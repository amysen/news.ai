Sam Vokes pounced late on for Sean Dyche’s side to move them into sixth spot with 19 points -- the same as Chelsea, who host Manchester United on Sunday, and Arsenal.

Burnley have already won three league matches on the road this season compared to one in the whole of last season.

“I am delighted to be where we are but there are a lot of challenges coming our way and the group know we will have to work hard for every point we get,” Dyche, who has been linked with the vacant Everton manager’s job, told the BBC.

“We still have to fight for every chance we get but we are willing to do the graft.”

The issue of whether to end coal production has been one of the sticking points in coalition negotiations between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her would-be allies: the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).

Organizers of the march called for the German government to implement the 2015 Paris plan to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century.

Selbst die verheerenden Hurrikans “Harvey” und “Irma” im Süden der USA hatten den Aufschwung am Arbeitsmarkt im September nur bremsen, aber nicht abwürgen können. Damit ist die Bühne bereitet für die dritte geldpolitische Straffung in diesem Jahr: “Die Notenbank Fed dürfte auf eine Zinserhöhung im Dezember zusteuern”, so Commerzbank-Ökonom Christoph Balz. Händler sehen dafür eine Wahrscheinlichkeit von 90 Prozent. Zuletzt hatte die Fed den Zins im Juni auf 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent hochgesetzt.

Sollten die Währungshüter den nächsten Schritt bereits in wenigen Wochen wagen, wird es wohl die letzte große Entscheidung unter der amtierenden Chefin Janet Yellen sein. Mit dem langjährigen Fed-Direktor Jerome Powell steht bereits ihr Nachfolger bereit, den Kurs einer behutsamen geldpolitischen Straffung ab Februar 2018 fortzusetzen. Händler erwarten, dass er angesichts der brummenden Wirtschaft schon Mitte 2018 eine weitere Zinserhöhung folgen lassen wird.

Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt wuchs im Sommer mit einer aufs Jahr hochgerechneten Rate von drei Prozent exakt in dem Tempo, das Präsident Donald Trump in den nächsten Jahren mit einer Steuerreform und einem großen Infrastrukturprogramm auf Dauer erreichen will. Trump sieht in Powell offenbar den richtigen Mann, um dieses sehr ambitionierte Ziel zu erreichen: “Er weiß, was nötig ist, damit eine Wirtschaft wächst”, sagte Trump kurz nach der Nominierung am Donnerstag.

Powell selbst kündigte an, bei einer Bestätigung durch den Senat getreu dem Mandat der Fed Vollbeschäftigung und stabile Preise anzustreben. Das erste Ziel kann er bei einer Arbeitslosenquote von zuletzt 4,1 Prozent schon jetzt abhaken. Dies ist in etwa das niedrigste Niveau seit 17 Jahren. Zudem entstanden im Oktober 261.000 neue Jobs und damit weit mehr als nötig wären, um mit dem Bevölkerungswachstum Schritt zu halten: “Der US-Arbeitsmarkt zeigt sich in einer äußerst guten Verfassung und die US-Wirtschaft ist nach der Finanzmarktkrise wieder auf Erholungskurs”, so Ökonom Thomas Gitzel von der VP Bank in Vaduz.

Doch Yellen, Powell & Co. bereitet noch die unerwünscht niedrige Inflation Sorge, die beharrlich unter dem Fed-Ziel von zwei Prozent bleibt. Die Notenbank setzt daher auf anziehende Gehälter, die für mehr Preisdruck sorgen könnten. Doch im Oktober stagnierten die Stundenlöhne im Vergleich zum Vormonat: “Trotz des zunehmenden Mangels an Fachkräften können die Beschäftigten also noch immer keine deutlich höheren Lohnforderungen bei den Arbeitgebern durchsetzen. Diese Entwicklung muss man im Auge behalten”, so Analyst Tobias Basse von der NordLB. Ökonom Sean Lynch von der Großbank Wells Fargo erwartet jedoch nicht, dass die Lohnentwicklung die Fed von einer raschen Zinserhöhung abbringen wird: Falls sich der Trend jedoch im nächsten Jahr fortsetzen sollte, könnte dies aus seiner Sicht zu einer Belastung der Märkte führen.",Bühne für nächste US-Zinserhöhung nach starken Jobdaten wohl frei,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-arbeitsmarkt-idDEKBN1D31OL

“Eventually, if you get your business plan right, you will make that price point, that is in no way illegal.”

Starring Brannagh as eccentric detective Hercule Poirot, the film premiered in London on Thursday and features a star-studded cast, including Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and “The Force Awakens” star Daisy Ridley.

“Previous film versions have been romps and they’ve been wonderful, but it felt like with this group of actors it could get a little more dark and a little more emotional, and surprise and divert in a different way,” Brannagh told Reuters at the film’s premiere.

A ‘whodunit’ tale, the film follows Brannagh’s detective as he seeks to unmask a murderer among the passengers on board the glamorous train, trapped by an avalanche in mountainous terrain in southern Europe.

Christie, who died in 1976 aged 85, is cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling novelist of all time.

Despite a rich pedigree in print, film and television, Brannagh’s film represents something of a cinematic resurrection for Christie’s work, with the most recent previous cinematic adaptation being 1985’s “Ordeal by Innocence.”

“It’s been 30 years, I guess, since we’ve had a proper cinema film,” said James Prichard, Christie’s great grandson and CEO of Agatha Christie Ltd., the company which manages the rights to her works.

“I’d love to say that it was a strategy, that we held it back and refused to allow it, but actually we kind of went out of fashion for a bit, certainly on the big screen.”

“Murder on the Orient Express,” is the first in an upcoming slew of new film and television adaptations of Agatha Christie properties, which include a production of “Witness for the Prosecution,” directed by and starring Oscar-winner Ben Affleck.

So, will Christie’s Poirot go the way of modern-day cinematic heavyweights, superheroes like Spider-Man or Iron Man, and spawn a franchise?

“I think Ken’s been fantastic, and I think the idea of this being a one-off Ken Poirot would be sad, so I’d love to see him do more,” Prichard said.

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://www.reuters.com/article/lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-pm-hariri-resigns-attacking-iran-and-hezbollah-idINKBN1D40E0?il=0

Damrey reached land at 4 a.m. local time (2100 GMT on Friday) with winds gusting at up to 90 kmph (56 mph) that tore off more than 1,000 roofs, knocked down hundreds of electricity poles and uprooted trees.

At least 12 people were missing and over 370 houses had collapsed, the Communist state’s search and rescue committee said. Over 33,000 people had been evacuated.

The government earlier said six ships had capsized with 61 people on board in the South China Sea and that 25 people had been rescued, but gave no details as to the possible fate of the others.

The storm made landfall near the city of Nha Trang, which is around 500 km (310 miles) south of the coastal city of Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place next week.

There were reports of high winds and rain in Danang, but no immediate reports of casualties. The city will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10 as well as China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing area of the world’s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. Traders had expected the storm to delay harvesting, but were not sure whether it would damage the crop.

The government said more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations. More than 40 flights were cancelled.

Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security.

Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days.

In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year.

Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.

Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump’s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT).

En route to Hawaii’s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump’s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.",Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-trump-asia/trump-heads-to-japan-with-north-korea-on-his-mind-idUKKBN1D406B

The deal would combine CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers and drugstore chains, with Aetna, one of the oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

The companies have agreed that CVS will split its consideration for the deal between cash and CVS stock, a deal structure that would minimize tax liabilities for Aetna shareholders, the sources said.

A deal will probably value Aetna at significantly more than $200 per share, the sources said, adding that the companies will agree to an exact price closer to signing the deal in December.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Aetna declined to comment, while CVS did not respond to a request for comment.

Aetna shares rose as much as 6 percent on the news and ended trading up 2.7 percent on Friday at $176.99. They have risen over 10 percent since Oct. 26, when the Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS and Aetna were in merger talks.

CVS shares ended trading down 0.2 percent at $69.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $70 billion.

Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.

They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.

A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.

The deal would follow years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.

Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress, along with Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs, has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.","CVS, Aetna aim to finalize deal as early as December: sources",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/cvs-aetna-aim-to-finalize-deal-as-early-as-december-sources-idUSKBN1D32A6?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The elder Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, while his son voted for neither Trump nor his Democratic challenger, or ”none of the above,“ said Mark K. Updegrove, who wrote ”The Last Republicans” with the cooperation of the two Bushes. HarperCollins will publish the book on Nov. 14.

In an interview with the New York Times, Updegrove said the elder Bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of Trump though he did not know him personally.

In an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush told the author that Trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service.

The younger Bush, 71, who served in the White House from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate Trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, Updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the Bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son.

During the campaign, George W. Bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last Republican elected president.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Updegrove told the Times.

“But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said Updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency.

Updegrove could not be reached for further comment.

“The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

”If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”

Like many Americans, George W. Bush was surprised that Trump fared so well in last year’s Republican state primaries, where his brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, emerged as one of Trump’s most frequent targets.

During the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, a vow that extended to the Republican establishment, which the Bush family epitomized.

The book follows a rare speech by the younger Bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style.

The 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous Republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.","Neither George Bush voted for Trump, book author tells New York Times",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-bush-book/neither-george-bush-voted-for-trump-book-author-tells-new-york-times-idUSKBN1D40TP?il=0

Veteran left-wing lawmaker Peter Pilz, 63, has been a fixture in Austrian politics for decades, having made a name for himself railing against arms deals with countries accused of human rights abuses and leading investigations into corruption like one this year connected to Austrian fighter-jet purchases.

He also recently pulled off a political coup - leaving the Greens this summer to form his own party, Pilz List, which not only beat the Greens in last month’s parliamentary election, it also passed the 4 percent threshold for entering parliament, which the Greens fell just short of.

Weekly newspaper Falter reported on Saturday that Pilz had repeatedly groped a female employee of the center-right European People’s Party during a conference in the Alps four years ago. The article included her description of the incident. She said Pilz was “relatively drunk” at the time.

Pilz -- one of the more colorful figures in Austrian politics, a straight talker fond of singing rock songs like “Wild Thing” at party events -- said he could not remember what happened.

“Not remembering is no excuse,” Pilz told a news conference, adding that Falter’s editor in chief had assured him the report was thoroughly researched.

“Because of these accusations, which I take extremely seriously, even though I do not remember, I will not take up my mandate in the coming parliament. I will not be at the swearing-in ceremony on Thursday,” he said.

In the wake of the Weinstein scandal and the resignations over inappropriate behavior that have followed, including that of British Defence Minister Michael Fallon this week, Austrian media had begun to ask whether there were previously unreported cases of sexual harassment by influential Austrians.

U.S. movie mogul Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Pilz said he would work to bring all the facts to light in the accusations made against him. But he also said he rejected separate allegations by a former colleague that he sexually harassed her on dozens of occasions. That case was first reported by Austrian media on Friday.

Pilz said he would support his party’s work in parliament “from the outside”, though he did not say specifically that he was stepping down as party leader.

A spokeswoman for Pilz was not immediately available for comment.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Sam Vokes pounced late on for Sean Dyche’s side to move them into sixth spot with 19 points -- the same as Chelsea, who host Manchester United on Sunday, and Arsenal.

Burnley have already won three league matches on the road this season compared to one in the whole of last season.

“I am delighted to be where we are but there are a lot of challenges coming our way and the group know we will have to work hard for every point we get,” Dyche, who has been linked with the vacant Everton manager’s job, told the BBC.

“We still have to fight for every chance we get but we are willing to do the graft.”

Liverpool can move back above Burnley into sixth place with victory at West Ham United in the late kickoff.

Bournemouth grabbed a last-gasp winner at Newcastle United to move out of the bottom three, above Swansea City who slumped to a home defeat by Brighton and Hove Albion.

The 36-year-old had been due to retire last season but was recalled by the Williams team after Valtteri Bottas left for Mercedes following the surprise retirement of 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg.

After an emotional send-off in Brazil last year, Massa was back in the cockpit a few months later.

“As you know, last year I decided to announce my retirement in Formula One but because of the Williams request I decided to do another season,” the former Ferrari driver said in a video message posted on social media.

“But this time will be my last race in Brazil of Formula One and my last race in Abu Dhabi,” he added, thanking his family, fans and sponsors and making clear he was not retiring from racing entirely.

“I really hope that you can support me next year or maybe in the future in other races and in other categories,” he said.

Williams have yet to announce their 2018 lineup, with several candidates in the frame including Poland’s Robert Kubica. Canadian rookie teenager Lance Stroll is sure to stay, however.

Massa won 11 races with Ferrari and finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton, now a four-times world champion, by a single point in the 2008 season.

His last victory was at the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he won new fans for his dignified and sporting response when Hamilton seized the title by taking fifth place on the last corner of the last lap.

In 2009, he suffered a severe head injury and was in a coma for several days after being hit on the helmet in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying by a spring shed from the Brawn of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.

Massa joined Williams in 2014, helping the former champions to take third place in the constructors’ championship that year and in 2015.

“It has been an absolute pleasure to work with him,” said deputy principal Claire Williams in a team statement.

”We are especially grateful that he agreed to postpone his retirement from Formula One for a year, after Valtteri joined Mercedes, which demonstrated the depth of the relationship we built during our time together.

“We appreciate that it wasn’t an easy decision for him to return, after having such an emotional send-off at the end of last year.”",Massa to retire from Formula One for second time,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-massa/felipe-massa-to-retire-from-formula-one-for-second-time-idUKKBN1D40EQ

Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover, a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution, appeared higher than in recent years when Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran.

Last month, Trump broke ranks with European allies, Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran’s compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reached during Obama’s tenure. Under that deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs.

Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “shred” the pact if the United States pulls out.

”All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, told a rally in Tehran, state media reported.

“Trump’s policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today,” Shamkhani said.

He did not identify the governments he had in mind. The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump’s opposition to it, fearing this could stir new Middle East instability.

But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing” regional behavior.

Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic’s missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable.

In a sign of defiance, a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran, now a cultural center, during Saturday’s street demonstration, Tasnim news agency said.

“That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream,” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development, according to Tasnim.

Delson Guarate, who had been a mayor in central Aragua state, and former student leader Yon Goicoechea were among nearly 400 jailed anti-Maduro activists who rights campaigners say are political prisoners but whom the government calls coup-plotters.

“I‘m with my family today,” tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas’ Avila mountain. “Tomorrow I’ll address the country. God is with us.”

“I‘m free!” Guarate tweeted.

The pair’s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment.

The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles.

And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence.

Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths.

Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him.

In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation.

”When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls,“ he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison. ”The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness.

“There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.”

Senior officials said Goicoechea was an “imperialist” agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing “terrorism.” Neither was tried.

Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists.

“The dictatorship’s ‘justice’ is a revolving door,” said party legislator Juan Mejia. “Some leave, while others come in at its discretion and to its benefit.”",Venezuela frees two anti-Maduro activists; scores still jailed,https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/venezuela-frees-two-anti-maduro-activists-scores-still-jailed-idINKBN1D40RG?il=0

Selon une information donnée par la chaîne de télévision CNN jeudi, huit employés de “House of Cards”, anciens et actuels, ont accusé Kevin Spacey de comportement sexuel non approprié.

Netflix a également annoncé vendredi qu‘il ne diffuserait pas le film “Gore”, qui se trouve en postproduction et qui est produit par Kevin Spacey. L‘acteur y incarne l‘écrivain Gore Vidal, décédé en 2012.

L‘agent de Kevin Spacey a rompu avec lui jeudi et on ne sait désormais qui représente l‘acteur.

Dans le cadre de ses excuses présentées à Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey a annoncé qu‘il était homosexuel, ce qui a mis en colère un certain nombre de personnes dans et hors de la communauté LGBT qui ont vu dans ce coming out une tentative de faire diversion par rapport aux accusations d‘Anthony Rapp.

L‘acteur mexicain Roberto Cavazos, qui travaillait au théâtre Old Vic de Londres où Kevin Spacey a été directeur artistique entre 2004 et 2015, a dit avoir subi à l‘époque des faits de harcèlement de la part de la star hollywoodienne.","Netflix rompt avec Kevin Spacey, accusé d'inconduite sexuelle",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idFRKBN1D40AX-OFRIN

In an order filed in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said Veselnitskaya’s immigration status was “squarely within the purview of the executive branch.”

Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May agreed to pay nearly $6 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing it of laundering proceeds of a $230 million tax fraud. Her temporary permission from the U.S. Department of Justice to enter the United States while working on the case has expired.

Following Pauley’s order on Monday, a U.S. lawyer for Prevezon filed a letter asking that Veselnitskaya be allowed to appear by telephone at the hearing, which is scheduled for Nov. 9.

The hearing is expected to focus on whether the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, as the U.S. government has maintained. Prevezon disputed that in a letter filed on Oct. 31.

About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon the Netherlands had frozen at the United States’ request, according to the letter.

The Netherlands lifted the freeze on Oct. 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Prevezon’s letter said.

Browder has said that the underlying $230 million tax fraud was uncovered by a former Hermitage auditor, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009.

In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so they could attend hearings.

Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year.

Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.

The 2012 law was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for Magnitsky’s death.

Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”",Judge denies request to return to U.S. by Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr.,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer/judge-denies-request-to-return-to-u-s-by-russian-lawyer-who-met-trump-jr-idUSKBN1D32JM?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

The issue of whether to end coal production has been one of the sticking points in coalition negotiations between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her would-be allies: the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).

Organizers of the march called for the German government to implement the 2015 Paris plan to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century.

The Wallabies scored five unanswered tries in the first half at the venue for the 2019 World Cup final to put the game beyond Japan’s reach before crossing for four more after the break.

The match, held at Yokohama’s Nissan Stadium, drew more than 43,000 fans, reflecting the growing interest towards the World Cup.

Japan were left to rue their lack of discipline as Australia’s first three tries resulted from the visitors opting to kick for touch and successfully crossing the line from the subsequent lineouts.

Japan coach Jamie Joseph said his backs were at a disadvantage playing against their opponents who were bigger, more powerful and equally fast.

Tevita Kuridrani ran in a hat-trick with his powerful runs and his centre partner Samu Kerevi grabbed two tries for Australia, who were playing their first test against the hosts on Japanese soil.

Wing Henry Speight, hooker Tatafu Polota Nau, lock Rob Simmons and scrumhalf Nick Phipps also scored for the Wallabies as they extended their unbeaten run to six matches.

“We’re really happy with probably about sixty minutes of our game, some players had really good games,” said Australia captain Michael Hooper.

Reece Hodge, playing his first test at flyhalf after Bernard Foley fell ill during the week, proved accurate with the boot, converting all nine conversions.

The 23-year old received a stamp of approval from Australia coach Michael Cheika, who told reporters that the utility back did a ‘fantastic job’.

Locks Wimpie van der Walt and Kazuki Himeno, making their test debuts, and number eight Amanaki Mafi each touched down for Jamie Joseph’s side, who are still struggling to find consistency with two years to go until they host the World Cup.

It was a third straight loss to a tier one nation on home soil after they went down in both of their meetings with Ireland in June.

Flyhalf Rikiya Matsuda converted four out of five kicks at goal, including three penalty conversions. Replacement back Yu Tamura converted two of Japan’s tries in the second half.

While Japan’s tries came in too late to change the course of the match, the amount of points the Wallabies conceded would be a potential point of worry as they head for Europe.

“Japan put thirty points on us, we’ve got to be better than that but congratulations to them. It was wonderful to play here,” Hooper added.

Asked about a meeting in which aide George Papadopoulos suggested arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told reporters: “I don’t remember much about that meeting. It was a very unimportant meeting.”

According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Papadopoulos said at the meeting of foreign policy advisers in March 2016 “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.”

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting at the same table with Trump as well as Jeff Sessions, now Trump’s attorney general, and several others.

Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. His plea was made public this week.

Sessions is under pressure from Senate Democrats to testify again about the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee, Sessions has denied knowing anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries.

The president spoke before leaving for a trip to Asia, where his domestic woes are expected to dog him. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and Moscow denies interfering in the 2016 election.

Sessions is also under pressure from his boss, who has made clear he thinks the Department of Justice should look into his former presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and her campaign’s behavior with the Democratic National Committee during the presidential primary race.

Trump told reporters on Friday that many people were unhappy with the Department of Justice, including him.

Those comments followed remarks he made during “The Larry O’Connor Show” on WMAL radio in which he lamented not having more say in the department’s work.

“The saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I’m not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated by that,” he said.

Trump on Friday repeated his urgings that the Justice Department and FBI investigate Clinton.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he said on Twitter.

His comments elicited criticism from several U.S. senators.

“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has frequently sparred with Trump, said in a statement.

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said: “We can’t allow ourselves to become numb to the president of the United States calling on independent law enforcement organizations to investigate his political opponents. That’s characteristic of authoritarian regimes, not democracies, and it needs to stop.”

Trump has expressed frustration repeatedly over the Russia investigation, which has overshadowed his administration, at times referring to it as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”

Federal investigators this week charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another ex-aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. In a court filing on Friday, Mueller estimated he would need three weeks to present his case against Manafort and Gates if it went to trial.

Both men pleaded not guilty.

Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said in a filing on Friday that he would challenge what he called “evidence improperly obtained by search warrant, subpoena or otherwise.” FBI agents seized documents and other material from Manafort’s Virginia home in a July raid.

O órgão executivo da UE vê o plano da Rússia de dobrar o gás que poderia bombear pelo mar Báltico para a Alemanha, ignorando rotas tradicionais através da Ucrânia, subestimando os esforços da UE para reduzir a dependência de Moscou e seu apoio a Kiev.

A mudança se ajusta à proposta da Comissão de um mandato dos Estados membros para negociar com a Rússia as objeções ao gasoduto.

Mesmo com as mudanças, os reguladores da UE dizem que podem precisar de novas conversas com a Rússia, uma vez que não podem impor a lei no trecho do gasoduto que está fora do seu território.

Sob as mudanças propostas para a diretriz de gás, todos os dutos de importação teriam que cumprir as regras da EU, que exigem que os gasodutos não sejam diretamente de fornecedores de gás, tarifas não discriminatórias, operações transparentes e pelo menos 10 por cento da capacidade disponível para terceiros.

A proposta será submetida a uma votação na quarta-feira durante reunião dos Comissários da UE. Se aprovada, será enviada aos Estados membros e ao Parlamento Europeu para aprovação.

Os reguladores da UE afirmam querer as regras em vigor o mais cedo possível para a solicitação do gasoduto Nord Stream 2, que deverá estar concluído até o final do ano seguinte.

The girl gave her parents the slip near Geneva’s central railway station on Sunday, then took the one-stop ride to the airport. Her parents rang the Swiss police, who tracked her progress through the airport on security videos, airport spokesman Bertrand Staempfli said.

She went through the security gate and managed to pass herself off as the child of adults around her, before using her small stature to slip through the departure gate without being noticed and boarding a plane, the airport said in a statement.

On her first attempt she followed a crew toward the plane and was turned back. She melted into the crowd and pretended to look for her parents. The second time, she managed to get into a plane, was spotted by an official, stopped, and handed over to police.

Staempfli declined to say which airline was involved or where it was flying to, but he said it was leaving from the airport’s French sector and the destination was in France.

The airport said in the statement it would tighten safety rules and boarding procedures as a result of what it called the “highly regrettable incident”.

Just hours after Fallon resigned over past behavior he said had fallen “below the high standards we require of the armed forces”, May appointed Gavin Williamson, 41, a rising star in her ruling Conservative Party.

Weakened after losing her parliamentary majority in a June election that many Conservatives blame on her, May had to move swiftly.

The growing harassment scandal threatens to undermine her further if other allegations against Conservatives, including against her deputy Damian Green, force more resignations.

Williamson has risen quickly up the ranks of the Conservatives and May selected him last year as the party’s chief whip in parliament - a role in which he is tasked with maintaining voting discipline on legislation.

As chief whip, Williamson was renowned for his toughness and for introducing lawmakers to his pet tarantula Cronus, named after the god of time who swallowed each of his children according to Greek mythology.

But he has no former experience of the armed forces, according to his online profile, and some Conservative lawmakers openly questioned the appointment.

Sarah Wollaston writing on Twitter: “There are times when offered a job that it would be better to advise that another would be more experienced and suited to the role.”

SCANDAL

Williamson said nothing as he arrived at the Ministry of Defense on Thursday, taking on the role at a difficult time for May, who since June’s election is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament.

Fallon’s resignation after he apologized for repeatedly touching a female radio presenter’s knee in 2002, was yet another blow.

Described by Conservative sources as a political “Rottweiler”, Fallon was a trusted minister able to robustly face down criticism of the government.

Britain’s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, said it was time to break with a culture in politics where powerful people “use positions of power to demand things from others”.

“The dam has broken on this now, and these male-dominated professions where the boys-own locker room culture has prevailed and it’s all been a bit of a laugh, have got to stop,” she told the BBC.

Allegations of sexual abuse have ranged from a charge of rape by an activist in the opposition Labour Party by a senior party member, to unconfirmed details of serial “sex pests” on a list reportedly drafted by aides and researchers in parliament.

May has ordered investigations into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and an allegation that her deputy, Green, made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman - something he denies.",Britain's May replaces defense minister in growing harassment scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-defence-minister/may-replaces-defence-minister-in-growing-harassment-scandal-idUKKBN1D219B

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets and rejects the financial damages claim.

Uber and Waymo, rivals in the development of autonomous car technology, have been fighting in court since earlier this year about whether Uber benefited from trade secrets and other intellectual property allegedly stolen by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. Trial is set for early December.

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup late on Thursday issued an order excluding Waymo’s damages expert, Michael Wagner, from the case and restricting use of financial evidence at trial and denying other relief, according to a docket entry.

The docket summarizes the decision, but the details are under seal until later on Friday.

University of Florida law professor Elizabeth Rowe said it was a setback for Waymo to have its damages expert excluded, but noted there were still ways to include the information, were the scope of the exclusion limited to the one person.

In a statement, Waymo said the company could still pursue full damages using “the same documents” relied upon by their expert.

Uber described the ruling on the expert as a sign of success, together with Alsup’s exclusion of Otto Trucking as a defendant in the case. Levandowski is the primary shareholder of Otto Trucking.

“Waymo’s case continues to shrink,” the ride-services company said in a statement.

Alsup recently agreed to Waymo’s request to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that Levandowski - the former head of Uber’s self-driving effort who was previously at Waymo - downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Waymo to set up a self-driving truck startup company that Uber then acquired.

Waymo in settlement talks had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, which rejected that and other terms as non-starters, sources previously told Reuters.

The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 51.7 last month - its highest since June - from 50.7 in September.

In July and August, the index was below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.

During those months, confusion over product pricing following the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax pushed manufacturing and services sectors into contraction.

Aashna Dodhia, an economist at IHS Markit, said recovery from the GST implementation “was sustained in the private sector in October, mainly radiating from service providers as growth in manufacturing was relatively subdued.”

A sister survey showed manufacturing activity barely expanded last month.

However, services demand has been recovering since September and the latest survey showed the new business sub-index, a proxy for both domestic and foreign demand, rose to 51.5 in October from 51.1 a month before.

This helped a composite index that takes into account both manufacturing and services activity rise to a four-month high of 51.3 last month from September’s 51.1.

Firms raised prices at a sharper rate to end-consumers than their costs rose, signaling a pickup in inflation over coming months.

Retail inflation held steady at an annual pace of 3.28 percent in September, below the Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4 percent.

Economic growth slowed to 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, its weakest in three years.

Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will remain benign.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists’ expectations for a jump of 310,000 jobs.

Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.

The White House, which is pushing a Republican-backed package of tax cuts to boost economic growth and employment, trumpeted the payrolls gains. “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!” President Donald Trump tweeted after the release of the report.

But Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement that the report showed Americans were continuing to be denied bigger paychecks by Republicans’ “billionaires-first agenda.”

Average hourly earnings slipped one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part due to the return of the lower-paid leisure and hospitality workers. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September. They were up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis last month, the smallest gain since February 2016, after a 2.8 percent advance in the prior month.

October’s job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve’s assessment on Wednesday that “the labor market has continued to strengthen,” and the sluggish wage data did little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.

The U.S. central bank has increased rates twice this year.

“The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,” said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. “Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”

Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. Should wage growth remain sluggish, economists say it would be hard for central bank policymakers to hike rates three times next year as they currently anticipate.

Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October, from 4.2 percent in the prior month, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise rise of 575,000 in September.

The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.

The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.

Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher as were U.S. stocks. The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. The unemployment rate, which has declined by 0.7 percentage point since January, is now at its lowest level since December 2000 and below the Fed’s median forecast for 2017.

A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month. That was the lowest level since December 2006 and was down from 8.3 percent in September.

The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.

“You cannot get strong growth when spending power is increasing so modestly,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.

Other economic reports showed a jump in business spending on capital in September and a measure of services sector activity racing to more than a 12-year high in October.

Economic growth has remained strong even as Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.

House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cut tax rates on individuals and families and end certain tax breaks. Small businesses, realtors and homebuilders have opposed the current proposal.

Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers’ difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.

Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs last month while the retail sector lost 8,300 jobs.

Construction payrolls were up 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes.

The IMF approved a $666 million, three-year extended credit facility in June for Cameroon, which has been hit hard by the global decline in crude prices. Economic growth came in at 4.5 percent last year.

In a statement at the end of a 10-day review mission, the IMF said that it had reached an agreement with the government on economic and financial policy ahead of the first review of the programme, which is expected in mid-December.

“The economic programme of the country remains on the right track despite the difficult context. All the quantitative benchmarks established in the programme...have been fulfilled,” said mission head Corinne Delechat.

The government has been forced to concentrate resources on combating Islamist Boko Haram militants along its northwestern border with Nigeria. It has also faced unrest in two predominantly English-speaking provinces since late last year.

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUKKBN1D31U1

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalisation of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://in.reuters.com/article/lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-prime-minister-resigns-saying-his-life-in-danger-idINKBN1D40E0

For the first time, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada said they were “deeply concerned” at the ongoing detention of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy.

“We are concerned at the detention conditions that Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in Egypt,” a joint statement published on the British government website said late on Friday.

Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances on Sept. 10.

Members of Metwaly’s group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention.

Asked about the case, two judicial sources told Reuters that Metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination.

Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation.

Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo in January 2016. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture.

企业市值有上有落，首富易角不足为奇，贝索斯今年七月亦曾短暂登上这个宝座，惟席未坐暖已因亚马逊股价回落而迅速让位，盖茨首富名号失而复得。随着亚马逊近期在股市表现神勇，微软相形失色，贝索斯这次相信可以在全球第一富豪之位多坐一会。

盖茨和贝索斯都是身家接近千亿美元的超富，多一个零恐怕也只是数字游戏而已。重要的并非谁富甲天下，而是身处这个位置者的所作所为，对经济、社会和民生到底意味着什么。

亚马逊为了应付业务扩充需要，最近高调在北美寻觅与西雅图平起平坐的第二总部驻紮地，最终收到来自美国、加拿大及墨西哥合共二百三十八个城市积极申请，各地优惠尽出百般献媚，无非为了争取亚马逊兑现承诺，向获选城市大手笔投资五十亿美元，同时创造五万个贝索斯声称的高薪职位。

全球首富对第二总部甚有要求，强调城市人口至少达一百万，教育水平要高，以便公司发掘人才，迎抗苹果、Google等对手的挑战。美加当然不乏符合亚马逊选址条件的名城，但连刚受飓风蹂躏，至今仍未完全恢复电力供应的波多黎各，以至名不见经传的墨西哥北部地区奇瓦瓦州，明知获选机会微乎其微，也「凑热闹」递上标书，足证亚马逊魅力没法挡，彷佛只要给贝索斯看中，山鸡即可变凤凰，从此在科技之路踏上「快线」。

It said it would also offer discounts for online orders picked up at its stores.

The company said its stores and website would offer more exclusive products from companies such as appliance maker Cuisinart and audio equipment maker Bose.

The plans were announced at a media briefing to outline Wal-Mart’s strategy for the November and December holiday shopping season, an important period for retailers during which they earn an outsized portion of their annual profits and sales.

Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer at Wal-Mart said the retailer would offer “thousands of rollbacks” or reduced prices across products that would include lower prices on 400 toys from brands like Lego and Nerf.

“We are buying as much inventory as we think we can handle and sell ... we think we are in a really strong position,” Bratspies said.

Bratspies said that for the third consecutive year the retailer would focus more on discounts and offering the lowest prices on items instead of gimmicky product deals, as customers expect more consistent pricing.

Wal-Mart will hold more than 20,000 holiday events at its stores where shoppers can test and try top-selling items, chief marketing officer Tony Rogers said, adding that the company was investing heavily in improving the shopping experience at its stores.","Wal-Mart triples online items, lowers prices as holiday season kicks in",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-holidayshopping/wal-mart-triples-online-items-lowers-prices-as-holiday-season-kicks-in-idUSKBN1D13GX

Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban and spent five years under brutal captivity by the insurgent group. He had faced up to life in prison after pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The 31-year-old Idaho native trembled in a military courtroom at Fort Bragg in North Carolina as he waited to hear his punishment. Army Colonel Jeffery Nance delivered the sentence in a hearing that lasted just two minutes, and did not comment on his decision. He also recommended Bergdahl be demoted to private. Bergdahl and lawyers in the case had no immediate comment. Prosecutors had asked Nance to send Bergdahl to prison for 14 years for the hardships and injuries endured by service members who searched for the soldier after he left his combat outpost in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission. Defense lawyers had said Bergdahl, who experts testified has several mental health conditions, should not go to prison. Bergdahl's case made him a polarizing figure. He drew withering criticism from political leaders in Washington and fellow soldiers, both for the dangerous efforts to find him and the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by the Democratic Obama administration that secured his release. During his successful campaign for the presidency last year, Republican Donald Trump called Bergdahl ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed."" Nance, acting on a defense motion, ruled that Trump's comments had not influenced him nor affected Bergdahl's chances of a fair sentence, but said he would consider them a mitigating factor. Defense attorneys argued at Bergdahl's sentencing hearing that he was a young, hardworking soldier who did not understand the full consequences of his actions when he deserted. Bergdahl, who has said he wanted to report problems in his unit, apologized in court this week for the suffering he caused his comrades and admitted he had made ""a horrible mistake."" Prosecutors, however, said Bergdahl knew his disappearance would trigger alarm in the war zone.

Use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in Afghanistan over recent years. Social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator ATRA was widely shared on social media.

Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the National Directorate for Security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.

The acting minister for telecommunications, Shahzad Aryobee, posted a message on Facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.

“The government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,” he wrote.

The letter by telecoms regulator ATRA, dated Nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block Telegram and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) WhatsApp services “without delay” for a period of 20 days.

However, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on Saturday on both state-owned operator Salaam and private service providers.

On Friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with WhatsApp services that were experienced in several countries.

Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage.

WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own.

The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number “in case WhatsApp is not working”.","Afghanistan moves to block WhatsApp, Telegram messaging services",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D4071-OCATC

In the past few years, some Hong Kong football fans have booed the national anthem during World Cup qualifiers and other matches, mirroring protests in the United States where football players knelt during the national anthem, a practice denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

China passed a new law in September mandating up to 15 days in police detention for those who mock the “March of the Volunteers” national anthem, a law that also covers the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau but was not immediately given a legal basis for enforcement there.

The National Anthem Law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, has now been included in an annex of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, or mini constitution, state news agency Xinhua said. It will also be included in an annex of Macau’s Basic Law, Xinhua reported.

He Shaoren, spokesman for the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said in a news conference on Saturday that it was up to the Hong Kong government to enact a local law to abide by the amendment in a timely manner.

A Hong Kong official said on Wednesday that the Special Administrative Region would enact such a law “as soon as possible”.

Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called “one country, two systems” formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary.

China’s growing reach into Hong Kong’s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014 “Occupy” civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure China to allow full democracy.

Chinese authorities have strived to instill greater patriotism into Hong Kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance Hong Kong.

China’s national legislature on Saturday also passed an amendment to its criminal law that extends punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to disrespecting the national anthem. Punishments include jail terms of up to three years, Xinhua reported.

Skating to “Don Quixote,” Zagitova, the 2017 world junior champion, had the crowd clapping along to the jump-laden second half of her routine, cleanly landing a triple lutz and triple salchow as well as a sequence of dazzling spins on her way to top an extremely tight field.

With the first three finishers after Friday’s short program separated by barely a point, Zagitova leapt to victory with 144.44 points for the free skate and a total of 213.88.

“To win the gold medal in my first grand prix means a lot to me but I need to continue to work and I cannot rest on my laurels,” Zagitova told reporters.

“I was not pleased with my short program but I was pleased with the free (skate) as I did everything.”

Japan’s Wakaba Higuchi held on to second place, snapping out a lightning series of jumps, including a double axel, double toeloop and double loop, in her routine to “Skyfall” by Adele.

“I think I moved very well on the ice today and I am satisfied with what I did,” said the 16-year-old, who picked up 141.99 points for a total of 212.52 overall.

“However... I have a little regret I am not at the top here, there is still a gap.”

After seventh seed Goerges had overpowered Anastasija Sevastova 6-3 6-3 in the first semi-final, American Vandeweghe took to court to outplay Australian Ashleigh Barty with the same scoreline.

Goerges broke Sevastova in the opening game and never took her foot off the pedal to clinch the first set in 40 minutes.

In the second set too, Goerges broke Sevastova early to take charge and she sealed an easy victory with a backhand winner down the line to avenge her loss to the Latvian in Mallorca in June.

The German reeled off 41 winners and did not face a break point in the contest, winning 76 percent of her second-service points as she sailed into her fifth final of the year.

Vandeweghe likewise had little trouble in claiming the first set against Barty, the American losing just one point on serve and winning 16 straight points on serve.

She raced to a 5-2 lead in the second but Barty saved three match points in the next game before the American came back to serve out the match.

Vandeweghe fired a total of 32 winners against nine unforced errors to assert her dominance. The American will break into the top 10 for the first time in next week’s rankings after reaching her second final of the year.

Despite the defeat, Barty finishes the year as the highest ranked Australian, inside the top 20.",Tennis: Vandeweghe to meet Goerges in WTA Elite Trophy final,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1D40HI-OCASP

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc T.N..

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.” He said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with “significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

Legal experts also said earlier this year that it was difficult to predict whether the current administration would be more receptive of a deal.

FRANCOFORTE, 2 novembre (Reuters) - Alcune delle maggiori banche mondiali stanno facendo pressione sulla Banca centrale europea per evitare norme che le costringano ad accantonare capitale a fronte dei titoli di Stato che detengono, come mostrano documenti pubblicati dalla Bce.

La misura è tra quelle discusse dai regolatori internazionali ed europei per spezzare il circolo vizioso tra banche e governi che ha acuito la crisi del 2010-2011 nella zona euro.

Ma la misura potrebbe comportare miliardi di euro di capitale aggiuntivo per le banche della zona euro, che detengono titoli di Stato del blocco per quasi 2.000 miliardi di euro.

I banchieri che hanno preso parte all‘ultimo gruppo di contatto del mercato dei titoli di Stato della Bce, il 10 ottobre, hanno messo in guardia contro i rischi legati all‘introduzione troppo rapida o a livelli eccessivi di simili coefficienti di ponderazione del rischio, secondo i resoconti della riunione pubblicati sul sito della Bce.

“Una transizione ad una ponderazione del rischio non neutro per il debito sovrano dev‘essere molto graduale per evitare vendite massicce di titoli di Stato e maggiore volatilità”, ha detto Kevin Gaynor della banca giapponese Nomura nella sua presentazione al gruppo.

La Bce, che tiene periodicamente questi incontri per avere feedback e opinioni da chi partecipa al mercato, è stata criticata il mese scorso da un gruppo di attivisti perché troppo vicina al settore finanziario.

Oltre ad essere il principale supervisore del settore bancario per l‘eurozona, la Bce fa parte del Comitato di Basilea di regolatori globali che stendono le regole volte a rafforzare il sistema bancario mondiale dopo le crisi finanziarie.

Consiglia inoltre il Parlamento europeo su questioni finanziarie, inclusa l‘imminente revisione di regolamento e direttiva sui requisiti patrimoniali (CRR/CRD IV).

“Alcuni membri hanno sottolineato che il trattamento del debito sovrano nella imminente revisione di CRD IV/CRR potrebbe essere fonte di preoccupazione”, emerge dai resoconti della riunione.

“Se i livelli di ponderazione del rischio per il debito sovrano delle banche fossero fissati troppo in alto, questo potrebbe bloccare il modello di primary dealer... e portare ad aumenti dei rendimenti dei titoli di stato, almeno durante il periodo transitorio”.

Alla riunione hanno preso parte rappresentanti di BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs e Commerzbank, come pure altri grandi istituti e compagnie assicurative.

E’ stata presieduta dal capo delle operazioni di mercato della Bce ed erano presenti esponenti delle banche centrali di Spagna, Francia, Italia e Germania.

The warning came after a Delhi High Court ruling on Tuesday annulled the AIFF’s most recent presidential election and ordered a re-run to be organized by the country’s former election commission chief S.Y. Quraishi.

FIFA statutes state that member federations must be free from legal and political interference in their respective countries and the world governing body has suspended other national associations in the past in similar cases.

“FIFA has sent a letter to the AIFF requesting more information about Delhi’s High Court decision as well as the steps that AIFF intends to undertake in this matter,” FIFA told Reuters in an emailed statement.

“FIFA has also reminded the AIFF that... member associations, including the AIFF, are obliged to manage their affairs independently and without undue influence from third parties.”

The High Court ruling came less than a week after India completed its hosting of the under-17 World Cup and was praised by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who said he wants to make football the most popular sport in the cricket-mad nation.

Martha O‘Donovan, who works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe’s leading producer of political satire, was on Friday charged by police, who also accused her of insulting President Robert Mugabe.

Lawyers for O‘Donovan, who appeared in court in jeans and a checked shirt, argued before magistrate Nomsa Sarabauta that police only informed O‘Donovan of the more serious charges of attempting to subvert the government hours after her arrest, thereby violating the constitution.

But the magistrate said she was satisfied the officers complied with the law and dismissed the application. The charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail.

Lawyer Obey Shava said he would now apply for bail at the High Court on Monday.

O‘Donovan, who denies the charges against her, was not formally charged nor was she asked to plead in court, where she will return on Nov. 15.

The case against her centers around a post on Twitter last month in which O‘Donovan allegedly called 93-year-old Mugabe a “selfish and sick man”. Her arrest comes after the creation of a Ministry of Cyber Security last month.

Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover, a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution, appeared higher than in recent years when Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran.

Last month, Trump broke ranks with European allies, Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran’s compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reached during Obama’s tenure. Under that deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs.

Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “shred” the pact if the United States pulls out.

”All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, told a rally in Tehran, state media reported.

“Trump’s policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today,” Shamkhani said.

He did not identify the governments he had in mind. The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump’s opposition to it, fearing this could stir new Middle East instability.

But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing” regional behavior.

Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic’s missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable.

In a sign of defiance, a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran, now a cultural center, during Saturday’s street demonstration, Tasnim news agency said.

“That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream,” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development, according to Tasnim.

U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen anew at a time when Tehran has been improving political and military ties with Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran on Wednesday. Khamenei told him that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help defuse conflict in the Middle East.

Zudem warten Börsianer darauf, ob US-Präsident Donald Trump seine vollmundig angekündigte Steuerreform tatsächlich durchbekommt. “Für den Dax könnte das bedeuten, dass es weiter nach oben geht”, sagt NordLB-Aktienstratege Tobias Basse. Allerdings sei nicht davon auszugehen, dass der deutsche Leitindex nochmals um fast 300 Punkte weiter marschiere. In der alten Woche war er von einem Rekord zum anderen geeilt und hatte um zwei Prozent auf knapp über 13.500 Punkte zugelegt.

Der US-Präsident will Firmen, Privatleute und Familien in den kommenden zehn Jahren um mehrere Billionen Dollar entlasten. “Wenn die geplanten Maßnahmen wie von Trump angekündigt noch vor Weihnachten in ein Gesetz gegossen werden sollen, dann wird man sehr bald Fortschritte sehen müssen”, sagt Aktienstratege Basse. Volkswirtin Christine Schäfer von der DZ Bank ist allerdings skeptisch, dass der Republikaner bei seinem Vorhaben schnelle Erfolge erzielt. “Auch ohne den großen Zeitdruck, unter dem die US-Abgeordneten und der Präsident jetzt agieren, wäre das Konzipieren einer umfassenden Steuerreform eine Herkulesaufgabe.” Es sei zu befürchten, dass bei einem schnell umgesetzten Kompromiss eine nachhaltige Fiskalpolitik auf der Strecke bleibe.

Befürchtungen, dass die Staatsverschuldung in den USA durch eine solche Steuerreform weiter steigt, könnten den Dollar belasten. Das wiederum dürfte dem Euro einen Schub geben. An den Aktienmärkten käme eine anziehende Gemeinschaftswährung allerdings nicht gut an, da sich dadurch die Chancen der exportfokussierten Unternehmen aus der Euro-Zone verschlechtern.

NEUER NOTENBANKCHEF BLEIBT EIN THEMA

Großes Gesprächsthema an den Börsen wird nach Einschätzung von Analysten auch die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum neuen Chef der US-Notenbank Fed bleiben. Der 64-Jährige soll im Februar das Amt von Janet Yellen übernehmen. “Powells Nominierung gilt als Signal für geldpolitische Kontinuität”, sagt Anna Stupnytska, Ökonomin beim Vermögensverwalter Fidelity. “Auf kurze Sicht dürfte sich daher an den sehr behutsamen Zinserhöhungen nichts ändern.” Börsianer gehen davon aus, dass die Fed im Dezember die Leitzinsen erneut anheben wird, es wäre die dritte in diesem Jahr.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

The issue of whether to end coal production has been one of the sticking points in coalition negotiations between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her would-be allies: the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).

Organizers of the march called for the German government to implement the 2015 Paris plan to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century.

La empresa, Southern Nevada Donor Services, ofrecía a las familias afligidas una forma de eliminar los elevados gastos funerarios: incineración gratuita a cambio de donar los órganos del cuerpo de tus seres queridos para “estudios médicos avanzados”.

Fuera del almacén de Southern Nevada, las circunstancias distaban de ser reconfortantes. En otoño de 2015, los vecinos comenzaron a quejarse sobre un misterioso hedor y unas cajas ensangrentadas en un contenedor de basura. Ese diciembre, según muestras de los registros sanitarios locales, alguien había contactado con las autoridades para informar de actividades extrañas en el patio.

Los inspectores sanitarios encontraron a un hombre vestido con bata médica que sujetaba una manguera de jardinería. Estaba, al sol del mediodía, derritiendo el hielo del torso de un hombre congelado.

Mientras el hombre rociaba los restos, “trozos de tejidos y sangre caían por el desagüe”, rezaba el informe de uno de los inspectores. El riachuelo pasaba por delante de las tiendas y se estancaba cerca de una escuela técnica.

Southern Nevada, descubrieron los inspectores, son “comerciantes de cuerpos”, una compañía que adquiere cadáveres, los disecciona y los vende en piezas, con ánimo de lucro, a investigadores médicos, academias médicas y otros compradores. El torso tumbado en la camilla lo estaba preparando para una de estas ventas.

Cada año, miles de estadounidenses donan sus cuerpos con la creencia de que contribuyen a la ciencia. De hecho, muchos contribuyen involuntariamente con la materia prima de un amplio mercado nacional no regulado.

Los comerciantes de cuerpos también son conocidos como “bancos de tejidos no-trasplantables”. Son diferentes del sector de trasplante de órganos y tejidos que el gobierno de EEUU regula minuciosamente. Vender corazones, riñones y tendones para su trasplante es ilegal. Pero ninguna ley federal rige la venta de cadáveres o partes del cuerpo para su uso en investigación o educación. Pocas leyes estatales plantean supervisión al respecto y casi cualquier persona, independientemente de su experiencia, puede diseccionar y vender fragmentos de un cuerpo humano.

“La situación actual es la ley de la selva”, dijo Angela McArthur, que dirige el programa de donación de cuerpos en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Médica de Minnesota y ha presidido la comisión de donación anatómica de su estado. “Vemos problemas similares a lo que vimos con los ladrones de tumbas de hace siglos” indicó, refiriéndose a la práctica del siglo XIX de obtener cadáveres con un procedimiento que violaba la dignidad de los fallecidos.

“Creo que cualquier cosa que diga se queda corta” dijo McArthur. “Lo que están haciendo es sacar provecho de la venta de humanos”.

El modelo de negocio de esta industria depende del acceso a una gran cantidad de cuerpos, a menudo procedentes de población pobre. A cambio de un cuerpo, los comerciantes suelen cremar una parte del donante sin cobrar. Al ofrecer la cremación gratuita, dicen algunos veteranos del sector, los intermediarios atraen a las familias de bajos ingresos que son más vulnerables. Muchos han agotado sus ahorros pagando el tratamiento médico de un ser querido y no pueden permitirse un funeral tradicional.

“Las personas con medios económicos tienen la oportunidad de debatir las cuestiones morales, éticas y espirituales sobre qué método elegir”, dijo Dawn Vander Kolk, un trabajador social de cuidados paliativos de Illinois. “Pero quienes no tienen dinero, pueden terminar con una opción de último recurso: la donación de cadáveres”.

La escasa normativa supone escasas consecuencias cuando los cuerpos son maltratados. En el caso de Southern Nevada, las autoridades descubrieron que podían hacer poco, más allá de una pequeña citación por contaminación a uno de los trabajadores involucrados. El operario de Southern Nevada Joe Collazo, quien no fue citado, dijo que lamentaba el incidente. También dijo que la industria se beneficiaría si hubiera más supervisión que ofrezca tranquilidad a los donantes, intermediarios e investigadores.

“Siendo honesto contigo, creo que tendría que existir una regulación”, expresó Collazo. “Hay una zona gris demasiado amplia”.

“UN GRAN MERCADO DE CADÁVERES”

Los cuerpos donados desempeñan un papel esencial en la educación médica, la formación y la investigación. Los cadáveres y partes del cuerpo se utilizan para enseñar a estudiantes de medicina, médicos, enfermeras y dentistas. Los cirujanos dicen que ningún maniquí o simulación virtual puede reproducir la respuesta táctil y la experiencia emocional que aporta practicar con partes del cuerpo humano. Los médicos de urgencias, por ejemplo, usan cabezas y torsos humanos para aprender cómo insertar tubos de respiración.

Los investigadores dependen de partes del cuerpo donadas para desarrollar nuevos instrumentos quirúrgicos, técnicas e implantes; y para crear nuevos medicamentos y tratamientos para enfermedades.

“La necesidad de cuerpos humanos es absolutamente vital”, dijo el médico de Chicago Armand Krikorian, expresidente de la Federación Estadounidense de Investigación Médica. Citó una reciente cura potencial para la diabetes tipo 1 desarrollada mediante el estudio del páncreas de los donantes. “Es un tipo de tratamiento que nunca habría salido a la luz si no hubiéramos recibido la donación de un cuerpo entero”, dijo

Pese al importante papel de la industria en la medicina, no existe un registro nacional del comercio de cuerpos. Muchos pueden operar casi en el anonimato, firmando acuerdos silenciosamente para obtener cadáveres y vender sus partes.

“Existe un extenso mercado para los cuerpos de los fallecidos” dijo Ray Madoff, un profesor de la Facultad de Derecho de Boston College que estudia cómo tratan a los muertos las leyes estadounidenses. “Sabemos muy poco sobre quién adquiere estos cuerpos y qué hacen con ellos”, añadió.

En la mayoría de los estados, cualquier persona puede comprar legalmente piezas de un cuerpo. Como se detalla en otro reportaje, un comerciante de Tennessee vendió a Reuters una columna cervical y dos cabezas humanas después de un breve intercambio de correos.

A través de entrevistas y registros públicos, Reuters identificó a Sourthern Nevada y otros 33 activos en todo Estados Unidos durante los últimos cinco años. Veinticinco de los 34 negocios eran empresas con ánimo de lucro. Solo en tres años, una de las empresas con ánimo de lucro ganó al menos 12,5 millones de dólares gracias al negocio de partes de cuerpos, como muestra otro artículo de Reuters.

Debido a que solo cuatro estados siguen de cerca las donaciones y las ventas, la amplitud del mercado de piezas de cuerpos humanos sigue siendo desconocida. Pero los datos obtenidos bajo las leyes de registro público de Nueva York, Virginia, Oklahoma y Florida, proporcionan una imagen de conjunto. Reuters calculó que desde 2011 hasta 2015, los comercios privados recibieron al menos 50.000 cuerpos y distribuyeron más de 182.000 partes humanas.

Las autorizaciones de Florida y Virginia dan una idea de cómo se usaron algunas de esas piezas: un envío en 2013 a un seminario de formación ortopédica de Florida incluyó 27 hombros. Un envío de 2015 a una sesión sobre el síndrome del túnel carpiano en Virginia incluyó cinco brazos.

Al igual que con otros productos, los precios de los cuerpos y las piezas de estos fluctúan según las condiciones del mercado. En general, un comerciante puede vender un cuerpo humano donado por alrededor de 3.000 a 5.000 dólares, aunque los precios a veces superan los 10.000 dólares. Pero los comerciantes normalmente dividen el cadáver en seis partes para satisfacer las necesidades del cliente. Los documentos internos de siete de estos negocios recogen un rango de precios para las partes del cuerpo: 3.575 dólares para un torso con piernas; 500 dólares por cabeza; 350 dólares por un pie; 300 dólares por columna vertebral.

Los negocios de cuerpos se han entrelazado con la industria funeraria estadounidense. Reuters identificó a 62 agentes funerarios que han llegado a acuerdos comerciales de beneficio mutuo con los comerciantes. Las funerarias brindan a los intermediarios acceso a posibles donantes. A cambio, los comerciantes de cuerpos pagan los honorarios a los funerarios, que van de 300 dólares a 1.430 dólares, de acuerdo con los libros contables y los registros judiciales.

Estos pagos generan ingresos para los agentes funerarios de aquellas familias que de otra forma no podrían permitirse una simple incineración. Pero tales relaciones provocan posibles conflictos de interés al crear un incentivo para las funerarias que alientan a los familiares en duelo a que consideren la donación del cuerpo, a veces sin una comprensión total sobre qué podría pasar con los restos.

“Algunos directores de las funerarias piensan: ‘La cremación ya no paga las facturas, así que déjame ver si puedo ayudar a estas personas a recoger partes corporales’” dijo Steve Palmer, un trabajador funerario miembro de la junta directiva de la National Funeral Directors Association. “Simplemente creo que las familias que donan los cadáveres de sus seres queridos tendrían dudas al respecto si supieran esto”, dijo.

Algunos embalsamadores han hecho que la donación del cuerpo forme parte de sus propios negocios. En Oklahoma, dos propietarios de funerarias invirtieron 650.000 dólares en una startup de comercio de cuerpos. En Colorado, una familia que controlaba una funeraria también dirigía una empresa que disecaba y distribuía piezas de cadáveres desde el mismo edificio.

Cuando se dona un cuerpo, pocos estados establecen normativas que controlen el desmembramiento o el uso de este, u ofrecen derechos sobre los familiares más cercanos del donante. Los cuerpos y las piezas se pueden comprar, vender y alquilar, una y otra vez. Como resultado, puede ser difícil rastrear qué sucede con los cuerpos de los donantes, y mucho menos garantizar que se les trate con dignidad.

En 2004, un comité de salud federal pidió sin éxito al gobierno de EEUU que regulara la industria. Desde entonces, Reuters ha descubierto que más de 2.357 partes del cuerpo obtenidas por comerciantes de al menos 1.638 personas han sido maltratadas, abusadas o profanadas en todo Estados Unidos.

Estos datos, basados en una revisión de registros judiciales, policiales, y de documentos internos de los negocios de cuerpos, seguramente estén subestimados, dada la falta de supervisión. Incluyen instancias en las que los cuerpos fueron utilizados sin el consentimiento del donante o el familiar más cercano; los donantes fueron engañados acerca de cómo se usarían los cuerpos; los cuerpos fueron desmembrados por motosierras en lugar de instrumentos médicos; las partes del cuerpo se almacenaron en condiciones insalubres y se descompusieron; o los cuerpos fueron desechados en incineradores de desechos médicos en lugar de ser incinerados adecuadamente.

“MATERIAS PRIMAS GRATUITAS”

Los negocios de cuerpos varían en tamaño, desde pequeñas empresas familiares hasta empresas nacionales con oficinas en varios estados. También varían en experiencia.

Garland Shreves, quien fundó el negocio de Phoenix Research for Life en 2009, dijo que invirtió más de 2 millones de dólares en procedimientos de control de calidad y equipos médicos, incluidos 265.000 dólares en una máquina de rayos X para escanear cadáveres en busca de implantes quirúrgicos.

Pero otros comerciantes han lanzado sus negocios por menos de 100.000 dólares, según indican registros corporativos internos y entrevistas. A menudo, los mayores gastos de capital son una furgoneta de carga y un conjunto de congeladores. Algunos negocios han ahorrado dinero utilizando motosierras para desmembrar los cadáveres en lugar de sierras quirúrgicas.

Los negocios también pueden reducir gastos al renunciar a los meticulosos procedimientos de control de calidad y a la formación solicitada por una organización nacional de referencia, la Asociación Estadounidense de Bancos de Tejidos.

Aun así, un tercio de los 34 negocios identificados por Reuters se declaraban en bancarrota o no pagaban sus impuestos, de acuerdo con documentos judiciales. Cuando las empresas que fracasan en la industria reducen gastos para ahorrar dinero, las consecuencias para las familias de los donantes pueden ser emocionalmente desgarradoras.

“UN ÚLTIMO GESTO DESINTERESADO”

Harold Dillard trabajaba con su hermano alicatando bañeras y encimeras de cocina en Albuquerque, Nuevo México. Le diagnosticaron cáncer terminal en 2009, el día después a Acción de Gracias.

“Tenía 56 años, era joven, activo, sano, tenía una vida genial y una noche, ¡bam!”, dijo su hija, Farrah Fasold. “Quería hacer un último gesto desinteresado antes de morir, por lo que donó su cuerpo”

Mientras su padre agonizaba, dijo Fasold, los trabajadores de Bio Care, negocio de cuerpos de Albuquerque, le visitaron a él y a su hija, y les dieron un discurso sincero: el generoso regalo de su cuerpo a la ciencia beneficiaría a estudiantes de medicina, médicos e investigadores. Fasold indicó que Bio Care les dio varias posibilidades, incluida que el cuerpo de su padre se usara para entrenar a los cirujanos en técnicas de reemplazo de rodilla.

La visión que tenía Fasold de Bio Care cambió en poco tiempo. Pasaron algunas semanas más de las prometidas hasta que recibieron lo que dijeron que eran los restos cremados de su padre. Una vez con ellos, sospechó que no eran sus cenizas porque parecían arena. Estaba en lo correcto.

En abril de 2010, las autoridades informaron a Fasold de que la cabeza de su padre se encontraba entre las partes corporales descubiertas en un incinerador médico. También supo, por primera vez, que Bio Care estaba dentro del negocio de la venta de partes del cuerpo.

“Estaba completamente histérica”, dijo. “Nunca nos habríamos apuntado si nos hubieran dicho algo sobre vender partes del cuerpo, de ninguna manera. Eso no es lo que mi padre quería en absoluto”.

Dentro del almacén de Bio Care, las autoridades apuntaron que encontraron al menos 127 partes del cuerpo pertenecientes a 45 personas.

El propietario de Bio Care, Paul Montano, fue acusado de fraude. De acuerdo con la declaración jurada de la policía, Montano negó haber abusado de los cuerpos y dijo a los agentes que dirigía Bio Care con “cinco empleados voluntarios”, incluido su padre. No quiso responder a las peticiones de comentarios.

Los fiscales retiraron más adelante los cargos contra Montano porque dijeron que no podían demostrar el engaño ni ningún otro delito. Ninguna otra ley estatal regulaba el tratamiento de los cuerpos donados o protegía a los familiares.

Confundida e indignada, Fasold habló por teléfono con Kari Brandenburg, el fiscal del distrito en el condado de Bernalillo. Fasold grabó parte de la llamada.

“Lo que ha sucedido es horrible, pero la ley de Nuevo México no dice nada sobre este tipo de actividad”, le dijo Brandeburg a Fasold. El fiscal expresó que, aunque Montano era quizás “el peor empresario del mundo”, sus errores se debieron, en parte, a acuerdos que fracasaron.

“Entonces”, respondió Fasold, “como otras personas incumplieron sus acuerdos, ¿está bien que siga adelante, corte el cuerpo de mi padre y lo incinere?”

”No, no está bien“, respondió el fiscal. ”Pero no lo convierte en un crimen“. No existe ninguna ley que diga que eso esté mal”.

En una entrevista reciente, Brandenburg dijo que él también se sintió frustrado al descubrir que ninguna ley protege a personas como Fasold y su padre. “Fue escandaloso”, dijo el exfiscal. “Estas familias han quedado profundamente heridas, devastadas”.

Las autoridades terminaron por recuperar las otras partes del cuerpo del padre de Fasold y se las devolvieron para que las pudiera incinerar correctamente. Algunas piezas habían sido descubiertas en bañeras en el incinerador y otras en las instalaciones de Bio Care.

EL TORSO CONGELADO

El incidente de 2015 en las afueras de Las Vegas que involucró al torso congelado provenía de una asociación entre un negocio de cuerpos y una funeraria.

Tanto el negocio, Southern Nevada Donor Services, y la funeraria, Valley Cremation and Burial, tenían problemas financieros. Valley acordó permitir que Southern Nevada diseccionara y prepara los cadáveres y las partes el cuerpo en su funeraria. Los restos y los documentos relacionados se mantendrían en el almacén de Valley, en un parque industrial a pocos kilómetros de distancia.

El dueño de Southern Nevada, Joe Collazo, tenía una década de experiencia vendiendo partes del cuerpo. Los registros judiciales muestran que también cumplió casi dos años en prisión a finales de la década de 1990 por falsificación. Y que un exempleado lo demandó por el robo de partes del cuerpo donadas valoradas en 75.000 dólares y la venta de las mismas a un cliente en Turquía.

Collazo defendió que su condena por falsificación es irrelevante y que la acusación de robo es falsa. Su negocio siguió las mejores prácticas de la industria, dijo, y prestó importantes servicios públicos a la comunidad médica.

Funcionarios locales y estatales informaron de que encontraron otras señales preocupantes, más allá del torso, en las instalaciones de almacenaje. Estas incluían una sierra mecánica ensangrentada que suelen usar trabajadores de la construcción y partes corporales con moho dentro de un congelador desconectado.

Valley ya no está en el negocio, y el dueño murió, según los registros estatales. Southern Nevada también se disolvió, dejando una estela de deudas y partes corporales profanadas.","En el mercado de los cuerpos humanos, casi cualquiera puede vender muertos",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CZ1KL-OESEN

Saudi has doled out money to global institutions for decades, hoping to generate income for its monarchy. Now the crown prince is turning the tables. At the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, the heir to the throne exhorted global entrepreneurs, business leaders and money managers to put some of their treasure to work in the kingdom. A precondition for that should be that Saudi modernizes, improving the role of women and establishing a more just criminal justice system.

The pitch is sinking in. “The opening up of Saudi Arabia - to try to take things back to before 1979 - is brave, it’s bold,“ Richard Branson said at the so-called ”Davos in the desert“ hosted by the country’s Public Investment Fund last week. The Virgin Group founder is considering backing tourism enterprises along Saudi Arabia’s unspoiled coastline on the Red Sea. ”Young people want it, the women want it and I think most sensible men want it too.”

Nobody seems to want it more than the crown prince, who at 32 is closer in age to more of his subjects than his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Reforming the economy is existential for the House of Saud. If the country cannot provide a hopeful vision for the 33 million people – just under two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30 - the current king could very well be the last. Balancing Islamic traditions and foreign innovations and money – without a bloody revolution – is a demanding transfiguration.

This is why the crown prince’s reference to 1979 was huge – not just because it came during a panel led by a female American journalist. “We will not spend 30 years of our lives dealing with extremist ideologies. We will destroy them today and immediately,” he said to thunderous applause. “Saudi was not like this before 1979. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after 1979. All we are doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world.”

Some history helps to understand the importance of that statement. Just a few weeks short of 38 years ago, armed religious militants stormed and occupied the Grand Mosque of Mecca – the holiest place in the Muslim world – and demanded the overthrow of the royal family. The siege lasted for two weeks and was resolved with the assistance of French commandos who converted to Islam so they could enter the mosque, according to Lawrence Wright’s account in the “The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11.”

Following the siege, and public beheadings of 63 rebels, King Khalid bin Abdulaziz doubled down on religion. He expanded the role of conservative religious clerics in Saudi life and allowed Wahhabi leaders to impose sweeping restrictions on cinemas, musical performances and the mingling of genders, among other things. Last week, the crown prince effectively called the last 38 years lost.

The prince must move cautiously enough to accommodate hard-liners, but fast enough to keep his youthful people from rebelling against Saudi’s income inequality. Already the country’s religious police have seen their powers curtailed, and in September the government said it would relax the prohibition on women driving. Though attendees of the conference, arriving in chauffeur-driven Mercedes, applauded talk about making Saudi moderate again it’s not evident they reflect the will of the masses.

That explains NEOM – the city on the Red Sea that the crown prince promised to build from scratch with $500 billion of oil booty. NEOM’s laws and rules will be different from Saudi Arabia’s and determined by the entrepreneurs who populate it, the crown prince says. Though that may not include lifting the prohibition on alcohol, or removing the death penalty for cases of homosexuality or blasphemy, it appears to be a way for him to offer an alternative to the more conservative lifestyle that has governed Saudi since 1979.

NEOM will need global validation - and money. The Vision Fund, in which the kingdom has said it would invest $45 billion alongside SoftBank and others, has already stepped up, pledging to take a stake in the Saudi Electric Co, a utility that will help power NEOM. Though it’s an odd way to channel some of the state’s own money back into the country, bringing along foreign investors could be seen as a validation of the kingdom’s plan.

The crown prince, in an interview, denied that there is any quid pro quo for global investors, like SoftBank, to reinvest funds into Saudi Arabia. “We don’t want to squeeze investors. If we cannot offer good opportunities in Saudi that means no one would come,” he said. “We think we really have great opportunities in Saudi Arabia. We want to shape it and to invest in it ourselves and also to allow people all over the world to invest in it.”

His charms are having an effect. BlackRock and Blackstone Group, with whom the kingdom has invested $20 billion in a fund dedicated to infrastructure, are opening offices in Riyadh, the crown prince told Breakingviews. That should be a sign that their leaders, Larry Fink and Steve Schwarzman, respectively, believe in the crown prince. But there is a flip side to this.

Should the crown prince fail to dismantle the gender apartheid of his predecessors the money managers – and indeed other investors like SoftBank or Branson’s Virgin - could find themselves needing to explain to their own shareholders and customers why they are invested in the kingdom. With the two Wall Street firms alone commanding $6 trillion of assets, that’s a pretty strong incentive for them to help keep the crown prince to his word.",Breakingviews - Cox: Saudi crown prince revealed his magic number,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-breakingviewsbreakin/breakingviews-cox-saudi-crown-prince-revealed-his-magic-number-idUSKBN1D21WW

Polizei und Staatsanwaltschaft durchsuchten am Freitag Büros des Düsseldorfer Konzerns. Metro kooperiere “in vollem Umfang” mit den Ermittlungsbehörden, sagte ein Konzernsprecher. Er wies den Vorwurf des Insiderhandels zurück. Den Anstoß für die Razzia hatte die Finanzaufsicht BaFin mit einer Anzeige gegeben. Die Behörde sei “wegen des Verdachts des Insiderhandels und der Marktmanipulation in Aktien der Metro AG” aktiv geworden, erklärte eine BaFin-Sprecherin. Zu Details wollte sie sich nicht äußern. Ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft Düsseldorf kündigte für Montag eine Erklärung an. Der “Spiegel” hatte zuerst über den Fall berichtet.

Börsianer reagierten nervös: Metro-Aktien gaben am Nachmittag fast zwei Prozent nach und zählten damit zu den größten Verlierern im Nebenwerteindex MDax.

Vorwürfe richten sich gegen Metro-Aufsichtsratschef Jürgen Steinemann sowie gegen Metro-Vorstand Pieter Boone. Es geht um Aktienkäufe, die beide Manager tätigten, kurz bevor der Konzern Ende März 2016 seine Aufspaltungspläne publik machte. Die Aktie der damaligen Metro AG legte am Tag der Ankündigung in der Spitze um 15 Prozent zu.

AKTIENKÄUFE VOR DEM HÖHENFLUG

Steinemann hatte einer Pflichtmitteilung zufolge am 22. Februar 2016, kurz nach seiner Wahl an die Spitze des Gremiums, für gut eine Million Euro 43.000 Aktien der damaligen Metro AG gekauft. Der damalige Cash&Carry-Chef und jetzige Metro-Vorstand Boone erwarb einer Pflichtmitteilung zufolge am 26. Februar 2016 für den damaligen Wert von knapp 50.000 Euro insgesamt 2175 Aktien. Die Metro sieht in beiden Fällen keinen Insider-Handel, wie der Sprecher betonte. “Die Metro AG hat die Nachricht von der beabsichtigten Aufspaltung des Unternehmens am 30. März 2016 pünktlich und unter Beachtung der einschlägigen Vorschriften kommuniziert und ist dabei allen entsprechenden Pflichten nachgekommen”, sagte der Sprecher. “Zu dem Zeitpunkt, zu dem Herr Steinemann und Herr Boone Aktien erworben haben, lag keine Insider-Information vor.”

Steinemann ist nicht nur bei der Metro engagiert. Er sitzt unter anderem auch in den Verwaltungsräten der Schweizer Konzerne Barry Callebaut und Lonza Group.

Konzernchef Olaf Koch hatte der Metro die Spaltung in einen Elektronikhändler um Media Markt und Saturn sowie einen Lebensmittelhändler verordnet. Er wollte die neuen Unternehmen damit schlagkräftiger machen. Heute sind beide Teile getrennt, die Media-Saturn-Holding firmiert unter dem Namen Ceconomy. Der Lebensmittelhändler rund um die Großmärkte und die Supermarktkette Real hat sich den Namen Metro gesichert.

Die BaFin geht branchenweit immer wieder mutmaßlichen Unregelmäßigkeiten nach. Im vergangenen Jahr hatte die Behörde insgesamt 21 Vorfälle unter dem Verdacht des Insiderhandels bei den zuständigen Staatsanwaltschaften angezeigt. Bei Insiderhandel drohen in schweren Fällen bis zu fünf Jahre Haft. Es können aber auch Geldstrafen verhängt werden, wenn sich Vorwürfe bestätigen.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Zuckerberg’s absence in Washington on Wednesday was widely noted by politicians. Earlier in the day, Facebook’s general counsel was raked over the coals by U.S. senators probing how the Kremlin could effectively push propaganda on social media as it tried to sway the presidential election.

Lawmakers were quick to say it appeared Facebook’s first priority was its business as opposed to national security. California Democrat Kamala Harris even brandished a 10-Q form. Several senators expressed disappointment that Zuckerberg, in addition to his missing counterparts at Twitter and Alphabet unit Google, decided to skip out on the hearings.

It would be a glaring error, even by Silicon Valley’s happy standards, to brush aside the Russian problem on earnings day. Sure, the firm reported its profit jumped almost 80 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to nearly $5 billion. That topped analysts’ expectations and fueled a 2.6 percent rise in the stock. But Zuckerberg also said he was “dead serious” about fixing security and that doing so “will significantly impact our profitability going forward.” The shares shed the day’s gain, and a bit more, in after-hours trading.

1/TRUMP ON TOUR

U.S. President Donald Trump embarks on his first trip to Asia in the coming week, stopping in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention, but investors will also look at trade talks, with Trump particularly keen to address his country’s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional, but which he calls “horrible”.

There is also the first deluge of data since last month’s People’s Party Congress in China. Import and loan growth figures will be particularly closely watched.

A weakening of the former would point to domestic demand finally flagging, while an acceleration of loan growth would show borrowers are finding ways around tighter new lending rules.

2/BALLISTIC BITCOIN

Investors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds. The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.

But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion? What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency - of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity - from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice? With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.

It all comes following strong recent U.S GDP data and after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives released plans on Thursday for a tax overhaul they believe will help lift the economy.

It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance .SX7E in 2017, so the results round should be telling.

5/ VENEZUELA RESTRUCTURING

After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.

Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.

Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.

The issue of whether to end coal production has been one of the sticking points in coalition negotiations between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her would-be allies: the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).

Organizers of the march called for the German government to implement the 2015 Paris plan to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century.

The group said 25,000 people took part in the march. A spokesman for the Bonn police said he could not provide an official figure but estimated the number of participants at around 10,000.

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to pull out from the 2015 Paris accord to limit global warming. His pro-coal policies and doubts that climate change is caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions have cast a shadow over the Bonn meeting.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock, and the prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings in future - including the IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf, as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

After Air Force One landed at Joint Base Hickam, Trump and his wife, Melania, were draped with traditional lei necklaces. Trump went on to nearby Camp Smith for a classified briefing from Pacific Command military leaders that officials expected would touch on North Korea and other areas.

Later, he was to visit Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial for the U.S. sailors killed when Japan bombed the American naval base on Dec. 7, 1941.

Trump’s 12-day trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, ending on Nov. 14, takes him out of Washington at a time when he has been beset by several issues.

These include an intensifying federal investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election, New York’s recovery from an attack earlier this week that killed eight people, and debate over a Republican tax-cut plan that if approved by Congress would be Trump’s first major legislative victory.

The trip began just days after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and after his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced Democratic calls to appear before Congress again to clarify his previous testimony about the campaign’s Russia contacts.

Amid the furor caused by the revelations, the Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at an Asian economic summit next week was being discussed, and Trump said it might happen.

“We may have a meeting with Putin,” Trump told Fox News. “And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.”

Court documents made public on Monday also disclosed that a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty early last month to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The documents cited a March 2016 meeting, when Trump was campaigning for the presidency, and attended by Trump and Sessions, in which Papadopoulos offered to help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin.

While Trump tweeted about developments vigorously this week, he told The New York Times on Wednesday that he was “not angry at anybody” about the case and there was nothing to suggest any collusion by his campaign and Russia.

CHINA AND PYONGYANG

Trump’s plan for an extended absence from Washington has alarmed allies who, after seeing a healthcare reform bid fizzle, worry the tax effort could suffer without Trump to keep momentum going.

On Saturday, Trump is to fly to Japan and later visit South Korea in search of a united front against North Korea before going to Beijing, where he will push Chinese President Xi Jinping to get tougher with Pyongyang.

In the Fox interview, Trump was asked if he planned to be tough on China over thorny issues including trade, intellectual property theft and subsidies.

“You have to understand something - very important,” he responded. “We have a problem called North Korea.”

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “has been pretty terrific” in cutting Pyongyang off from banking and oil systems. He added that Japan had reason to be worried about North Korea and alluded to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for a military buildup against that threat.

“Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation,” he said. “I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.”

Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, make a state visit to Hanoi and end his trip with the Association of South East Asia Nations summit in Manila. Trump told reporters before leaving on Friday that he would spend an extra day in the Philippines.

Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.
Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.
Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.","(Reuters) - Communications chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to unveil a bid for smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) by Monday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, an attempt to create a roughly $200-billion company through the biggest technology acquisition ever.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUSKBN1D324K?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Isner had his right leg massaged twice by the trainer but it did not prevent him from firing down 31 aces, although it was a perfect service return that gave Krajinovic his first match point, which he converted after 2-1/2 hours.

Krajinovic, who benefited from world number one Rafa Nadal’s withdrawal in the quarter-finals, held serve throughout and relied on his quick backhand to unsettle Isner.

Krajinovic made only four unforced errors in the opening set, saving three break points, and broke on his only opportunity to take a 3-2 lead with a fine service return and closed it out when Isner buried a forehand in the net.

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

“The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,” said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

“Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That’s why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,” said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday’s mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks.

“Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

High-yield, or so-called “junk”, bonds are on a tear that puts even record-busting stock markets in the shade. Last week, the yield on the Merrill Lynch global high-yield bond index fell below 5 percent for the first time ever. The European index yields barely 2 percent.

To put that into context, European junk bonds yield less than 10-year U.S. Treasuries trading around 2.35 percent.

If there’s evidence of irrational exuberance anywhere in financial markets, this may be it. And if that’s the case, this will be where the first tremors of a broader market earthquake will likely be felt.

There’s a case to be made that high-yield bonds of firms with sub-investment grade credit ratings are in a sweet spot right now. Economic and company earnings growth are running at the fastest pace in years, yet subdued inflation means the global shift towards tighter monetary policy can be glacial.

Put together, it’s a backdrop against which both stocks and fixed income can do well. Corporate bonds, which offer a higher rate of return than sovereign debt, can do well also.

Within that universe, high-yield paper is doing even better. Ratings agency Moody’s said this week that defaults among U.S. non-financial junk-rated companies fell to a three-year low in the third quarter.

So no surprise, perhaps, that the yield on Merrill Lynch’s global high yield index dipped below 5 percent last week and European junk yields threatened to go below 2 percent.

But it’s precisely this supercharged run that should be ringing the alarm bells for investors. A selloff in high yield could hit stock markets hard.

With stocks around the world higher than they’ve ever been, it’s easy to forget that there was a 20 percent drawdown from mid-2015 to early 2016, a correction that dovetailed with a collapse of the junk bond market.

Historically, the correlation between junk bonds and stocks is nearly always positive, but had shown signs of breaking down through 2014 and early 2015, just before junk bonds and stocks began to slide.

A plunge in oil prices decimated the U.S. high-yield market, which is dominated by energy companies. The yield on Merrill’s global high-yield index jumped to nearly 10 percent in February 2016 from under 6 percent the previous May.

Investors pulled $46 billion out of high-yield bond funds in those 10 months, according to data provider EPFR, during which time MSCI’s world stock index fell 21 percent.

To put that outflow into context, the net inflow into global junk bond funds since January 2010 stands at $64 billion, EPFR figures show.

The correlation between junk bonds and equities is breaking down again. Last month, it fell to 0.18, its lowest in three years. A move back up towards historical norms and average levels would imply the two asset classes rising or falling together at a much closer speed.

Given the lofty heights both markets find themselves at now, investors will be asking whether a correction of, say, 10-20 percent is more likely than a further 10-20 percent increase.

Junk-rated companies are certainly taking advantage of the current sweet spot to borrow at these unprecedented low rates. They’ve issued $366 billion of debt so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, up 35 percent on last year’s total.

But with interest rates rising in the United States and Britain - albeit at the most glacial pace imaginable - that may also be about to level off.

House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he has asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to assess Trump’s suggestion and indicated some lawmakers were considering it.

Other lawmakers have expressed concern. They said adding such a divisive provision would expose the tax bill to the fierce opposition that doomed Republicans’ efforts in July to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.

The act was former President Barack Obama’s biggest domestic achievement. It raised taxes on wealthier Americans to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income people, extending coverage to millions of previously uninsured. Democrats have defended it for years from attacks by Republicans, who see it as Washington intruding on Americans’ healthcare.

Since Trump took power in January, he has pressed hard to undo much of Obama’s work. So far he has not secured any major legislative accomplishments in Congress, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate.

“The president feels very strongly about including this (the individual mandate repeal) at some step before the final process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Brady told an event hosted by the news outlet Politico.

“No decisions have been made ... Importing healthcare into a tax reform debate has consequences,” Brady said.

Trump broached his idea in a tweet earlier this week, saying it would be “great” to repeal the mandate “and use those savings for further tax cuts.” Some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton and Rand Paul, also favor this idea.

Handout still from the film ""Ittefaq""

At a time when the Indian movie industry is struggling to make money, the producers of “Ittefaq” say they hope a minimalistic approach focusing more on digital platforms would provide a template for future projects and significantly reduce publicity budgets.

In the weeks leading up to its Nov. 3 release, the film’s cast has barely given media interviews, not starred in road shows or appeared in reality TV shows - staples of the Bollywood film promotion calendar.

Instead, ""Ittefaq"" producers Karan Johar (Dharma Films) and Shah Rukh Khan (Red Chillies Entertainment) have focused on social media and digital promotions to build a buzz about the film, a remake of a 1969 Bollywood thriller of the same name.

""Will this work for every film? Not necessarily. But we are hoping to use some of this stuff in the marketing of other films,"" Dharma Films CEO Apoorva Mehta told Reuters over the phone.

“We cannot eliminate all aspects of promotions, because some films do require it, but we can definitely look at doing some things on a lesser scale.”

Mehta said their focus was on digital promotions and outdoor signage, and that eschewing city tours and press events had brought down the film’s publicity budget by up to 30 percent.

""Ittefaq"" stars Sidharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha in the lead, playing two people who accuse each other of murder. The film is 100 minutes long, shorter than most Bollywood movies, and has no songs.

""Right now it's crazy. Promotions have become like a film of their own. There is so much work involved.""

Handout still from the film ""Ittefaq""





“The audience is fragmented across so many platforms that you have no choice but to cater to all of them. That becomes extremely exhausting for the actors,” Mehta said.

Most actors spend the weeks leading up to the release of their film appearing on television shows, touring at least five cities apart from print, TV, and radio interviews, all of which comes at a cost for the producer.

""If this works, it would be a huge game-changer for Bollywood. Going on [reality TV host] Kapil Sharma's show does nothing for your film. What does work is content and what your film is about,"" said Akshaye Rathi, a film distributor and theatre owner.

Rathi cited the examples of films such as Saket Chaudhary's ""Hindi Medium"", which started slow but ran in cinemas for several weeks, making it one of the hits of the year.

Shailesh Kapoor runs Ormax, an agency that tracks Bollywood releases before and after release. He says there is no evidence to prove that publicity tours and reality TV show appearances boost audience interest.

""If a star has visited, say, Ahmedabad on a day, and there has been press coverage the next day, our research shows that it makes no difference to the way an audience feels about the film,"" said Kapoor.

""Right now, it is somewhat of a herd mentality when it comes to film promotions.""

Kapoor says the real change will come when a film with a big-ticket star and budget takes the risk of going low-key with promotions.

""If they can resist the temptation to go all out to promote their film, maybe everyone else will catch on and take things down a notch,"" he said.

Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security.

Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days.

In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year.

Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.

Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump’s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT).

En route to Hawaii’s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump’s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.",Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D406B

Firmenchef und Steve-Jobs-Nachfolger Tim Cook bezeichnete das neue Gerät, das über eine Gesichtserkennung verfügt, als “den größten Sprung vorwärts seit dem Original”. Er hofft nun auf ein boomendes Geschäft im wichtigen Weihnachtsquartal. Anleger machen die Wette mit: Die Apple-Aktie legte im frühen US-Handel um drei Prozent zu und erreichte einen neuen Höchststand. Damit knackte der Konzern aus Kalifornien erstmals die Marke von 900 Milliarden Dollar bei der Marktbewertung - Analysten zufolge dürfte schon sehr bald die Grenze von einer Billion Dollar überschritten werden.

Im laufenden Quartal rechnet Apple nun mit einem Umsatz von 84 bis 87 Milliarden Dollar, so viel wie noch nie. Das wäre fast das Bruttoinlandsprodukt der Ukraine. In der Tat scheint das Unternehmen zehn Jahre nach dem Debüt des ersten iPhones die Begeisterung seiner Kunden neu zu entfachen: Weltweit zelteten Apple-Jünger über mehrere Tage vor den Läden, um beim Verkaufsstart dabei zu sein, auch in Berlin, wo sich am Morgen insgesamt etwa 380 Fans versammelten: “Ich habe kein Auto und gebe mein Geld lieber fürs iPhone X aus”, sagte Helge, ein 49-jähriger Soldat. Acht Tage hatte er vor der Filiale am Kurfürstendamm ausgeharrt, um dann als erster hereinzumarschieren.

“EINE EIGENE ART DER WÄHRUNGSUMRECHNUNG”

Am Preis von mindestens 1149 Euro störten sich die Kunden in der Hauptstadt nicht. Der 18-jährige YouTuber Jonas bezeichnete es zwar als “sehr krass”, aber das iPhone X habe er trotzdem haben müssen. Zumal er sich zuvor bereits einen Dummy in China bestellt habe, um seinen 16.000 Abonnenten einen ersten Eindruck von Gehäuse und Größe des Geräts geben zu können. Sein Freund und Kollege Marvin, der ein Apple-Tattoo auf dem Unterarm hat, sagte: “Apple scheint da irgendwie eine ganz eigene Art der Währungsumrechnung vorzunehmen. Schließlich ist das iPhone X in den USA ab 999 Dollar erhältlich.”

Auch in Sydney, Tokio und Peking bildeten sich Schlangen vor den Apple-Läden. Viele Menschen hatten sich zuvor ihr iPhone online reserviert. In fast allen Filialen gab es trotz zahlreicher Berichte von Produktionsengpässen weitere Geräte auf Lager. Nach den Worten von Apple-Finanzchef Luca Maestri ist die Nachfrage riesig. Die Branchenexperten von Nomura Instinet schätzen, dass Apple allein für das laufende Quartal 30 Millionen Exemplare des iPhone X herstellen wird. Analyst Bob O‘Donnell vom Technologieberater Techanalysis Research goss allerdings Wasser in den Wein: “Was wir nicht wissen, ist, wie lange diese Welle der ersten iPhone-X-Käufer anhält”, sagte er.

VERBRAUCHERSCHÜTZER SEHEN RISIKEN BEI GESICHTSERKENNUNG

Apple gilt zwar als Wegbereiter der schicken, teuren Universalgeräte. Doch zuletzt hatte es immer wieder Kritik gegeben, die iPhones seien technisch nicht mehr auf dem neuesten Stand. Konkurrent Samsung Electronics aus Südkorea stieg mit seiner Galaxy-Reihe zum Smartphone-Primus nach Marktanteil auf und führt mit großem Abstand. Das neueste Gerät aus dem Hause Apple ist nun fast randlos, verfügt über drei Kameras und erstmals über eine Gesichtserkennung. Damit kann das Smartphone entsperrt werden - was vorab gerade in Europa für viele Schlagzeilen sorgte. “Individuelle körperliche Merkmale machen uns einzigartig und sind deshalb deutlich sicherer als Passwörter, die leicht abgeschaut, geknackt, gestohlen und missbraucht werden können”, sagte Bitkom-Sicherheitsexperte Marc Bachmann zu Reuters. Deswegen werde die Gesichtserkennung künftig “ganz normal” sein. Verbraucherschützer weisen dagegen auf die Risiken hin. Den Nutzern müsse bewusst sein, dass sich im Falle eines unberechtigten Zugriffs von Dritten sensible biometrische Daten auf dem Gerät befinden, teilte die Verbraucherzentrale Nordrhein-Westfalen mit. Bevor App-Entwicklern Zugriff auf die Face-ID-Kamera gegeben werde, müsse dies genau überdacht werden.

Apple brachte in diesem Jahr erstmals zwei neue iPhone-Modelle auf den Markt. Im September kam bereits das iPhone 8 in den Handel und soll laut Analysten zuletzt für Schub gesorgt haben. Die Smartphones tragen mehr als die Hälfte zum Gesamtumsatz bei, der von Juli bis September um rund zwölf Prozent auf 52,6 Milliarden Dollar anzog. Im abgelaufenen Quartal steigerte Apple seinen Gewinn um knapp 19 Prozent auf 10,71 Milliarden Dollar. “Das iPhone X wird nun noch mal eins drauf setzen”, sagte Gartner-Analystin Melanie Zimmermann zum laufenden Vierteljahr.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

Use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in Afghanistan over recent years. Social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator ATRA was widely shared on social media.

Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the National Directorate for Security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.

The acting minister for telecommunications, Shahzad Aryobee, posted a message on Facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.

“The government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,” he wrote.

The letter by telecoms regulator ATRA, dated Nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block Telegram and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) WhatsApp services “without delay” for a period of 20 days.

However, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on Saturday on both state-owned operator Salaam and private service providers.

On Friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with WhatsApp services that were experienced in several countries.

Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage.

WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own.

The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number “in case WhatsApp is not working”.","Afghanistan moves to block WhatsApp, Telegram messaging services",https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-moves-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-messaging-services-idINKBN1D4072

The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies remained at +11, its joint lowest level since June.

“Growth in the economy has remained relatively stable, although the pace of growth was a little slower than expected, particularly for retailers and manufacturers,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.

Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 although it picked up a bit of pace in the third quarter.

The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday as it moved to head off what it sees as the inflationary impact of Brexit, even as it said economy will probably remain stuck in a slow gear over the next three years.

Output expectations for the next three months fell to +12 from +18 in September, the weakest reading since January.

The CBI said it expected growth to remain modest as inflation eats further into household spending power in late 2017 and early 2018 and uncertainty about Brexit dampens business investment next year.

“We still expect more support to growth from net trade than has been the case in the recent past, as a lower exchange rate and firm global growth lift UK exports and softer domestic demand bears down on import growth,” it said.",UK economy holds steady but outlook remains weak: CBI,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-cbi/uk-economy-holds-steady-but-outlook-remains-weak-cbi-idUKKBN1D4001

“We are about to buy a house, so we were hoping it wouldn’t happen,” 36-year-old Hall, a travel manager, said as she pushed her baby along in a pram in Greenwich in southeast London.

“It’s a bit of a difficult time for people trying to get on the housing ladder anyway without it becoming a bit harder.”

The BoE said it did not expect the increase in its benchmark rate to 0.50 percent from an all-time low of 0.25 percent to hit the budgets of borrowers hard, given how low rates remain by historical standards.

But the psychological impact of the first interest rate rise in more than a decade may be hard to measure.

Young people already spend a three times greater proportion of their income on housing than their grandparents, and they often live in poorer accommodation, according to a study published by the Resolution Foundation research group in September.

Home ownership in England has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years fuelled by the growing gap between earnings and property prices.

The BoE said a third of households in Britain have a mortgage. It said that initially the impact of the rate hike will be fairly modest although around 2 million households in Britain with mortgages were now facing their first ever interest rate hike.

The central bank said that if its 25 basis-point rate hike is fully passed on, it would raise the average cost of a mortgage by only around 15 pounds ($20) a month.

What remains to be seen is how households respond to what is likely to be the start of a series of rate hikes in Britain, even if the BoE stressed that it would move only gradually and that rates were unlikely to return to their levels of around 5 percent seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis.

“The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rate to 0.5 percent may appear subtle at first glance, but it will undoubtedly send a very real signal to UK shoppers and retailers,” Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said.

“This rise marks the first hike in 10 years, and there is therefore a sizeable portion of shoppers who have become all too accustomed to cheap credit.”

James Ronen, 38, who builds drones and has a mortgage, said the rate rise will be a shock for many first-time buyers.

“It’s going to really squeeze people,” he said. “For a lot of first-time buyers, this is the first rate rise they’ve seen so that might be a bit of a surprise for them.”

On the other hand, pensioners whose disposable incomes are growing at a faster rate than for people of working age in Britain will be among the biggest winners, especially as they tend to have savings, which earn more when interest rates rise.

Last year, British Prime Minister Theresa May sided with voters who have long complained that they were being punished by the dwindling returns on their savings in order to help borrowers cope with debt costs.

May’s spokesman said on Thursday that she expected to see commercial banks pass on higher returns to savers quickly following the BoE’s decision.

Martin Wooley, 77, who has no mortgage and just savings, welcomed the Bank of England news.

“We have been starved of decent interest rates on our savings for a very long time now. It’s high time it went up - and a lot more than this,” he said. “I hope they will do a great deal more before too long.”",Bank of England rate hike a blow for UK first-time buyers,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-borrowers/bank-of-england-rate-hike-a-blow-for-uk-first-time-buyers-idUKKBN1D22UH

Pocos en las calles entendieron realmente el anuncio hecho esta semana por el impopular presidente izquierdista Nicolás Maduro de que buscaría refinanciar la fuerte carga de bonos de la nación petrolera de unos 60.000 millones de dólares, cerca de 2.000 dólares por habitante.

Pero varios venezolanos entrevistados por Reuters dijeron que esperan que cualquier acuerdo entre el Gobierno y sus acreedores extranjeros libere divisas para aumentar las importaciones de alimentos, medicinas y productos básicos que en la actualidad escasean.

“De repente funciona, para que mejore el país”, dijo Johny Vargas, un trabajador de la construcción de 53 años, quien sostuvo que a menudo sólo come dos veces al día porque su salario se diluye por los aumentos de los precios. “Todo está caro. No hay comida, no hay nada. Maduro no sirve, mira como está el país”.

Hasta ahora, el gobernante Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) ha priorizado los pagos de la deuda recortando las importaciones, agravando cuatro años de recesión y escasez.

Si se llega a una renegociación de deuda podría liberar más dinero en el corto plazo para que el Gobierno compre alimentos básicos y medicamentos, la principal demanda en las calles.

Pero Wall Street es escéptico, al igual que muchos venezolanos.

“No podemos tener una buena negociación. No tenemos la credibilidad como para sentarnos y pedir”, dijo Mayerling Delgado, una contadora de 35 años, refiriéndose a las tensas relaciones con las potencias occidentales e incluso con varios países latinoamericanos.

“Entonces, sí hay que pagar”, agregó en un tono resignado en una concurrida plaza de Caracas.

Expertos alertaron durante mucho tiempo que la deuda acumulada por el fallecido Hugo Chávez era insostenible e instaron al Gobierno de Maduro a que refinanciara sus pesados compromisos.

Pero llevar a cabo tal operación ahora es casi imposible debido al caos económico de Venezuela, la falta de tecnócratas en el Gobierno, y especialmente, las sanciones que prohíben a los bancos estadounidenses participar de nuevos acuerdos de deuda venezolana o negociarlos.

NO PAGAR, ¿ES PEOR?

La mayoría de los venezolanos se resisten a la idea de un incumplimiento de deuda, lo que desencadenaría demandas de los acreedores que buscan quedarse con activos como refinerías en Estados Unidos. Eso podría hundir a la nación miembro de la OPEP, de 30 millones de habitantes, en dificultades aún peores.

“Consistentemente la población mayoritaria percibe que un default es una acción negativa que puede complicar la economía del país”, dijo el economista Luis Vicente León, de la encuestadora local Datanálisis.

Pero como muchos analistas ven un incumplimiento de pagos como algo inevitable, dado al estado lamentable de las finanzas de Venezuela, algunos creen que sería mejor pasar el trago amargo.

“¿Cuál es la ciencia de pagar algo que ya está perdido? No es lo que quiere el venezolano pero (...) no hay otra salida, lamentablemente”, dijo la esteticista Harlee Tovitto, de 42 años, quien planea emigrar pronto a Colombia porque ya no puede comprar ropa o un seguro médico para sus tres hijos.",Venezolanos esperan por ayuda en medio de saga sobre deuda externa,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idLTAKBN1D40M1-OUSLT

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock, and the prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings in future - including the IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf, as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUKKBN1D40IN

Martha O‘Donovan, who works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe’s leading producer of political satire, was on Friday charged by police, who also accused her of insulting President Robert Mugabe.

Lawyers for O‘Donovan, who appeared in court in jeans and a checked shirt, argued before magistrate Nomsa Sarabauta that police only informed O‘Donovan of the more serious charges of attempting to subvert the government hours after her arrest, thereby violating the constitution.

But the magistrate said she was satisfied the officers complied with the law and dismissed the application. The charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail.

Lawyer Obey Shava said he would now apply for bail at the High Court on Monday.

O‘Donovan, who denies the charges against her, was not formally charged nor was she asked to plead in court, where she will return on Nov. 15.

A Justiça rejeitou um pedido do ex-líder catalão, que considera concorrer em uma eleição antecipada na Catalunha no mês que vem, para testemunhar da Bélgica via videoconferência.

Puigdemont disse não confiar na Justiça espanhola, mas que irá cooperar com tribunais belgas. A Bélgica terá um máximo de três meses para decidir enviá-lo ou não de volta à Espanha.

As autoridades belgas receberam o mandado de prisão da Espanha para o líder catalão expulsado Carles Puigdemont e vão examiná-lo antes de entregá-lo a um juiz, disse o promotor federal Eric Van Stite.

“Vamos estudá-lo, vamos dar isso a um juiz de investigação talvez amanhã ou depois de amanhã”, disse Van der Sypt à Reuters. Os comentários ocorreram algumas horas depois que a Espanha emitiu o mandado de prisão.

Na quinta-feira, a Suprema Corte determinou que nove membros do gabinete destituído de Puigdemont fossem mantidos em custódia pendendo investigação e possível julgamento.

“Nós nos consideramos um governo legítimo”, disse Puigdemont nesta sexta-feira à TV estatal belga RTBF. “Precisa haver uma continuidade para contar ao mundo o que está acontecendo na Espanha... Não é com um governo na prisão que as eleições serão neutras, independentes, normais.”

“Estou pronto para ser candidato... é possível fazer campanha de qualquer lugar”, acrescentou, se referindo à eleição convocada por autoridades em Madri quando o primeiro-ministro Mariano Rajoy assumiu a Catalunha.

Em protesto às prisões, os grupo civis catalães Asamblea Nacional Catalana e Omnium Cultural --cujos líderes foram presos no mês passado por acusações de insubordinação-- convocaram uma greve geral para 8 de novembro e uma manifestação em massa para 11 de novembro.

Outros seis líderes catalães devem testemunhar em 9 de novembro pelas mesmas acusações.

Um membro do gabinete destituído, Santi Villa, foi libertado após pagar fiança de 50 mil euros nesta sexta-feira. Os outros oito não tiveram opção de fiança e podem continuar em custódia por até quatro anos.

Villa deixou o gabinete catalão antes da declaração de independência de sexta-feira e embora continue apoiador da separação, tem defendido uma solução negociada com o governo central.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

En una conferencia de prensa antes de su partido de cuartos de final frente al serbio Filip Krajinovic, Nadal dijo que tenía problemas en la rodilla derecha.

Asimismo, el tenista de 31 años afirmó que hará todo lo posible para llegar en forma al torneo, en el que participarán los ocho mejores jugadores del año y que se celebrará entre el 12 y el 19 de noviembre en el estadio O2 Arena Londres, pero precisó que su objetivo es a largo plazo.

“No me veo en condiciones de jugar tres partidos más en este torneo. Quería jugar, pero es imposible”, comentó el 10 veces ganador del Abierto de París, que tuvo que lidiar con los dolores en su rodilla para doblegar el jueves al uruguayo Pablo Cuevas. “Estoy teniendo que retirarme de París, la ciudad más importante de mi carrera. Ha sido una decisión dura”, agregó.

“Lo lamento por el torneo y por los fans, es un día triste para mí. He hecho todo lo posible para jugar este torneo. La rodilla me ha estado molestando desde hace un tiempo. Es el final de la temporada y he jugado muchos partidos. He exigido al cuerpo y esto puede suceder”, declaró.

El tenista español, que nunca ha ganado el Masters de la capital francesa, aseguró que no sabe si estará a punto para Londres.

“No se trata de Londres para mí, sino del largo plazo. Pero no es el día para hablar de Londres”, señaló.

In a special edition marking 50 years since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, ""Time Out Tel Aviv"" rebranded itself as ""Time Out Ramallah,"" with stories provided by seven freelance Palestinian reporters and photographers. The cover photo, of an horizon-obscuring Israeli security barrier, anticipates stories that are far from the magazine's usually hip and carefree content: A Gazan correspondent tells of soirees timed around daily power cuts; in the West Bank, a rare female DJ awaits an elusive permit to perform in Israel. There is lighter fare, such as a tale of two former prisoners in Israel who run the first Palestinian food truck. But as evidenced by the lack of ads - Time Out Tel Aviv's source of income, allowing the weekly to be distributed for free - this edition is a political display, not a commercial crowd-pleaser. A quarter-century of failed talks on creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel has been interspersed with surges of violence. Israel has responded with West Bank closures and withdrawal from Gaza, which is now under Islamist Hamas rule. So deep is the rift, that just getting the Palestinian journalists past checkpoints to meet their Israeli counterparts was a challenge. Internal Palestinian pressures also shadowed some of the freelancers, who published articles without bylines lest they be accused at home of ""collaborating"" with Israel. ""Having this kind of thing in Ramallah, and a way and approach to share our stories and experiences for the whole world to hear, and for ourselves, is something encouraging,"" said Tareq Mansour, a student at Birzeit University in the West Bank who contributed to the special edition. Within Israel, 70,000 copies of ""Time Out Ramallah"" came out in Arabic and Hebrew, and around 2,000 more appeared in English in the Palestinian territories, editor Nof Nathansohn told Reuters.

News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars.

IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG (BMWG.DE), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) with its Audi (NSUG.DE) and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV (OMVV.VI).

“The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles,” IONITY’s CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest.

Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers. The car consortium’s new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros (£178,385) each, sources said previously.

Companies ranging from engineering conglomerates such as Siemens (SIEGn.DE) to small specialists like ChargePoint are all hoping for a slice of the pie.

IONITY will expand its network to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from petrol or diesel models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems.

A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard.",Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-electricity-autos-charging/carmakers-plan-400-europe-car-charging-stations-by-2020-idUKKBN1D30GW

Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that there is a “reasonable basis to believe” war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed and that all sides in the conflict would be examined.

The prosecutor will focus on crimes allegedly committed since May 2003 on the territory of Afghanistan, and war crimes closely linked to the situation in Afghanistan allegedly committed since July 2002 on the territory of other states.

The prosecutor on Friday did not mention any specific parties to be investigated.

In a report last year, ICC prosecutors identified “potential cases” among three groups of alleged perpetrators: the Taliban and its affiliates, the Afghan authorities and members of the U.S. armed forces and Central Intelligence Agency.

There were preliminary grounds to believe U.S. forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan and at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004, it said.

The alleged atrocities took place in all 34 of Afghanistan’s provinces, with a smaller number of crimes alleged in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where suspected members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda were held for questioning.

If authorized by the court’s judges, prosecutors will investigate “in an independent, impartial and objective way, crimes within the court’s jurisdiction allegedly committed by any party to the armed conflict.”

ULTIMATE FOCUS ON MOST SERIOUS CRIMES

“The ultimate focus will be upon those most responsible for the most serious crimes,” she said in the statement.

The ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court for prosecuting the most serious war crimes, including genocide.

It has the backing of the European Union and dozens of nations, but several of the world’s most powerful countries - notably the United States, Russia and China - never joined.

Former U.S. administrations first opposed the court’s establishment, citing fears that American service members would be targeted by politically-motivated prosecutions, but later backed ad hoc investigations.

A court of last resort, the ICC only steps in when a country’s government is found to be unwilling or unable to do so. ICC jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed on the territory of member states, or in cases referred to it by the U.N. Security Council, as happened with Sudan over alleged genocide in Darfur in 2005.

However, crimes committed on the soil of member states by soldiers of countries who are not members also fall under the court’s jurisdiction under international law.

If a state can show it has investigated and prosecuted the same crimes the ICC is looking into, it could avoid any case ending up in The Hague.

In a 2016 report on the preliminary examination of alleged crimes in Afghanistan, the prosecutor noted that while the U.S. Dept. of Justice has looked into allegations of ill treatment of CIA detainees in 2009-2011, the scope of the probe was limited and two cases did not result in a prosecution.",Prosecutor at war crimes court to seek investigation into Afghan conflict,https://www.reuters.com/article/icc-afghanistan/prosecutor-at-war-crimes-court-to-seek-investigation-into-afghan-conflict-idINKBN1D31GR

Pistorius was imprisoned in July last year after being found guilty on appeal of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013. The case has attracted worldwide interest.

He was not in court for Friday’s hearing.

Women’s rights groups in a country beset by high levels of violent crime against women say Pistorius has received preferential treatment compared to non-whites and those without his wealth or international celebrity status.

The athlete was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in jail. That conviction was increased to murder by the SCA in December 2015 and his sentence increased to six years by trial Judge Thokozile Masipa.

State prosecutors, led by advocate Andrea Johnson, said the sentence by Masipa was too lenient as the jail term was less than half the minimum 15-year sentence prescribed for murder in South Africa.

Johnson said the High Court did not list the substantial and compelling factors for deviating from the 15-year sentence and that Pistorius had not shown remorse for the murder.

“There is no true, gut-wrenching remorse,” Johnson said.

“It is shockingly lenient and has accordingly resulted in an injustice,” she said, referring to the sentence.

Lawyers for the gold medalist, known as the “Blade Runner” for his carbon-fiber prosthetics, say he did not deliberately kill model and law graduate Steenkamp.

Barry Roux, lead defense lawyer for Pistorius, said the athlete was suffering from severe and worsening post-traumatic stress disorder over the case.

Roux said Masipa had addressed the misperception that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp.

“Leave to appeal should really not be granted,” he said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets and rejects the financial damages claim.

Uber and Waymo, rivals in the development of autonomous car technology, have been fighting in court since earlier this year about whether Uber benefited from trade secrets and other intellectual property allegedly stolen by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. Trial is set for early December.

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup late on Thursday issued an order excluding Waymo’s damages expert, Michael Wagner, from the case and restricting use of financial evidence at trial and denying other relief, according to a docket entry.

The docket summarizes the decision, but the details are under seal until later on Friday.

University of Florida law professor Elizabeth Rowe said it was a setback for Waymo to have its damages expert excluded, but noted there were still ways to include the information, were the scope of the exclusion limited to the one person.

In a statement, Waymo said the company could still pursue full damages using “the same documents” relied upon by their expert.

Uber described the ruling on the expert as a sign of success, together with Alsup’s exclusion of Otto Trucking as a defendant in the case. Levandowski is the primary shareholder of Otto Trucking.

“Waymo’s case continues to shrink,” the ride-services company said in a statement.

Alsup recently agreed to Waymo’s request to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that Levandowski - the former head of Uber’s self-driving effort who was previously at Waymo - downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Waymo to set up a self-driving truck startup company that Uber then acquired.

Waymo in settlement talks had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, which rejected that and other terms as non-starters, sources previously told Reuters.

Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will remain benign.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists’ expectations for a jump of 310,000 jobs.

Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.

The White House, which is pushing a Republican-backed package of tax cuts to boost economic growth and employment, trumpeted the payrolls gains. “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!” President Donald Trump tweeted after the release of the report.

But Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement that the report showed Americans were continuing to be denied bigger paychecks by Republicans’ “billionaires-first agenda.”

Average hourly earnings slipped one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part due to the return of the lower-paid leisure and hospitality workers. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September. They were up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis last month, the smallest gain since February 2016, after a 2.8 percent advance in the prior month.

October’s job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve’s assessment on Wednesday that “the labor market has continued to strengthen,” and the sluggish wage data did little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.

The U.S. central bank has increased rates twice this year.

“The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,” said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. “Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”

Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. Should wage growth remain sluggish, economists say it would be hard for central bank policymakers to hike rates three times next year as they currently anticipate.

Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October, from 4.2 percent in the prior month, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise rise of 575,000 in September.

The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.

The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.

Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher as were U.S. stocks. The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. The unemployment rate, which has declined by 0.7 percentage point since January, is now at its lowest level since December 2000 and below the Fed’s median forecast for 2017.

A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month. That was the lowest level since December 2006 and was down from 8.3 percent in September.

The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.

“You cannot get strong growth when spending power is increasing so modestly,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.

Other economic reports showed a jump in business spending on capital in September and a measure of services sector activity racing to more than a 12-year high in October.

Economic growth has remained strong even as Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.

House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cut tax rates on individuals and families and end certain tax breaks. Small businesses, realtors and homebuilders have opposed the current proposal.

Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers’ difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.

Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs last month while the retail sector lost 8,300 jobs.

Construction payrolls were up 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes. Professional and business services payrolls rose as did healthcare employment.",U.S. job growth picks up; flat wages raise consumer spending worries,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-job-growth-picks-up-flat-wages-raise-consumer-spending-worries-idUKKBN1D308L

The British government will be forced to pass the region’s budget after talks to form a government failed. A return to direct rule from London may follow; an outcome that could see growth weaken and heighten sectarian tensions.

The region has been without a government since January, when a decade-long power-sharing agreement between the Democratic Unionist Party and Irish nationalist group Sinn Fein ended amid a financial scandal. Attempts to forge a new deal were scuppered by Sinn Fein’s demands for legal protections for the Irish language, the main tongue of 0.2 percent of the population. The party has been emboldened by UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to form an alliance with the DUP to preserve her majority at Westminster.

The stalemate is bad news for Northern Ireland’s economy. It is already one of the least productive in the developed world according to PwC data, and is reliant on fiscal transfers from London for roughly 30 percent of government income. It will now rely on Westminster to pass a budget, and, if there is no truce, to rule directly. The status of 1 billion pounds of additional funding promised to the DUP as a quid pro quo for propping up Theresa May’s government is now in question, delaying infrastructure projects. The parties’ ambitions to lower the region’s corporate tax rate may be shelved too, reducing its ability to compete with the low-tax Republic of Ireland.

Economic strains will have political consequences. The province’s dismal economy will be particularly stark when compared with the Republic of Ireland. It is already on track to grow more than four times faster this year than the 1.2 percent forecast for Northern Ireland according to EY data. An abrupt exit from the EU could further hurt Northern Ireland, if it means the return of a hard border with the Republic. Such damage, inflicted under direct UK rule, could boost support for independence, while exonerating Sinn Fein. It is already calling for Dublin to play a role in the province’s governance.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

FILE PHOTO: Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province January 7, 2011. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 25 in the California Superior Court in San Francisco, alleges that Tezos’ organizers violated U.S. securities laws and defrauded participants in the online fundraiser.

ICOs have become a popular way for technology companies to raise money by issuing new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.

Tezos, however, has yet to issue any digital coins and participants were told they were making a donation and may never receive any.

The defendants include Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, the co-founders of the project; their Delaware-based company Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, which owns the source code; and Strange Brew Strategies, a communications firm hired to promote the venture.

Defendants also include the Tezos Foundation, a Swiss entity that the couple helped establish to handle the ICO, and its president Johann Gevers.

Brian Klein, an attorney for the Breitmans, said the lawsuit “is without merit” and the couple “are going to aggressively defend themselves.”

The Tezos Foundation and Strange Brew declined to comment.

The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The lawsuit quotes extensively from a Reuters investigation published Oct. 18 that reported on a battle between the Breitmans and Gevers over control of the Tezos project.

The dispute has significantly delayed the venture, which aims to create a computerized network for transactions using blockchain technology.

The lawsuit is asking that plaintiffs receive a refund as well as damages. It alleges that the organizers sold unregistered securities.

The ship’s captain, a 25-year-old Indonesian has been put under house arrest. The other four crew members, also from Indonesia, were not arrested.

The ship was intercepted in Sicilian waters on Oct. 26 and prosecutors in Syracuse are still investigating exactly where the fuel was taken from and where it was intended to be sold, the statement said.

Repairing the damage wrought on the broadband system, including replacing steel-braid wires that the pesky parrots have gnawed, has already cost A$80,000 ($61,500), network builder NBN Co said on Friday.

The company estimates the bill could rise sharply as more damage is uncovered and more cables are rolled out in the national telecommunications infrastructure project, which is not due to be completed until around 2021.

“They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across,” said NBN Co project manager Chedryian Bresland in a blog post on the company’s website on Friday.

“Unfortunately, they’ve developed a liking to our cables ... these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm.”

Yellow-crested cockatoos are prolific in Australia and well-known for their voracious appetites for everything from fruit crops to wooden window frames.

Much of the cable chomping has occurred in grain-growing regions in Australia’s southeast.

“It would have to be an acquired taste, because it’s not their usual style,” Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behavior at the University of New England, told Reuters.

“Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, They don’t usually go for cables. But it might be the color or the position of the cables that’s attracted them,” she said.

“These will be largely software engineering, tech and non-tech jobs, and they’ll be contributing to products that are used globally,” Jesse Dougherty, general manager for the Vancouver office, told reporters.

The Vancouver expansion comes as companies in the United States have struggled to secure visas in a timely fashion to import foreign workers to fill highly skilled and technical jobs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it tougher for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more regularly than at nearly any point under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Unluckily for him, as he and his father watched forbidden Italian television, the regime was watching him.

Maloku was jailed for nine years in 1976 after the secret police bugged his home. Four decades on, he can visit a unique Tirana museum and see for himself the kind of listening devices that betrayed him.

At the Museum of Surveillance, created in the former headquarters of the feared Sigurimi security service, Albanians can now inspect some of the spying paraphernalia used by dictator Enver Hoxha’s totalitarian state as well as the files kept on many of them.

“Until now nothing had been done to show how Albanians were spied upon and kept in check, so this is a good step to illustrate the history of spying we were the victims of,” Maloku, now 71, told Reuters.

Visiting the museum, Maloku told the story of how he had wanted to help his paralyzed father by broadening his television viewing beyond the drab daily four hours of Albanian state broadcasts.

An electronic engineer, he built a device he called “the can” to convert UHF signals from Italy’s RAI television so they could be viewed on an Albanian set.

“The can opened a window into the West for the Albanians. I made them free of charge for my friends, but later learned some of them had denounced me,” Maloku said.

The Sigurimi planted a listening device in a wall to gather evidence against him.

The same model of device - once attached to a broomstick to spy on the Italian embassy in Tirana - is on display in another museum depicting the work of the communist-era interior ministry.

In the age of the smartphone, both Maloku’s and the Sigurimi’s electronic gizmos now look quaintly crude - but they did their jobs, and Maloku went to prison convicted of hostile “agitation and propaganda”. He remembers singing Rolling Stones and Beatles songs in his underground cell to preserve his sanity.

Before the collapse of Albanian communism in 1990, the building that now houses the Museum of Surveillance was known as the “House of Leaves” - a pun referring to both its ivy-clad walls and the “leaves” of secret police files kept on citizens.

But the fact the decision was so contested both in and outside the BoE perhaps reveals more concern about the lack of inflation pressure than about Britain’s clear difficulty in trying to leave the European Union without a concrete plan.

The majority of those who argued against higher rates in Britain started with the fact above-target inflation is a result of sharply higher import prices due to the tumble in the pound since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.

A lack of domestic inflation pressure from higher wage deals remains as plain as ever, as does the ongoing lack of inflationary drift from the global economy, where trade is down from boom years but cheap labor remains plentiful.

Among those who carefully follow Britain’s peers in the Group of Seven industrialized economies, notably the United States and those in the euro zone, the lack of inflation is real and striking, corroborated by a recent Reuters poll of over 500 forecasters around the world.

News that Jerome Powell will be taking over as Federal Reserve chair from Janet Yellen does nothing to change the fact core inflation on the central bank’s preferred measure has fallen back to 1.3 percent. That is where it was the month before the Fed started raising rates nearly two years ago.

The Bank of Canada has delivered two interest rate hikes this year - the July one more of a surprise than the follow-up in September - but growth has since flatlined and there’s no sign of core inflation picking up there either.

Led by President Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank has just skillfully engineered a broad acceptance January is the right time to slash its monthly asset purchases by half to 30 billion euros. But core inflation is still going nowhere fast.

The ECB even has a “core core” measure it looks at that strips out a litany of pesky components holding inflation down, and even that is not offering much encouragement.

Japan, like the euro zone, is experiencing one of its best economic years in the past two decades, drifting up with the rest of the global economy but also showing impressive domestic performance and more reason for hope for the future.

But its notable recent improvements in raising wage settlements a bit still does not look like they will bring inflation much higher.

The Bank of Japan’s latest meeting had a newcomer arguing for more easing, a crack in the armor that leaves a rather uncomfortable question lingering in the air.

If Japan still hasn’t escaped from two lost decades of near-zero pricing power, even after the authorities have thrown the kitchen, bathroom and garage sinks at it, isn’t the logical conclusion that central banks aren’t in control of inflation?

That is the challenge the BoE will have in coming months: persuading anyone who will listen that by raising rates a tiny amount from near-zero to just a little above zero it was instrumental in bringing UK inflation under control.

It is also worth noting that as central bankers change their tune on inflation from tentative to more emphatic hopes for a revival, some very powerful disinflationary forces in the global economy remain.

While labor unions everywhere are pushing for better pay, the most powerful pull for consumers appears to be the search for a good bargain.

Amazon, now almost synonymous with “instant” and “cheap” in the eyes of consumers, and a website many routinely check on their mobile phones against consumer prices while in shops for just about any item, is rapidly expanding.

Obviously more symbolic at this stage than statistical, its recent acquisition of Whole Foods, a grocery brand more associated with “posh” and “expensive”, should also be a reminder of where the path of least resistance lies.

The other clear disinflationary risk, even if price pressure does pick up in the interim, is that on more than a few measures global asset prices look extremely stretched.

“Equity investors are trying to have their cake and eat it,” economists at Fathom, an investment consultancy, say in a note.

“They are betting, simultaneously, that real rates of interest will never rise materially above zero, while the major economies will continue to enjoy positive, if not stellar real rates of economic growth. They will be proved wrong, in our view.”","Central bankers on the move, but where's the inflation?",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-economy-outlook/central-bankers-on-the-move-but-wheres-the-inflation-idUKKBN1D401O

Pocos en las calles entendieron realmente el anuncio hecho esta semana por el impopular presidente izquierdista Nicolás Maduro de que buscaría refinanciar la fuerte carga de bonos de la nación petrolera de unos 60.000 millones de dólares, cerca de 2.000 dólares por habitante.

Pero varios venezolanos entrevistados por Reuters dijeron que esperan que cualquier acuerdo entre el Gobierno y sus acreedores extranjeros libere divisas para aumentar las importaciones de alimentos, medicinas y productos básicos que en la actualidad escasean.

“De repente funciona, para que mejore el país”, dijo Johny Vargas, un trabajador de la construcción de 53 años, quien sostuvo que a menudo sólo come dos veces al día porque su salario se diluye por los aumentos de los precios. “Todo está caro. No hay comida, no hay nada. Maduro no sirve, mira como está el país”.

Hasta ahora, el gobernante Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) ha priorizado los pagos de la deuda recortando las importaciones, agravando cuatro años de recesión y escasez.

Si se llega a una renegociación de deuda podría liberar más dinero en el corto plazo para que el Gobierno compre alimentos básicos y medicamentos, la principal demanda en las calles.

Pero Wall Street es escéptico, al igual que muchos venezolanos.

“No podemos tener una buena negociación. No tenemos la credibilidad como para sentarnos y pedir”, dijo Mayerling Delgado, una contadora de 35 años, refiriéndose a las tensas relaciones con las potencias occidentales e incluso con varios países latinoamericanos.

“Entonces, sí hay que pagar”, agregó en un tono resignado en una concurrida plaza de Caracas.

Expertos alertaron durante mucho tiempo que la deuda acumulada por el fallecido Hugo Chávez era insostenible e instaron al Gobierno de Maduro a que refinanciara sus pesados compromisos.

Pero llevar a cabo tal operación ahora es casi imposible debido al caos económico de Venezuela, la falta de tecnócratas en el Gobierno, y especialmente, las sanciones que prohíben a los bancos estadounidenses participar de nuevos acuerdos de deuda venezolana o negociarlos.

NO PAGAR, ¿ES PEOR?

La mayoría de los venezolanos se resisten a la idea de un incumplimiento de deuda, lo que desencadenaría demandas de los acreedores que buscan quedarse con activos como refinerías en Estados Unidos. Eso podría hundir a la nación miembro de la OPEP, de 30 millones de habitantes, en dificultades aún peores.

“Consistentemente la población mayoritaria percibe que un default es una acción negativa que puede complicar la economía del país”, dijo el economista Luis Vicente León, de la encuestadora local Datanálisis.

Pero como muchos analistas ven un incumplimiento de pagos como algo inevitable, dado al estado lamentable de las finanzas de Venezuela, algunos creen que sería mejor pasar el trago amargo.

“¿Cuál es la ciencia de pagar algo que ya está perdido?

Eugene Kaspersky, Chief Executive of Russia's Kaspersky Lab, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Moscow, Russia October 27, 2017. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov

The acknowledgement, made in an interview last Friday as part of the Reuters Cyber Security Summit, comes days after Kaspersky’s company said its software had copied a file containing U.S. National Security Agency hacking tools from the home computer of an agency worker in 2014.

Kaspersky’s firm has for years faced suspicions that it has links with Russian intelligence and state-sponsored hackers. Kaspersky denies any cooperation with Russian authorities beyond cyber crime enforcement.

In September, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky software from use in federal offices, citing the company’s ties with Russian intelligence. The company is the subject of a long-running probe by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, sources have told Reuters.

Antivirus software is designed to burrow deeply into computer systems and has broad access to their contents, but it normally seeks and destroys only files that contain viruses or are otherwise threatening to a customer’s computers, leaving all other files untouched.

Searching for and copying files that might contain hacking tools or clues about cyber criminals would not be part of normal operations of antivirus software, former Kaspersky employees and cyber security experts said.

In the Reuters interview, conducted at Kaspersky Lab’s offices in Moscow, Eugene Kaspersky said the NSA tools were copied because they were part of a larger file that had been automatically flagged as malicious.

He said the software removed from the agency worker’s computer included a tool researchers dubbed GrayFish, which the company has called the most complex software it has ever seen for corrupting the startup process for Microsoft’s Windows operating system.

Kaspersky said he had ordered the file to be deleted “within days” because it contained U.S. government secrets.

But he defended the broader practice of taking inert files from machines of people that the company believes to be hackers as part of a broader mission to help fight cyber crime.

“From time to time, yes, we have their code directly from their computers, from the developers’ computers,” Kaspersky told Reuters.

‘IMPROPER PRACTICE’

Three former Kaspersky employees and a person close to the FBI probe of the company, who first described the tactic to Reuters this summer, said copying non-infectious files abused the power of antivirus software. The person associated with the FBI said in one case Kaspersky removed a digital photo of a suspected hacker from that person’s machine.

Eugene Kaspersky declined to discuss specific instances beyond the NSA case, saying he did not want to give hackers ideas for avoiding detection.

“Sometimes we are able to catch cyber criminals, that’s why I am not so comfortable to speak about this to media,” he said in the interview. “Many of them are very clever, they can learn from what I am saying.”

Other industry experts called the practice improper. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at Finnish security company F-Secure, said that when his firm’s software finds a document that might contain dangerous code, “it will prompt the user or the administrator and ask if it can upload a copy to us.”

Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security firm Trail of Bits, which has performed audits on security software, said Kaspersky’s practices point to a larger issue with all antivirus software.

“All of them aggregate a huge amount of information about their clients, which can be easily exploited when put in willing hands,” he said.

U.S. news organizations have reported that Kaspersky, or Russian spies hijacking its service, have been searching widely among customers’ computers for secret files, citing anonymous U.S. intelligence officials. Reuters has not verified such reports.

Kaspersky said he hoped to alleviate concerns about his company by opening up his source code for review by third parties in independently run centers, as well as by raising the maximum amount it offers for information about security flaws in its programs to $100,000.

Damrey reached land at 4 a.m. local time (2100 GMT on Friday) with winds gusting at up to 90 kmph (56 mph) that tore off more than 1,000 roofs, knocked down hundreds of electricity poles and uprooted trees.

At least 12 people were missing and over 370 houses had collapsed, the Communist state’s search and rescue committee said. Over 33,000 people had been evacuated.

The government earlier said six ships had capsized with 61 people on board in the South China Sea and that 25 people had been rescued, but gave no details as to the possible fate of the others.

The storm made landfall near the city of Nha Trang, which is around 500 km (310 miles) south of the coastal city of Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place next week.

There were reports of high winds and rain in Danang, but no immediate reports of casualties. The city will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10 as well as China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing area of the world’s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. Traders had expected the storm to delay harvesting, but were not sure whether it would damage the crop.

The government said more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations. More than 40 flights were cancelled.

Punjab National Bank (PNB), the second-biggest state lender, reported a better-than-expected second quarter profit on Friday of 5.61 billion rupees, with additions to bad loans 42 percent less than the first quarter.

Union Bank of India, the sixth-biggest state lender, reported a surprise 15.31 billion-rupee loss in the three months to Sept. 30, mainly due to front-loading of provisions for bankruptcy cases but additional bad loans dropped 40 percent on the previous quarter.

Uco Bank, a smaller state-run lender that also reported second-quarter results, saw its net loss widening to 6.23 billion rupees.

State-run lenders account for the bulk of India’s 9.5 trillion rupees in soured bank loans as of June. The surge in bad loans has choked new lending in an economy which needs more investment to help spur growth.

The central bank has ordered commercial lenders to take 12 of the biggest loan defaulters, accounting for about a quarter of the sector’s non-performing loans, to bankruptcy proceedings.

It has ordered nearly 30 more firms to be pushed to bankruptcy if other forms of debt resolution do not work out by mid-December.

A $32 billion recapitalisation plan announced by the Indian government last month has given a lifeline to the 21 state-run banks, whose profitability is lower than the private lenders but they have higher capital requirements due to bigger loan books.

Sunil Mehta, chief executive of New Delhi-based PNB, said the recapitalisation announcement “boosted the morale” of bankers and said the bank would boost credit growth.

Ram Sangapure, a PNB executive director, said the bank aimed to increase loans at 11 percent in the full year to end-March, up from the 8.3 percent rise in domestic loans in the second quarter.

Union Bank Chief Executive Rajkiran Rai G said his bank would aim for loan growth of 10 percent in the 2017/2018 fiscal year. He said higher provisions would be a drag in this and the next quarter but saw a return to profitability from March.

The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders to make minimum 50 percent provisioning by March on loans to firms in bankruptcy.

PNB said it was ahead of requirements.

For 65 billion rupees in bad debts held by 20 of the firms that could face bankruptcy proceedings from December, much of the provisioning has yet to be done, officials said.

Union Bank has 74 billion rupees in loans to companies in bankruptcy and 47 billion rupees to those in the second list, CEO Rai said, adding they have 55 percent provision cover for the first list of loans and 30 percent for the second.

One recall covers 670,000 2006-2011 U.S. 3-Series vehicles to address a wiring issue for heating and air conditioning systems that may overheat and could increase the risk of a fire.

The second recall covers 740,000 U.S. 2007-2011 vehicles with a valve heater that could rust and lead to a fire in rare cases. The recall includes some 128i vehicles, 3-Series, 5-Series and X3, X5 and Z4 vehicles.

BMW spokesman Michael Rebstock said the recalls overlap and cover about 1 million vehicles, nearly all in the United States and about 15,000 in Canada. He said the recalls may be expanded.

“We are examining whether it will be necessary in the future to widen this (recall) into other countries,” he said.

BMW said both recalls followed recent meetings with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

In the heating and air conditioning recall, BMW told NHTSA it first got a report of an incident in 2008 involving heat- related damage to a 2006 3-Series sedan, but did not determine a root cause. The automaker continued to monitor additional field incidents in the following years.

In 2011, BMW made a quality improvement to the blower-regulator wiring harness.

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

Qualcomm, which has been fighting a legal battle on many fronts with Apple Inc, said revenue from areas other than smartphones was more than $3 billion in its latest fiscal year, up more than 25 percent from last year.

Revenue from Qualcomm’s chip unit, which supplies both Android smartphone makers and Apple, rose 13 percent in the latest quarter. Licensing revenue, which includes royalties mostly from Apple, sank 36 percent.

Reuters reported earlier this week that Apple would drop the Qualcomm’s chips altogether from its iPhones and iPads from next year, the latest salvo in a longstanding dispute between the two companies.

Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and of refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm also sued some Apple contract manufacturers in April over royalty payments and is trying to ban the sale of iPhones in China.

“We really try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple ... (and) we do have a lot of engagement with the company and we do speak in our engage on a daily basis with them across multiple areas,” Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call.

Qualcomm continues to exclude from its forecast revenue related to the sale of Apple products by the iPhone maker’s contract manufacturers as well as the another licensee in dispute.

It forecast current-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and adjusted earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents per share.

Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.90 billion and a profit of 90 cents per share, per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

While Qualcomm and Apple would be better off with each other, Qualcomm will do just fine even if that’s not the case, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said.

Qualcomm also reported better-than expected profit and sales for the fourth quarter, despite earnings tumbling nearly 90 percent due to a $778 million charge related to a fine imposed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission for anti-trust violations.

The company' adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share beat estimates of 81 cents. Revenue fell 4.5 percent to $5.91 billion, but topped estimates of $5.80 billion. (bit.ly/2z5MwMB)

The deal with Brookfield hinged on Reliance Communications or RCom merging its mobile operations with rival Aircel but the merger was called off last month due to regulatory delays and legal uncertainties.

Brookfield said it is still pursuing RCom and other opportunities in this sector to scale its presence in India.

RCom, led by billionaire Anil Ambani, had 443 billion Indian rupees ($6.86 billion) of net debt as of March making it the most leveraged among listed Indian telecom companies.

The debt load has spooked investors, sending RCom’s shares tumbling this year amid worries about whether it could pay back creditors at a time when profits across the sector are slumping due to stiff competition.

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc T.N..

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.” He said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with “significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

Legal experts also said earlier this year that it was difficult to predict whether the current administration would be more receptive of a deal.

Four soldiers from each nation were killed when a joint patrol was attacked on Oct. 4 by dozens of militants with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.

The incident drew attention to the little-known U.S. military presence in Niger at a time when many Americans are weary of U.S. involvement in conflicts abroad and Nigeriens are chafing at the growing presence of foreign troops on their soil.

The United States has 800 soldiers operating in the largely desert West African nation, more than France, which has 4,000 in the wider Sahel trying to tackle Islamist militancy. The main U.S. base in Africa is in Djibouti, which supports about 4,000 personnel.

A Pentagon investigation into the incident, led by a two-star general from U.S. Africa Command, may take weeks. The Pentagon says it has not settled on any final version of events.

Through interviews in Niger’s capital Niamey and Washington, Reuters has tried to piece together the events of Oct. 3 to Oct. 6, when the last U.S. soldier’s body was recovered.

Accounts by Nigerien and American officials differ over the mission’s objectives, and whether and how they may have changed.

The one consistent thread is that they appear to have been woefully unprepared for their enemy.

“CONSIDERED SAFE”

U.S. and Niger officials agree that on Oct. 3, 12 U.S. Special Forces and 30 Nigeriens left Niamey and headed north to the Mali border. Twenty six similar patrols had taken place in the area in the past six months without enemy contact, the Pentagon said.

After that, the stories of the two sides diverge.

“It was an intelligence mission but also a mission of an operational nature,” Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum told Reuters in an interview. “It was in a zone that was considered safe, not enemy territory.”

Specifically, the mission aimed to detain and question a suspected recruiter for Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, an Islamic State affiliate, according to a senior Nigerien security source with knowledge of the operation and two mid-level government sources, all of whom declined to be named.

The senior source said the mission was thought low enough risk that they had no armored vehicles or body armor.

U.S. officials vehemently contradict this account.

“The service members involved in this unfortunate incident were unequivocally not directed to do a ‘kill or capture mission’. They were on a reconnaissance mission,” the Pentagon said in statement sent to Reuters on Thursday. It said it would provide more details once the investigation is complete.

All three Nigerien sources said the target was a mid-ranking commander called Doundou Chefou who was recruiting disgruntled youths from the Fulani ethnic group along Niger-Mali border.

Chefou commanded Islamic State fighters affiliated to the movement led by an Arabic-speaking north African called Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, the Nigerien sources said.

According to the senior Nigerien security official, the team initially sought Chefou out near a remote border village on Oct. 3. They found a militant camp there but no fighters, he said.

After that, Nigerien intelligence officials on the team received fresh orders from their headquarters to pursue him in the village of Tongo Tongo, so they stayed the night nearby, the official said.

Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while it is true the team was given an additional task mid-mission, it was never in pursuit of a militant.

SECOND TEAM

The U.S. officials said their soldiers were asked to work with the Nigerien troops to be on standby to help a second U.S. military team whose mission was indeed to pursue a militant. That mission was called off, however. It is unclear when or why.

“Did the mission change? That’s one of the questions being asked. I can’t tell you definitively the answer to that question,” General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month.

The U.S. officials said the first team was asked to gather intelligence on the militant. The Americans could do this under U.S. military rules of engagement that allow American forces to accompany partner forces only when the chances of enemy contact are “unlikely.”

Asked about the existence of a second mission, none of the Nigerien sources were aware of it.

U.S. and Nigerien officials agree the team was ambushed after they met local leaders in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4.

One of the Nigerien government sources said the militants first came with just a few gunmen with AK47s on motorbikes to slow them down, and later brought out heavier 12.7mm machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.

That might explain why the team took an hour to call for help - one of the issues that has most disturbed senior Pentagon officials - because the initial attack may have only involved light arms.

A few minutes after the team called for air support, a surveillance drone appeared, providing a live feed, but it took another hour before French military aircraft arrived. They were unable to drop bombs because of how close the fighting was, diplomatic sources have said.

One U.S. official said at least some of the four U.S. soldiers killed were then separated from the convoy. They included Sergeant La David T. Johnson, whose body was not recovered for two days. It is unclear why.

U.S. PRESENCE LIKELY TO GROW

It is unlikely the United States will back away from Niger because of its central location in the Sahel and because of the proliferation of militant groups around it, including Nigeria’s Islamic State-linked Boko Haram and al-Qaeda affiliates.

Several current and former U.S. officials with Africa experience said they expected U.S. military focus on the Sahel to grow, not decrease.

Retired general Donald Bolduc, who led U.S. special operations in Africa until June, said the military should retain a small “footprint” in Africa but needed more intelligence and surveillance resources and medical and air support.

While the most assets have gone to the Middle East and Afghanistan, “there needs to be ... a different perspective on how we allocate the resources between theaters,” he said.

He expressed surprise at the idea that the unit which was ambushed had been redirected to focus on a militant leader.

Senior militant leaders are normally well protected, Bolduc said, with rings of security guards and layers of militants who communicate with one another via radio.

“I‘m as confused about it as you are,” he said. “That’s not how it’s done. ... The resources and planning didn’t seem to be there for that kind of operation.”","A month on, U.S., Niger still disagree on what happened on fatal mission",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D408J-OZATP

Use of social media and mobile instant messaging services has exploded in Afghanistan over recent years. Social media users and civil rights groups reacted with outrage to initial reports of the move and the letter sent by telecoms regulator ATRA was widely shared on social media.

Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the move had been ordered by the National Directorate for Security to thwart the use of the encrypted messaging services by the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.

The acting minister for telecommunications, Shahzad Aryobee, posted a message on Facebook saying that the telecoms regulator had been ordered to put a gradual block on the services to improve their functioning after complaints had been received.

“The government is committed to freedom of speech and knows that it is a basic civil right for our people,” he wrote.

The letter by telecoms regulator ATRA, dated Nov. 1 and signed by an official of the regulator, directed internet companies to block Telegram and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) WhatsApp services “without delay” for a period of 20 days.

However, the service worked normally this week and still appeared to be working normally on Saturday on both state-owned operator Salaam and private service providers.

On Friday, there were reports of interruptions but it was not clear whether they were caused by a deliberate shutdown or by the unrelated issues with WhatsApp services that were experienced in several countries.

Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage.

WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own.

The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number “in case WhatsApp is not working”.","Afghanistan moves to block WhatsApp, Telegram messaging services",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-moves-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-messaging-services-idUSKBN1D4071

Parliament’s Treasury Committee wrote to him last month to seek confirmation that “all efforts” were being made to boost diversity among the Bank’s top brass.

Silvana Tenreyro of the Monetary Policy Committee and Sandy Boss of the Prudential Regulation Committee are the only women among the 23 people serving on the BoE’s main three policy panels.

The Treasury Committee’s criticism of Hammond was written before he announced on Thursday that banker Elisabeth Stheeman will join the Financial Policy Committee early next year.

Hammond had said he was content that the finance ministry’s processes for hiring top BoE staff met the standards set by a government adviser on public appointments.

“The (Treasury) Committee is disappointed by the chancellor’s response,” said Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee and a former minister for women and equalities.

“He did not confirm whether ‘all efforts’ are being made by the Treasury to encourage as diverse a range of candidates as possible,” she added, saying the finance ministry only “seeks to encourage” diversity in its appointments.

Asked about diversity in a BBC news interview on Thursday, Carney said the BoE was looking to lead by example.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California.

Mobile phone services have been one of the big success stories in Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted from power by a U.S.-led campaign in 2001, but there are also frequent complaints from users about quality and coverage.

WhatsApp and similar services, including Facebook Messenger and Viber, are widely used by Afghan politicians and members of the government as well as by the Taliban, which has a sophisticated social media operation of its own.

The movement’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote to reporters this week giving his Viber number “in case WhatsApp is not working”.","Afghanistan moves to block WhatsApp, Telegram messaging services",https://in.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-internet/afghanistan-moves-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-messaging-services-idINKBN1D4072

Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year.

Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad.

Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term.

Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier.

That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF.

A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent.

Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September.

Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it.

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year.

The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs.

FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY

Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002.

It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis.

But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion.

Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates.

Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.

But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest.

Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies.

Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3.

Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).","Hurricanes, earthquake drag down third-quarter profit at Buffett's Berkshire",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D32F4-OCABS

Since the start of October, at least 35 U.S. companies have cited currency “benefits” or “tailwinds” and “weaker dollar” for boosting quarterly earnings, compared with few mentions a year ago, and some see that extending to the fourth quarter, a Reuters analysis shows.

“The quarter was one where the dollar weakened over the course of the quarter, more so than analysts expected,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

“That’s what’s in part been helping multinationals,” Carey Hall said. “They have seen some of the strongest results so far.”

The U.S. dollar index’s .DXY average in the third quarter fell from its year-ago level by about 2.5 percent, the weakest showing since 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The index has recovered from its recent lows, but remains down about 7 percent for the year.

U.S.-based multinational companies can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.

Among companies citing a positive dollar impact were Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and other names in technology, which has the highest percentage of foreign sales within the S&P 500.

Others included Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N), W.R. Grace (GRA.N), Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), which said the third quarter was the first in 13 that a weaker dollar boosted the company’s earnings, by about 1 percentage point.

“And we’re expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates,” Xerox Chief Financial Officer William Osbourn said in the company’s Oct. 26 conference call after it reported higher-than-expected results.

The weaker dollar “should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that’s a good sign,” Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told investors Oct. 17.

The dollar’s weakness has helped offset the impact of a trio of hurricanes that took a heavy toll on companies in the third quarter. If the benefit continues, it could help companies hit the 11.7 percent profit gains analysts have projected for the fourth quarter.

With results in from more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies, third-quarter profit growth is estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 4.3 percent three weeks ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Much of the improvement has come with stronger-than-expected technology results. Ninety percent of S&P technology index .SPLRCT names are beating earnings expectations, while 72 percent are surpassing estimates in the overall S&P 500, the data shows.

Materials companies’ earnings, which have benefited from higher commodity prices tied to the weaker dollar, have had a high percentage of beats as well.

Adding to the weaker dollar’s benefit has been better global economic strength, and that is also why multinational companies have performed better than others this earnings season, Carey Hall said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 16.7 percent for the third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Stocks of big multinationals also have outperformed, with the Dow Jones global titans index .DJGT up about 3.3 percent since Oct. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is up just 0.2 percent since then.

“It’s not so much the dollar is a windfall for them; it’s no longer a headwind, so that’s positive, and outlooks for companies have been generally upbeat,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.",U.S. dollar enters center stage for earnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/u-s-dollar-enters-center-stage-for-earnings-idUSKBN1D32CQ

Not all of the allegations have been verified and some are in preliminary assessment phase, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric in a press briefing. During the three month period, 14 investigations have been launched and one case has been proven, he said.

Of the 31 cases, 12 involve military personnel from peacekeeping operations including those in the Central African Republic and Mali.

The majority of the civilian staff cases, 15, involve the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Three cases involve the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and one the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

UNHCR and UNICEF did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside office hours. IOM was not immediately available outside office hours.

For decades, media and U.N. reports have exposed sexual exploitation and abuse by civilian and military U.N. personnel in places from Haiti to Darfur, with operations in the Central African Republic most recently in the headlines.

The new type of data collection that began in January, Dujarric said, is part of a U.N. initiative to increase transparency with regards to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse.

“We’re seeing allegations that date back a few years,” he said, because “people feel freer and safer to come forward.”

The U.N. has deployed victims rights advocates in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti.

A dozen of the reported alleged cases happened in 2017, two last year and six more in 2015 or prior. Eleven have no known date, Dujarric said.

The 36-year-old had been due to retire last season but was recalled by the Williams team after Valtteri Bottas left for Mercedes following the surprise retirement of 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg.

After an emotional send-off in Brazil last year, Massa was back in the cockpit a few months later.

“As you know, last year I decided to announce my retirement in Formula One but because of the Williams request I decided to do another season,” the former Ferrari driver said in a video message posted on social media.

“But this time will be my last race in Brazil of Formula One and my last race in Abu Dhabi,” he added, thanking his family, fans and sponsors and making clear he was not retiring from racing entirely.

“I really hope that you can support me next year or maybe in the future in other races and in other categories,” he said.

Williams have yet to announce their 2018 lineup, with several candidates in the frame including Poland’s Robert Kubica. Canadian rookie teenager Lance Stroll is sure to stay, however.

Massa won 11 races with Ferrari and finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton, now a four-times world champion, by a single point in the 2008 season.

His last victory was at the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he won new fans for his dignified and sporting response when Hamilton seized the title by taking fifth place on the last corner of the last lap.

In 2009, he suffered a severe head injury and was in a coma for several days after being hit on the helmet in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying by a spring shed from the Brawn of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.

Massa joined Williams in 2014, helping the former champions to take third place in the constructors’ championship that year and in 2015.

“It has been an absolute pleasure to work with him,” said deputy principal Claire Williams in a team statement.

”We are especially grateful that he agreed to postpone his retirement from Formula One for a year, after Valtteri joined Mercedes, which demonstrated the depth of the relationship we built during our time together.

Questionado se “tinha consciência de que é um presidenciável”, Meirelles respondeu que sim.

“Sim, sou presidenciável. As pessoas falam comigo, me procuram, mas ninguém me cobra uma definição. No mundo político, por exemplo, dizem o seguinte: o senhor tem o meu apoio, estou torcendo para isso”, disse o ministro, completando, no entanto, que é “pé no chão” e não fará nada “baseado no entusiasmo”.

“Tenho consciência de que o importante agora é fazer meu trabalho aqui no Ministério da Fazenda. Fazer um trabalho sério e entregar resultados. O futuro é outra coisa. Vamos aguardar”, disse.

O nome de Meirelles tem surgido consistentemente como presidenciável, inclusive dentro do Palácio do Planalto. Fontes já admitiram à Reuters que, se a economia confirmar o crescimento e o ministro da Fazenda se transformar em uma opção concreta, pode ter o apoio do PMDB em 2018.

Em todas as conversas, no entanto, Meirelles adia a decisão. Na entrevista à revista Veja, o ministro lembra que passou por situação semelhante em 2010, quando foi convidado pelo ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva a ser vice de Dilma Rousseff. E que só tomou uma decisão na última semana. 0

“O fato de ter tomado a decisão no dia 31 de março é porque esperei o momento certo. Parei, pensei e decidi tranquilamente. Agora, terei que tomar uma decisão desse tipo novamente”, explicou.

Se for candidato, Meirelles precisa deixar o cargo, de acordo com a lei eleitoral, até seis meses antes das eleições, na primeira semana de abril de 2018.

O ministro admite ainda acreditar que o cenário é favorável para um candidato com o seu perfil, “reformista” e que a situação econômica seria um ativo. Frente à insistência do entrevistador sobre uma definição, disse que é uma questão de “oportunidade e destino”.

“Eu tenho que analisar tudo isso: a situação econômica, que é o ativo, as condições políticas do momento e a minha própria disposição”, afirmou, lembrando que uma candidatura tem grandes custos. “Vou ter que deixar o ministério e deixar o trabalho ainda por um período de decolagem da economia e entrar em um processo que é outra história. Agora, acho que essas situações vão se definir naturalmente não só na economia como na política. Não é só meramente uma decisão do tipo ‘eu vou porque eu quero’”.

Meirelles disse ainda acreditar que a política social será o centro das eleições em 2018. Ao ser perguntado sobre o embate que teve como senadores do PT em uma audiência no Senado, afirmou ter se “sentido como candidato”.

“A campanha será pautada na política social. Estou preparado para enfrentar esse discurso populista do PT. Diria até que estou acostumado, pois já tive embates com o PT que eram exatamente iguais quando era presidente do Banco Central no governo Lula”, afirmou.",Meirelles admite à Veja que seu nome é cotado para Presidência da República,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1D22YL-OBRDN

Fredericks, a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) who won four silver medals at the 1992 and 1996 Games, is suspected of receiving bribes and laundering the money through Paris, the source said.

He appeared before a French magistrate late on Thursday.

Fredericks is already being investigated by the global Athletics Integrity Unit over payments he received from Papa Massata Diack, the son of former world athletics chief Lamine Diack, on the day Rio won the vote to host the 2016 Olympics.

“We have just been informed of the decision by the French judge,” an IOC spokesperson said. “The CECO (Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer) will look into the file, which is not yet available, and report to the Ethics Commission, which is meeting on Monday.”

“Like with any procedure, the right to be heard has to be respected.”

Fredericks also sat on the IAAF Council, world athletics’ governing body, until he was suspended in July pending the outcome of the Integrity Unit probe.

The athlete has previously rejected allegations of corruption, saying that a payment of $300,000 to his company was recompense for legitimate work.

The Integrity Unit on Friday confirmed that it was still investigating Fredericks and that he remained suspended.

Fredericks stepped down in March as head of the IOC team evaluating bids to host the 2024 Olympics, and from an IAAF task force investigating doping allegations in Russia.

Rio was awarded the games in 2009, beating Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid.

Last month, the IOC suspended the head of Brazil’s national Olympic committee, Carlos Nuzman, after he was charged in Brazil with racketeering in connection with alleged vote buying to win the Games for Rio.

House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he has asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to assess Trump’s suggestion and indicated some lawmakers were considering it.

Other lawmakers have expressed concern. They said adding such a divisive provision would expose the tax bill to the fierce opposition that doomed Republicans’ efforts in July to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.

The act was former President Barack Obama’s biggest domestic achievement. It raised taxes on wealthier Americans to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income people, extending coverage to millions of previously uninsured. Democrats have defended it for years from attacks by Republicans, who see it as Washington intruding on Americans’ healthcare.

Since Trump took power in January, he has pressed hard to undo much of Obama’s work. So far he has not secured any major legislative accomplishments in Congress, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate.

“The president feels very strongly about including this (the individual mandate repeal) at some step before the final process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Brady told an event hosted by the news outlet Politico.

“No decisions have been made ... Importing healthcare into a tax reform debate has consequences,” Brady said.

Trump broached his idea in a tweet earlier this week, saying it would be “great” to repeal the mandate “and use those savings for further tax cuts.” Some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton and Rand Paul, also favor this idea.

Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said Friday that adding on a mandate repeal could cost the tax bill votes. “I don’t want to overload the vehicle,” Cole told reporters, adding that including the mandate repeal would probably be a “deal breaker” for Democrats.

Brady also said Friday he would offer “substantive improvements” to the tax bill when his committee begins considering the legislation next week. He gave no details.

1/TRUMP ON TOUR

U.S. President Donald Trump embarks on his first trip to Asia in the coming week, stopping in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention, but investors will also look at trade talks, with Trump particularly keen to address his country’s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional, but which he calls “horrible”.

There is also the first deluge of data since last month’s People’s Party Congress in China. Import and loan growth figures will be particularly closely watched.

A weakening of the former would point to domestic demand finally flagging, while an acceleration of loan growth would show borrowers are finding ways around tighter new lending rules.

2/BALLISTIC BITCOIN

Investors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds. The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.

But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion? What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency - of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity - from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice? With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.

At the moment, the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1, hovering in a range close to the all-time peak of 2.12 hit in July 2015.

It all comes following strong recent U.S GDP data and after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives released plans on Thursday for a tax overhaul they believe will help lift the economy.

Italy’s biggest banks, including UniCredit (CRDI.MI), Intesa (ISP.MI) and Banco BPM (BAMI.MI), report their latest earnings and they could make encouraging reading following the euro zone-wide pick-up in growth and a strong rally in Italian debt over the last month.

It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance .SX7E in 2017, so the results round should be telling.

5/ VENEZUELA RESTRUCTURING

After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.

Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.

Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

Präsident Nicolas Maduro kündigte am Donnerstag Pläne für eine Umstrukturierung der Verbindlichkeiten an. Damit riskiert das Land die größte Staatspleite Lateinamerikas seit dem Zahlungsausfall Argentiniens im Jahr 2001. Argentinien war seinerzeit über Jahre von den internationalen Finanzmärkten abgeschnitten. Nun wachsen die Befürchtungen, dass Venezuela ein ähnliches Schicksal droht.

Das Opec-Land ist auf Gedeih und Verderb von der Ölproduktion abhängig, für die der Staatskonzern PDVSA verantwortlich ist. In den Jahren des Ölbooms legte Maduros Vorgänger Hugo Chavez großzügige Sozialprogramme auf und lieh Milliarden an der Wall Street. Doch dann rauschten ab 2014 die Ölpreise in den Keller. Die Ölindustrie leidet zudem unter einem gewaltigen Investitionsmangel, der die Förderung beeinträchtigt. Venezuela brachen die Einnahmen weg. Es fehlt vielerorts an Nahrungsmitteln und Medikamenten. Hinzu kommt eine gigantische Inflation. Seit der Parlamentswahl 2015 steckt das Land in einer politischen Krise. Zwischen Regierung und Opposition tobt ein erbitterter Machtkampf. Bei Unruhen kamen Dutzende Menschen ums Leben.

“KAMPF GEGEN FINANZIELLE SCHIKANIERUNG”

Bislang konnten sich die Gläubiger darauf verlassen, dass Regierung und PDVSA ihre Schulden fristgerecht beglichen. Doch nun signalisierte Maduro eine Wende. Er versprach zwar, dass eine aktuell fällig werdende Anleihe über 1,1 Milliarden Dollar zurückgezahlt werde. Zugleich ernannte der Präsident aber eine Kommission, die unter Leitung seines Vize Tareck El Aissami eine “Restrukturierung aller künftigen Zahlungen” in Angriff nehmen soll. Maduro rief zum “Kampf gegen die finanzielle Schikanierung unseres Landes” auf. Sein Zorn gilt insbesondere US-Präsident Donald Trump. Die Vereinigten Staaten werfen Maduro Korruption und den Aufbau einer Diktatur vor und haben deswegen Sanktionen verhängt, die auch die Geldversorgung Venezuelas schwächen.

Dies ist aus Expertensicht auch ein zentrales Problem für Bemühungen zur Umschuldung. Denn die Sanktionen hindern US-Banken daran, entsprechende Vereinbarungen auszuhandeln. Sollte die Regierung auf eigene Faust eine Umstrukturierung der Verbindlichkeiten verfügen, liefe dies auf einen Zahlungsausfall hinaus, sagte Asdrubal Oliveros vom Analysehaus Ecoanalitica in Caracas. Kollege Jorge Piedrahita vom New Yorker Finanzdienstleister Gear Capital Partners ergänzte: “Ich glaube nicht, dass sie die Probleme durchdacht haben.” Einer Umschuldung würden überdies die Investoren nur zustimmen auf Basis eines Plans, der eine Ablösung der sozialistischen Planwirtschaft durch eine funktionierende Marktwirtschaft vorsehe.

ZAHLUNGSAUSFALL KAUM ZU VERMEIDEN

Die Regierung und die Ölgesellschaft PDVSA müssen bis Ende des Jahres 1,6 Milliarden Dollar an Zins und Tilgung zahlen. Im kommenden Jahr stehen weitere neun Milliarden Dollar an. Als nächstes muss PDVSA 81 Millionen Dollar begleichen. Die Anleihe war bereits am 12. Oktober fällig, doch das Unternehmen schob die Zahlung auf im Rahmen einer Schonfrist von 30 Tagen. Wenn das Geld dann nicht fließen sollte, würde dies nach Darstellung von Investoren einen Zahlungsausfall auslösen.

Zu diesem Schritt wird es Experten zufolge früher oder später mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit kommen. “Ein Zahlungsausfall ist angesichts des desolaten Zustandes des Ölsektors und der übrigen Wirtschaft eigentlich kaum mehr zu vermeiden”, konstatierten die Analysten der Landesbank LBBW. Weitreichende Konsequenzen rund um den Globus sind demnach nicht zu erwarten: “Die Auswirkungen einer möglichen Schuldenrestrukturierung in Venezuela sollten weder an den internationalen Finanzmärkten noch in der Weltwirtschaft zu stärkeren Turbulenzen führen.”",Venezuela will Schuldenumbau - Märkte fürchten Staatspleite,https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-schulden-idDEKBN1D31QB

Since the start of October, at least 35 U.S. companies have cited currency “benefits” or “tailwinds” and “weaker dollar” for boosting quarterly earnings, compared with few mentions a year ago, and some see that extending to the fourth quarter, a Reuters analysis shows.

“The quarter was one where the dollar weakened over the course of the quarter, more so than analysts expected,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

“That’s what’s in part been helping multinationals,” Carey Hall said. “They have seen some of the strongest results so far.”

The U.S. dollar index’s .DXY average in the third quarter fell from its year-ago level by about 2.5 percent, the weakest showing since 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The index has recovered from its recent lows, but remains down about 7 percent for the year.

U.S.-based multinational companies can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.

Among companies citing a positive dollar impact were Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and other names in technology, which has the highest percentage of foreign sales within the S&P 500.

Others included Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N), W.R. Grace (GRA.N), Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), which said the third quarter was the first in 13 that a weaker dollar boosted the company’s earnings, by about 1 percentage point.

“And we’re expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates,” Xerox Chief Financial Officer William Osbourn said in the company’s Oct. 26 conference call after it reported higher-than-expected results.

The weaker dollar “should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that’s a good sign,” Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told investors Oct. 17.

The dollar’s weakness has helped offset the impact of a trio of hurricanes that took a heavy toll on companies in the third quarter. If the benefit continues, it could help companies hit the 11.7 percent profit gains analysts have projected for the fourth quarter.

With results in from more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies, third-quarter profit growth is estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 4.3 percent three weeks ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Much of the improvement has come with stronger-than-expected technology results. Ninety percent of S&P technology index .SPLRCT names are beating earnings expectations, while 72 percent are surpassing estimates in the overall S&P 500, the data shows.

Materials companies’ earnings, which have benefited from higher commodity prices tied to the weaker dollar, have had a high percentage of beats as well.

Adding to the weaker dollar’s benefit has been better global economic strength, and that is also why multinational companies have performed better than others this earnings season, Carey Hall said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 16.7 percent for the third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Stocks of big multinationals also have outperformed, with the Dow Jones global titans index .DJGT up about 3.3 percent since Oct. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is up just 0.2 percent since then.

“It’s not so much the dollar is a windfall for them; it’s no longer a headwind, so that’s positive, and outlooks for companies have been generally upbeat,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.",U.S. dollar enters center stage for earnings,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/u-s-dollar-enters-center-stage-for-earnings-idUSKBN1D32CQ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security.

Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days.

In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year.

Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.

Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump’s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT).

En route to Hawaii’s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump’s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.",Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia/trump-heads-to-japan-with-north-korea-on-his-mind-idUSKBN1D4061?il=0

On Wednesday Ratner sued Melanie Kohler accusing her of “deliberately false and malicious accusations” in a post on Facebook, and said her statement had caused him personal and professional injury, according to the complaint filed in U.S. district court in Hawaii and seen by Reuters.

Ratner and his attorney, Marty Singer, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Kohler’s spokesman Bill Burton said in a telephone interview that Kohler, who lives in Hawaii where the lawsuit was filed, had deleted the post.

Burton emailed Reuters a copy of Kohler’s Facebook post.

It was consistent with court documents that said, “Commencing on or about October 20, 2017, Defendant recklessly and/or intentionally posted a statement on her Facebook page claiming that ‘Brett Ratner raped [her],’ Ratner ‘was a rapist on at least one night in Hollywood about 12 years ago,’ and Ratner ‘preyed on me as a drunk girl [and] forced himself upon me.'”

The lawsuit requested a jury trial to determine damages and costs.

“We are concerned at the detention conditions that Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in Egypt,” a joint statement published on the British government website said late on Friday.

Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances on Sept. 10.

Members of Metwaly’s group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention.

Asked about the case, two judicial sources told Reuters that Metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination.

Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation.

La empresa, Southern Nevada Donor Services, ofrecía a las familias afligidas una forma de eliminar los elevados gastos funerarios: incineración gratuita a cambio de donar los órganos del cuerpo de tus seres queridos para “estudios médicos avanzados”.

Fuera del almacén de Southern Nevada, las circunstancias distaban de ser reconfortantes. En otoño de 2015, los vecinos comenzaron a quejarse sobre un misterioso hedor y unas cajas ensangrentadas en un contenedor de basura. Ese diciembre, según muestras de los registros sanitarios locales, alguien había contactado con las autoridades para informar de actividades extrañas en el patio.

Los inspectores sanitarios encontraron a un hombre vestido con bata médica que sujetaba una manguera de jardinería. Estaba, al sol del mediodía, derritiendo el hielo del torso de un hombre congelado.

Mientras el hombre rociaba los restos, “trozos de tejidos y sangre caían por el desagüe”, rezaba el informe de uno de los inspectores. El riachuelo pasaba por delante de las tiendas y se estancaba cerca de una escuela técnica.

Southern Nevada, descubrieron los inspectores, son “comerciantes de cuerpos”, una compañía que adquiere cadáveres, los disecciona y los vende en piezas, con ánimo de lucro, a investigadores médicos, academias médicas y otros compradores. El torso tumbado en la camilla lo estaba preparando para una de estas ventas.

Cada año, miles de estadounidenses donan sus cuerpos con la creencia de que contribuyen a la ciencia. De hecho, muchos contribuyen involuntariamente con la materia prima de un amplio mercado nacional no regulado.

Los comerciantes de cuerpos también son conocidos como “bancos de tejidos no-trasplantables”. Son diferentes del sector de trasplante de órganos y tejidos que el gobierno de EEUU regula minuciosamente. Vender corazones, riñones y tendones para su trasplante es ilegal. Pero ninguna ley federal rige la venta de cadáveres o partes del cuerpo para su uso en investigación o educación. Pocas leyes estatales plantean supervisión al respecto y casi cualquier persona, independientemente de su experiencia, puede diseccionar y vender fragmentos de un cuerpo humano.

“La situación actual es la ley de la selva”, dijo Angela McArthur, que dirige el programa de donación de cuerpos en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Médica de Minnesota y ha presidido la comisión de donación anatómica de su estado. “Vemos problemas similares a lo que vimos con los ladrones de tumbas de hace siglos” indicó, refiriéndose a la práctica del siglo XIX de obtener cadáveres con un procedimiento que violaba la dignidad de los fallecidos.

“Creo que cualquier cosa que diga se queda corta” dijo McArthur. “Lo que están haciendo es sacar provecho de la venta de humanos”.

El modelo de negocio de esta industria depende del acceso a una gran cantidad de cuerpos, a menudo procedentes de población pobre. A cambio de un cuerpo, los comerciantes suelen cremar una parte del donante sin cobrar. Al ofrecer la cremación gratuita, dicen algunos veteranos del sector, los intermediarios atraen a las familias de bajos ingresos que son más vulnerables. Muchos han agotado sus ahorros pagando el tratamiento médico de un ser querido y no pueden permitirse un funeral tradicional.

“Las personas con medios económicos tienen la oportunidad de debatir las cuestiones morales, éticas y espirituales sobre qué método elegir”, dijo Dawn Vander Kolk, un trabajador social de cuidados paliativos de Illinois. “Pero quienes no tienen dinero, pueden terminar con una opción de último recurso: la donación de cadáveres”.

La escasa normativa supone escasas consecuencias cuando los cuerpos son maltratados. En el caso de Southern Nevada, las autoridades descubrieron que podían hacer poco, más allá de una pequeña citación por contaminación a uno de los trabajadores involucrados. El operario de Southern Nevada Joe Collazo, quien no fue citado, dijo que lamentaba el incidente. También dijo que la industria se beneficiaría si hubiera más supervisión que ofrezca tranquilidad a los donantes, intermediarios e investigadores.

“Siendo honesto contigo, creo que tendría que existir una regulación”, expresó Collazo. “Hay una zona gris demasiado amplia”.

“UN GRAN MERCADO DE CADÁVERES”

Los cuerpos donados desempeñan un papel esencial en la educación médica, la formación y la investigación. Los cadáveres y partes del cuerpo se utilizan para enseñar a estudiantes de medicina, médicos, enfermeras y dentistas. Los cirujanos dicen que ningún maniquí o simulación virtual puede reproducir la respuesta táctil y la experiencia emocional que aporta practicar con partes del cuerpo humano. Los médicos de urgencias, por ejemplo, usan cabezas y torsos humanos para aprender cómo insertar tubos de respiración.

Los investigadores dependen de partes del cuerpo donadas para desarrollar nuevos instrumentos quirúrgicos, técnicas e implantes; y para crear nuevos medicamentos y tratamientos para enfermedades.

“La necesidad de cuerpos humanos es absolutamente vital”, dijo el médico de Chicago Armand Krikorian, expresidente de la Federación Estadounidense de Investigación Médica. Citó una reciente cura potencial para la diabetes tipo 1 desarrollada mediante el estudio del páncreas de los donantes. “Es un tipo de tratamiento que nunca habría salido a la luz si no hubiéramos recibido la donación de un cuerpo entero”, dijo

Pese al importante papel de la industria en la medicina, no existe un registro nacional del comercio de cuerpos. Muchos pueden operar casi en el anonimato, firmando acuerdos silenciosamente para obtener cadáveres y vender sus partes.

“Existe un extenso mercado para los cuerpos de los fallecidos” dijo Ray Madoff, un profesor de la Facultad de Derecho de Boston College que estudia cómo tratan a los muertos las leyes estadounidenses. “Sabemos muy poco sobre quién adquiere estos cuerpos y qué hacen con ellos”, añadió.

En la mayoría de los estados, cualquier persona puede comprar legalmente piezas de un cuerpo. Como se detalla en otro reportaje, un comerciante de Tennessee vendió a Reuters una columna cervical y dos cabezas humanas después de un breve intercambio de correos.

A través de entrevistas y registros públicos, Reuters identificó a Sourthern Nevada y otros 33 activos en todo Estados Unidos durante los últimos cinco años. Veinticinco de los 34 negocios eran empresas con ánimo de lucro. Solo en tres años, una de las empresas con ánimo de lucro ganó al menos 12,5 millones de dólares gracias al negocio de partes de cuerpos, como muestra otro artículo de Reuters.

Debido a que solo cuatro estados siguen de cerca las donaciones y las ventas, la amplitud del mercado de piezas de cuerpos humanos sigue siendo desconocida. Pero los datos obtenidos bajo las leyes de registro público de Nueva York, Virginia, Oklahoma y Florida, proporcionan una imagen de conjunto. Reuters calculó que desde 2011 hasta 2015, los comercios privados recibieron al menos 50.000 cuerpos y distribuyeron más de 182.000 partes humanas.

Las autorizaciones de Florida y Virginia dan una idea de cómo se usaron algunas de esas piezas: un envío en 2013 a un seminario de formación ortopédica de Florida incluyó 27 hombros. Un envío de 2015 a una sesión sobre el síndrome del túnel carpiano en Virginia incluyó cinco brazos.

Al igual que con otros productos, los precios de los cuerpos y las piezas de estos fluctúan según las condiciones del mercado. En general, un comerciante puede vender un cuerpo humano donado por alrededor de 3.000 a 5.000 dólares, aunque los precios a veces superan los 10.000 dólares. Pero los comerciantes normalmente dividen el cadáver en seis partes para satisfacer las necesidades del cliente. Los documentos internos de siete de estos negocios recogen un rango de precios para las partes del cuerpo: 3.575 dólares para un torso con piernas; 500 dólares por cabeza; 350 dólares por un pie; 300 dólares por columna vertebral.

Los negocios de cuerpos se han entrelazado con la industria funeraria estadounidense. Reuters identificó a 62 agentes funerarios que han llegado a acuerdos comerciales de beneficio mutuo con los comerciantes. Las funerarias brindan a los intermediarios acceso a posibles donantes. A cambio, los comerciantes de cuerpos pagan los honorarios a los funerarios, que van de 300 dólares a 1.430 dólares, de acuerdo con los libros contables y los registros judiciales.

Estos pagos generan ingresos para los agentes funerarios de aquellas familias que de otra forma no podrían permitirse una simple incineración. Pero tales relaciones provocan posibles conflictos de interés al crear un incentivo para las funerarias que alientan a los familiares en duelo a que consideren la donación del cuerpo, a veces sin una comprensión total sobre qué podría pasar con los restos.

“Algunos directores de las funerarias piensan: ‘La cremación ya no paga las facturas, así que déjame ver si puedo ayudar a estas personas a recoger partes corporales’” dijo Steve Palmer, un trabajador funerario miembro de la junta directiva de la National Funeral Directors Association. “Simplemente creo que las familias que donan los cadáveres de sus seres queridos tendrían dudas al respecto si supieran esto”, dijo.

Algunos embalsamadores han hecho que la donación del cuerpo forme parte de sus propios negocios. En Oklahoma, dos propietarios de funerarias invirtieron 650.000 dólares en una startup de comercio de cuerpos. En Colorado, una familia que controlaba una funeraria también dirigía una empresa que disecaba y distribuía piezas de cadáveres desde el mismo edificio.

Cuando se dona un cuerpo, pocos estados establecen normativas que controlen el desmembramiento o el uso de este, u ofrecen derechos sobre los familiares más cercanos del donante. Los cuerpos y las piezas se pueden comprar, vender y alquilar, una y otra vez. Como resultado, puede ser difícil rastrear qué sucede con los cuerpos de los donantes, y mucho menos garantizar que se les trate con dignidad.

En 2004, un comité de salud federal pidió sin éxito al gobierno de EEUU que regulara la industria. Desde entonces, Reuters ha descubierto que más de 2.357 partes del cuerpo obtenidas por comerciantes de al menos 1.638 personas han sido maltratadas, abusadas o profanadas en todo Estados Unidos.

Estos datos, basados en una revisión de registros judiciales, policiales, y de documentos internos de los negocios de cuerpos, seguramente estén subestimados, dada la falta de supervisión. Incluyen instancias en las que los cuerpos fueron utilizados sin el consentimiento del donante o el familiar más cercano; los donantes fueron engañados acerca de cómo se usarían los cuerpos; los cuerpos fueron desmembrados por motosierras en lugar de instrumentos médicos; las partes del cuerpo se almacenaron en condiciones insalubres y se descompusieron; o los cuerpos fueron desechados en incineradores de desechos médicos en lugar de ser incinerados adecuadamente.

“MATERIAS PRIMAS GRATUITAS”

Los negocios de cuerpos varían en tamaño, desde pequeñas empresas familiares hasta empresas nacionales con oficinas en varios estados. También varían en experiencia.

Garland Shreves, quien fundó el negocio de Phoenix Research for Life en 2009, dijo que invirtió más de 2 millones de dólares en procedimientos de control de calidad y equipos médicos, incluidos 265.000 dólares en una máquina de rayos X para escanear cadáveres en busca de implantes quirúrgicos.

Pero otros comerciantes han lanzado sus negocios por menos de 100.000 dólares, según indican registros corporativos internos y entrevistas. A menudo, los mayores gastos de capital son una furgoneta de carga y un conjunto de congeladores. Algunos negocios han ahorrado dinero utilizando motosierras para desmembrar los cadáveres en lugar de sierras quirúrgicas.

Los negocios también pueden reducir gastos al renunciar a los meticulosos procedimientos de control de calidad y a la formación solicitada por una organización nacional de referencia, la Asociación Estadounidense de Bancos de Tejidos.

Aun así, un tercio de los 34 negocios identificados por Reuters se declaraban en bancarrota o no pagaban sus impuestos, de acuerdo con documentos judiciales. Cuando las empresas que fracasan en la industria reducen gastos para ahorrar dinero, las consecuencias para las familias de los donantes pueden ser emocionalmente desgarradoras.

“UN ÚLTIMO GESTO DESINTERESADO”

Harold Dillard trabajaba con su hermano alicatando bañeras y encimeras de cocina en Albuquerque, Nuevo México. Le diagnosticaron cáncer terminal en 2009, el día después a Acción de Gracias.

“Tenía 56 años, era joven, activo, sano, tenía una vida genial y una noche, ¡bam!”, dijo su hija, Farrah Fasold. “Quería hacer un último gesto desinteresado antes de morir, por lo que donó su cuerpo”

Mientras su padre agonizaba, dijo Fasold, los trabajadores de Bio Care, negocio de cuerpos de Albuquerque, le visitaron a él y a su hija, y les dieron un discurso sincero: el generoso regalo de su cuerpo a la ciencia beneficiaría a estudiantes de medicina, médicos e investigadores. Fasold indicó que Bio Care les dio varias posibilidades, incluida que el cuerpo de su padre se usara para entrenar a los cirujanos en técnicas de reemplazo de rodilla.

La visión que tenía Fasold de Bio Care cambió en poco tiempo. Pasaron algunas semanas más de las prometidas hasta que recibieron lo que dijeron que eran los restos cremados de su padre. Una vez con ellos, sospechó que no eran sus cenizas porque parecían arena. Estaba en lo correcto.

En abril de 2010, las autoridades informaron a Fasold de que la cabeza de su padre se encontraba entre las partes corporales descubiertas en un incinerador médico. También supo, por primera vez, que Bio Care estaba dentro del negocio de la venta de partes del cuerpo.

“Estaba completamente histérica”, dijo. “Nunca nos habríamos apuntado si nos hubieran dicho algo sobre vender partes del cuerpo, de ninguna manera. Eso no es lo que mi padre quería en absoluto”.

Dentro del almacén de Bio Care, las autoridades apuntaron que encontraron al menos 127 partes del cuerpo pertenecientes a 45 personas.

El propietario de Bio Care, Paul Montano, fue acusado de fraude. De acuerdo con la declaración jurada de la policía, Montano negó haber abusado de los cuerpos y dijo a los agentes que dirigía Bio Care con “cinco empleados voluntarios”, incluido su padre. No quiso responder a las peticiones de comentarios.

Los fiscales retiraron más adelante los cargos contra Montano porque dijeron que no podían demostrar el engaño ni ningún otro delito. Ninguna otra ley estatal regulaba el tratamiento de los cuerpos donados o protegía a los familiares.

Confundida e indignada, Fasold habló por teléfono con Kari Brandenburg, el fiscal del distrito en el condado de Bernalillo. Fasold grabó parte de la llamada.

“Lo que ha sucedido es horrible, pero la ley de Nuevo México no dice nada sobre este tipo de actividad”, le dijo Brandeburg a Fasold. El fiscal expresó que, aunque Montano era quizás “el peor empresario del mundo”, sus errores se debieron, en parte, a acuerdos que fracasaron.

“Entonces”, respondió Fasold, “como otras personas incumplieron sus acuerdos, ¿está bien que siga adelante, corte el cuerpo de mi padre y lo incinere?”

”No, no está bien“, respondió el fiscal. ”Pero no lo convierte en un crimen“. No existe ninguna ley que diga que eso esté mal”.

En una entrevista reciente, Brandenburg dijo que él también se sintió frustrado al descubrir que ninguna ley protege a personas como Fasold y su padre. “Fue escandaloso”, dijo el exfiscal. “Estas familias han quedado profundamente heridas, devastadas”.

Las autoridades terminaron por recuperar las otras partes del cuerpo del padre de Fasold y se las devolvieron para que las pudiera incinerar correctamente. Algunas piezas habían sido descubiertas en bañeras en el incinerador y otras en las instalaciones de Bio Care.

EL TORSO CONGELADO

El incidente de 2015 en las afueras de Las Vegas que involucró al torso congelado provenía de una asociación entre un negocio de cuerpos y una funeraria.

Tanto el negocio, Southern Nevada Donor Services, y la funeraria, Valley Cremation and Burial, tenían problemas financieros. Valley acordó permitir que Southern Nevada diseccionara y prepara los cadáveres y las partes el cuerpo en su funeraria. Los restos y los documentos relacionados se mantendrían en el almacén de Valley, en un parque industrial a pocos kilómetros de distancia.

El dueño de Southern Nevada, Joe Collazo, tenía una década de experiencia vendiendo partes del cuerpo. Los registros judiciales muestran que también cumplió casi dos años en prisión a finales de la década de 1990 por falsificación. Y que un exempleado lo demandó por el robo de partes del cuerpo donadas valoradas en 75.000 dólares y la venta de las mismas a un cliente en Turquía.

Collazo defendió que su condena por falsificación es irrelevante y que la acusación de robo es falsa. Su negocio siguió las mejores prácticas de la industria, dijo, y prestó importantes servicios públicos a la comunidad médica.

Funcionarios locales y estatales informaron de que encontraron otras señales preocupantes, más allá del torso, en las instalaciones de almacenaje. Estas incluían una sierra mecánica ensangrentada que suelen usar trabajadores de la construcción y partes corporales con moho dentro de un congelador desconectado.

Valley ya no está en el negocio, y el dueño murió, según los registros estatales. Southern Nevada también se disolvió, dejando una estela de deudas y partes corporales profanadas.","En el mercado de los cuerpos humanos, casi cualquiera puede vender muertos",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idESKBN1CZ1KL-OESTP

“Today the U.S.-led racket of brutal sanctions and pressure against the DPRK constitutes contemporary human rights violation and genocide,” the North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva said in a statement.

The sanctions regime “threatens and impedes the enjoyment by the people of DPRK of their human rights in all sectors”, it said.

The call for an immediate end to the sanctions comes as U.S. President Donald Trump sets off on a trip to Asia - including China, South Korea and Japan - looking for help to pressure North Korea to stand down from the nuclear crisis.

The global community has been ramping up the pressure on the isolated country after it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, on Sept. 3.

Last month the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses, including forced labor.

In September the U.N. Security Council strengthened its sanctions, including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials,

North Korea’s response follows a U.N. expert last month saying international sanctions may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of Pyongyang’s citizens.

The sanctions meant that “some unprincipled countries have blocked the delivery of medical equipment and medicines”, the North Korean mission said on Friday, with the supplies destined for children and mothers in the country.

The 36-year-old had been due to retire last season but was recalled by the Williams team after Valtteri Bottas left for Mercedes following the surprise retirement of 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg.

After an emotional send-off in Brazil last year, Massa was back in the cockpit a few months later.

“As you know, last year I decided to announce my retirement in Formula One but because of the Williams request I decided to do another season,” the former Ferrari driver said in a video message posted on social media.

“But this time will be my last race in Brazil of Formula One and my last race in Abu Dhabi,” he added, thanking his family, fans and sponsors and making clear he was not retiring from racing entirely.

“I really hope that you can support me next year or maybe in the future in other races and in other categories,” he said.

Williams have yet to announce their 2018 lineup, with several candidates in the frame including Poland’s Robert Kubica. Canadian rookie teenager Lance Stroll is sure to stay, however.

Massa won 11 races with Ferrari and finished runner-up to Lewis Hamilton, now a four-times world champion, by a single point in the 2008 season.

His last victory was at the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he won new fans for his dignified and sporting response when Hamilton seized the title by taking fifth place on the last corner of the last lap.

In 2009, he suffered a severe head injury and was in a coma for several days after being hit on the helmet in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying by a spring shed from the Brawn of compatriot Rubens Barrichello.

Massa joined Williams in 2014, helping the former champions to take third place in the constructors’ championship that year and in 2015.

“It has been an absolute pleasure to work with him,” said deputy principal Claire Williams in a team statement.

”We are especially grateful that he agreed to postpone his retirement from Formula One for a year, after Valtteri joined Mercedes, which demonstrated the depth of the relationship we built during our time together.

Few on the streets of capital Caracas really understood unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro’s announcement this week that he would seek to refinance the oil-rich nation’s heavy bond burden of $60 billion - or about $2,000 per person.

But those interviewed by Reuters said they were hoping any deals between the government and its multiple foreign creditors would free up foreign currency to increase imports of scarce food, medicine, and basic products.

“Maybe it will work, and improve the country,” said Johny Vargas, 53, a construction worker who says he often only eats twice a day because his salary is gobbled up by price increases.

“Everything is so expensive. There’s no food, nothing. Maduro’s useless. Look at the bad state we’re in.”

Up to now, Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party has prioritized debt payments by slashing imports, compounding four years of recession and shortages on the shelves.

Should a debt renegotiation be reached, it could free more money in the short-term for the government to bring in basic foods and medicines.

But Wall Street is skeptical, and so are many Venezuelans.

“We can’t have strong negotiations. We don’t have the credibility to sit down and make requests,” said 35 year-old accountant Mayerling Delgado, referring to Venezuela’s increasingly fraught relations with many other countries.

“So we have to pay,” she added in a resigned tone, in a busy Caracas plaza.

Experts have long warned that debt accrued under late leader Hugo Chavez was unsustainable, and urged Maduro’s government to refinance its debt load.

But pursuing such an operation now is near impossible given Venezuela’s economic mess, a dearth of technocrats in the government, and, especially, sanctions that bar U.S. banks from participating in or negotiating new Venezuelan debt deals.

NOT PAYING IS WORSE?

Most Venezuelans balk at the idea of a default, which would trigger lawsuits by creditors seeking to seize assets such as refineries in the United States. That could plunge the OPEC nation of 30 million people into even worse hardship.

“The majority of the population has consistently perceived a default as a negative move that could hurt the country’s economy,” said economist Luis Vicente Leon of pollster Datanalisis.

But with many analysts viewing a default as ultimately unavoidable given the parlous state of Venezuela’s coffers, some said it might be better to bite the bullet.

“What’s the science behind paying when you’ve already lost? It’s not what we as Venezuelans want ... but there’s no other way out, unfortunately,” said beautician Harlee Tovitto, 42. She plans to emigrate to neighboring Colombia soon because she can no longer afford clothes or insurance for her three children.

Amid a deepening spat with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, some Venezuelans think Caracas would find a way out of its bond mess if it weren’t for the U.S. sanctions.

“If Venezuela has always paid its debt ... why can’t they refinance?,” said Rafael Moreno, 30, a lawyer and former Chavez supporter who now says he does not back either the government or opposition.","Unversed in debt details, Venezuelans desperate for any relief",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-reaction/unversed-in-debt-details-venezuelans-desperate-for-any-relief-idUSKBN1D40GV

Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban and spent five years under brutal captivity by the insurgent group. He had faced up to life in prison after pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The 31-year-old Idaho native trembled in a military courtroom at Fort Bragg in North Carolina as he waited to hear his punishment. Army Colonel Jeffery Nance delivered the sentence in a hearing that lasted just two minutes, and did not comment on his decision. He also recommended Bergdahl be demoted to private. Bergdahl and lawyers in the case had no immediate comment. Prosecutors had asked Nance to send Bergdahl to prison for 14 years for the hardships and injuries endured by service members who searched for the soldier after he left his combat outpost in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission. Defense lawyers had said Bergdahl, who experts testified has several mental health conditions, should not go to prison. Bergdahl's case made him a polarizing figure. He drew withering criticism from political leaders in Washington and fellow soldiers, both for the dangerous efforts to find him and the 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by the Democratic Obama administration that secured his release. During his successful campaign for the presidency last year, Republican Donald Trump called Bergdahl ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed."" Nance, acting on a defense motion, ruled that Trump's comments had not influenced him nor affected Bergdahl's chances of a fair sentence, but said he would consider them a mitigating factor. Defense attorneys argued at Bergdahl's sentencing hearing that he was a young, hardworking soldier who did not understand the full consequences of his actions when he deserted. Bergdahl, who has said he wanted to report problems in his unit, apologized in court this week for the suffering he caused his comrades and admitted he had made ""a horrible mistake."" Prosecutors, however, said Bergdahl knew his disappearance would trigger alarm in the war zone.

The Niger Delta Avengers announced a halt to hostilities in August 2016, although they carried out attacks in October and November last year.

""Niger Delta Avenger's ceasefire on Operation Red Economy is officially over,"" the group said on its website ( www.nigerdeltaavengers.org/ ).

“Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties; this outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody,” it said in a section of its statement addressed to oil companies.

The move threatens Nigeria’s fragile economic growth and poses a further security challenge for President Muhammadu Buhari, in addition to the jihadist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and rising secessionist sentiments in the southeast.

The government has been in talks for more than a year to address grievances over poverty and oil pollution but local groups have complained that no progress has been made, despite Buhari receiving a list of demands at a meeting last November.

Buhari’s office did not immediately comment.

The 2016 attacks cut oil production from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd, the lowest level in Africa’s top oil producer for at least 30 years.

The attacks, combined with low oil prices, caused the OPEC member’s first recession in 25 years. Crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of its foreign exchange. Nigeria came out of recession in the second quarter of this year, mostly due to the rise in oil production after attacks stopped and as prices strengthened.

The Niger Delta Avengers, who say they want a greater share of Nigeria’s energy wealth to go to the impoverished swampland region, said they decided to end the ceasefire because they had “lost faith” in local leaders.

“We can assure you that every oil installation in our region will feel the warmth of the wrath of the Niger Delta Avengers,” it said.

There have been no substantial attacks in the region since January.

Eric Omare, president of the Ijaw Youth Council, which represents the largest ethnic group in the Niger Delta, said the government had paid only “lip service” to communities’ concerns.

“The truth is that the federal government has not demonstrated any seriousness towards addressing the issues that led to the Niger Delta agitation,” Omare said, while adding that his group sought a “peaceful dialogue.”

Nigeria’s economy grew 0.55 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, largely on higher oil receipts.

The World Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast in October to 1 percent from 1.2 percent as the oil production increase was lower than expected and non-oil sector growth was subdued.",Nigeria's 'Delta Avengers' militants end oil hub ceasefire,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D317X-OZATP

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

The stock rose as much as 3.7 percent to $174.26, briefly breaching $900 billion in market value, amid declines in the broader market. The gains added nearly $32 billion to the company’s market capitalization.

The Cupertino, California-based company also forecast a strong holiday quarter ahead, which will include the iPhone X that started selling on Nov. 3.

“We see iPhone X unlocking pent-up iPhone upgrades, especially in China, driving more than 20 percent iPhone unit growth and a revenue and earnings beat in 2018,” analyst Katy Huberty on Morgan Stanley said.

The glass-and-steel $999 phone appeared to have brought back the frenzy associated with iPhone launches - long lines formed outside Apple stores across the world as fans flocked to buy the new phone.

The company will make 30 million iPhone X units during the current quarter, Nomura Instinet analysts estimated, allaying production worries related to the phone.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Apple said on Thursday it expects first-quarter revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion, at the high end of analysts’ average expectation of $84.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

“We – and many others – had feared that guidance could be weaker, reflecting only 9 weeks of the flagship iPhone X and limitations on supply,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said.

At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Citigroup making the most bullish move by raising its price target by $30 to $200.

Veteran left-wing lawmaker Peter Pilz, 63, has been a fixture in Austrian politics for decades, having made a name for himself railing against arms deals with countries accused of human rights abuses and leading investigations into corruption like one this year connected to Austrian fighter-jet purchases.

He also recently pulled off a political coup - leaving the Greens this summer to form his own party, Pilz List, which not only beat the Greens in last month’s parliamentary election, it also passed the 4 percent threshold for entering parliament, which the Greens fell just short of.

Weekly newspaper Falter reported on Saturday that Pilz had repeatedly groped a female employee of the center-right European People’s Party during a conference in the Alps four years ago. The article included her description of the incident. She said Pilz was “relatively drunk” at the time.

Pilz -- one of the more colorful figures in Austrian politics, a straight talker fond of singing rock songs like “Wild Thing” at party events -- said he could not remember what happened.

“Not remembering is no excuse,” Pilz told a news conference, adding that Falter’s editor in chief had assured him the report was thoroughly researched.

“Because of these accusations, which I take extremely seriously, even though I do not remember, I will not take up my mandate in the coming parliament. I will not be at the swearing-in ceremony on Thursday,” he said.

In the wake of the Weinstein scandal and the resignations over inappropriate behavior that have followed, including that of British Defence Minister Michael Fallon this week, Austrian media had begun to ask whether there were previously unreported cases of sexual harassment by influential Austrians.

U.S. movie mogul Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Pilz said he would work to bring all the facts to light in the accusations made against him. But he also said he rejected separate allegations by a former colleague that he sexually harassed her on dozens of occasions. That case was first reported by Austrian media on Friday.

Pilz said he would support his party’s work in parliament “from the outside”, though he did not say specifically that he was stepping down as party leader.

A spokeswoman for Pilz was not immediately available for comment.

At least Thomas Morel is hoping they will. He’s a 30-year-old former financier who saw how much Canadians liked the sport, or game, or pastime, or whatever axe-throwing might be.

“And I told myself, this is bound to work in Paris,” Morel said.

So he opened Les Cognees - French for “axes” or “hatchets” - where people can gather after work and pay to hurl heavy edged weapons around. What could go wrong?

Quite a lot, obviously, but safeguards are in place: no alcohol is served, the blades of the axes are blunted and security measures are read out to participants when they arrive.

And they are arriving. Morel’s venue is in the city’s north-east 18th district, a traditionally working-class neighborhood showing tentative signs of gentrification. On a typical day this week, it had attracted about 30 men and women in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

Some had come with friends and some, improbably, were there on corporate outings. For example, 29-year-old Antoine Verdier, a legal manager, and his boss, Camille Cocaud, had come on a team-building exercise.

“It’s a great way to unwind after work,” Cocaud said.

“It’s a real melting pot,” Morel said. “You get the young hipsters, you get companies on team-building, but you also get punks, you get mothers with children, you get families.”

Morel’s timing is good. France is trying to get more people to take part in sports, partly to promote the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

In fact, Morel can see a great marketing opportunity approaching, although some might say it’s a tad over-ambitious:

In the past few years, some Hong Kong football fans have booed the national anthem during World Cup qualifiers and other matches, mirroring protests in the United States where football players knelt during the national anthem, a practice denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

China passed a new law in September mandating up to 15 days in police detention for those who mock the “March of the Volunteers” national anthem, a law that also covers the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau but was not immediately given a legal basis for enforcement there.

The National Anthem Law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, has now been included in an annex of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, or mini constitution, state news agency Xinhua said. It will also be included in an annex of Macau’s Basic Law, Xinhua reported.

He Shaoren, spokesman for the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said in a news conference on Saturday that it was up to the Hong Kong government to enact a local law to abide by the amendment in a timely manner.

A Hong Kong official said on Wednesday that the Special Administrative Region would enact such a law “as soon as possible”.

Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called “one country, two systems” formula that promises the city a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary.

China’s growing reach into Hong Kong’s affairs has, however, stoked tensions and mass protests including the 2014 “Occupy” civil disobedience movement that blocked major roads in the city for 79 days to pressure China to allow full democracy.

Chinese authorities have strived to instil greater patriotism into Hong Kong, while condemning a push from democracy activists to distance Hong Kong.

China’s national legislature on Saturday also passed an amendment to its criminal law that extends punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to disrespecting the national anthem. Punishments include jail terms of up to three years, Xinhua reported. This law does not appear to apply to Hong Kong or Macau.","China extends national anthem ""disrespect"" law to Hong Kong",https://in.reuters.com/article/china-lawmaking-hongkong/china-extends-national-anthem-disrespect-law-to-hong-kong-idINKBN1D40CD

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but the project has faced a two-year delay due to planning objections.

In a meeting on Thursday, Cook did not commit to going ahead with it, Varadkar told state broadcaster RTE.

Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels.

In Spain’s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago.

Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.

“It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,” Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box.

Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont’s tweet.

EVENLY SPLIT

In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately.

That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.

If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid’s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed.

Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December.

Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election.

JAILED POLITICIANS

The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.

“It is up to the state to show it’s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,” she said.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont’s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes

On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions.

Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.

Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.

Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.

“Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don’t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.”

While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.

Images like these are rare and hard to find. The color illustrations printed in black and white albums were a significant innovation of the time, comics expert Eric Leroy said, and Herge was reluctant to switch to color drawings for fear of losing his trademark touch. Also up for grabs are sketches for the book 'The Castafiore Emerald', offering a unique insight into the craftsmanship behind Herge's works and his thought processes as an illustrator.

The decision to endorse a measure advancing in the U.S. Senate could clear the way for Congress to pass the first rewrite of a law adopted 21 years ago that is widely considered a bedrock legal shield for the internet industry.

Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said in a statement it supported a bipartisan proposal advancing in the U.S. Senate making it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.

“Important changes made to (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,” Beckerman said.

May’s Conservative Party refused to give any detail about the nature of the allegations against Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative lawmaker for Dover in southern England, but said it had referred the matter to the police.

Elphicke, formerly a tax lawyer who was first elected in 2010, denied any wrongdoing.

“The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension,” he said on Twitter. “I am not aware of what the alleged claims are and deny any wrongdoing.”

May’s office did not respond to calls from Reuters about the allegations, whose nature was unclear. Email enquiries went unanswered. The Conservatives declined to comment.

May’s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party are grappling with a slew of sexual harassment and abuse claims - many of them unsubstantiated - against British politicians.

The allegations have surfaced since the sexual abuse claims against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted women and men in British politics to share stories about alleged improper behavior.

One of May’s most loyal ministers, Michael Fallon, resigned as defense secretary on Wednesday. Fallon, who had admitted touching a radio presenter’s knee in 2002, said his past conduct had fallen below the required standard. He gave no details.

Separately on Saturday, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party resigned from his cabinet post in the devolved Edinburgh administration after apologizing for what he described as “inappropriate” actions.

“Where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behavior might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions,” Mark McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside, said in a statement.

May set out the code of conduct for her party on Friday detailing standards and procedures expected of elected and appointed party members.

She lost her party’s majority in parliament with a botched bet on a snap election in June, so now has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to ensure she can pass legislation.

With the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), May has a slender working majority of about 13 in the 650-seat House of Commons.

Parliament remains bitterly divided over terms for Britain’s planned departure from the European Union. The pace of the Brexit talks remains slow, heightening the risk of Brexit in March 2019 without a deal on future relations with the EU, much to the alarm of business leaders.","Britain's ruling Conservatives suspend lawmaker, refer his case to police",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-lawmaker/britains-ruling-conservatives-suspend-lawmaker-refer-his-case-to-police-idUKKBN1D40L2?il=0

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

“I will not be defeated by it,” Ito, a 59-year-old banker, said as he picked up his race number three days after an Uzbek immigrant drove a truck down a Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring a dozen more.

Holding his white cane, Ito, who will run with a sighted guide, said through an interpreter that while the attack gave him “a little trepidation,” he is “definitely running.”

He is far from alone, according to organizers of the annual road race, who said runners were defying concerns to join the world’s biggest marathon.

“There’s been no spike in cancellations that we’ve seen,” said Chris Weiller, a spokesman for race organizer the New York Road Runners.

New York officials allowed the city’s Halloween parade to step off just hours after the attack and vowed that the marathon would go forward, with some enhanced security.

The race has been canceled only once in its 47-year-history, in 2012, following Superstorm Sandy’s devastating hit to the region. It even went forward after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which killed about 2,600 people in New York.

Marathoners train for months to prepare their bodies for the 26.2-mile race, and some wait years before winning a spot in the drawing which gives about 30 percent of them access to a field that includes the world’s top runners and draws about 2.5 million spectators.

“The determination that got them here is the determination that I think that they have right now going into Sunday,” Weiller said.

Sunday’s race will not be the first time U.S. runners have had to worry about violence. Two brothers inspired by al Qaeda killed three people and injured more than 260 with bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.

Philadelphian Neil Gottlieb remembers that attack vividly as it occurred shortly after he crossed the finish line. But he was back on that course in 2014 and said he was undaunted about racing in New York.

“I‘m not going to win the New York City Marathon, but it’s a victory for me, and I‘m not going to let anyone stop me,” said Gottlieb, a 48-year-old healthcare executive and father of three.

New York police stepped up security, saying they would deploy extra “blocking trucks” to protect against vehicle attacks, rooftop snipers, heavy weapons, dogs and helicopters.

“This increase will supplement the already large, substantial detail of uniformed officers that you will see along the route,” New York Police Chief Carlos Gomez said on Wednesday.

The route connects all five of the city’s boroughs, starting near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island, snaking through Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, before circling up to the Bronx and back to Manhattan.

Stephanie Trumbino, 35, of Maplewood, New Jersey, said she felt concerned about the attack but did not consider missing her first attempt at the race.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Sono due punti contenuti nel decreto del Presidente del Consiglio, adottato su proposta della ministra della Difesa Roberta Pinotti, dopo che Mubadala, il fondo sovrano di Abu Dhabi proprietario del gruppo italiano, ha notificato all‘esecutivo il progetto di vendita del ramo di azienda che produce il jet executive P180 nell‘ambito delle procedure previste per il golden power nel settore difesa.

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embraces Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi before a meeting of the Saudi-Iraqi Bilateral Coordination Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, October 22, 2017. REUTERS/Alex Brandon/Pool

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

Mohamed Merah a été tué le 22 mars 2012 dans l‘assaut de l‘appartement où il s‘était retranché après avoir abattu trois militaires, trois écoliers de l‘école juive Ozar Hatorah de Toulouse et le père de deux d‘entre eux, les 11, 15 et 19 mars. Des assassinats revendiqués par un groupe affilié à Al Qaïda.

L‘avocate générale Naïma Rudloff avait requis lundi à l‘encontre d‘Abdelkader Merah la réclusion à perpétuité assortie de 22 ans de sûreté pour complicité d‘assassinats et association de malfaiteurs en relation avec une entreprise terroriste.

Les avocats de cet ex-caïd de cité franco-algérien de 35 ans converti à l‘islamisme radical demandaient son acquittement.

Après un mois de procès tendu, la cour n‘a finalement retenu que l‘association de malfaiteurs, au grand dam des familles des victimes et d‘une partie des avocats des parties civiles.

Elle a considéré dans ses motivations que les éléments à charge étaient “insuffisants” pour condamner Abdelkader Merah pour complicité et que “le doute devait lui profiter”.

“Il n‘est pas démontré l‘existence d‘une aide ou assistance apportée en connaissance de cause par Abdelkader Merah à son frère lors de la commission des assassinats”, a-t-elle expliqué.

Si la peine prononcée était confirmée, Abdelkader Merah, qui a déjà fait cinq ans et demi de détention provisoire, pourrait donc théoriquement sortir de prison dans environ huit ans.

“On est trop naïf en France, il faut qu‘on se réveille (...) Les gens comme lui sont des gens dangereux, des gens qui ne laissent pas de trace”, a déclaré après le verdict la mère du premier soldat abattu par Mohamed Merah, Latifa Ibn Ziatem.

“ÉTHIQUE JUDICIAIRE”

“Lorsqu’il sera relâché, Abdelkader Merah représentera un très grave danger pour la France”, a renchéri vendredi sur LCI Samuel Sandler, père et grand-père de victimes.

La procureure générale de Paris estime pour sa part que la cour “n‘a pas tiré toutes les conséquences juridiques des faits qui lui étaient soumis”, lit-on dans un communiqué du parquet.

Elle a donc décidé de faire appel de la décision de la cour d‘assises, notamment “de l‘acquittement partiel d‘Abdelkader Merah pour complicité d‘assassinats et tentative d‘assassinats en relation avec une entreprise terroriste”.

Cet appel vaut aussi pour l‘autre prévenu, Fettah Malki, à l‘encontre de qui l‘avocate générale avait requis 20 ans de prison pour avoir fourni au tueur une des armes utilisées lors de son équipée meurtrière et un gilet pare-belle.

Ce délinquant multirécidiviste a finalement été condamné à 14 ans de prison avec peine de sûreté des deux tiers mais ses avocats ont annoncé dès jeudi qu‘il voulait faire appel.

L‘un des trois avocats d‘Abdelkader Merah, Eric Dupond-Moretti, a pour sa part laissé entendre que son client pourrait faire de même. “Je pense qu‘on s‘oriente vers un autre procès”, a-t-il dit sur France Inter vendredi matin.

Me Dupond-Moretti conteste l‘incrimination d‘association de malfaiteurs, qui est selon lui une infraction “fourre-tout” et “intrinsèquement discutable”.

Du côté des parties civiles, Me Simon Cohen, avocat de familles de victimes de Mohamed Merah, estime que la décision du parquet général de faire appel relève de l’“éthique judiciaire”.

PROCÈS RÉFÉRENCE

“Lorsqu‘un haut magistrat soutient qu‘un accusé est coupable d‘un fait, il a le devoir moral de ne pas renoncer si l‘accusé n‘est pas condamné pour ce fait-là”, a-t-il dit à Reuters.

“Donc, en appel, je soutiendrai qu‘Abdelkader Merah est effectivement coupable de complicité d‘assassinats.”

Me Olivier Morice, avocat de la famille d‘un des militaires tués par Mohamed Merah, qui avait salué le verdict et estimé qu‘il ne fallait pas “faire croire (aux familles des victimes) que tout est possible”, juge pour sa part que les motivations de la cour posent effectivement des questions juridiques.

Selon les estimations les plus optimistes, le procès en appel d‘Abdelkader Merah et Fettah Malki ne pourra pas avoir lieu avant un an, voire plusieurs années.

A moins que la pression combinée des familles, de l‘opinion, du pouvoir politique, de l‘accumulation des dossiers liés à l‘islamisme radical violent et des procès en assises à venir ne contraignent l‘institution judiciaire à accélérer le mouvement.

“Il va falloir que, pour une fois, la lourdeur de l‘appareil judiciaire ne ralentisse pas le cours des choses. Cette affaire mérite d‘être rejugée rapidement”, estime Me Simon Cohen, pour qui ce procès fixera une sorte de jurisprudence.

“C‘est le procès référence pour les affaires de terrorisme, notamment pour les procès de complices en l‘absence des auteurs directs. Et il va y en avoir”, a-t-il ajouté.

Pour le directeur général de l‘Association française des victimes du terrorisme (AFVT), une des parties civiles, il s‘agit notamment de savoir si l‘on peut condamner au moins aussi lourdement l‘inspirateur idéologique que l‘acteur direct.

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://www.reuters.com/article/lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-pm-hariri-resigns-attacking-iran-and-hezbollah-idINKBN1D40E0

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

While veteran State Department Asia hand Joseph Yun might be Washington’s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a devastating war on the Korean peninsula, he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle Pyongyang.

On the other side, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong Un, shows little interest in negotiating either, at least not until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Despite the daunting obstacles, South Korean-born Yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand-off, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials and South Korean diplomats.

Most were deeply skeptical about his chances.

“He’s such a dreamer,” a White House official said, with a note of sarcasm.

“We don’t think this is going anywhere,” said another U.S. official, although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the North Koreans as long as Yun does not appear to be undermining President Donald Trump’s public rejection of direct negotiations.

Trump has told aides that his military threats will drive North Korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs, four White House officials said, a view not shared among most U.S. intelligence agencies.

Yun, however, is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korean officials at the United Nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of U.S. citizens, a senior State Department official told Reuters this week. In June, he secured the release of U.S. student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the United States in a coma and died days later.

‘RUNNING OUT OF TIME’

Trump headed to Asia on Friday as a senior aide warned the world is “running out of time” on the North Korea crisis. Behind the scenes, Yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict.

Further aggravating tensions, two U.S. strategic bombers conducted drills over South Korea on Thursday. That followed word from South Korea’s spy agency that North Korea may be preparing another missile launch.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

In the midst of this is Yun, a soft-spoken, 32-year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago, near the end of the Obama administration.

He is grappling with Trump’s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president’s top aides over whether saber-rattling will force Kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Concern about Yun’s difficulties has surfaced in Seoul, where he visits regularly and where Trump will travel next week on the second stop of his Asian tour.

Several South Korean officials expressed worry that Yun’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea lack any real underpinning of support from the White House.

“Things are clearly not easy for him,” one South Korean diplomat said. “Yun is precisely that person (to talk to North Korea), but Trump is killing the whole process.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Sept. 30 the United States was probing for a diplomatic opening, only to be slapped down by Trump, who told him via Twitter this was a waste of time.

REUTERS/Toru Yamanaka/Pool/File Photo

At the same time, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who regularly briefs Trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on North Korea in the president’s inner circle, has apparently gained stature.

Several officials familiar with those discussions say Pompeo is feeding Trump assessments that U.S. military threats will force Kim to bow to U.S. demands for nuclear disarmament, a position that some U.S. intelligence officers privately contest.

The CIA declined comment.

NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATOR ‘SHOCKED’

A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Yun has become diplomatically “untethered,” not fully connected to a core U.S. approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy.

The one tangible achievement of Yun’s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of 22-year-old Warmbier in secret talks with North Korean officials in Oslo and New York. Yun flew to Pyongyang in June to medically evacuate Warmbier.

When Choe Son Hui, head of the North Korean foreign ministry’s North America bureau, met Yun in Oslo, she was unaware of how serious Warmbier’s condition was, a source in Washington knowledgeable about the matter said.

KCNA/via REUTERS.

But once she learned about it she was “shocked” and Yun was summoned urgently to meet a North Korean diplomat in New York, which quickly led to Warmbier’s return home, the source said.

Warmbier’s death complicated Yun’s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time, the State Department official said.

STUMBLING IN THE DARK

Despite Trump’s threats of military action against Pyongyang, the State Department official said Yun’s view was “the less you engage diplomatically, the more likely you are in the dark.”

Even so, Trump’s rhetoric has raised questions among allies, and possibly even in North Korea, about how serious, if at all, his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate Yun may have to pursue it.

Trump “personalized” the conflict – deriding Kim as “Little Rocket Man” - against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts, some of whom warned it could be counterproductive, a senior national security official said.

Another official pointed out, however, that Trump, who in May said he would be honored to meet Kim, had not hurled any fresh insults at Kim in recent days, raising hopes for an altered approach.

A South Korean official in Seoul said it was necessary for Washington to have someone in contact with North Korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold.

But Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told Japan’s NHK television this week: “What we cannot afford to do is enter into these long, drawn-out negotiations that allow North Korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs.”

Former U.S. negotiators sympathize with Yun, whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug-of-war between a White House breathing fire and a State Department pushing a peaceful solution.

“Nobody doubted my authority,” said Wendy Sherman, one of the lead U.S. negotiators who achieved the 2015 deal under which

Iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. “All of this undermines our ability to do the job.”

Robert Gallucci, who was chief U.S. negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994 and has had recent contact with Yun, said the envoy is “realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere, including the tone set by the president, but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism.”",'He's such a dreamer:' Skepticism dogs U.S. envoy's North Korean peace efforts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-diplomacy-insight/hes-such-a-dreamer-skepticism-dogs-u-s-envoys-north-korean-peace-efforts-idUSKBN1D32BL

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.",Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia/trump-heads-to-japan-with-north-korea-on-his-mind-idUSKBN1D4061

Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will remain benign.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists’ expectations for a jump of 310,000 jobs.

Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.

The White House, which is pushing a Republican-backed package of tax cuts to boost economic growth and employment, trumpeted the payrolls gains. “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!” President Donald Trump tweeted after the release of the report.

But Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement that the report showed Americans were continuing to be denied bigger paychecks by Republicans’ “billionaires-first agenda.”

Average hourly earnings slipped one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part due to the return of the lower-paid leisure and hospitality workers. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September. They were up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis last month, the smallest gain since February 2016, after a 2.8 percent advance in the prior month.

October’s job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve’s assessment on Wednesday that “the labor market has continued to strengthen,” and the sluggish wage data did little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.

The U.S. central bank has increased rates twice this year.

“The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,” said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. “Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”

Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. Should wage growth remain sluggish, economists say it would be hard for central bank policymakers to hike rates three times next year as they currently anticipate.

Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October, from 4.2 percent in the prior month, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise rise of 575,000 in September.

The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.

The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.

Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher as were U.S. stocks. The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. The unemployment rate, which has declined by 0.7 percentage point since January, is now at its lowest level since December 2000 and below the Fed’s median forecast for 2017.

A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month. That was the lowest level since December 2006 and was down from 8.3 percent in September.

The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.

“You cannot get strong growth when spending power is increasing so modestly,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.

Other economic reports showed a jump in business spending on capital in September and a measure of services sector activity racing to more than a 12-year high in October.

Economic growth has remained strong even as Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.

House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cut tax rates on individuals and families and end certain tax breaks. Small businesses, realtors and homebuilders have opposed the current proposal.

Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers’ difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.

Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs last month while the retail sector lost 8,300 jobs.

Construction payrolls were up 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes. Professional and business services payrolls rose as did healthcare employment.",U.S. job growth picks up; flat wages raise consumer spending worries,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-job-growth-picks-up-flat-wages-raise-consumer-spending-worries-idUSKBN1D308L?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc T.N..

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.” He said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with “significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

May’s Conservative Party refused to give any detail about the nature of the allegations against Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative lawmaker for Dover in southern England, but said it had referred the matter to the police.

Elphicke, formerly a tax lawyer who was first elected in 2010, denied any wrongdoing.

“The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension,” he said on Twitter. “I am not aware of what the alleged claims are and deny any wrongdoing.”

May’s office did not respond to calls from Reuters about the allegations, whose nature was unclear. Email enquiries went unanswered. The Conservatives declined to comment.

May’s Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party are grappling with a slew of sexual harassment and abuse claims - many of them unsubstantiated - against British politicians.

The allegations have surfaced since the sexual abuse claims against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted women and men in British politics to share stories about alleged improper behavior.

One of May’s most loyal ministers, Michael Fallon, resigned as defense secretary on Wednesday. Fallon, who had admitted touching a radio presenter’s knee in 2002, said his past conduct had fallen below the required standard. He gave no details.

Separately on Saturday, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party resigned from his cabinet post in the devolved Edinburgh administration after apologizing for what he described as “inappropriate” actions.

“Where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behavior might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions,” Mark McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside, said in a statement.

May set out the code of conduct for her party on Friday detailing standards and procedures expected of elected and appointed party members.

She lost her party’s majority in parliament with a botched bet on a snap election in June, so now has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to ensure she can pass legislation.

With the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), May has a slender working majority of about 13 in the 650-seat House of Commons.

Parliament remains bitterly divided over terms for Britain’s planned departure from the European Union.

Since the start of October, at least 35 U.S. companies have cited currency “benefits” or “tailwinds” and “weaker dollar” for boosting quarterly earnings, compared with few mentions a year ago, and some see that extending to the fourth quarter, a Reuters analysis shows.

“The quarter was one where the dollar weakened over the course of the quarter, more so than analysts expected,” said Jill Carey Hall, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

“That’s what’s in part been helping multinationals,” Carey Hall said. “They have seen some of the strongest results so far.”

The U.S. dollar index’s .DXY average in the third quarter fell from its year-ago level by about 2.5 percent, the weakest showing since 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows.

The index has recovered from its recent lows, but remains down about 7 percent for the year.

U.S.-based multinational companies can benefit the most from declines in the dollar, which make overseas sales more valuable when translated back into the U.S. currency.

Among companies citing a positive dollar impact were Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and other names in technology, which has the highest percentage of foreign sales within the S&P 500.

Others included Axalta Coating Systems Ltd (AXTA.N), W.R. Grace (GRA.N), Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Xerox Corp (XRX.N), which said the third quarter was the first in 13 that a weaker dollar boosted the company’s earnings, by about 1 percentage point.

“And we’re expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates,” Xerox Chief Financial Officer William Osbourn said in the company’s Oct. 26 conference call after it reported higher-than-expected results.

The weaker dollar “should help with the discounting pressure from the non-U.S. manufacturers, so that’s a good sign,” Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told investors Oct. 17.

The dollar’s weakness has helped offset the impact of a trio of hurricanes that took a heavy toll on companies in the third quarter. If the benefit continues, it could help companies hit the 11.7 percent profit gains analysts have projected for the fourth quarter.

With results in from more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 companies, third-quarter profit growth is estimated at 8.0 percent, up from 4.3 percent three weeks ago, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Much of the improvement has come with stronger-than-expected technology results. Ninety percent of S&P technology index .SPLRCT names are beating earnings expectations, while 72 percent are surpassing estimates in the overall S&P 500, the data shows.

Materials companies’ earnings, which have benefited from higher commodity prices tied to the weaker dollar, have had a high percentage of beats as well.

Adding to the weaker dollar’s benefit has been better global economic strength, and that is also why multinational companies have performed better than others this earnings season, Carey Hall said.

S&P 500 companies with 50 percent or more of sales coming from outside the United States have estimated profit growth of 16.7 percent for the third quarter, compared with 5.5 percent for companies with less than 50 percent of non-U.S. sales, Thomson Reuters data shows.

Stocks of big multinationals also have outperformed, with the Dow Jones global titans index .DJGT up about 3.3 percent since Oct. 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is up just 0.2 percent since then.

“It’s not so much the dollar is a windfall for them; it’s no longer a headwind, so that’s positive, and outlooks for companies have been generally upbeat,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.",U.S. dollar enters center stage for earnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/u-s-dollar-enters-center-stage-for-earnings-idUKKBN1D32CQ

Delson Guarate, who had been a mayor in central Aragua state, and former student leader Yon Goicoechea were among nearly 400 jailed anti-Maduro activists who rights campaigners say are political prisoners but whom the government calls coup-plotters.

“I‘m with my family today,” tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas’ Avila mountain. “Tomorrow I’ll address the country. God is with us.”

“I‘m free!” Guarate tweeted.

The pair’s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment.

The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles.

And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence.

Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths.

Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him.

In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation.

”When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls,“ he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison. ”The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness.

“There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.”

Senior officials said Goicoechea was an “imperialist” agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing “terrorism.” Neither was tried.

Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists.

“The dictatorship’s ‘justice’ is a revolving door,” said party legislator Juan Mejia. “Some leave, while others come in at its discretion and to its benefit.”",Venezuela frees two anti-Maduro activists; scores still jailed,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics/venezuela-frees-two-anti-maduro-activists-scores-still-jailed-idUSKBN1D40QW?il=0

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest.

The Seattle-based company said the Vancouver expansion has been in the works for some time and is not related to the hotly contested race by cities across North America to land the e-commerce company’s $5 billion HQ2.

“These will be largely software engineering, tech and non-tech jobs, and they’ll be contributing to products that are used globally,” Jesse Dougherty, general manager for the Vancouver office, told reporters.

The Vancouver expansion comes as companies in the United States have struggled to secure visas in a timely fashion to import foreign workers to fill highly skilled and technical jobs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it tougher for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more regularly than at nearly any point under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

“Amazon likes to hire the smartest people we can find, and so Vancouver certainly is a place where we like to get that growth,” said Dougherty.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock, and the prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings in future - including the IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf, as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly indicator of output for manufacturers, retailers and services companies remained at +11, its joint lowest level since June.

“Growth in the economy has remained relatively stable, although the pace of growth was a little slower than expected, particularly for retailers and manufacturers,” CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.

Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first half of 2017 although it picked up a bit of pace in the third quarter.

The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade on Thursday as it moved to head off what it sees as the inflationary impact of Brexit, even as it said economy will probably remain stuck in a slow gear over the next three years.

Output expectations for the next three months fell to +12 from +18 in September, the weakest reading since January.

The CBI said it expected growth to remain modest as inflation eats further into household spending power in late 2017 and early 2018 and uncertainty about Brexit dampens business investment next year.

Sie rechne zwar in den nächsten Tagen wieder mit schwierigen Beratungen, sagte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel am Freitag in Berlin. “Aber ich glaube nach wie vor, dass wir die Enden zusammenbinden können, wenn wir uns mühen und anstrengen.” Am Wochenende sollen nun alle vier Parteien die für sie wesentlichen Punkte einer gemeinsamen Regierung festlegen.

“Wir treffen uns dann am Montagabend, um das nebeneinander zu legen”, kündigte CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer mit Blick auf eine Spitzenrunde der Parteichefs und Verhandlungsführer an.

Vertreter aller vier Parteien gaben sich nach der Evaluierung des Sondierungsstandes optimistisch. So bilanzierte FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer ähnlich wie die Manager der anderen Parteien: “Nach einer teilweise anstrengenden, teilweise zähen, aber zum Schluss noch einmal sehr konstruktiven Woche glaube ich, ein guter Schlusspunkt, um dann ab Montag in den Gesprächen entsprechend fruchtbar weiterzumachen.”

DETAILARBEIT BEGINNT KOMMENDE WOCHE

In der abgelaufenen Sondierungsrunde ging es vor allem darum, in zwölf Themenfeldern Gemeinsamkeiten und Differenzen auszuarbeiten. Die Unterhändler verfehlten allerdings in den Bereichen Klimaschutz, Migration und Verkehr das Ziel, sich auf ein gemeinsames Papier zu einigen. Dies soll in den nächsten Tagen nachgeholt werden. Dann beginnt zudem die Detailarbeit, Kompromisse für die Meinungsverschiedenheiten zu finden und möglichst konkrete Leitplanken für die Arbeit einer möglichen Jamaika-Koalition zu definieren.

“Jetzt haben wir eine Fülle von Fakten auf dem Tisch”, sagte Merkel vor Beginn der Beratungen. Jetzt gehe es darum zu fragen, was wesentlich für den Abschluss von Sondierungsgesprächen sei. Sie betonte, jeder Partner müsse seine Identität zur Geltung bringen können. FDP-Chef Christian Lindner und CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt relativierten Differenzen bei den ersten Sondierungsrunden und bezeichneten sie als normal. Beide forderten aber mehr Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen ein. Die grüne Chef-Unterhändlerin Katrin Göring-Eckardt betonte dagegen, in den Bereichen Klima und Migration gebe es weiter sehr große Differenzen. Grünen-Parteichef Cem Özdemir wies jedoch auf Einigkeit in den Bereichen Bildung, Digitalisierung und Europa hin.

SEEHOFER LOBT SONDIERUNGSRUNDEN DER PARTEICHEFS

Die Parteichefs und Chefunterhändler hatten sich vor den Beratungen bereits zum dritten Mal zu einer kleinen Gesprächsrunde zusammengefunden. Nach Seehofers Worten sind diese Spitzenrunden ausschlaggebend für das Zustandekommen einer Jamaika-Koalition. “Natürlich müssen wir uns immer rückkoppeln mit unseren Parteien, aber entscheidend ist, wie die Parteivorsitzenden zusammenwirken.” Es sei “eigentlich immer eine sehr, sehr konstruktive, vertrauensvolle Gesprächsrunde” gewesen.

Im Themenbereich Außenpolitik bekannten sich CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne am Freitag zu einer aktiveren deutschen Rolle. Zudem streben sie im Fall einer gemeinsamen Regierung eine Vollbeschäftigung an. Trotzdem wurden auch am Freitag große Differenzen über den Klimaschutz deutlich. Der FDP-Chef bekannte sich zwar zu dem Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen 2030. Göring-Eckardt betonte dagegen, dass für die Grünen die ehrgeizigeren deutschen Ziele bis 2020 entscheidend seien. “Es ist eine Chance, wenn sich so unterschiedlichen Partner darauf verständigen, was gut für unser Land ist”, betonte sie. Lindner forderte, dass in der nächsten Sondierungsrunde die Parteispitzen die strategischen Vorgaben für Lösungswege vorgeben müssten.

Lindner wies zugleich die Kritik des bayerischen FDP-Chefs Albert Duin scharf zurück, der Jamaika als “Totgeburt” bezeichnet hatte. Duin habe keine Ahnung von den Verhandlungen. “Wir haben extrem starke Nerven, sind sehr strapazierfähig und haben Freude am politischen Austausch”, sagte er zudem auf die Frage, ob Neuwahlen drohten. “Ich glaube nicht, dass die Bevölkerung das gut fände”, sagte CDU-Vize Julia Klöckner. Schleswig-Holsteins Ministerpräsident Daniel Günther wies Neuwahl-Drohungen des FDP-Politikers Wolfgang Kubicki zurück. “Davon halte ich nichts, davon habe ich auch nichts gehalten, als Wolfgang Kubicki das Gleiche in Schleswig-Holstein zwischendurch einmal gemacht hat”, sagte Günther, der im nördlichen Bundesland selbst eine Jamaika-Koalition führt.",Jamaika-Sondierer ziehen positive Zwischenbilanz,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-merkel-idDEKBN1D3117

TV3 via REUTERS

Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels.

In Spain’s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago.

Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.

“It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,” Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box.

Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont’s tweet.

EVENLY SPLIT

In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately.

That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.

If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid’s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed.

Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December.

Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election.

JAILED POLITICIANS

The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.

“It is up to the state to show it’s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,” she said.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont’s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions.

Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.

Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.

Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.

“Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don’t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.”

While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.

“To pick someone up and arrest them is not politics. Politics is talking, discussing. To arrest some, it seems to me a little bit like a fascist government,” Barcelona resident Cristiano Gonzalez, 34, said.

The Seattle-based company said the Vancouver expansion has been in the works for some time and is not related to the hotly contested race by cities across North America to land the e-commerce company’s $5 billion HQ2.

“These will be largely software engineering, tech and non-tech jobs, and they’ll be contributing to products that are used globally,” Jesse Dougherty, general manager for the Vancouver office, told reporters.

The Vancouver expansion comes as companies in the United States have struggled to secure visas in a timely fashion to import foreign workers to fill highly skilled and technical jobs.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it tougher for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more regularly than at nearly any point under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Trump on Friday repeated his urgings that the Justice Department and FBI investigate Clinton.
“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he said on Twitter.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not remember much about a meeting last year with a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty last month as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.

Asked about a meeting in which aide George Papadopoulos suggested arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told reporters: “I don’t remember much about that meeting. It was a very unimportant meeting.”

According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Papadopoulos said at the meeting of foreign policy advisers in March 2016 “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.”

A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting at the same table with Trump as well as Jeff Sessions, now Trump’s attorney general, and several others.

Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. His plea was made public this week.

Sessions is under pressure from Senate Democrats to testify again about the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee, Sessions has denied knowing anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries.

The president spoke before leaving for a trip to Asia, where his domestic woes are expected to dog him. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and Moscow denies interfering in the 2016 election.

Sessions is also under pressure from his boss, who has made clear he thinks the Department of Justice should look into his former presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and her campaign’s behavior with the Democratic National Committee during the presidential primary race.

Trump told reporters on Friday that many people were unhappy with the Department of Justice, including him.

Those comments followed remarks he made during “The Larry O’Connor Show” on WMAL radio in which he lamented not having more say in the department’s work.

“The saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I’m not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated by that,” he said.

Trump on Friday repeated his urgings that the Justice Department and FBI investigate Clinton.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he said on Twitter.

His comments elicited criticism from several U.S. senators.

“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has frequently sparred with Trump, said in a statement.

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said: “We can’t allow ourselves to become numb to the president of the United States calling on independent law enforcement organizations to investigate his political opponents. That’s characteristic of authoritarian regimes, not democracies, and it needs to stop.”

Trump has expressed frustration repeatedly over the Russia investigation, which has overshadowed his administration, at times referring to it as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”

Federal investigators this week charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another ex-aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. In a court filing on Friday, Mueller estimated he would need three weeks to present his case against Manafort and Gates if it went to trial.

Both men pleaded not guilty.

Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said in a filing on Friday that he would challenge what he called “evidence improperly obtained by search warrant, subpoena or otherwise.” FBI agents seized documents and other material from Manafort’s Virginia home in a July raid.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the Bank of Canada would be “mildly encouraged” by the increase in year-over-year wage growth.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Separate trade data for September was much gloomier, possibly tempering the central bank’s enthusiasm for a third rate hike in quick succession.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$3.00 billion. Since Statscan started compiling trade data in 1946, exports and imports never both declined for four months in a row.

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc T.N..

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.” He said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with “significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

Legal experts also said earlier this year that it was difficult to predict whether the current administration would be more receptive of a deal.

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but the project has faced a two-year delay due to planning objections.

In a meeting on Thursday, Cook did not commit to going ahead with it, Varadkar told state broadcaster RTE.

“We didn’t get a start date, or a definite commitment or anything like that,” said Varadkar, who is on a tour of the United States to meet investors, adding he had told Cook that the government would do “anything within our power” to facilitate the resumption of the project.

Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centers as a means of securing their presence in the country.

Puigdemont, que foi para a Bélgica depois de seu governo ter sido destituído após uma declaração unilateral de independência, disse na sexta-feira que está considerando concorrer nas eleições, mesmo estando em Bruxelas.

Em meio à mais grave crise política da Espanha desde o retorno da democracia, no fim da década de 1970, o primeiro-ministro, Mariano Rajoy, convocou uma eleição depois da intervenção na Catalunha, ocorrida há uma semana.

Os partidos políticos que desejarem formar uma coalizão têm até a terça-feira para registrar suas chapas, e até 18 de novembro para anunciar seus candidatos.

Pesquisa publicada na terça-feira mostrou que a coalizão pró-independência Juntos pel Si ganharia a eleição se ela fosse realizada hoje, com 35,2 por cento das preferências.

Esse resultado daria a eles novamente uma maioria parlamentar pela independência, caso o grupo mantenha sua atual aliança com o CUP, de extrema-esquerda.

A rica região noroeste da Espanha continua dividida entre os que apoiam a separação e os que querer manter as terras catalãs como parte da Espanha, mostraram pesquisas tomadas desde a declaração de independência.

Se os partidos pró-independência se separarem, pode ficar difícil formar uma maioria parlamentar, embora a prisão de ex-membros do governo possa unir o eleitorado crítico a Madri, visto como poder demasiadamente repressor.

São candidatos pró-Espanha os do Partido Popular (PP), de Rajoy, os Socialistas e o Ciudadanos, legenda pró-mercado. Tais partidos realizaram pequenas manifestações neste sábado, pedindo que a chamada maioria silenciosa vote em massa em dezembro.

Na quinta-feira, nove membros do gabinete de Puigdemont receberam ordem de prisão preventiva pela Suprema Corte espanhola, enquanto são investigados e podem ser denunciados. Um membro do ministério dissolvido, Santi Vila, foi solto na sexta-feira, após pagar fiança de 50 mil euros. Os outros oito permanecem presos.

Na sexta-feira, a Espanha emitiu o mandado de prisão contra Puigdemont e quatro assessores por rebelião, incitação de motim, malversação de dinheiro público, desobediência e quebra de confiança, todas acusações relacionadas à campanha pela independência.

O grupo cívico catalão Asamblea Nacional Catalana y Omnium Cultural, cujos líderes foram presos no mês passado sob acusação de motim, convocaram uma greve geral no dia 8 e uma grande manifestação no dia 11, em protesto contra as detenções.

Puigdemont afirmou que não voltará à Espanha até receber garantias de Madri.

At issue is Draghi’s membership of the so-called Group of 30, where policymakers meet bankers, fund managers and academics behind closed doors to discuss economic issues.

He sits alongside former and current central bankers, such as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and the Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman.

Responding to a question from the European Union’s ombudsman, or transparency watchdog, the ECB said it was up to the group to decide whether to start publishing the content of its meetings.

“For G30 meetings, it is primarily for the G30 to decide on the level of transparency of its discussions,” it said in the response to one of 16 questions.

Ombudsman Emily O‘Reilly had asked whether the ECB would “consider proactively informing the public of the content of these meetings, providing agendas and non-confidential summaries” of G30 events.

The ombudsman was responding to a complaint by activist group Corporate Europe Observatory, which said in January it was concerned about proximity at the G30 of ECB officials and bankers they are meant to supervise.

These include directors from Spain’s Santander (SAN.MC), Germany’s Bayerische Landesbank and U.S. giant JPMorgan (JPM.N), whose Luxembourg subsidiary is supervised by the ECB.

The chairman of UBS (UBSG.S), Axel Weber, and the chief executive of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Tidjane Thiam - two Swiss banks with several subsidiaries in the euro zone - are also members of the G30.

The ECB, which publishes the text of the speeches given by Draghi and other board members at the G30, said such meetings -- which are announced in advance as taking place -- were in the public interest because they helped inform its decisions on monetary policy.

“In an environment where proper safeguards are in place and respected, such interactions positively contribute to the ECB’s ability to fulfill its mandate – which, in turn, is in the public interest,” the ECB said.

It said the G30 had become more transparent since the complaint, filming and publishing one of its debates and allowing the media to a recent seminar.

In its response to O‘Reilly, the ECB also announced plans to hold regular meetings with entrepreneurs outside the financial sector, a concession to critics who say it is too close to the industry it is supposed to oversee.

CEO, the activist group, said in a report last month that the vast majority of seats available on the ECB’s advisory groups were taken by financial sector representatives.

Draghi has been a member of the G30 since 2006, when he was still the governor of the Bank of Italy.

UEFA’s Nations League starts next September and features four divisions of national teams, replacing friendlies with competitive fixtures.

While the format has yet to be tested, the idea of a similar style of competition has already been under consideration at CONCACAF, which governs the sport in North and Central America and the Caribbean.

With UEFA’s competition set to fill the international dates left for friendly games, teams in other confederations will find it difficult to get windows for games against European nations.

Responding to reports that UEFA was talking with other confederations, the global governing body said it was directly involved in the discussions.

“FIFA has been always involved from the beginning in the process. Thanks to the cooperative atmosphere FIFA will continue to have constructive discussions about the next steps together with UEFA and the other confederations,” the global governing body said in a statement.

UEFA said it had begun the process of consultation with all concerned bodies.

”UEFA can confirm that it has initiated discussions regarding the evolution of the UEFA Nations League. These constructive discussions involve our national associations, European football stakeholders, all confederations and of course FIFA, with whom we have a very good relationship.

“We have included them in discussions on this topic since the start. No decisions have been made at this time,” it said in a statement.

CONCACAF did not respond to a request for comment but in April their president Victor Montagliani told Reuters that the body was well on the way to creating its own version of UEFA’s competition.

“There has been overwhelming acceptance that it is a great idea and the way we need to go. There are a few formats that we have looked at and we have had various members coming back with ideas,” he said.

“What people need to realize is that the world of friendlies is going to change, with Europe changing to the Nations League, it is going to get harder to get friendlies,” said Montagliani who believes that will be no great loss.

While discussions are at a relatively early stage, one of the ideas that has been floated in media reports is for regional ‘leagues’ with a mini-tournament involving the winners from across the world.

Such mini-tournaments could also be held for teams from the lower divisions from different confederations, creating a sort of ‘minnows World Cup’.",FIFA and confederations look at expanding UEFA's Nations League,https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-nationsleague/fifa-and-confederations-look-at-expanding-uefas-nations-league-idINKBN1D40HX

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

O exame de Guerrero deu positivo para um estimulante após a partida Argentina-Peru em 15 de outubro e recebeu uma suspensão preliminar de 30 dias, informou a Federação peruana de Futebol na sexta-feira.

Com a proibição é quase certo que ele não participe da primeira partida contra a Nova Zelândia, em Wellington, em 11 de novembro e a partida de retorno em Lima, quatro dias depois. O vencedor garantirá um lugar na Copa do Mundo do próximo ano na Rússia.

“Na seleção estamos cientes do controle antidoping”, disse o médico Julio Segura à Rádio Nacional do Peru. “Não usamos substâncias que produzam doping. É uma pena o que aconteceu com Paolo, mas estou certo de que não houve nenhum problema do nosso lado”.

La rete di distributori di carburanti e gli asset nella raffinazione sono stati venduti ad Api (Anonima Petroli Italiana); in questa joint venture Erg aveva il 51% e Total il 49%.

Total, inoltre, ha messo fine alla joint venture con Erg nei lubrificanti, comprando il 51% che faceva capo alla società italiana.

Creata nel 2010, TotalErg è il quarto operatore nella distribuzione di carburanti in Italia. Un mercato che Total giudica “frammentato” e in cui, pertanto, “le prospettive di profittabilità non sono all‘altezza delle attese del gruppo, malgrado gli sforzi degli azionisti”.

In una nota, Erg ricorda che il perimetro dell‘operazione comprende circa 2.600 stazioni di servizio della rete, il polo logistico di Roma e il 25,16% della raffineria di Trecate.

Nel comunicato che annuncia l‘operazione, Total sottolinea che “il mercato dei lubrificanti offre prospettive di crescita soddisfacenti”.

L‘importo complessivo che Erg incasserà per l‘equity value dalla transazione è pari a 273 milioni. Cifra che comprende i dividendi straordinari distribuiti da TotalErg per complessivi 71 milioni e una componente differita di 36 milioni, regolata da un ‘vendor loan agreement’ con scadenza a cinque anni e mezzo, sottoscritto con Api.

Commentando l‘operazione, l‘AD di Erg, Luca Bettonte, spiega che la cessione è “coerente con la nostra strategia e il nostro ruolo di produttori di energia verde, ci permette di rafforzare ulteriormente la capacità finanziaria al fine di proseguire il nostro percorso di crescita nelle rinnovabili”.

Il gruppo francese resta presente in Italia nella distribuzione di carburanti attraverso AS24, la rete dedicata ai mezzi pesanti, e nel segmento del rifornimento agli aerei.

Api, tramite un comunicato, afferma che dopo l‘acquisizione disporrà di oltre 5.000 punti vendita e raggiungerà un fatturato aggregato di circa 6 miliardi di euro.

“L‘acquisizione ci consente di raggiungere la dimensione produttiva, logistica e commerciale necessarie per perseguire la nostra strategia di sviluppo che ha al centro il cliente”, commenta il presidente di Api, Ugo Brachetti Peretti. “Vogliamo essere al fianco degli italiani ovunque avranno bisogno di energia e servizi per muoversi, con un‘offerta sempre più ampia, innovativa e vantaggiosa”.

Nell‘operazione, Erg è stata assistita da Hsbc (financial advisor), DLA Piper (legal advisor) ed Ernst & Young (accounting & tax).

UniCredit è stata financial advisor di Api. Ubi Banca e Banco Bpm hanno sostenuto Api come joint financial advisor nella definizione della capital structure del gruppo e nella strutturazione del finanziamento. Lo studio Bonelli Erede ha assistito Api come legal advisor.

The index provider will no longer add shares of stocks to its ACWI IMI and U.S. Investable Market 2500 Indexes if the company restricts which topics an investors can vote on or treats their vote as less valuable than those of a privileged insider, such as the company’s founder.

The ban will apply until the index provider consults with investors on how and whether to apply a “one share, one vote” principle across its equity benchmarks. Stocks currently in the indexes will not be affected by the ban.

Snap Inc, which owns the messaging app Snapchat, made waves when it went public in a $3.4 billion offering in March with a class of common stock granting no voting rights, and it was later excluded from some market indexes.

But a move to ban Snap and companies like it from its benchmarks would put MSCI at odds with its biggest client, BlackRock Inc. The world’s largest asset manager with nearly $6 trillion, BlackRock offers funds that track indexes, and it has said that excluding companies could hurt its investors’ returns.

On Thursday they said the “majority” of the institutional investors they consulted supported excluding shares that do not offer equal voting rights.

“Many international institutional investors highlighted that they now consider the ‘one share, one vote’ principle part of their definition of common equity for publicly listed companies,” MSCI said in a statement.

“At the same time, a minority of participants were strongly against the exclusion of non-voting shares from equity benchmarks and expressed concerns that this would result in equity benchmarks that less clearly represent the overall opportunity set. These participants often argued that it should be the role of regulators or stock exchanges rather than index providers, such as MSCI, to address the issue of unequal voting structures, including non-voting shares.”

FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC said in July they would exclude Snap and companies with similar structures from certain stock indexes, citing concerns over their lack of voting rights.

Japan has fared better following the U.S. election than might have been expected. Abe rushed to meet Trump soon after he won and has since maintained close contact. The result has been a better rapport than most world leaders enjoy with the disrupter-in-chief. And despite Trump’s hatred of trade imbalances, his transactional worldview, and radical suggestions during the campaign about Asian security, America has recommitted to the longstanding alliance.

The latest face-to-face talks are likely to focus on the threat across the Sea of Japan. That makes sense: both men take a similarly dim view of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And Tokyo fears being surprised by a U.S. strike, which could have unpredictable consequences.

Abe mostly likes the economic status quo, though. Maintaining it will be a challenge given Trump’s instincts, and the $57 billion trade surplus Japan ran last year with the United States. Tokyo does not want a bilateral trade deal forcing down the gap by opening up sensitive markets such as rice. It prefers bigger pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it has helped stitch back together after the U.S. withdrawal. Any pressure to strengthen the yen, now comfortably weak at 114 per dollar, would also be worrying. It could derail a lengthening upturn in growth.

As Takuji Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors notes, Abe already has successfully separated the “potentially thorny trade issues” from the top political relationship. These are now being handled separately by Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy PM Taro Aso.

The arrangement turns such matters into slower-burn, more technocratic issues. That has been yielding small wins for both sides: most recently on persimmons and potatoes, for example.

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

They party hard and work harder, until she gets pregnant and realises they aren’t ready for parenthood.

Handout photo

This first romantic movie cliché is introduced within the first 15 minutes, and from then on, the tired tropes don’t stop. The crying baby, the search for a perfect nanny, the sleepless nights - Sandilya makes sure we see them all. Sahana is apparently a star employee at her workplace, but is treated like a daily-wage labourer. She is not granted paid maternity leave, and when she comes back to work after having her baby, her position has been given to someone else. We see her balancing client presentations and breast pumping schedules, even as Karan plays the role of the supportive spouse. And when she dares ask for three days of leaves to take care of her daughter, Aashi (Kierra Soni), she is fired from her job.

Because a working mother seems to be an anomaly in Sandilya’s world, no one is willing to give a top performer like Sahana a job, and Karan is forced to take up a project in a neighbouring city to support the family. But the real test of their relationship comes when they are forced to deal with an incident involving their daughter. In the absence of the proverbial village, Sahana and Karan find that raising a child alone in a city throws up more challenges than they had anticipated.

Given that these are problems most urban couples face, the subject matter could veer towards being either relatable or banal. In the case of “Ribbon”, it is the latter. Sandilya’s style is prosaic and the narrative staccato. We trudge from one mini-crisis to another, but there is never quite an insight into the life of modern-day couples or the pressures of parenting in urban India. The vantage point that the audience has been given is only interesting for a while, even though Koechlin and Vyas seem capable enough for their roles. Sandilya’s attempt at giving us a glimpse into the unseen pressures of urban life is commendable, but the story has neither meat nor heft to keep the audience interested.",Movie Review: Ribbon,https://in.reuters.com/article/review-ribbon/movie-review-ribbon-idINKBN1D30JM

The Manus island center, and one on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, have been key parts of Australia’s disputed “Sovereign Borders” immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.

Australia’s offshore detention policies have been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but are backed the center-right government and the Labor opposition.

Damrey reached land at 4 a.m. local time (2100 GMT on Friday) with winds gusting at up to 90 kmph (56 mph) that tore off more than 1,000 roofs, knocked down hundreds of electricity poles and uprooted trees.

There were reports of high winds and rain in Danang, but no immediate reports of casualties. The city will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10 as well as China’s Xi Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members.

Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover, a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution, appeared higher than in recent years when Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran.

Last month, Trump broke ranks with European allies, Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran’s compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reached during Obama’s tenure. Under that deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs.

Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “shred” the pact if the United States pulls out.

”All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, told a rally in Tehran, state media reported.

“Trump’s policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today,” Shamkhani said.

He did not identify the governments he had in mind. The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump’s opposition to it, fearing this could stir new Middle East instability.

But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing” regional behavior.

Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic’s missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable.

In a sign of defiance, a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran, now a cultural center, during Saturday’s street demonstration, Tasnim news agency said.

“That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream,” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development, according to Tasnim.

Fars news agency posted pictures of demonstrators nearby burning an effigy of Trump and holding up signs saying “Death to America”.

Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations soon after the 1979 revolution, during which hardline students seized the embassy and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

Shamkhani spoke a few days after Khamenei said the United States was the “number one enemy” of the Islamic Republic.

U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen anew at a time when Tehran has been improving political and military ties with Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran on Wednesday. Khamenei told him that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help defuse conflict in the Middle East.

Iran and Russia are both fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar al Assad against rebels, some of them U.S.-backed, and Islamist militants trying to overthrow him.","Iran displays missile, calls Trump 'crazy' in marking 1979 U.S. embassy takeover",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D40F8-OCATP

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

Netflix’s move to cut ties with Spacey went beyond “House of Cards.”

The company will not release the film “Gore,” which was in post-production and was produced by Spacey, its statement said.

Il Rosatellum bis configura un sistema elettorale misto, nel quale i parlamentari saranno eletti per un terzo in collegi uninominali e per i restanti due terzi in collegi plurinominali con listini brevi, senza preferenze.

Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover, a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution, appeared higher than in recent years when Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran.

Last month, Trump broke ranks with European allies, Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran’s compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reached during Obama’s tenure. Under that deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs.

Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “shred” the pact if the United States pulls out.

”All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, told a rally in Tehran, state media reported.

“Trump’s policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today,” Shamkhani said.

He did not identify the governments he had in mind. The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump’s opposition to it, fearing this could stir new Middle East instability.

But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing” regional behavior.

Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic’s missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable.

In a sign of defiance, a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran, now a cultural center, during Saturday’s street demonstration, Tasnim news agency said.

“That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream,” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development, according to Tasnim.

Fars news agency posted pictures of demonstrators nearby burning an effigy of Trump and holding up signs saying “Death to America”.

Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations soon after the 1979 revolution, during which hardline students seized the embassy and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

Shamkhani spoke a few days after Khamenei said the United States was the “number one enemy” of the Islamic Republic.

U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen anew at a time when Tehran has been improving political and military ties with Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran on Wednesday. Khamenei told him that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help defuse conflict in the Middle East.

Iran and Russia are both fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar al Assad against rebels, some of them U.S.-backed, and Islamist militants trying to overthrow him.","Iran displays missile, calls Trump 'crazy' in marking 1979 U.S. embassy takeover",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa/iran-displays-missile-calls-trump-crazy-in-marking-1979-u-s-embassy-takeover-idUSKBN1D40F8?il=0

Few on the streets of capital Caracas really understood unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro’s announcement this week that he would seek to refinance the oil-rich nation’s heavy bond burden of $60 billion - or about $2,000 per person.

But those interviewed by Reuters said they were hoping any deals between the government and its multiple foreign creditors would free up foreign currency to increase imports of scarce food, medicine, and basic products.

“Maybe it will work, and improve the country,” said Johny Vargas, 53, a construction worker who says he often only eats twice a day because his salary is gobbled up by price increases.

“Everything is so expensive. There’s no food, nothing. Maduro’s useless. Look at the bad state we’re in.”

Up to now, Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party has prioritized debt payments by slashing imports, compounding four years of recession and shortages on the shelves.

Should a debt renegotiation be reached, it could free more money in the short-term for the government to bring in basic foods and medicines.

But Wall Street is skeptical, and so are many Venezuelans.

“We can’t have strong negotiations. We don’t have the credibility to sit down and make requests,” said 35 year-old accountant Mayerling Delgado, referring to Venezuela’s increasingly fraught relations with many other countries.

“So we have to pay,” she added in a resigned tone, in a busy Caracas plaza.

Experts have long warned that debt accrued under late leader Hugo Chavez was unsustainable, and urged Maduro’s government to refinance its debt load.

But pursuing such an operation now is near impossible given Venezuela’s economic mess, a dearth of technocrats in the government, and, especially, sanctions that bar U.S. banks from participating in or negotiating new Venezuelan debt deals.

NOT PAYING IS WORSE?

Most Venezuelans balk at the idea of a default, which would trigger lawsuits by creditors seeking to seize assets such as refineries in the United States. That could plunge the OPEC nation of 30 million people into even worse hardship.

“The majority of the population has consistently perceived a default as a negative move that could hurt the country’s economy,” said economist Luis Vicente Leon of pollster Datanalisis.

But with many analysts viewing a default as ultimately unavoidable given the parlous state of Venezuela’s coffers, some said it might be better to bite the bullet.

“What’s the science behind paying when you’ve already lost? It’s not what we as Venezuelans want ... but there’s no other way out, unfortunately,” said beautician Harlee Tovitto, 42. She plans to emigrate to neighboring Colombia soon because she can no longer afford clothes or insurance for her three children.

Amid a deepening spat with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, some Venezuelans think Caracas would find a way out of its bond mess if it weren’t for the U.S. sanctions.

“If Venezuela has always paid its debt ... why can’t they refinance?,” said Rafael Moreno, 30, a lawyer and former Chavez supporter who now says he does not back either the government or opposition.","Unversed in debt details, Venezuelans desperate for any relief",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-bonds-reaction/unversed-in-debt-details-venezuelans-desperate-for-any-relief-idUKKBN1D40H3?il=0

Trump, who is on a 12-day trip, is to speak to U.S. and Japanese forces at Yokota air base shortly after arriving in Japan on Sunday and looked to stress the importance of the alliance to regional security.

Ballistic missile tests by North Korea and its sixth and largest nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, have exacerbated the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

Aerial drills conducted over South Korea by two U.S. strategic bombers have raised tensions in recent days.

In a display of golf diplomacy, Trump is to play a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders also played together in Florida earlier this year.

Trump will also have a state call with the Imperial Family at Akasaka Palace during his visit. Abe and Trump will meet families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.

Joined by his wife Melania on part of the trip, Trump’s tour of Asia is the longest by an American president since George H.W. Bush in 1992. Besides Japan, he will visit South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Trump departed Hawaii for Japan aboard Air Force One shortly before 7:27 a.m. Hawaii time (1727 GMT).

En route to Hawaii’s Hickham Air Force Base, Trump’s motorcade stopped briefly at the Trump International Hotel Waikiki.

”It has been a tremendously successful project and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.

Trump extended the trip by a day on Friday when he agreed to participate in a summit of East Asian nations in Manila.

His trip got off to a colorful start in Hawaii. He was taken by boat out to the USS Arizona Memorial, where lies the World War Two ship that was sunk by the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.

The Trumps tossed white flower petals into the waters at the memorial in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.

TRADE, NORTH KOREA

Trump’s trip is to be dominated by trade and how to muster more international pressure on North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

“We’ll be talking about trade,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. “We’ll be talking about obviously North Korea. We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot of people and countries and we’ll see what happens. But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

Trump has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster, briefing reporters on Friday, defended Trump’s colorful language.

“What’s inflammatory is the North Korean regime and what they’re doing to threaten the world,” McMaster said.

Trump will seek a united front with the leaders of Japan and South Korea against North Korea before visiting Beijing to make the case to Chinese President Xi Jinping that he should do more to rein in Pyongyang.

Trade will factor heavily during Trump’s trip as he tries to persuade Asian allies to agree to trade policies more favorable to the United States.

A centerpiece of the trip will be a visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, where he will deliver a speech in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is seen as offering a bulwark in response to expansionist Chinese policies.",Trump heads to Japan with North Korea on his mind,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D4061-OCATP

Unlike the original 1969 film with the same title, Chopra adopts a Rashomon-like approach in his remake. Vikram Sethi (Siddharth Malhotra) is a renowned author whose wife is found dead in her hotel room. Under suspicion for murder, he goes on the run and lands up at Maya’s (Sonakshi Sinha) doorstep. Next, we find Maya’s husband lying dead in their tastefully done-up living room with a fatal wound on the head. She claims Vikram killed her husband, but Vikram tells police that the man was likely dead before he arrived.

Caught in the middle of these two versions is detective Dev (Akshaye Khanna). The wry and straight-talking policeman has to sift through the many clues and red herrings in his path, and he does so in style.

Khanna is undoubtedly the star of this film. He gets the best lines and delivers them with panache - trademark half-scowl and deadpan wit in place. Both Vikram and Maya are merely supporting characters who hinder Dev’s pursuit of the truth, and that is a good thing.

Malhotra and Sinha don’t have the acting chops to match Khanna, and seem happy to let him take center stage. Michal Luka’s cinematography is on point, painting Mumbai in apocalyptic, gloomy monsoon colours that go well with the tone of the film.

Russia and Saudi Arabia are leading a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut global oil production, with the aim of propping up oil prices.

“The states-participant signified satisfaction of reducing commercial stocks of oil and stated their readiness to continue (to make) join efforts towards such a direction”, the statement said.

OPEC, Russia and other oil producers are due to meet at the end of November in Vienna to decide whether to extend the current supply-cut pact.

According to the Russian Energy Ministry, the formerly Soviet state Turkmenistan will take part at the meeting as an observer.

Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih said after the meeting that more work was needed to cut inventories.

“There is a general satisfaction with the strategy of 24 countries that signed a declaration of cooperation”.

“Everybody recognizes that (the) job is not done yet by any means, we still have significant amount of work to do to bring inventories down. Mission is not yet complete, more needs to be done,” he added.

He said members of the global pact he had spoken with have expressed the same views.

“This is the same sentiment I’ve heard yesterday from (Kazakh) President (Nursultan) Nazarbayev, this is the same sentiment I’ve heard from all the oil-producing members of the Asia energy ministers’ round table”, he said.

Officials from Malaysia, Ecuador, Nigeria and Libya have also given him similar feedback, Falih said.

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but the project has faced a two-year delay due to planning objections.

The Polish government, whose judiciary reform has been met with youth protests and legal action from the European Union, had accused German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen of interference after she called for supporting “the healthy democratic resistance of the young generation” in Poland.

But a spokesman for von der Leyen said the comments had been misinterpreted and the minister had instead praised Poland’s achievements since the fall of communism and called for a more inclusive approach to European integration.

“The defense minister’s quote was changed in social media and ripped out of context,” a spokesman for von der Leyen told Reuters on Saturday.

“Mrs von der Leyen has emphasized that the EU is an inclusive process, which is about securing and consolidating the common values of the EU and dealing with all positions.”

The Polish reform of the courts would give nearly a free hand to the ruling conservatives in picking the country’s top judges.

It has triggered protests by thousands of young people and others over the summer and an “infringement procedure” from the European Union.

It comes as some European leaders call for letting some member states in the wealthier, Western part of the bloc push ahead with further integration without the others following suit.

During the show broadcast Thursday on ZDF television, von der Leyen highlighted significant efforts undertaken by the Baltic states and Poland to “live in freedom” and to be part of the European Union.

“Precisely this healthy democratic resistance of the young people, also there in Poland, must be supported,” she said.

Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski called on von der Leyen to withdraw her words.

“This is one of the most explicit statements, which I am not sure whether it is a warning or an admission by the German side of interfering into our internal affairs,” Waszczykowski told the wpolitice.pl right-wing news portal.

The Polish defense ministry said it would summon the defense attache from the German embassy for an explanation.

Ces problèmes “freinent le développement humain dans son ensemble”, souligne cette étude annuelle qui porte sur 140 pays.

Ses auteurs appellent à un changement radical d‘attitude dans la lutte contre cette menace pour la santé mondiale et soulignent la nécessité d‘augmenter les financements permettant de traiter ce double problème.

Plus de 155 millions d‘enfants de moins de cinq ans sont en retard de croissance à cause d‘un manque de nourriture et 52 millions ont un poids insuffisant par rapport à leur taille, souligne le rapport.

A l‘inverse, la suralimentation est en hausse partout dans le monde. Deux milliards de personnes sont en surpoids ou obèses sur les sept milliards d‘habitants que compte la planète. En Amérique du Nord, un tiers des hommes et des femmes sont obèses.

Les jeunes sont également touchés : 41 millions d‘enfants de moins de cinq ans sont considérés comme trop gros, indique le rapport. Dans la seule Afrique, quelque 10 millions d‘enfants sont désormais considérés en surpoids.

“Historiquement, l‘anémie maternelle et la sous-nutrition de l‘enfant ont été considérés comme des problèmes distincts de l‘obésité et des maladies non transmissibles”, commente Jessica Fanzo, professeur à l‘université Johns Hopkins de Baltimore (Etats-Unis) qui a co-dirigé le rapport.

“La réalité est qu‘ils sont intimement liés et dus aux inégalités partout dans le monde. C‘est pourquoi les gouvernements doivent les aborder globalement et non pas comme des problèmes distincts.”

Si la sous-alimentation est globalement en recul dans le monde, elle ne diminue pas suffisamment vite pour qu‘elle ait disparu à l‘horizon 2030 conformément à l‘objectif que s‘est fixé la communauté internationale.

Pour cela, le rapport appelle à un triplement des financements liés à l‘alimentation. Ceux-ci ont augmenté de 2% en 2015 pour atteindre 867 millions de dollars (746 millions d‘euros) mais le rapport estime qu‘ils devront tripler pour atteindre 70 milliards de dollars sur les dix prochaines années.","Près d'un tiers de la population mondiale en surpoids, selon un rapport",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1D40BY-OFRTP

REUTERS/Toru Yamanaka/Pool/File Photo

While veteran State Department Asia hand Joseph Yun might be Washington’s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a devastating war on the Korean peninsula, he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle Pyongyang.

On the other side, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong Un, shows little interest in negotiating either, at least not until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Despite the daunting obstacles, South Korean-born Yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand-off, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials and South Korean diplomats.

Most were deeply skeptical about his chances.

“He’s such a dreamer,” a White House official said, with a note of sarcasm.

“We don’t think this is going anywhere,” said another U.S. official, although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the North Koreans as long as Yun does not appear to be undermining President Donald Trump’s public rejection of direct negotiations.

Trump has told aides that his military threats will drive North Korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs, four White House officials said, a view not shared among most U.S. intelligence agencies.

Yun, however, is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korean officials at the United Nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of U.S. citizens, a senior State Department official told Reuters this week. In June, he secured the release of U.S. student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the United States in a coma and died days later.

‘RUNNING OUT OF TIME’

Trump headed to Asia on Friday as a senior aide warned the world is “running out of time” on the North Korea crisis. Behind the scenes, Yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict.

Further aggravating tensions, two U.S. strategic bombers conducted drills over South Korea on Thursday. That followed word from South Korea’s spy agency that North Korea may be preparing another missile launch.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

In the midst of this is Yun, a soft-spoken, 32-year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago, near the end of the Obama administration.

He is grappling with Trump’s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president’s top aides over whether saber-rattling will force Kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Concern about Yun’s difficulties has surfaced in Seoul, where he visits regularly and where Trump will travel next week on the second stop of his Asian tour.

Several South Korean officials expressed worry that Yun’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea lack any real underpinning of support from the White House.

“Things are clearly not easy for him,” one South Korean diplomat said. “Yun is precisely that person (to talk to North Korea), but Trump is killing the whole process.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Sept. 30 the United States was probing for a diplomatic opening, only to be slapped down by Trump, who told him via Twitter this was a waste of time.

REUTERS/Toru Yamanaka/Pool/File Photo

At the same time, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who regularly briefs Trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on North Korea in the president’s inner circle, has apparently gained stature.

Several officials familiar with those discussions say Pompeo is feeding Trump assessments that U.S. military threats will force Kim to bow to U.S. demands for nuclear disarmament, a position that some U.S. intelligence officers privately contest.

The CIA declined comment.

NORTH KOREAN NEGOTIATOR ‘SHOCKED’

A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Yun has become diplomatically “untethered,” not fully connected to a core U.S. approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy.

The one tangible achievement of Yun’s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of 22-year-old Warmbier in secret talks with North Korean officials in Oslo and New York. Yun flew to Pyongyang in June to medically evacuate Warmbier.

When Choe Son Hui, head of the North Korean foreign ministry’s North America bureau, met Yun in Oslo, she was unaware of how serious Warmbier’s condition was, a source in Washington knowledgeable about the matter said.

KCNA/via REUTERS.

But once she learned about it she was “shocked” and Yun was summoned urgently to meet a North Korean diplomat in New York, which quickly led to Warmbier’s return home, the source said.

Warmbier’s death complicated Yun’s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time, the State Department official said.

STUMBLING IN THE DARK

Despite Trump’s threats of military action against Pyongyang, the State Department official said Yun’s view was “the less you engage diplomatically, the more likely you are in the dark.”

Even so, Trump’s rhetoric has raised questions among allies, and possibly even in North Korea, about how serious, if at all, his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate Yun may have to pursue it.

Trump “personalized” the conflict – deriding Kim as “Little Rocket Man” - against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts, some of whom warned it could be counterproductive, a senior national security official said.

Another official pointed out, however, that Trump, who in May said he would be honored to meet Kim, had not hurled any fresh insults at Kim in recent days, raising hopes for an altered approach.

A South Korean official in Seoul said it was necessary for Washington to have someone in contact with North Korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold.

But Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told Japan’s NHK television this week: “What we cannot afford to do is enter into these long, drawn-out negotiations that allow North Korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs.”

Former U.S. negotiators sympathize with Yun, whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug-of-war between a White House breathing fire and a State Department pushing a peaceful solution.

“Nobody doubted my authority,” said Wendy Sherman, one of the lead U.S. negotiators who achieved the 2015 deal under which

Iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. “All of this undermines our ability to do the job.”

Robert Gallucci, who was chief U.S. negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994 and has had recent contact with Yun, said the envoy is “realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere, including the tone set by the president, but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism.”",'He's such a dreamer:' Skepticism dogs U.S. envoy's North Korean peace efforts,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-diplomacy-insight/hes-such-a-dreamer-skepticism-dogs-u-s-envoys-north-korean-peace-efforts-idUSKBN1D32BL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-pm-hariri-resigns-attacking-iran-and-hezbollah-idUKKBN1D40DN?il=0

“Eu tenho bastante consciência de que muitas pessoas tenham uma certa expectativa de um candidato que defenda esta linha de atuação e que ao mesmo tempo tenha experiência. Mas, no momento, como eu disse, eu não estou pensando nesse assunto. Eu estou focado na economia”, completou.

Nesta sexta-feira, o ministro reconheceu que a sensação de melhora ainda não é generalizada na economia e atribuiu essa percepção ao fato de o país ter enfrentado a maior recessão de sua história.

Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover, a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution, appeared higher than in recent years when Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran.

Last month, Trump broke ranks with European allies, Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran’s compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, reached during Obama’s tenure. Under that deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs.

Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “shred” the pact if the United States pulls out.

”All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide,” Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, told a rally in Tehran, state media reported.

“Trump’s policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today,” Shamkhani said.

He did not identify the governments he had in mind. The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump’s opposition to it, fearing this could stir new Middle East instability.

But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing” regional behavior.

Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic’s missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable.

In a sign of defiance, a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran, now a cultural center, during Saturday’s street demonstration, Tasnim news agency said.

“That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream,” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development, according to Tasnim.

Fars news agency posted pictures of demonstrators nearby burning an effigy of Trump and holding up signs saying “Death to America”.

Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations soon after the 1979 revolution, during which hardline students seized the embassy and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

Shamkhani spoke a few days after Khamenei said the United States was the “number one enemy” of the Islamic Republic.

U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen anew at a time when Tehran has been improving political and military ties with Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran on Wednesday. Khamenei told him that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help defuse conflict in the Middle East.

Iran and Russia are both fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar al Assad against rebels, some of them U.S.-backed, and Islamist militants trying to overthrow him.","Iran displays missile, calls Trump 'crazy' in marking 1979 U.S. embassy takeover",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D40F4

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

Members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party said the first high-profile resignation in the scandal showed it was time for reform at the 800-year-old parliament, where power is concentrated in lawmakers’ hands and wielded, often unchecked, over junior aides.

The loss of Fallon, described by Conservative sources as a political “Rottweiler”, leaves May with a hole in her cabinet, already at odds on everything from Britain’s departure from the European Union to the government’s austerity agenda.

Weakened after losing her party’s majority in a June election, May will want to move swiftly to appoint a replacement with as little disruption as possible.

In his letter of resignation to May, Fallon, who had apologized earlier this week for repeatedly touching a radio presenter’s knee in 2002, said there had been many allegations about lawmakers, including “some about my previous conduct”.

“Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces that I have the honor to represent,” he said, offering no detail on the nature of any other allegations.

“I have reflected on my position and I am therefore resigning as defense secretary.”

May replied in a letter saying she appreciated “the characteristically serious manner” in which Fallon had considered his position and “the particular example you wish to set to servicemen and women and others”.

The prime minister was expected to announce a new defense minister on Thursday and is unlikely to launch a major reshuffle of her cabinet at a time when she is trying to push forward Brexit talks.

Dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament, May will be keen to try to limit the fallout of the scandal, which has prompted allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct against lawmakers across parliament.

LOCKER ROOM CULTURE

Sexual abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein have prompted hundreds of thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior and Britain’s parliament - a bastion of tradition - has been no exception.

Ruth Davidson, leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, said it was time to break with a culture in politics when powerful people “use positions of power to demand things from others”.

“The dam has broken on this now, and these male-dominated professions where the boys-own locker room culture has prevailed and it’s all been a bit of a laugh, has got to stop,” she told the BBC.

Allegations of sexual abuse have ranged from a charge of rape by an activist in the opposition Labour Party by a senior party member, to unconfirmed details of serial “sex pests” on a list reportedly drafted by aides and researchers in parliament.

On Monday, May sat beside the leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom as she set out the government’s plans to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure.

May has ordered investigations into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys and an allegation her deputy, Damian Green, made an inappropriate sexual advance on a young woman - something he denies.

The prime minister, who has long championed the careers of female lawmakers, said on Wednesday that action would be taken when there were allegations and evidence of sexual misconduct.

“I am very clear that we will take action against those where there are allegations that we see, and the evidence is there, that there has been misconduct,” May told lawmakers.",Britain's defense minister resigns in growing harassment scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-fallon/fallon-resigns-in-growing-harassment-scandal-idUKKBN1D15Q5

Lungu told supporters on Thursday the judges could plunge the southern African country into chaos if they made any “adventurous” rulings, the Zambia Daily Mail and Times of Zambia reported.

Allies of Lungu’s Patriotic Front party have asked the Supreme Court to confirm that he will be eligible to stand again in presidential elections scheduled for 2021.

Opponents say that would break the constitution which bars leaders from standing for three terms. He argues his first period in office doesn’t count as he took over after the death of the last leader without an election.

Lungu told a political meeting in the northwestern town of Solwezi that he had information that the judges were thinking of barring him from standing again, the newspapers said.

”To my colleagues in the Judiciary, I am just warning you because I have information that some of you want to be adventurous, your adventure should not plunge us into chaos please,” Lungu was quoted as saying.

He said they should not follow the example of Kenya’s Supreme Court, which annulled the result of a presidential vote in August.

There was no immediate comment from Zambia’s Supreme Court, which is due to meet to consider the election case on Nov. 16.

The Law Association of Zambia asked Lungu on Friday to withdraw his warning saying it served “to undermine the authority of the judiciary and erode public confidence in the institution”.

There was no immediate response from the presidency.

The streaming company suspended production earlier this week of the upcoming sixth and final season of the political intrigue drama, in which Spacey plays U.S. president Frank Underwood.

“Netflix will not be involved with any further production of ‘House of Cards’ that includes Kevin Spacey,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

Spacey’s publicist cut ties with him on Thursday and it was not known who currently represents him.

His departure may not mean the end of the show, however.

“While we continue the ongoing investigation into the serious allegations concerning Kevin Spacey’s behavior on the set of ‘House of Cards,’ he has been suspended, effective immediately,” Media Rights Capital, the company that produces the show, said in a statement.

“MRC, in partnership with Netflix, will continue to evaluate a creative path forward for the program during the hiatus,” it said.

The Netflix statement also said the company will work with MRC to determine the show’s future.

Spacey, who has had a successful career in film, television and theater, is one of several big names in the entertainment business to be accused of sexual misconduct by people coming forward in the wake of allegations against movie producer Harvey

Weinstein.

Spacey apologized last weekend to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. CNN reported on Thursday that eight current and former employees of “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the accusations.

Spacey, as part of his apology to Rapp, announced he was gay, which angered many in the LGBT community and beyond who saw his announcement as an effort to divert attention from the accusation by Rapp.

Spacey has sought evaluation and treatment, his representatives said in a statement on Wednesday, without providing details on the nature of the treatment.

The announcement that he would seek treatment followed harassment allegations against him this week by Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who worked in the London theater where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-2015, and U.S. filmmaker Tony Montana.

MRC said in a statement on Thursday it had handled one incident in 2012 in which a crew member it did not identify “shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey” and that immediate action had been taken and the issue was resolved.

It said Spacey had “willingly participated in a training process” and that it was not aware of any complaints since then involving the actor.

U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl (R) arrives at the courthouse for the eighth day of sentencing proceedings in his court martial at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, U.S., November 3, 2017.","FORT BRAGG, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl on Friday was spared prison for endangering his comrades in arms when he deserted in Afghanistan in 2009, a sentence swiftly condemned by President Donald Trump, who while seeking election had called for his execution.

“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Trump posted on Twitter from Air Force One as he flew to Asia at the start of a lengthy tour of the region.

A military judge recommended that Bergdahl should be dishonorably discharged from the service, demoted to private and forfeit $10,000 in pay. Army Colonel Jeffery Nance took less than a minute to render his decision and made no other comment.

Bergdahl was captured eight years ago by the Taliban after walking off his combat outpost. He endured torture and malnutrition while held prisoner by the insurgent group for nearly five years. His case sparked a national debate over whether he was a victim or a villain.

The soldier, who had pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, faced a maximum term of life in prison.

Late Friday morning, the 31-year-old Hailey, Idaho, native trembled as he waited to hear his punishment in a courtroom in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Defense lawyers, who had urged Nance to show leniency, said after sentencing that Bergdahl was relieved and eager to move on, though they would not discuss his plans. Bergdahl has remained on active duty at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.

“This has been a terrible ordeal,” said one of his lawyers, Eugene Fidell.

Neither Bergdahl nor prosecutors, who had sought a 14-year prison term, commented.

Soldiers who testified about the hardships and injuries suffered in the hunt for Bergdahl after he walked off his post in Paktika province in June 2009 without permission said they were disappointed by the sentence.

“It’s definitely a slap in the face,” former Army Specialist Jonathan Morita said in a phone interview. Morita’s right hand was mangled by a rocket-propelled grenade during a July 2009 raid seeking intelligence on Bergdahl’s whereabouts.

Along with criticism over the years from U.S. political leaders and fellow soldiers over the dangerous searches prompted by Bergdahl’s actions, the conditions of his release sparked controversy.

In May 2014, Bergdahl was handed over to U.S. special operations troops in Afghanistan in exchange for five Taliban detainees, who were released from the Guantanamo Bay prison and flown to Qatar.

Last year, as a Republican presidential candidate, Trump called Bergdahl “a no-good traitor who should have been executed.”

Responding to a defense motion on Trump’s comments, Colonel Nance ruled they had not influenced him nor affected Bergdahl’s chances of a fair sentence. However, the judge said he would consider them a mitigating factor.

Defense attorney Fidell said on Friday that Americans should be offended by Trump’s behavior.

“President Trump’s unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch-mob atmosphere while seeking our nation’s highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case,” he said.

A dishonorable discharge, issued for the most serious offenses, cuts off all military and veterans benefits, including healthcare from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

That could pose difficulties for Bergdahl, who, according to testimony, suffered significant nerve damage while a Taliban prisoner and has several mental health conditions.

His punishment must be approved by the commanding general of the U.S. Army Forces Command and then will automatically be reviewed on appeal. The discharge will not take effect until an appellate court affirms Bergdahl’s conviction and sentence.

Two portraits of Bergdahl emerged during the sentencing proceedings.

Defense lawyers said he was a young, hardworking soldier who did not understand the full consequences of his actions when he left to report what he said were problems in his unit.

Bergdahl apologized in court this week for the pain he caused fellow service members and admitted he had made “a horrible mistake.”

But prosecutors said Bergdahl knew he would trigger alarm in the war zone. They acknowledged he suffered during his years as a Taliban prisoner, but argued it resulted from his choices and did not diminish the harm he caused others.

Retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Addicott said he was surprised by the judge’s decision.

“You had several members of our military who have been maimed for the rest of their life because of what Bergdahl did, so he should have received jail time, in my opinion,” said Addicott, now a law professor at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, Texas.","No prison for U.S. Army deserter Bergdahl, who Trump wanted dead",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-bergdahl/no-prison-for-u-s-army-deserter-bergdahl-who-trump-wanted-dead-idUSKBN1D30VT

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D324K-OCATC

For the first time, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada said they were “deeply concerned” at the ongoing detention of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy.

“We are concerned at the detention conditions that Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in Egypt,” a joint statement published on the British government website said late on Friday.

Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances on Sept. 10.

Members of Metwaly’s group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention.

Asked about the case, two judicial sources told Reuters that Metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination.

Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation.

Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo in January 2016. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

After Air Force One landed at Joint Base Hickam, Trump and his wife, Melania, were draped with traditional lei necklaces. Trump went on to nearby Camp Smith for a classified briefing from Pacific Command military leaders that officials expected would touch on North Korea and other areas.

Later, he was to visit Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial for the U.S. sailors killed when Japan bombed the American naval base on Dec. 7, 1941.

Trump’s 12-day trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, ending on Nov. 14, takes him out of Washington at a time when he has been beset by several issues.

These include an intensifying federal investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election, New York’s recovery from an attack earlier this week that killed eight people, and debate over a Republican tax-cut plan that if approved by Congress would be Trump’s first major legislative victory.

The trip began just days after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and after his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced Democratic calls to appear before Congress again to clarify his previous testimony about the campaign’s Russia contacts.

Amid the furor caused by the revelations, the Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at an Asian economic summit next week was being discussed, and Trump said it might happen.

“We may have a meeting with Putin,” Trump told Fox News. “And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.”

Court documents made public on Monday also disclosed that a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty early last month to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The documents cited a March 2016 meeting, when Trump was campaigning for the presidency, and attended by Trump and Sessions, in which Papadopoulos offered to help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin.

While Trump tweeted about developments vigorously this week, he told The New York Times on Wednesday that he was “not angry at anybody” about the case and there was nothing to suggest any collusion by his campaign and Russia.

CHINA AND PYONGYANG

Trump’s plan for an extended absence from Washington has alarmed allies who, after seeing a healthcare reform bid fizzle, worry the tax effort could suffer without Trump to keep momentum going.

On Saturday, Trump is to fly to Japan and later visit South Korea in search of a united front against North Korea before going to Beijing, where he will push Chinese President Xi Jinping to get tougher with Pyongyang.

In the Fox interview, Trump was asked if he planned to be tough on China over thorny issues including trade, intellectual property theft and subsidies.

“You have to understand something - very important,” he responded. “We have a problem called North Korea.”

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “has been pretty terrific” in cutting Pyongyang off from banking and oil systems. He added that Japan had reason to be worried about North Korea and alluded to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for a military buildup against that threat.

“Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation,” he said. “I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.”

Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, make a state visit to Hanoi and end his trip with the Association of South East Asia Nations summit in Manila. Trump told reporters before leaving on Friday that he would spend an extra day in the Philippines.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-pm-hariri-resigns-attacking-iran-and-hezbollah-idUSKBN1D40DY

“Where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behavior might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions,” Mark McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside, said in a statement.

May set out the code of conduct for her party on Friday detailing standards and procedures expected of elected and appointed party members.

She lost her party’s majority in parliament with a botched bet on a snap election in June, so now has to rely on a small Northern Irish party to ensure she can pass legislation.

With the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), May has a slender working majority of about 13 in the 650-seat House of Commons.

Parliament remains bitterly divided over terms for Britain’s planned departure from the European Union. The pace of the Brexit talks remains slow, heightening the risk of Brexit in March 2019 without a deal on future relations with the EU, much to the alarm of business leaders.","Britain's ruling Conservatives suspend lawmaker, refer his case to police",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-lawmaker/britains-ruling-conservatives-suspend-lawmaker-refer-his-case-to-police-idUSKBN1D40L6?il=0

The Bank of England’s decision to increase official UK borrowing costs for the first time in a decade has a more dismal logic. Governor Mark Carney and his fellow rate-setters have concluded that leaving the European Union will permanently lower Britain’s growth prospects.

Raising the UK bank rate for the first time since July 2007 should have been a milestone in Britain’s recovery from the financial crisis. In fact, the quarter-percentage point increase merely cancels out the cut that followed last year’s referendum. The rationale for changing course is more significant.

The central bank believes Brexit will hobble Britain’s growth potential. Leaving the EU will reverse some of the effects of globalisation that have put a downward pressure on prices and wages. Withdrawing from the EU single market will add friction to close to half of Britain’s exports. The UK will attract fewer immigrants, and companies will invest less.

Those shifts may ultimately enable British workers to demand higher wages. But low productivity means prices will also rise more quickly. The BoE reckons the UK’s potential output is growing by just 1.5 percent a year – below the 1.7 percent increase in GDP it forecasts for the next three years. In short, though the British economy is expanding at a slower pace than in the past, this may be unsustainable.

This analysis does not make raising interest rates now a foregone conclusion. Though inflation reached 3 percent in September and unemployment is low, there’s little evidence of wage pressure. Meanwhile, consumers’ incomes are being squeezed.

Carney sought to ease the pain by signalling that official rates would rise in line with expectations in financial markets – implying just two more quarter-percent increases by the end of 2020. The governor may also worry about the risks that a weak exchange rate pose to Britain’s ability to finance its current account deficit.

After the BoE last hiked rates, it was forced to slash them by 4.75 percentage points in the following 18 months as the global financial crisis tipped the UK into recession. The latest increase may also prove a mistake.

“I‘m with my family today,” tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas’ Avila mountain. “Tomorrow I’ll address the country. God is with us.”

“I‘m free!” Guarate tweeted.

The pair’s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment.

The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles.

And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence.

Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths.

Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him.

In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation.

”When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls,“ he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison. ”The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness.

“There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.”

Senior officials said Goicoechea was an “imperialist” agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing “terrorism.” Neither was tried.

Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists.

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis. (After publication of this column, a spokesman for Hakim's movement told Reuters that while Hakim and Faisal had both attended an iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, Faisal ""was one of the invitees among other many people, and there was no meeting or political talk during that event."")

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

His resignation brought down the coalition government and plunged Lebanon into a new political crisis, returning it to the front line of a regional competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran that has also buffeted Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.

Hariri, who is closely allied with Saudi Arabia, alleged in a broadcast from an undisclosed location that Hezbollah was “directing weapons” at Yemenis, Syrians and Lebanese.

In comments directed at Iran, he said the Arab world would “cut off the hands that wickedly extend to it”.

Hariri’s coalition, which took office last year, grouped nearly all of Lebanon’s main parties, including Hezbollah. It took office in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, president, and was seen as a victory for Iran.

The resignation risks exacerbating sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslims and returning Lebanon to paralysis in government.

It was not immediately clear who might succeed Hariri, Lebanon’s most influential Sunni politician.

The prime minister must be a Sunni in Lebanon’s sectarian system. Aoun must appoint the candidate with most support among MPs, who he is expected to consult in the coming days.

“We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri. I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life,” Hariri said.

Rafik al-Hariri was killed in a 2005 Beirut bomb attack that pushed his son Saad into politics and set off years of turmoil. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies involvement.

The Saudi-owned pan-Arab television channel al-Arabiya al-Hadath reported that an assassination plot against Hariri was foiled in Beirut days ago, citing an unnamed source.

Lebanon’s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter and denied it was the source of the news.

Hariri said Hezbollah and Iran had brought Lebanon into the “eye of a storm” of international sanctions. Iran was sowing strife, destruction and ruin wherever it went and accused it of a “deep hatred for the Arab nation”, he said.

Aoun’s office said Hariri had called him from “outside Lebanon” to inform him of his resignation. He has postponed a visit to Kuwait and directed military and security agencies “to maintain stability”, it said.

Hariri flew to Saudi Arabia on Friday after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Afterwards, Velayati described Hariri’s coalition as “a victory” and “great success”.

TUSSLE FOR INFLUENCE

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, will address Hariri’s resignation in a televised speech on Sunday, Hezbollah-affiliated media reported.

A member of Hezbollah’s central committee, Sheikh Nabil Kawouk, accused Riyadh of being behind Hariri’s resignation, saying in a speech reported by Lebanon’s al-Jadeed television: “God protect Lebanon from the evil of Saudi Arabia’s reckless adventures.”

Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon’s Druze minority, said Lebanon was too weak to bear the consequences of Hariri’s resignation, saying he feared political and economic fallout.

“We cannot afford to fight the Iranians from Lebanon,” he told Reuters, advocating an approach of compromise with Hezbollah in Lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow Saudi-Iranian dialogue.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said Hariri’s departure was a plot to “create tension in Lebanon and the region”.

“Hariri’s resignation was done with planning by Donald Trump, the president of America, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia,” said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iran’s supreme leader.

Saudi Arabia’s influential Gulf Affairs Minister Thamer al-Sabhan, who met Hariri in Riyadh this week, echoed the language of the Lebanese politician saying in a tweet: “The hands of treachery and aggression must be cut off.”

Hariri has visited Saudi Arabia twice in the past week, meeting Crown Prince Mohammed and other senior officials. In recent weeks, leading Christian politicians who oppose Hezbollah have also visited Saudi Arabia.

ECONOMIC RISKS

Hezbollah’s close ties to Iran and its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his war with rebels have been a major source of tension in Lebanon for years.

Beirut has adopted a position of “disassociation” from the conflict, but this has come under strain with Hezbollah and its allies pushing for a normalization of ties.

Since taking office, Hariri had worked to garner international aid for Lebanon to cope with the strain of hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees, seeking billions of dollars to boost its sluggish economy.

The government’s collapse complicates preparations for next year’s parliamentary elections, Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters there was no danger to Lebanon’s economy or its currency.

Joseph Torbey, head of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said there was no risk to monetary stability because the central bank had large reserves and there was confidence in Lebanese banks.

Lebanon has one of the world’s highest ratios of debt-to-GDP and last month passed its first budget since 2005, one of the few achievements of the coalition government.

The United States is considering new sanctions on Hezbollah, as part of a tougher stance against Iran and its allies, that Lebanese politicians have fretted could hurt the economy.","Lebanese PM Hariri resigns, attacking Iran and Hezbollah",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanese-pm-hariri-resigns-attacking-iran-and-hezbollah-idUKKBN1D40DN

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock, and the prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings in future - including the IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf, as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D40IL-OCABS

“Es geht nicht alleine darum, dass wir trockene Geschichtsforschung betreiben”, sagte Ritschl. Das Projekt sei Teil eines gesellschaftlichen Prozesses, wie eine neue Generation über diese Vergangenheit streite. Brechtken zufolge soll unter anderem untersucht werden, wie sich die Karrieren und Weltbilder der Inhaber von Schlüsselpositionen in der Geldpolitik von den 20er Jahren bis in die 60er Jahre hinein entwickelt haben.

They also display the weaknesses, present and future, of the two leaders of the contending parties: Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister and Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia.

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUSKBN1D31U1

The arrests were carried out by the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), a Salafist-led armed group that has expanded its power under Libya’s U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

Salafists are ultra-conservatives whose influence has grown across Libya in recent years.

The organisers said on their Facebook page that the festival had nothing to do with Halloween. They posted no immediate comment on the arrests.

Rada said in its statement that festivals like Comic Con were “derived from abroad and exploit weakness of religious faith and fascination with foreign cultures”.

“The organisers and supervisors of the event were arrested and will be presented for public prosecution for acts of indecency and against public morals,” it said in a statement.

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

One of Indonesia’s worst industrial disasters, the Oct. 26 blaze in the congested industrial suburb of Tangerang, has cast a new spotlight on lax safety standards in Indonesia, where rules are often ignored or weakly enforced.

Reuters interviews with police investigators, government officials and survivors show that at the time of the fire, the factory was overcrowded, had only one exit, and a single mid-sized fire extinguisher even though it had reported having four on site.

The building housed more than 4,000 kg of combustible materials in various locations, which, police say, made it all too easy for the fire to rip through the 2,600 square meter factory within minutes, killing 49 workers and injuring dozens more.

Survivors told Reuters they had not had any emergency training or drills, and were not familiar with evacuation routes. Police spokesman Argo Yuwono said there was no indication anyone had tried to use the fire extinguisher.

“It was total panic and the fire was quickly out of control,” Yuwono said. “The workers had zero training in how to respond in an emergency or how to use a fire extinguisher.”

Police have detained the owner and operations manager of the company on suspicion of negligence leading to death. They face at least five years in prison if found guilty.

A representative for the parent company of PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses said the firm would pay for all survivors’ medical treatment, but declined comment on the legal case.

THE FIRE

On the day of the fire, 103 workers had filed into the dusty and stuffy factory. Many lived in small houses nearby that are dotted among the neighborhood’s factory complexes, and sent their children to school just a block away from the fireworks workshop.

Workers, paid an average of 40,000 rupiah ($2.96) a day, fanned out across the factory – to storage facilities for raw materials and finished fireworks, a machine room where the fireworks were produced, and packaging stations. Some milled around in the workers’ canteen near the front of the building.

Police say that soon after the day’s work got underway, at around 9.20 a.m., sparks from unauthorized welding work landed on tall stacks of unpackaged fireworks, causing at least two explosions that shook neighboring buildings and could be heard miles away.

Survivors say that within minutes the front area and only exit of the warehouse was engulfed in fire and thick black smoke, trapping the workers and sending them scrambling towards the back of the building.

Police found 44 bodies piled up in a back corner of the building, all charred beyond recognition. Clothes and identifying accessories had melted. Bodies were identified using dental records and DNA samples from families.

Uwang, a 36-year-old woman hired to package fireworks, said she and four others survived by jumping into a small water tank.

“At first, I tried to get out the front gate, but the smoke was already very thick. My friend pulled me into the water tank. I only dared to put my face up to the surface every few seconds to breathe,” she said, lying in a hospital bed with at least half her face, and hands, feet and thighs wrapped in thick, white bandages.

As the flames leapt higher and people screamed for help, a contingent of police officers that happened to be temporarily stationed just across from the factory, started breaking down one of the walls of the warehouse using hammers and iron bars.

More than 30 workers, many severely injured and some with their clothes burned off, managed to scramble out of the hole in the wall, including Uwang.

Others scaled the factory’s walls, jumped to safety or used ladders that residents had propped up against the burning building, witnesses said.

The local fire brigade, winding through narrow streets swarming with bystanders and motorbikes, arrived nearly an hour later and had brought the blaze under control by noon.

CLOSURE THREAT

Authorities suspect that violations are rampant among thousands of factories in the area, and they are threatening to close any don’t meet safety requirements.

“Small- and medium-sized companies are the ones likely to ignore the rules, and they’re the ones that are difficult to regulate,” said Ahmed Zaki Iskandar, the regent of Tangerang, adding that companies making products like paper, fuel, or paint will be targeted first.

He said the company in question had been inspected by safety officials and was issued a permit to employ up to 35 people, but had actually recruited over 100.

“The layout made sense for 35 people ... but they broke the rules and they must take responsibility,” Iskandar said, adding that since the fire he had ordered dozens of fireworks “home industries” in the area to be shut down.

Risk analyst Keith Loveard said the crackdown was little more than an “instant solution for a deep-seated problem of industrial safety”.

“The regent’s proposal is positive and much needed, but similar moves have followed disasters in the past, only to see compliance and oversight return to earlier low levels a few months later.”

Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but wages grew at their slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years in a sign that inflation probably will remain benign.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 261,000 last month as 106,000 leisure and hospitality workers returned to work, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. That was the largest gain since July 2016 but below economists’ expectations for a jump of 310,000 jobs.

Data for September was revised to show a gain of 18,000 jobs instead of a decline of 33,000 as previously reported.

The White House, which is pushing a Republican-backed package of tax cuts to boost economic growth and employment, trumpeted the payrolls gains. “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!” President Donald Trump tweeted after the release of the report.

But Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement that the report showed Americans were continuing to be denied bigger paychecks by Republicans’ “billionaires-first agenda.”

Average hourly earnings slipped one cent in October, leaving them unchanged in percentage terms, in part due to the return of the lower-paid leisure and hospitality workers. Wages shot up 0.5 percent in September. They were up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis last month, the smallest gain since February 2016, after a 2.8 percent advance in the prior month.

October’s job growth acceleration reinforced the Federal Reserve’s assessment on Wednesday that “the labor market has continued to strengthen,” and the sluggish wage data did little to change expectations it will raise interest rates in December.

The U.S. central bank has increased rates twice this year.

“The weakness in wages will not go unnoticed at the Fed, particularly for members that remained more concerned over the inflation outlook,” said Michael Hanson, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York. “Overall, sustained job growth and labor market slack at pre-crisis lows keeps December in play.”

Tepid wage growth supports the view that inflation will continue to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. Should wage growth remain sluggish, economists say it would be hard for central bank policymakers to hike rates three times next year as they currently anticipate.

Although the unemployment rate fell to near a 17-year low of 4.1 percent in October, from 4.2 percent in the prior month, it was because the labor force dropped by 765,000 after a surprise rise of 575,000 in September.

The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell four-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent.

The sharp moderation in job growth in September was blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which devastated parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September and left workers, mostly in lower-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality, temporarily unemployed.

Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher as were U.S. stocks. The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Economists, however, remain optimistic that wage growth will accelerate with the labor market near full employment. The unemployment rate, which has declined by 0.7 percentage point since January, is now at its lowest level since December 2000 and below the Fed’s median forecast for 2017.

A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.9 percent last month. That was the lowest level since December 2006 and was down from 8.3 percent in September.

The lack of wage growth despite a rapidly tightening labor could raise concerns about consumer spending, which appears to have been largely supported by savings this year.

“You cannot get strong growth when spending power is increasing so modestly,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The economy grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the U.S. trade deficit increased 1.7 percent to $43.5 billion in September as rising exports were offset by a surge in imports.

Other economic reports showed a jump in business spending on capital in September and a measure of services sector activity racing to more than a 12-year high in October.

Economic growth has remained strong even as Trump and the Republican-led Congress have struggled to enact their economic program.

House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cut tax rates on individuals and families and end certain tax breaks. Small businesses, realtors and homebuilders have opposed the current proposal.

Monthly job growth has averaged 162,000 over the past three months, below the 187,000 average in 2016. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

The slowing job growth trend largely reflects employers’ difficulties in finding qualified workers. Some economists believe the impact of the hurricanes was still holding back employment growth.

Private payrolls surged by 219,000 jobs in October after falling by 3,000 in September. Manufacturing employment increased by 24,000 jobs last month while the retail sector lost 8,300 jobs.

Construction payrolls were up 11,000 in October, likely boosted by hiring related to the clean-up and rebuilding efforts in the wake of the hurricanes.

“I will not be defeated by it,” Ito, a 59-year-old banker, said as he picked up his race number three days after an Uzbek immigrant drove a truck down a Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring a dozen more.

Holding his white cane, Ito, who will run with a sighted guide, said through an interpreter that while the attack gave him “a little trepidation,” he is “definitely running.”

He is far from alone, according to organizers of the annual road race, who said runners were defying concerns to join the world’s biggest marathon.

“There’s been no spike in cancellations that we’ve seen,” said Chris Weiller, a spokesman for race organizer the New York Road Runners.

New York officials allowed the city’s Halloween parade to step off just hours after the attack and vowed that the marathon would go forward, with some enhanced security.

The race has been canceled only once in its 47-year-history, in 2012, following Superstorm Sandy’s devastating hit to the region. It even went forward after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which killed about 2,600 people in New York.

Marathoners train for months to prepare their bodies for the 26.2-mile race, and some wait years before winning a spot in the drawing which gives about 30 percent of them access to a field that includes the world’s top runners and draws about 2.5 million spectators.

“The determination that got them here is the determination that I think that they have right now going into Sunday,” Weiller said.

Sunday’s race will not be the first time U.S. runners have had to worry about violence. Two brothers inspired by al Qaeda killed three people and injured more than 260 with bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.

Philadelphian Neil Gottlieb remembers that attack vividly as it occurred shortly after he crossed the finish line. But he was back on that course in 2014 and said he was undaunted about racing in New York.

“I‘m not going to win the New York City Marathon, but it’s a victory for me, and I‘m not going to let anyone stop me,” said Gottlieb, a 48-year-old healthcare executive and father of three.

New York police stepped up security, saying they would deploy extra “blocking trucks” to protect against vehicle attacks, rooftop snipers, heavy weapons, dogs and helicopters.

“This increase will supplement the already large, substantial detail of uniformed officers that you will see along the route,” New York Police Chief Carlos Gomez said on Wednesday.

The route connects all five of the city’s boroughs, starting near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island, snaking through Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan, before circling up to the Bronx and back to Manhattan.

Stephanie Trumbino, 35, of Maplewood, New Jersey, said she felt concerned about the attack but did not consider missing her first attempt at the race.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts.

In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.

Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.

The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday.

Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer.

The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA).

Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases.

“It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”

FEW FARA PROSECUTIONS

Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction.

By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.”

Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said.

“If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use.

But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction.

“The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter.

Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date.

“It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort-analysis/manafort-money-laundering-charge-in-russia-probe-may-face-challenges-idUSKBN1D401W?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if there is consensus at the next GST council meeting due over Nov. 9 to Nov. 10, the government would take the necessary steps to help traders and strengthen the country’s economy.

A panel of ministers last month recommended reducing tax rates for small businesses and traders and raising the minimum revenue threshold for companies that need to pay tax, local media reported.

The launch in July of the long-awaited GST, which transformed India’s 29 states into a single customs union, has left thousands of small and medium-sized firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

Modi is facing criticism for the disruption to the economy caused by the roll-out of GST and the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year. As a result of these issues India’s economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll found.

Modi’s comments came days after India jumped about 30 places to 100th on the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” rankings, reflecting reforms in accessing credit, power supply and the protection of minority investors.

Modi said he expected India’s ranking to improve next year when the GST and other reforms were considered.

“There are many other reforms that have already happened but need gestation and stabilization time before they are taken into account by the World Bank,” Modi said.

He added that there were other reforms on which India and the World Bank would need to find common ground.

Modi said along with manufacturing, India was also pushing for faster progress in developing infrastructure and was working to improve the investment climate.

Britain’s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior.

On Wednesday, defense minister Michael Fallon resigned saying his past conduct had fallen below the required standard, costing May a trusted ally in a fragile minority government and underlining her political vulnerability to further allegations.

On Friday, she set out the code of conduct on the Conservative Party website, detailing standards expected of elected and appointed party members, the procedure for breaches of those standards and the party’s definitions of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and bullying.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Their comments contradict media statements by McKinsey that it ceased work with the firm, local consultancy Trillian, in March 2016 -- after due diligence by external consultants showed the links to the Gupta family, accused by South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog of siphoning public funds.

McKinsey, which says it never signed a separate contract with Trillian, also ignored warnings by senior staff in South Africa not to partner Trillian in a deal to advise state utility Eskom which is being investigated for fraud, the sources said. The senior staff were troubled by Eskom’s demand that Trillian must be involved in the deal despite having little experience.

It then took a year for McKinsey to act on calls for an internal inquiry into the relationship with Trillian, the sources said.

Two of McKinsey’s global directors -- Europe-based Pal Erik Sjatil and Africa chief Georges Desvaux -- and South African office head Saf Yeboah-Amankwah told concerned partners the situation was “under control”, three former McKinsey employees said.

Six sources with direct knowledge of the matter -- four former McKinsey employees and two current employees -- said there was no investigation until July 2017. McKinsey declined to comment on this allegation.

Sjatil and Desvaux were on McKinsey’s Shareholder Council, its highest leadership body.

Sjatil, Desvaux and Yeboah-Amankwah declined to comment for this story. Eskom, McKinsey and Trillian have denied wrongdoing.

The sources’ disclosures are the first indication that McKinsey’s work with Trillian on the 1.6 billion rand (£86 million) contract to turn around Eskom continued until July of that year -- when Eskom canceled the deal.

Asked about the sources’ comments, McKinsey told Reuters by email on Thursday: “McKinsey never had a supplier development partnership with Trillian. We terminated our discussions in March 2016 and notified the client and Trillian.”

HOPES FOR A “SOLUTION”

Eskom had told McKinsey it must use Trillian as a partner to secure the “turnaround” contract under a black empowerment program, but by July it had become clear that McKinsey would not sign a formal contract with it.

Four people involved in the contract with Eskom said McKinsey’s work with Trillian continued until then, with one saying “the team hoped a solution could be found right up until Eskom cut ties.”

McKinsey and Trillian had wanted to extend their advisory partnership at Eskom for four years in a deal that could earn them $700 million (£535.5 million), according to documents setting out the firms’ cooperation plans seen by Reuters.

Sources at McKinsey confirmed the documents’ authenticity. Asked about the documents, a McKinsey spokesman did not deny they were genuine.

McKinsey said in its email to Reuters that Eskom knew Trillian would not be McKinsey’s partner and added: ”Any questions about why Trillian remained at Eskom (after March 2016) and what they did, should be directed to Eskom.

The disclosures are likely to form part of an investigation launched by South Africa’s parliamentary committee on public enterprises into whether McKinsey knowingly let funds from Eskom be diverted to a Gupta-linked company as a way of securing the deal, a source close to the committee said.

Trillian was owned at the time by Salim Essa, a business partner of the Guptas and of the president’s son, Duduzane Zuma.

McKinsey’s global risk committee, a vetting body, gave the partnership with Trillian initial approval, pending due diligence, but senior managers in Johannesburg did not inform the committee fully about how Trillian hid its ownership and why costs for Eskom were unusually high, three former partners said.

In the end, McKinsey launched a full internal investigation into its handling of the partnership with Trillian in July this year, after local media published a letter from a senior McKinsey manager dated Feb. 16, 2016 asking Eskom to pay Trillian as a McKinsey subcontractor.

McKinsey said the letter “inaccurately characterized” the relationship with Trillian. The manager has since left the firm.

McKinsey said on Oct. 17 the preliminary findings of the inquiry, approved by global head Dominic Barton, found “violations of our professional standards” but did not uncover any corruption.

In its email on Thursday, McKinsey did not comment directly on the timing of its internal inquiry, directing Reuters instead to its Oct. 17 statement.",Exclusive: McKinsey worked with South African firm after learning of Gupta links - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1D31RO-OZABS

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected.

Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter.

The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

“I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,” Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. “We are on it, we’ve got it covered,” but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said.

The Palo Alto, California-based company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called “production bottlenecks.” It had planned to build more than 1,500.

Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company’s cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car.

Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally.

Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 17 percent from a 12-month high of $385 in September, but are still up 50 percent from January fueled by belief in the long-term prospects of the company.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla charging station is seen in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S. on September 28, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo

Tesla’s soaring stock has made the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker behind General Motors Co (GM.N), which had annual net profit of $9.4 billion in 2016.

LARGEST-EVER LOSS

Tesla could face major new requirements for cash given Model 3 problems, a possible factory in China, and plans to develop other vehicles, including an electric heavy duty truck.

But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market.

Tesla said it was “well capitalized” for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla’s August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year.

Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter.

The price of the $1.8 billion eight-year junk bond 88160RAE1= issued by Tesla last August also fell after the quarterly report.

Tesla’s continued need for cash is exacerbated by Musk’s insistence on vertical integration, such as making its own batteries and selling cars directly to customers. That, industry experts say, is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its aggressive goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

Tesla warned that its adjusted gross margin would decline to about 15 percent due to a higher mix of lower-margin Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter, but then recover in the first quarter of 2018.

Last month, Tesla reported it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016.","Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-stock-falls-on-model-3-delays-biggest-ever-quarterly-loss-idUSKBN1D15TP

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

For the first time, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada said they were “deeply concerned” at the ongoing detention of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy.

“We are concerned at the detention conditions that Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in Egypt,” a joint statement published on the British government website said late on Friday.

Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances on Sept. 10.

Members of Metwaly’s group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention.

Asked about the case, two judicial sources told Reuters that Metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination.

Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation.

Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo in January 2016. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture.

Reuters requests for comment from Weinstein’s representative and his lawyer were not immediately answered.

New York City Police Department Deputy Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told a news conference that the alleged victim “put forth a credible and detailed narrative.”

“We have an actual case here,” Boyce said. He said the police department became aware of the accusation on October 25.

Boyce said it was a seven-year-old case and “we have to move forward gathering evidence.”

Boyce said that because Weinstein was out of state the police department would need a court-ordered warrant for any arrest.

More than 50 women have claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

Boyce said police had spoken to the woman and “we found corroboration along the way.”

He said the NYPD was working on the case with the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

“Right now he (Weinstein) poses no threat to anybody in New York City. He’s out of state. So it’s a continuing investigation,” Boyce told the news conference.

Earlier on Friday, in response to media reports, Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., told Reuters, “A senior sex crimes prosecutor is assigned to this investigation, and the Office has been working with our partners in the NYPD since the new allegations came to light.”

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock, and the prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings in future - including the IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf, as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.",Trump backs New York in bourses' battle for Saudi Aramco listing,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aramco/trump-backs-new-york-in-bourses-battle-for-saudi-aramco-listing-idUSKBN1D40IL

Their revised plan, unveiled on Thursday, only partly deals with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House - Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin - have fumbled their way through their own script.

GOP leaders in the House of Representatives have, at least, ditched the idea of scrapping the top rate of tax for the highest earners of nearly 40 percent. But they’re cutting to 25 percent the rate for so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships. Many wealthy people, including President Donald Trump and some in his cabinet, have made liberal use of these.

And they’re doubling the exemption and then repealing the estate tax over the next six years. Trump in September claimed this so-called death tax would “protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer.” Yet it only affects about 0.2 percent of the population – ultra-wealthy families, in other words. Its repeal would save Trump’s family and the offspring of rich cabinet members billions of dollars, argue Democrats.

Comments made by Trump administration officials aren’t helping. Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, claimed in September that the typical American family earns $100,000 a year. He’s vastly overstating it: the median annual U.S. household income in 2016 was about $59,000. The Pew Research Center tallies an annual middle-class income as low as $40,000, depending on where you live. Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, listed at least $250 million in assets in his financial disclosure.

Mnuchin, another Goldman alumnus, has also garbled his tax message. After saying for months that the wealthy would not get a tax cut, he recently changed his tune. He told Politico it’s difficult to avoid giving a break to the rich because “the top 20 percent pay 95 percent of the taxes.” It’s actually more like the top 50 percent of earners. His own wealth presents a conflict of interest, too: he reported about $500 million in assets in financial disclosures.

Such abysmal marketing is already falling flat with voters: only 25 percent of Americans like the plan and just 14 percent believe they will get a tax cut, according to an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll. If that translates into problems pushing the cuts through Congress, it’ll put the Trump administration’s goals of sustained 3 percent economic growth and rising wages in jeopardy. That’d be a dismal failure going into an election year.",Breakingviews - Botched Republican pitch bodes ill for tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-breakingviews/breakingviews-botched-republican-pitch-bodes-ill-for-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1D22PS

The Polish government, whose judiciary reform has been met with youth protests and legal action from the European Union, had accused German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen of interference after she called for supporting “the healthy democratic resistance of the young generation” in Poland.

But a spokesman for von der Leyen said the comments had been misinterpreted and the minister had instead praised Poland’s achievements since the fall of communism and called for a more inclusive approach to European integration.

“The defense minister’s quote was changed in social media and ripped out of context,” a spokesman for von der Leyen told Reuters on Saturday.

“Mrs von der Leyen has emphasized that the EU is an inclusive process, which is about securing and consolidating the common values of the EU and dealing with all positions.”

The Polish reform of the courts would give nearly a free hand to the ruling conservatives in picking the country’s top judges.

It has triggered protests by thousands of young people and others over the summer and an “infringement procedure” from the European Union.

It comes as some European leaders call for letting some member states in the wealthier, Western part of the bloc push ahead with further integration without the others following suit.

During the show broadcast Thursday on ZDF television, von der Leyen highlighted significant efforts undertaken by the Baltic states and Poland to “live in freedom” and to be part of the European Union.

“Precisely this healthy democratic resistance of the young people, also there in Poland, must be supported,” she said.

Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski called on von der Leyen to withdraw her words.

“This is one of the most explicit statements, which I am not sure whether it is a warning or an admission by the German side of interfering into our internal affairs,” Waszczykowski told the wpolitice.pl right-wing news portal.

The Polish defense ministry said it would summon the defense attache from the German embassy for an explanation.

Leicester took the lead in the 33rd minute when Vincente Iborra swept home the ball from a corner to register his first goal in English football.

The visitors had chances to immediately double their lead but it was Stoke who found the net six minutes after falling behind, with Xherdan Shaqiri racing on to a Maxim Choupo-Moting flick to equalise.

On the hour, the visitors got their second goal when Riyad Mahrez fired into the bottom corner but Crouch -- who equalled the record for the most Premier League substitute appearances after replacing Ramadan Sobhi -- had the final say, heading home Shaqiri’s cross to snatch a point for the home side.

The visitors started brightly, and were almost in front 11 minutes in, but Ryan Shawcross did well to block Jamie Vardy’s close-range effort. However, the pressure told as Iborra powered home the ball to break the deadlock after Harry Maguire had knocked a corner down into his path.

Leicester should have quickly doubled their advantage but Jack Butland was equal to a Shinji Okazaki effort, before Iborra headed over from a good position.

“We had a lot of chances today,” Puel said. “It’s a pity (Leicester didn’t win) but it is encouraging for the future. We are confident with our play and with the quality of our strikers.”

Such profligacy proved costly as Stoke levelled on the counter attack. The move was swift -- Choupo-Moting flicked the ball through first time for Shaqiri, who opened his body up before slotting into the bottom corner.

Mahrez then showed neat footwork to work space for the shot but saw his fizzing strike fly just wide, before Kasper Schmeichel again got down well to keep out a header from Shawcross.

Moments later, though, Mahrez did find the net. The change of pace saw him skip past Erik Pieters and he cut inside before powering a strike underneath the despairing dive of Butland.

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

Siemens-Chef Joe Kaeser verteidigte die Einschnitte in einem Brief an Bundeswirtschaftsministerin Brigitte Zypries (SPD), aus dem das Nachrichtenmagazin “Der Spiegel” zitierte. Kaeser gibt der Bundesregierung darin eine Mitschuld am Abwärtstrend in der Branche: Die Energiewende habe nicht nur “eine kurz-zyklische Abschwächung der Nachfrage” nach konventionellen Kraftwerken ausgelöst, sondern “eine dauerhafte Veränderung” dieser Industrie. Daher seien Kapazitätsanpassungen unvermeidbar. Ein Siemens-Sprecher bestätigte, dass Kaeser den Brief geschrieben habe, wollte sich aber zum Inhalt nicht äußern.

Zypries hatte Siemens für die Kürzungen kritisiert und dem Konzern indirekt vorgeworfen, dem Rechtspopulismus Vorschub zu leisten: “Es ist besonders kritisch, wenn Standorte in strukturschwachen Regionen - etwa im Osten Deutschlands - zur Disposition stehen. Andernfalls wachsen Unmut und Zweifel und brechen sich auch politisch Bahn - das konnten wir bei der Bundestagswahl schon erleben.” Kaeser betonte in dem Brief, die Gespräche mit den Arbeitnehmern über die Pläne hätten schon vor einem Jahr begonnen und seien nicht überraschend gekommen.

Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels.

In Spain’s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago.

Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.

“It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,” Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box.

Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont’s tweet.

EVENLY SPLIT

In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately.

That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.

If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid’s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed.

Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December.

Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election.

JAILED POLITICIANS

The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.

“It is up to the state to show it’s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,” she said.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont’s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions.

Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.

Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.

Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.

“Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don’t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.”

While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.

“To pick someone up and arrest them is not politics. Politics is talking, discussing. To arrest some, it seems to me a little bit like a fascist government,” Barcelona resident Cristiano Gonzalez, 34, said.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

“I only help her with changing the brushes and putting them into paints but she does the rest by herself more or less. I praise her by saying ‘oh this is really good, or not so good’,” Richter said. “We have been together for 40 years so this is a family connection.”

Sandra arrived as a baby elephant at the circus where Richter grew up, as a seventh generation member of an acrobat family.

FILE PHOTO - Berkshire Hathaway shareholders walk by a video screen at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. on May 4, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo

Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year.

Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad.

Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term.

Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier.

That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF.

A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent.

Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September.

Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it.

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year.

The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs.

FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY

Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002.

It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis.

But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion.

Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates.

Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.

But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest.

Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies.

Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3.

Berkshire also owns shares in dozens of companies including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), and has a 26.7 percent stake in food company Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).","Hurricanes, earthquake drag down third-quarter profit at Buffett's Berkshire",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-results/hurricanes-earthquake-drag-down-third-quarter-profit-at-buffetts-berkshire-idUSKBN1D32F4?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

For the first time, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Canada said they were “deeply concerned” at the ongoing detention of human rights lawyer Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy.

“We are concerned at the detention conditions that Ibrahim Metwaly Hegazy is reportedly enduring, and continue to call for transparency on prison conditions in Egypt,” a joint statement published on the British government website said late on Friday.

Metwaly, who founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after his son disappeared in suspicious circumstances four years ago, went missing while heading for his flight to Geneva to attend a U.N. conference on enforced disappearances on Sept. 10.

Members of Metwaly’s group said he was taken from Cairo airport by airport security and he was not heard from until three days later when a state security prosecutor ordered his detention.

Asked about the case, two judicial sources told Reuters that Metwaly had been detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group, and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law.

The sources said all prisoners are guaranteed the right to fair treatment without discrimination.

Rights activists say Egyptian security forces resort to kidnapping government opponents and keeping them in secret jails where they can spend weeks, months, or years without charge. The authorities deny the accusation.

Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was conducting research on Egyptian trade unions, disappeared in Cairo in January 2016. His body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the Egyptian capital on Feb. 3, showing signs of extensive torture.

The deal would combine CVS, one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers and drugstore chains, with Aetna, one of the oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide.

The companies have agreed that CVS will split its consideration for the deal between cash and CVS stock, a deal structure that would minimize tax liabilities for Aetna shareholders, the sources said.

A deal will probably value Aetna at significantly more than $200 per share, the sources said, adding that the companies will agree to an exact price closer to signing the deal in December.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Aetna declined to comment, while CVS did not respond to a request for comment.

Aetna shares rose as much as 6 percent on the news and ended trading up 2.7 percent on Friday at $176.99. They have risen over 10 percent since Oct. 26, when the Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS and Aetna were in merger talks.

CVS shares ended trading down 0.2 percent at $69.25, giving the company a market capitalization of $70 billion.

Healthcare consolidation has been a popular route for insurers and pharmacies, under pressure from the government and large corporations to lower soaring medical costs.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS negotiate drug benefits for health insurance plans and employers, and have in recent years taken an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with drugmakers.

They often extract discounts and after-market rebates from drugmakers in exchange for including their medicines in PBM formularies with low co-payments.

A tie-up with Aetna could give CVS more leverage in its price negotiations with drug makers.

The deal would follow years of major changes to the U.S. health insurance industry under former President Barack Obama, whose 2010 Affordable Care Act created new ground rules for how insurers operate and expanded insurance to 20 million more Americans.

Republican President Donald Trump has promised to turn back many of the Affordable Care Act’s facets, but Congress has not been able to agree on a repeal or a replacement. The lack of progress, along with Trump’s executive order to bring down healthcare costs, has created uncertainty for insurers as they head into 2018.","CVS, Aetna aim to finalize deal as early as December: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-cvs-health/cvs-aetna-aim-to-finalize-deal-as-early-as-december-sources-idUSKBN1D32A6

2/BALLISTIC BITCOIN

Investors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds. The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.

But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion? What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency - of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity - from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice? With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.

3/ NEED A JOLT?

The Nov. 7 release of the September Job Opening and Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey USJOLT=ECI will show whether demand for labour has held up or is in need of an - ahem - jolt.

At the moment, the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1, hovering in a range close to the all-time peak of 2.12 hit in July 2015.

It all comes following strong recent U.S GDP data and after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives released plans on Thursday for a tax overhaul they believe will help lift the economy.

4/ITALIAN BANKS JOB

Italy’s biggest banks, including UniCredit (CRDI.MI), Intesa (ISP.MI) and Banco BPM (BAMI.MI), report their latest earnings and they could make encouraging reading following the euro zone-wide pick-up in growth and a strong rally in Italian debt over the last month.

It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance .SX7E in 2017, so the results round should be telling.

5/ VENEZUELA RESTRUCTURING

After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.

Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.

Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUKKBN1D324K

Russia and Saudi Arabia are leading a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut global oil production, with the aim of propping up oil prices.

“The states-participant signified satisfaction of reducing commercial stocks of oil and stated their readiness to continue (to make) join efforts towards such a direction”, the statement said.

OPEC, Russia and other oil producers are due to meet at the end of November in Vienna to decide whether to extend the current supply-cut pact.

According to the Russian Energy Ministry, the formerly Soviet state Turkmenistan will take part at the meeting as an observer.

Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih said after the meeting that more work was needed to cut inventories.

“There is a general satisfaction with the strategy of 24 countries that signed a declaration of cooperation”.

“Everybody recognizes that (the) job is not done yet by any means, we still have significant amount of work to do to bring inventories down. Mission is not yet complete, more needs to be done,” he added.

He said members of the global pact he had spoken with have expressed the same views.

“This is the same sentiment I’ve heard yesterday from (Kazakh) President (Nursultan) Nazarbayev, this is the same sentiment I’ve heard from all the oil-producing members of the Asia energy ministers’ round table”, he said.

Officials from Malaysia, Ecuador, Nigeria and Libya have also given him similar feedback, Falih said.

Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts.

In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.

Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.

The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday.

Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer.

The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA).

Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases.

“It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”

FEW FARA PROSECUTIONS

Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction.

By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.”

Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said.

“If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use.

But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction.

“The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter.

Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date.

“It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort-analysis/manafort-money-laundering-charge-in-russia-probe-may-face-challenges-idUSKBN1D401W

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

“Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!”

Trump did not say why he chose to raise the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help to sway the Saudis’ decision.

The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to offer around 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale which officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest-ever initial public offer.

Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition between New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses to host the IPO.

An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment. NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities.

The London Stock Exchange has also enjoyed some government support in its bid, though the support has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year.

Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials insist they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues.

Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York, by far the world’s biggest exchange by market capitalization, for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option.

Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies.

Mohammed al-Sabban, who has served as an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem.

“President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said.

“Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.”

However, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. He was warmly welcomed by Saudi leaders during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic arch-rival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington.

Arqiva, a broadcast infrastructure group, and Bakkavor, which makes hummus for supermarkets, both shelved their IPOs at the last minute, saying that the market for new issues is too volatile. There’s something to that, at least in Britain. Companies in Europe have raised $38.5 billion in new equity offerings in 2017, 22 percent more than at this time last year. In Britain, however, total takings are down 13 percent.

True, the affected companies have their quirks. Arqiva runs old-school TV masts, while Bakkavor has four customers of scale and En+ is an oligarch’s plaything. Yet newly listed stocks elsewhere are also doing less well than new investors might have hoped. Shares in BAWAG Group, an Austrian bank, have fallen 5 percent since they started trading on Oct. 25. SMCP, a French clothier, is also trading below its offer price. HelloFresh, which delivers pre-prepared recipe kits and is ploughing the proceeds of its offering into marketing, is barely a whisker above where it started on Thursday.

Hedge funds are one source of trouble. Having made a decent return this year so far – 10.7 percent on equity strategies by Sept. 30 according to Preqin data – fund managers have little incentive to risk their performance fees on untested new stocks. Shares in Blue Apron, an American HelloFresh clone, have plunged by two-thirds since the company’s June IPO in New York. Hedge funds aren’t everything, but they provide capital markets bankers with a useful way of jimmying up price tension.

The finger then points to the banks themselves. After all, their job ought to be to know how market participants are feeling some time before the 11th hour. But accountability is being spread ever thinner. A European IPO now has on average 2.5 bookrunners – the highest ever in the region.

Puigdemont, que foi para a Bélgica depois de seu governo ter sido destituído após uma declaração unilateral de independência, disse na sexta-feira que está considerando concorrer nas eleições, mesmo estando em Bruxelas.

Em meio à mais grave crise política da Espanha desde o retorno da democracia, no fim da década de 1970, o primeiro-ministro, Mariano Rajoy, convocou uma eleição depois da intervenção na Catalunha, ocorrida há uma semana.

Os partidos políticos que desejarem formar uma coalizão têm até a terça-feira para registrar suas chapas, e até 18 de novembro para anunciar seus candidatos.

Pesquisa publicada na terça-feira mostrou que a coalizão pró-independência Juntos pel Si ganharia a eleição se ela fosse realizada hoje, com 35,2 por cento das preferências.

Esse resultado daria a eles novamente uma maioria parlamentar pela independência, caso o grupo mantenha sua atual aliança com o CUP, de extrema-esquerda.

A rica região noroeste da Espanha continua dividida entre os que apoiam a separação e os que querer manter as terras catalãs como parte da Espanha, mostraram pesquisas tomadas desde a declaração de independência.

Se os partidos pró-independência se separarem, pode ficar difícil formar uma maioria parlamentar, embora a prisão de ex-membros do governo possa unir o eleitorado crítico a Madri, visto como poder demasiadamente repressor.

São candidatos pró-Espanha os do Partido Popular (PP), de Rajoy, os Socialistas e o Ciudadanos, legenda pró-mercado. Tais partidos realizaram pequenas manifestações neste sábado, pedindo que a chamada maioria silenciosa vote em massa em dezembro.

Na quinta-feira, nove membros do gabinete de Puigdemont receberam ordem de prisão preventiva pela Suprema Corte espanhola, enquanto são investigados e podem ser denunciados. Um membro do ministério dissolvido, Santi Vila, foi solto na sexta-feira, após pagar fiança de 50 mil euros. Os outros oito permanecem presos.

Na sexta-feira, a Espanha emitiu o mandado de prisão contra Puigdemont e quatro assessores por rebelião, incitação de motim, malversação de dinheiro público, desobediência e quebra de confiança, todas acusações relacionadas à campanha pela independência.

O grupo cívico catalão Asamblea Nacional Catalana y Omnium Cultural, cujos líderes foram presos no mês passado sob acusação de motim, convocaram uma greve geral no dia 8 e uma grande manifestação no dia 11, em protesto contra as detenções.

Puigdemont afirmou que não voltará à Espanha até receber garantias de Madri.

In an order filed in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said Veselnitskaya’s immigration status was “squarely within the purview of the executive branch.”

Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May agreed to pay nearly $6 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing it of laundering proceeds of a $230 million tax fraud. Her temporary permission from the U.S. Department of Justice to enter the United States while working on the case has expired.

Following Pauley’s order on Monday, a U.S. lawyer for Prevezon filed a letter asking that Veselnitskaya be allowed to appear by telephone at the hearing, which is scheduled for Nov. 9.

The hearing is expected to focus on whether the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, as the U.S. government has maintained. Prevezon disputed that in a letter filed on Oct. 31.

About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon the Netherlands had frozen at the United States’ request, according to the letter.

The Netherlands lifted the freeze on Oct. 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Prevezon’s letter said.

Browder has said that the underlying $230 million tax fraud was uncovered by a former Hermitage auditor, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009.

In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so they could attend hearings.

Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year.

Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.

The 2012 law was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for Magnitsky’s death.

Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”",Judge denies request to return to U.S. by Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr.,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer/judge-denies-request-to-return-to-u-s-by-russian-lawyer-who-met-trump-jr-idUSKBN1D32JM

TV3 via REUTERS

Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels.

In Spain’s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago.

Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.

“It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,” Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box.

Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont’s tweet.

EVENLY SPLIT

In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately.

That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.

If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid’s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed.

Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December.

Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election.

JAILED POLITICIANS

The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.

“It is up to the state to show it’s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,” she said.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont’s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions.

Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.

Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.

Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.

“Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don’t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.”

While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.

“To pick someone up and arrest them is not politics. Politics is talking, discussing. To arrest some, it seems to me a little bit like a fascist government,” Barcelona resident Cristiano Gonzalez, 34, said.

The announcement marks the latest failed attempt to combine the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, as Sprint parent SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), and T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGn.DE), show unwillingness to part with their prized U.S. telecom assets.

The companies’ unusual step of making a joint announcement on the canceled negotiations could indicate they still recognize the merits of a merger and could keep the door open for potential future talks.

The companies said they ended talks because they “were unable to find mutually agreeable terms.”

A combined company would have had more than 130 million U.S. subscribers, behind Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and AT&T Inc T.N..

John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US Inc, said in the statement that the prospect of combining with Sprint was compelling but “we have been clear all along that a deal with anyone will have to result in superior long-term value for T-Mobile’s shareholders compared to our outstanding stand-alone performance and track record.”

Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the statement that even though the companies could not reach a deal, “we certainly recognize the benefits of scale through a potential combination.” He said Sprint has agreed it is best to move forward on its own with “significant assets, including our rich spectrum holdings, and are accelerating significant investments in our network to ensure our continued growth.”

The two companies came close to announcing a merger in 2014 but called it off at the last minute due to regulatory concerns.

Industry executives have said a combined Sprint-T-Mobile entity would have the scale, network and enhanced portfolio of wireless airwaves that could enable it to better compete with AT&T and Verizon on 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store.","NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shoppers surged into Apple Inc stores across the world on Friday to buy the new iPhone X, signaling stronger demand for the 10th anniversary version of the premium smartphone than the last two iterations.

Investors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the company’s better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.

Apple’s shares rose 3 percent on Friday, hitting a record high and giving the world’s most valuable publicly traded company a market capitalization of almost $890 billion.

“I can’t wait to get to my office and plug it in, back it up and play around with it,” said Jordan Shapiro, a 34-year-old recruiter from New Jersey who was one of the first to get into Apple’s flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, at the head of a line that stretched for a block.

Jasmine Rivera, a 16-year-old from Las Vegas, said getting one of the new phones was the highlight of her New York trip with her aunt.

“I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”

The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States.

The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.

Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.

In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.

“I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.

GLOBAL EXCITEMENT

Similar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.

In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.

“It’s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I‘m excited,” builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line. He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.

In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.

“I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.

In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.

Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.

Newly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters. In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary model’s starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).

SUPPLY CLOSER TO DEMAND

Analysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand. The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.

But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.

“Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said.

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.

The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.

Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion.

Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.

“We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.",Long lines for iPhone X help push Apple shares to record high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/long-lines-for-iphone-x-help-push-apple-shares-to-record-high-idUSKBN1D22Y2

On Thursday, the Bank added 25 basis points to borrowing costs, taking them to 0.50 percent, and many economists polled after the announcement have come around to thinking that Thursday’s hike was justified.

Unlike other major central banks, the Bank is facing inflation running well above target, due mainly to the fall in sterling after last year’s Brexit vote. But it expects inflation to peak at 3.2 percent in October. The Bank’s target is 2 percent.

Policymakers expect only “very gradual” further increases as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Thursday’s hike will be followed by just two more quarter-point increases over the next three years, according to the assumptions that underpinned the Bank’s latest economic forecasts.

BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday the Bank’s signal that it may need to raise interest rates two more times is “not a promise”.

Economists in the Reuters poll, taken after Thursday’s announcement, took the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee at its word on gradual rate hikes. Their median forecast was for the next 25 basis-point rate increase not to come until the second quarter of 2019 - just after Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.

“Now that the MPC has taken the plunge on a rate rise, the question is whether this marks the beginning of a series of increases in borrowing costs, or if the Committee is now minded to stand pat for an extended period of time,” said Martin Beck, lead UK economist at Oxford Economics.

“We favour the latter prediction. It’s ‘one and done’ for now.”

Markets agreed: sterling GBP= extended its losses on Friday, slipping to a one-month low against the dollar as investors rushed to exit positions.

The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have also taken a cautious approach as they attempt to wean their economies off massive stimulus programmes.

Bank Governor Mark Carney said Brexit talks were likely to be the biggest factor for the next BoE move, either up or down, yet none of the 51 economists polled had a cut in their forecasts and gave only a median 20 percent chance that Thursday’s decision would be reversed.

JUSTIFIED

In a Reuters poll taken ahead of the announcement, 34 of 48 economists said now was not the time for the central bank to be raising rates.

But in a reversal of largely the same sample, 27 of 46 said the Bank’s move was not a mistake, while 19 stuck to their original view.

“It was perfectly justified,” said Jacob Nell, chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley.

“Growth is running above potential and slack is being eroded, and once they had given that strong guidance in September and data in October came in stronger, it would have been much more of a shock and a surprise if it hadn’t delivered.”

Britain’s economy has slowed sharply this year as the jump in inflation has hurt household spending and the uncertainty about Brexit has weighed on investment by businesses.

A Reuters poll of economists last month showed that the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit has crept higher, and there was a 30 percent chance Britain would leave the EU without a trade deal when two-year divorce talks end in March 2019.

Prime Minister Theresa May faces a political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without triggering a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer that she walked away from the talks.","Bank of England hike was a 'one and done', next move not until second quarter 2019 - Reuters poll",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-boe-rates-poll/bank-of-england-hike-was-a-one-and-done-next-move-not-until-second-quarter-2019-reuters-poll-idUKKBN1D31IC

A empresa de streaming de vídeo suspendeu no começo desta semana a produção da sexta e última temporada da série sobre política, na qual Spacey interpreta o presidente norte-americano Frank Underwood.

“A Netflix não se envolverá em mais nenhuma produção de House of Cards que tenha Kevin Spacey”, afirmou a empresa em comunicado no fim da sexta-feira.

O agente de Spacey rescindiu o contrato com ele na quinta-feira, e ainda não se sabe quem o representa.

A saída de Spacey não significa o fim da série, contudo: ”Embora continuemos uma investigação sobre as sérias acusações relacionadas ao comportamento de Kevin Spacey no set de House of Cards, ele já foi suspenso com efeito imediato”, disse em comunicado a Media Rights Capital, que produz o programa.

“A MRC, em parceria com a Netflix, continuará avaliando uma continuação criativa para a série durante o hiato”, anunciou..

Spacey, dono de uma bem-sucedida carreira no cinema, na televisão e no teatro, é mais um dos famosos acusados de má conduta sexual por pessoas que decidiram delatar celebridades, sendo a mais recente delas o produtor cinematográfico Harvey Weinstein.

Na semana passada, Spacey se desculpou com o ator Anthony Rapp, que o acusou de tentar seduzi-lo em 1986, quando Rapp tinha apenas 14 anos. A CNN informou na quinta-feira que oito ex-funcionários de House of Cards, que não foram identificados, acusaram Spacey de assédio sexual.

A Reuters não conseguiu confirmar independentemente as acuações.

Spacey, como parte de seu pedido de desculpas a Rapp, anunciou que é gay, o que causou revolta na comunidade LGBT e em demais círculos sociais, que o acusaram de desviar o foco das acusações feitas por Rapp.

Os representantes de Spacey disseram na quarta-feira que ele buscou avaliação e tratamento profissionais, sem dar mais detalhes sobre o tipo de terapia.

Após anunciar o tratamento, Spacey viu uma série de novas acusações contra ele surgirem por parte do ator mexicano Roberto Cavazos, que trabalhou no teatro de Londres quando Spacey era diretor artístico, de 2004 a 2015, e do produtor norte-americano Tony Montana.

A MRC afirmou em comunicado, na quinta-feira, que lidou com um incidente em 2012, quando um membro não identificado da série fez uma reclamação contra Kevin Spacey, que ações imediatas foram tomadas e o problema foi resolvido.

A decisão da Netflix de cortar laços com Spacey vai além de House of Cards. A empresa não lançará o filme “Gore”, que estava em pós-produção e foi produzido por Spacey. Nela, o ator interpreta o escritor falecido Gore Vidal.

The Polish government, whose judiciary reform has been met with youth protests and legal action from the European Union, had accused German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen of interference after she called for supporting “the healthy democratic resistance of the young generation” in Poland.

But a spokesman for von der Leyen said the comments had been misinterpreted and the minister had instead praised Poland’s achievements since the fall of communism and called for a more inclusive approach to European integration.

“The defense minister’s quote was changed in social media and ripped out of context,” a spokesman for von der Leyen told Reuters on Saturday.

“Mrs von der Leyen has emphasized that the EU is an inclusive process, which is about securing and consolidating the common values of the EU and dealing with all positions.”

The Polish reform of the courts would give nearly a free hand to the ruling conservatives in picking the country’s top judges.

It has triggered protests by thousands of young people and others over the summer and an “infringement procedure” from the European Union.

It comes as some European leaders call for letting some member states in the wealthier, Western part of the bloc push ahead with further integration without the others following suit.

During the show broadcast Thursday on ZDF television, von der Leyen highlighted significant efforts undertaken by the Baltic states and Poland to “live in freedom” and to be part of the European Union.

“Precisely this healthy democratic resistance of the young people, also there in Poland, must be supported,” she said.

Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski called on von der Leyen to withdraw her words.

“This is one of the most explicit statements, which I am not sure whether it is a warning or an admission by the German side of interfering into our internal affairs,” Waszczykowski told the wpolitice.pl right-wing news portal.

The Polish defense ministry said it would summon the defense attache from the German embassy for an explanation.

Von der Leyen is part of the conservative team trying to negotiate a new coalition government with the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.

Minutes after Sayfullo Saipov drove a truck down a bike path in the city on Tuesday, a Reuters team started collecting videos and images taken by bystanders during the deadly attack.

When news breaks, video and images captured by people on smartphones frequently drive news updates worldwide. At Reuters, social media producers in London, Mexico City, Beijing, Singapore, Amman and Gdynia, Poland, find, verify and get permission to distribute user-generated content to our news clients.

In images and video from Tuesday’s attack posted on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, we looked for clues and details to confirm the location, like the Chambers Street sign.

Reuters reviewed 36 videos and photographs depicting Tuesday’s incident – in real time – along with 12 more of the aftermath. Ultimately, we authenticated and cleared 10 pieces of content, including images of a school bus that was hit with children inside. We need to ensure the photograph was authentic, and that the faces of the children are not easily identifiable.

We managed to secure videos taken by two passersby who witnessed the destroyed school bus up close, moments after the crash, as well as video of victims on the ground before both witnesses were escorted away from the premises by police.

Reuters also used social media messaging to communicate with eyewitnesses who posted video or pictures, seeking accounts of what happened and consent to share their material. That is how we connected with Tawhid Kabir Xisan, who shot the 34-second video of the attacker.

Reuters has used similar newsgathering techniques since 2013. In recent months, we verified a photograph of La Vita Bella nursing home residents in waist-high water in Dickinson, Texas, during the flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey in August.

After Mexico City was hit with a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, we checked to see that the timestamp on the user’s cellphone matched the minute of the earthquake when verifying a video showing the collapsing side walls of a high-rise government building.

Social media is a tool we use to augment our own reporting, often providing a more immediate and intimate view of news events. Unique images like the picture of Texas nursing home residents or the exact moment a building turns to rubble showcase the news value of social media in times when information and images are shared by more and more people.",Sorting through fast-moving information,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-backstory-new-york-attack/sorting-through-fast-moving-information-idUSKBN1D22NU

Former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai are competing to succeed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose election in 2005 helped draw a line under 14 years of civil war.

The vote is meant to mark Liberia’s first democratic transition of power since 1944, but the Supreme Court this week halted preparations while it examined charges by third-place finisher Charles Brumskine’s Liberty Party that the Oct. 10 first round was marred by fraud.

Following arguments by the Liberty Party and counter-arguments by the NEC, Chief Justice Francis Korkpor said that the court would give its decision at 10 a.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, one day before the scheduled poll.

“The election will definitely be delayed, but we don’t know for how long,” NEC spokesman Henry Flomo said. “The fact that the court will not rule until Monday is a delay.”

Boakai’s ruling Unity Party has backed the Liberty Party’s allegations and even accused Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, of interfering in the vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates.

Johnson Sirleaf denied the meetings were inappropriate. Observers from the European Union and the Carter Center said they saw no major problems with the first round vote.

Addressing the court’s five justices, Brumskine cited “gross irregularities”. In its complaint last week, the Liberty Party alleged various problems, including the late opening of polls, the absence of queue controllers and fraud by NEC officials.

“This is not about losing or winning,” Brumskine told the court. “It has do to do with putting a system in place.”

Lawyers for the NEC replied that the petitioners did not have any evidence and asked that the court lift its stay so that the commission could organize the second round.

The streets of the capital Monrovia remained calm with riot police deployed to protect the Supreme Court building and the election commission headquarters.

Weah, who became the first non-European to win the European soccer player of the year award in 1995, won the first round of voting with 38.4 percent to Boakai’s 28.8 percent. Brumskine won nearly 10 percent.",Fraud probe to delay Liberia election run-off: election commission,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D407T-OZATP

O piloto de 36 anos tinha se aposentado na temporada passada, mas foi chamado de volta pela equipe de Williams após Valtteri Bottas ir para a Mercedes diante da surpreendente aposentadoria do campeão mundial de 2016, Nico Rosberg.

Após uma despedida emocionante no Brasil no ano passado, Massa voltou no cockpit alguns meses depois.

“Como sabem, no ano passado eu decidi anunciar minha aposentadoria na Fórmula 1, mas, devido ao pedido de Williams, eu decidi fazer outra temporada”, disse o ex-piloto da Ferrari em mensagem de vídeo publicada nas mídias sociais.

“Mas esta vez será a minha última corrida no Brasil da Fórmula 1 e minha última corrida em Abu Dhabi”, acrescentou, agradecendo a sua família, fãs e patrocinadores e deixando claro que ele não está se aposentando totalmente de competições.

“Eu realmente espero que você possa me apoiar no próximo ano ou talvez no futuro em outras em outras categorias”, disse ele.

O Grande Prêmio do Brasil, penúltima corrida da temporada, acontece na próxima semana, com Abu Dhabi encerrando a temporada em 26 de novembro.

A Williams ainda não anunciou sua equipe de 2018, com vários candidatos, incluindo Robert Kubica da Polônia. O novato canadense Lance Stroll certamente continuará.

Massa ganhou 11 corridas com a Ferrari e perdeu um campeonato para Lewis Hamilton, por um ponto na temporada 2008.

Em 2009, ele sofreu uma grave lesão na cabeça e ficou em coma por vários dias após ser atingido no capacete no Grande Prêmio da Hungria, por uma peça que se soltou do carro do também brasileiro Rubens Barrichello.

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on. It’s not in that situation now,” said Senator Andre Pratte, an independent who was appointed by Trudeau in 2016.",Canada government facing resistance from Senate over pot law,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D32IK-OCADN

The new group, Ansar al-Islam, gave no evidence for its claim of responsibility for the Oct. 21 attack but said Abu Hatem Emad al-Din Abd al-Hamid, a fighter suspected by the authorities of involvement, was one of its leaders. He was killed this week in an air strike.

“We have started our jihad with the battle of the Lion’s Den in the Bahariya Oasis area on the borders of Cairo and were victorious against the enemy’s campaign,” the statement said.

Two security sources and a forensic doctor said DNA analysis of bodies of militants killed in the air raid showed Abd al-Hamid was among them.

The security sources said he was the deputy of Hesham al-Ashmawy, a former Egyptian military officer turned jihadist who has operated out of the city of Derna across the border in Libya and is blamed for past attacks. The two men graduated from Egypt’s military academy the same year and were both fired from the army for adopting radical Islamist beliefs.

Ashmawy is known for being loyal to al Qaeda, which means that if Ansar al-Islam’s claim of responsibility is verified it could herald the emergence of a new Egyptian cell of the network founded by Osama bin Laden.

In recent years most attacks on security forces in Egypt have been blamed on fighters claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group. Ashmawy is believed to have switched allegiance from Islamic State to al Qaeda, which operates more on a system of linked cells rather than a formal hierarchy.

“We have information that Ashmawy and Abd al-Hamid broke away from (Islamic State) after a third colleague of theirs was killed and also for doctrinal issues,” said one officer with Egypt’s Homeland Security agency on condition of anonymity.

Three security sources said at the time of the Oct. 21 attack that at least 52 police officers and conscripts had been killed when their patrol was struck by militants. The interior ministry denied that figure the next day, saying 16 policemen had been killed.

NEW FRONT

The attack was the latest to plague Egypt’s security forces who face an Islamic State insurgency mostly focused in the Sinai Peninsula but which has expanded to mainland Egypt. Other militant groups are active in Cairo and other cities.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi appointed a new military chief of staff after the militants struck. The Interior Ministry dismissed several high-ranking officials.

Security forces responded with two raids in the span of a week, killing dozens of militants and freeing a police officer who was taken hostage during the attack.

Ansar al-Islam said it used rocket-propelled grenades in the attack but provided no estimate for how many people were killed. It said the Egyptian air force struck 11 days later, killing several members including Abd al-Hamid.

Security sources say Ashmawy has carried out some of the most high-profile attacks in Egypt, including the attempted assassination of a former Interior Minister in 2013 and the killing in 2015 of Egypt’s top public prosecutor in a car bomb.

Ashmawy moved in 2014 to Derna, a hotbed of Libyan Islamist radicalism near the border with Egypt, where he runs an al-Qaeda cell, security sources say. Derna has been hit in air strikes by both the eastern-based Libyan National Army and its ally Egypt. Both denied carrying out air strikes on Derna on Monday which killed at 1east 15 people, however.

Ansar al-Islam’s statement was carried by groups with al-Qaeda links, including Guardians of Sharia, whose social media feeds carry statements from al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.",New al Qaeda-linked group claims responsibility for major Egypt attack,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D31FI-OZATP

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

The St Mary’s crowd have not had much to cheer of late as their side had won only twice in 11 games prior to the visit of Burnley.

It looked like Saints were about to better that record but they found Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope in fine form before substitute Sam Vokes brilliantly headed in the winner in the 81st minute with his side’s only shot on target in the match.

The result sees Burnley climb above Liverpool into sixth, temporarily at least, while Southampton stay in 13th.

The first half was a cagey affair where it took until the 35th minute for either goalkeeper to be forced into a save. Pope was the first to be tested, beating away Sofiane Boufal’s effort.

Pope then had to make an even better save to palm Nathan Redmond’s drilled effort around the post just before half time.

After the break, Pope continued to thwart Saints, with his best save of the match reserved for Maya Yoshida’s strike from the edge of the box as he acrobatically tipped the ball over the crossbar.

Redmond then played a fine one-two with Manolo Gabbiadini to work a chance for himself but sliced his strike wide from a good position.

Burnley started to create some problems after manager Sean Dyche made a positive double change, bringing on Ashley Barnes and Vokes to go with two strikers up front, and the pressure told as they scored what proved to be the winning goal nine minutes from time.

“The two lads coming off the bench changed the game,” Dyche said. “They were terrific. We have found a way to operate that suits us.”

Johann Berg Gudmundsson whipped a cross on to the head of Vokes, who was facing away from goal with plenty still to do to even get the ball on target, but he managed to arch his back and power the header beyond the reach of Fraser Forster in the Saints’ goal.

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

“The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,” said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

“Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That’s why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,” said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday’s mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks. [GOL/]

“Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

“Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

The game, in which players fight zombies that are superimposed onto the real world on smartphone screens, is tapping into the trend of augmented reality (AR) which gained mass adoption last year with the release of Niantic Inc’s Pokemon Go.

Next Games said the “Walking Dead: Our World” game, which it hopes will mirror Pokemon Go’s success, will be available for test users on Apple’s App Store and Google Play in selected regions by January before a wider release later next year.

The TV show tells the story of a world overrun by zombies, and the new game will use AR technology to let players battle the zombie characters in real world environments.

Based on the same show, Next Games has previously developed a mobile strategy game which has been downloaded by more than 16 million users.

“I have an optimistic view on (the new game‘s) potential. I expect this game to reach similar levels of revenue to their previous game,” said analyst Jerker Salokivi at Evli brokerage, with a “hold” rating on the stock.

Shares in the company, which was listed in March, jumped more than 100 percent in August after the company released its first video trailer of the upcoming game.

The stock fell more than 7 percent on Friday as the company reported a loss from the first nine months of the year due to investments in game development.

Its sales from January to September rose 30 percent from a year ago to around 26 million euros ($30 million).

This year, Google and Apple have both released augmented reality applications for their devices to compete for the attention of customers and software developers building such games.

Pokemon Go, which has players walking around real life neighborhoods to catch and train creatures, has more than 750 million downloads.

“AR games ... need to give the player a reason to look through their cameras, to change their surroundings into something else. With zombies, you don’t luckily get to do it any other way,” Next Games CEO Teemu Huuhtanen told Reuters in September.

In another recent AR initiative, Mattel and tech company Osmo launched an augmented reality version for “Hotwheels” toy car game.",'Walking Dead' zombie game seeks Pokemon-style success,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1D31UM-OCAEN

The OPEC member’s socialist leader wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt and has put an alleged drug trafficker in charge of working out how. U.S. sanctions make any refinancing virtually impossible. But even default might not force the hapless, increasingly authoritarian former bus driver from power.

Maduro presides over a mismanaged economy that was hit hard by the end of the oil-price boom in 2014. Now the government cannot provide sufficient food or medicine for its citizens despite huge crude reserves. Nonetheless, on Thursday he said state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela would make a $1.1 billion payment on a bond maturing that day. He also asked Vice President Tareck El Aissami to head a commission studying how to restructure all future obligations. El Aissami called on bondholders to meet in Caracas on Nov. 13 to discuss how that might work.

With great difficulty, is the answer. El Aissami is blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury as an alleged narcotics kingpin, something he denies. Sanctions against Maduro’s government effectively mean U.S. banks can’t take part in any restructuring of the country’s foreign debt, estimated at $90 billion or higher. The country owes some $9 billion in sovereign and PDVSA debt payments in 2018. Reserves have dwindled to barely more than that.

Default might ease some domestic pressure on Maduro by allowing his government to divert scarce dollars to import more medical supplies, food and other basic goods. Yet that may prompt creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments and assets abroad such as PDVSA’s U.S. refiner Citgo.

To counter that, Maduro’s government could try to somehow funnel oil exports through ally Russia, or try to arrange further cash-for-oil barter deals like those it has with Russia and China. It could try to maintain payments on PDVSA debt, protecting the company’s assets, while halting payments on sovereign debt.

Maduro looks increasingly willing to resort to repression. Elections for an all-powerful Constituent Assembly resulted in a rubber-stamp body crammed with government loyalists. Opposition politicians alleged fraud in recent gubernatorial polls but lost heavily and seem unable to unite against him. A presidential vote due next year looks unlikely to be free or fair. Unless dissatisfaction among his own allies in government forces Maduro out, he may end up presiding over a bizarre twilight economy for years to come.",Breakingviews - Venezuela's Maduro enters alternate reality,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-venezuelas-maduro-enters-alternate-reality-idUSKBN1D324G

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that U.S. Special Operation Forces captured the militant in Libya in the past few days.

Two of the officials identified him as Mustafa al-Imam and said he had played a role in the attack and the ambassador’s death.

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

The announcement comes a day after Sony confirmed its renaissance by forecasting its highest-ever profit this financial year, sending its shares surging to a nine-year high.

AIBO is billed as a pet that behaves like a real dog using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. The upgrade sees AIBO equipped with new sensing and movement technologies as well as far more advanced AI backed by cloud computing to develop the dog’s personality.

Sales begin in Japan in January for 198,000 yen ($1,739).

Sony pioneered entertainment robots with AIBO in 1999. It sold about 150,000 dogs in Japan before ceasing production seven years later when its core consumer electronics business struggled in price wars with emerging Asian rivals.

“It was a difficult decision to stop the project in 2006, but we continued development in AI and robotics,” Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai said at a news briefing.

“I asked our engineers a year and a half ago to develop (new) AIBO because I strongly believe robots capable of building loving relationships with people help realize Sony’s mission (to inspire).”

The reborn AIBO features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, AIBO can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions.

Sony said it aims to sell at least as many new AIBO as the original, without giving a time frame. It also said it is considering overseas sales.

The firm sees AI as a future pillar of growth, hoping to catch up with major technology companies such as Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google.

It invested an undisclosed sum last year in Cogitai, a U.S. AI start-up focusing on technology that allows machines to learn continually and autonomously from interaction in the real world.

Berkshire on Friday said it lost $3 billion before taxes, or $1.95 billion after-tax, from the disasters, leaving its Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance units with underwriting losses for the year.

Insurance typically accounts for about one-fourth of Berkshire’s overall profit. Berkshire has roughly 90 businesses in such sectors as chemicals, energy, food and retail and industrial products. It also owns the BNSF railroad.

Jim Shanahan, a senior analyst at Edward Jones & Co, said the disaster losses were higher than he had expected, given how pricing pressures had caused Berkshire to retrench from some business, but said shareholders should remain comfortable with the company over the long term.

Overall net income fell to $4.07 billion, or $2,473 per Class A share (BRKa.N), from $7.2 billion, or $4,379 per share, a year earlier.

Operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses and which Buffett says better reflects company performance, fell 29 percent to $3.44 billion, or $2,094 per Class A share, from $4.85 billion, or $2,951 per share a year earlier.

That missed analysts’ average operating profit forecast of $2,402.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s diversification helped cushion the earnings decline, as profit rose at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, while “improving economic conditions” helped boost shipping and profit at BNSF.

A better economy may also have persuaded more people to buy cars and trucks, as higher financing activity at the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership unit helped boost pre-tax retail profit by 22 percent.

Book value per Class A share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 2.5 percent in the quarter to $187,435, and was up 8.9 percent from January to September.

Berkshire also ended September with $109.3 billion of cash and equivalents, more than five times the $20 billion minimum Buffett has said he prefers, and investors are waiting to see what he does with it.

Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, and investors have remained confident in his leadership, as the company’s share price has risen 15 percent this year.

The Class A shares closed Friday down $2,963.99, or 1 percent, at $280,470.01, while Class B shares (BRKb.N) fell $1.34, or 0.7 percent, to $187.27. Both were about 2 percent below their Oct. 24 record highs.

FULL-YEAR UNDERWRITING LOSS LIKELY

Berkshire lost $1.44 billion from insurance underwriting in the quarter and $1.73 billion from January to September, putting it on pace for its first full-year underwriting loss since 2002.

It had even eked out a small underwriting profit in 2005, the year of Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita and Dennis.

But investment income from insurance operations cushioned the blow, rising 23 percent in the quarter to $1.04 billion.

Other insurers and reinsurers, such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), American International Group Inc (AIG.N) and Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S), also suffered larger quarterly storm losses, and like Berkshire are hoping to boost rates.

Berkshire’s results also reflected an accounting charge tied to its January agreement to assume many of AIG’s policies in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.

But that and other premiums that Berkshire receives before paying claims have helped boost its insurance “float” to $113 billion, giving Buffett more money to invest.

Shanahan, who rates Berkshire a “buy,” said he was encouraged at how Geico is adding market share, reflected in a 16.5 percent jump in premiums and 9.9 percent year-over-year growth in policies.

Some of Berkshire’s cash hoard will eventually be used to buy 80 percent of Pilot Flying J, the largest U.S. truck stop operator. Buffett announced that investment on Oct. 3.

One recall covers 670,000 2006-2011 U.S. 3-Series vehicles to address a wiring issue for heating and air conditioning systems that may overheat and could increase the risk of a fire.

The second recall covers 740,000 U.S. 2007-2011 vehicles with a valve heater that could rust and lead to a fire in rare cases. The recall includes some 128i vehicles, 3-Series, 5-Series and X3, X5 and Z4 vehicles.

BMW spokesman Michael Rebstock said the recalls overlap and cover about 1 million vehicles, nearly all in the United States and about 15,000 in Canada. He said the recalls may be expanded.

“We are examining whether it will be necessary in the future to widen this (recall) into other countries,” he said.

BMW said both recalls followed recent meetings with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

In the heating and air conditioning recall, BMW told NHTSA it first got a report of an incident in 2008 involving heat- related damage to a 2006 3-Series sedan, but did not determine a root cause. The automaker continued to monitor additional field incidents in the following years.

In 2011, BMW made a quality improvement to the blower-regulator wiring harness. No injuries were reported between 2007 and 2014, but in 2015, BMW was made aware of three incidents in which there were allegations of injuries. In early September, BMW learned of another incident involving a 2011 BMW 3 Series vehicle.

Dealers will replace a wiring harness if necessary and potentially additional parts.

In the valve heater issue recall, BMW first received a report in 2009 of an incident in a 2007 X5 involving heat-related damage to the engine compartment, the company told NHTSA. It received other reports and continued to review the issue and inspect returned parts, but had no reports of injuries or crashes related to the issue.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D324K-OCABS

A dirlo è Carlo Cottarelli, in occasione della presentazione del nuovo ‘Osservatorio sui conti pubblici italiani’ che dirigerà a titolo gratuito.

“Del 2012 in occasione delle stime semestrali il governo di turno ha sempre rivisto al ribasso l‘obiettivo del saldo primario. Se tutto va bene nel 2018 il saldo primario sarà del 2% contro il 5% che il governo prevedeva nel 2014” ha detto l‘ex-dirigente apicale del Fondo monetario internazionale.

Il saldo primario è dato dalla differenza tra entrate e spese pubbliche al netto della spesa per interessi, tallone d‘Achille italiano a causa dell‘elevato debito pubblico.

Un saldo primario del 4% in condizioni di crescita economica ‘normali’ serve per avere un calo annuo di tre punti percentuali del rapporto debito/Pil.

“In questo modo nei periodi in cui la crescita viene a mancare il debito rimane costante e non riprende a salire” ha spiegato Cottareli durante un incontro all‘Università Cattolica a cui fa capo il nuovo osservatorio. “La riduzione marginale del debito che vedremo quest‘anno e il prossimo non è sufficiente”.

Le stime del governo, dopo il 132% del 2016, vedono il rapporto debito/Pil al 131,6% a fine 2017 e al 130% a fine 2018.

Al governo attuale e a quello che uscirà dalle elezioni, Cottarelli, commissario per la spending review durante il governo Letta, raccomanda in tema di contenimento dei conti pubblici di evitare inversioni di tendenza in tema pensionistico.

“Sarebbe un grosso problema per i conti pubblici se si cominciasse già a disfare quello che è stato approvato alcuni anni fa con la riforma delle pensioni. Non vedo spazio per cambiare il meccanismo di indicizzazione dell‘età pensionabile alle aspettative di vita” ha spiegato.

In un recente incontro con i sindacati il governo, fatto salvo il principio dell‘adeguamento dell‘età pensionabile alle aspettative di vita, si è detto disponibile a discutere eccezioni per i lavoratori impiegati in attività gravose.

Sempre in tema di contenimento della spesa pubblica, Cottarelli chiede al governo di ragionare sulla moltiplicazone dei bonus vista ngli ultimi anni.

Delson Guarate, who had been a mayor in central Aragua state, and former student leader Yon Goicoechea were among nearly 400 jailed anti-Maduro activists who rights campaigners say are political prisoners but whom the government calls coup-plotters.

“I‘m with my family today,” tweeted Goicoechea, displaying a photo of himself against the backdrop of Caracas’ Avila mountain. “Tomorrow I’ll address the country. God is with us.”

“I‘m free!” Guarate tweeted.

The pair’s freedom, with some unspecified conditions attached, was confirmed by opposition parties and a rights group, but the government had no comment.

The releases came as Maduro called for one of the most prominent opposition leaders, congress head Julio Borges, to face treason charges for lobbying against his government in global financial circles.

And the pro-Maduro Supreme Court began moves this week to remove parliamentary immunity for congress deputy leader Freddy Guevara, so he can be tried for instigating violence.

Guevara runs the militant Popular Will party, which both Goicoechea and Guarate belong to. It has been at the forefront of anti-Maduro protests, including four months of demonstrations this year that led to 125 deaths.

Critics say Maduro has turned the OPEC nation into a dictatorship. His supporters say the 54-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez is resisting a Western-backed push to oust him.

In a New York Times column earlier this year, Goicoechea described how a dozen policemen put a black cloth over his head when they arrested him before taking him to a cell without natural light or ventilation.

”When I stretched my arms, I could touch two opposite walls,“ he wrote in the column smuggled out of prison. ”The door was blocked with black garbage bags, leaving the room in total darkness.

“There was rotten, worm-infested food on the floor alongside scraps of clothing covered in feces. It felt as if I had been buried alive.”

Senior officials said Goicoechea was an “imperialist” agent caught with explosives in his possession, while Guarate had been financing “terrorism.” Neither was tried.

Popular Will, which the government has threatened to proscribe as a terrorist organization, said it would not stop fighting for the freedom of all activists.

“The dictatorship’s ‘justice’ is a revolving door,” said party legislator Juan Mejia. “Some leave, while others come in at its discretion and to its benefit.”",Venezuela frees two anti-Maduro activists; scores still jailed,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics/venezuela-frees-two-anti-maduro-activists-scores-still-jailed-idUKKBN1D40QY?il=0

The Polish government, whose judiciary reform has been met with youth protests and legal action from the European Union, had accused German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen of interference after she called for supporting “the healthy democratic resistance of the young generation” in Poland.

But a spokesman for von der Leyen said the comments had been misinterpreted and the minister had instead praised Poland’s achievements since the fall of communism and called for a more inclusive approach to European integration.

“The defense minister’s quote was changed in social media and ripped out of context,” a spokesman for von der Leyen told Reuters on Saturday.

“Mrs von der Leyen has emphasized that the EU is an inclusive process, which is about securing and consolidating the common values of the EU and dealing with all positions.”

The Polish reform of the courts would give nearly a free hand to the ruling conservatives in picking the country’s top judges.

It has triggered protests by thousands of young people and others over the summer and an “infringement procedure” from the European Union.

It comes as some European leaders call for letting some member states in the wealthier, Western part of the bloc push ahead with further integration without the others following suit.

During the show broadcast Thursday on ZDF television, von der Leyen highlighted significant efforts undertaken by the Baltic states and Poland to “live in freedom” and to be part of the European Union.

“Precisely this healthy democratic resistance of the young people, also there in Poland, must be supported,” she said.

Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski called on von der Leyen to withdraw her words.

“This is one of the most explicit statements, which I am not sure whether it is a warning or an admission by the German side of interfering into our internal affairs,” Waszczykowski told the wpolitice.pl right-wing news portal.

President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans have been calling for an investigation into the Uranium One deal, amid news of Mueller’s first indictments of Trump associates as the special counsel investigates allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.

Moscow denies any effort to influence the election, and Trump has dismissed the investigation as a “witch hunt.”

On Monday, the day the indictments became public, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a special counsel should be appointed to investigate Democrats over the uranium deal.

Another group of Republican lawmakers, including House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte launched an investigation last week to examine issues including the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 opponent, in the uranium deal.

Democrats have dismissed the Republicans’ activities as a partisan effort to distract from Mueller’s probe and from efforts to ensure that a foreign government, Moscow, does not influence future U.S. elections.

Gaetz, Biggs and Gohmert are all members of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the FBI and Department of Justice.

Gaetz has called for investigations of issues related to Clinton previously, including accusing former FBI Director James Comey of colluding with Mueller on the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s emails.",Republicans seek special counsel's removal from Russia probe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-congress/republicans-seek-special-counsels-removal-from-russia-probe-idUSKBN1D31W8

About 600 men have barricaded themselves inside the camp on remote Manus island in Papua New Guinea, defying efforts by Australia and PNG to shut it. Food, running water and medical services were cut off by Australia four days ago.

Australian authorities want the men moved to a transit center elsewhere on the island at the start of a process the asylum seekers fear will result in them being resettled in PNG or another developing nation.

The men also fear violent reprisals from the local community.

“These people have committed no crime other than to do what every single one of us would do if we thought our lives, or our family’s lives, were at risk,” Federal Greens lawmaker Adam Bandt told the crowd in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city.

Another smaller protest was staged in Sydney.

The Manus island center, and one on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, have been key parts of Australia’s disputed “Sovereign Borders” immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores.

Australia’s offshore detention policies have been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but are backed the center-right government and the Labor opposition.

U.N. rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news conference in Geneva on Friday about the “unfolding humanitarian emergency” in the Manus island center, where asylum seekers have been reported digging wells to try to find water.

The Australian government has not responded to Colville’s comments. It frequently does not comment on issues concerning the offshore centers, citing operational reasons.

The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of asylum seekers as part of a refugee swap deal, agreed on last year, under which Australia will accept refugees from Central America.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idINKBN1D327I

TV3 via REUTERS

Puigdemont, who went to Belgium after his government was fired following a unilateral declaration of independence, said on Friday he was considering standing in the election from Brussels.

In Spain’s gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the snap election after taking control of Catalonia a week ago.

Political parties that wish to run on a common platform have until Tuesday to register any potential coalition and until Nov. 18 to put forward their candidates.

“It is time for all democrats to join together. For Catalonia, for the freedom of political prisoners and for the republic,” Puigdemont said in a tweet that included the hashtag llistaunitaria.cat, a site calling for parties to unite against the Spanish government at the ballot box.

Signatures on the website rose to over 40,000 from just 2,000 within a few hours of Puigdemont’s tweet.

EVENLY SPLIT

In a poll published on Tuesday, the pro-independence coalition Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) was seen winning with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately.

That would return a parliamentary majority to independence supporters if the group stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.

The wealthy northeastern region continues to be evenly split between those that support leaving Spain and those that wish to remain part of the country, according to polls taken since the declaration of independence.

If pro-independence parties run on different tickets, it may be difficult for them to win a parliamentary majority, though the imprisonment of former government members may help unite an electorate already wary of Madrid’s tactics, seen by many as heavy-handed.

Pro-Spain candidates including Rajoy’s People’s Party (PP), the Socialists and market-friendly Ciudadanos were out canvassing on Saturday with modest rallies in the region calling for the so-called silent majority to vote en masse in December.

Ines Arrimadas, the head of regional opposition Ciudadanos, called for anti-independence parties to join together on Tuesday. She singled out the Socialists and Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to clarify if they would run with the independence party ERC in the election.

JAILED POLITICIANS

The ERC general secretary Marta Rovira said on Saturday the party may shun the elections if the politicians jailed pending trial over the independence bid were not freed before the vote.

“It is up to the state to show it’s democratic. Let the prisoners go free so they can take part in the elections normally,” she said.

On Thursday, nine members of Puigdemont’s sacked cabinet were ordered by Spain’s High Court to be held on remand pending an investigation and potential trial. One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,000) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.

On Friday, Spain issued an arrest warrant for Puigdemont and four associates to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.

Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural - whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges - have called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11 to protest against the detentions.

Puigdemont has said he would not return to Spain until he has been given unspecified “guarantees” by the Spanish government. Following the warrant, any extradition process could take 45 days, though this could be extended up to 90 days.

Puigdemont reiterated on Saturday in a tweet that he would fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the warrant.

Asked if he would detain Puigdemont on Saturday, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said it was unlikely.

“Tomorrow, or it could be possible on Monday,” he said. “We are not in a hurry. He said he would collaborate. We don’t have any reason to believe he will flee. We are going to do this thoroughly.”

While anti-independence parties urged Catalans to go out and vote in the December election, the arrests helped fuel the antagonism felt by many in the region toward the central government in Madrid.

“To pick someone up and arrest them is not politics. Politics is talking, discussing. To arrest some, it seems to me a little bit like a fascist government,” Barcelona resident Cristiano Gonzalez, 34, said.
