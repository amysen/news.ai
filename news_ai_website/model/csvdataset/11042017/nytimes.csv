I HEAR SHE’S A REAL BITCH

By Jen Agg

Illustrated. 355 pp. Penguin Books. Paper, $17.

From the first pages of Jen Agg’s memoir, “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch,” a reader knows she is dealing with a formidable ego. Agg isn’t a writer but a restaurateur. She owns five beloved restaurants and bars in Canada, where she is a fixture of the food press, both for her success and for her occasionally impolitic forthrightness. In “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch,” Agg brags, she swaggers, she writes in great detail about her appetites — for junk food, music, sex. She is also relentlessly digressive — one of the truest signs of robust self-regard. Reading Agg’s book, I felt as if I was spending hours with someone who was pacing and rambling, expecting me to scribble disorderly dictation into my steno pad, stopping on occasion to ask me imperiously: “Are you getting all this?”

Whether I was depended entirely on which of the several books contained in “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” I was reading.

As a memoir, the book is sometimes unbearable. Memoir is a difficult form. It finds success, paradoxically, when its writer, self-absorbed enough in life to believe her story worth telling, is humble and curious on the page. The great ones are truly great. Think of “Speak, Memory” and “Black Boy,” of “A Moveable Feast” and “Just Kids.” Most humans care mostly about themselves. Good memoirs exhale humility. Agg is too proud of herself for that. (“Running Cobalt” — her first bar — “came very naturally to me.”) There is a nine-page chapter recounting what Agg has tweeted. It segues into a description of a conference Agg staged called “Kitchen Bitches: Smashing the Patriarchy One Plate at a Time.” The conference sounds interesting, but Agg finds ways to keep the narrative anchored to her: “The perfect name and tagline popped into my head immediately. … Over the next few days I somehow managed to plan this conference.”

I found myself wishing Agg would withhold some of what she discloses. I support talking about sex and cursing, but I gasped out loud at a scene involving spiked grape soda, oral sex and purple puke. Other readers may find such revelations disarmingly open and unedited.

The “how to open a bar or restaurant and then how to run it” book, which is hidden amid prolix self-observation, is instructive. Agg’s talent is as a restaurant proprietor and designer. I can’t argue that the passages about renovations — “We had to drill a subfloor through the grout, a bit of an easier drill than through the tile” or “We re-coat with a few layers of urethane every few years, and it still isn’t enough to keep it from wearing, but it will serve you very well for at least five years and costs almost nothing” — make for scintillating reading. But if I were an aspiring restaurateur, I would reopen my steno pad. I wished for lists, worksheets and diagrams rather than the dirty comics that are scattered throughout.

The third book inside the same two covers is a feminist diatribe. Or, that’s how Agg’s “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” is being marketed. Publicity material promises a “story of how she fought her way through the patriarchal service industry” and, for a bit more panting, “a rallying cry for a feminist revolution in the culinary world.”

As a feminist project, I’m … not sure. The issue of how women are treated in kitchens mainly comes up secondhand because Agg isn’t a chef. How traditional masculinity suffocates restaurant culture comes up firsthand, just over halfway through the book — not in those words, which are my distillation and my own firsthand observation. At that point, Agg makes good arguments. The best are not about her own fight but about what she calls “an absurd, militaristic, master-servant relationship that happens in restaurant kitchens.” This is accurate and historically correct. “Men bond with bosses who treat them like dogs and then throw them a bone with a few ‘atta boys’ and a couple of cold beers after service,” she writes, “like somehow their brutal behavior ceases to matter when the gas is turned off.” It is an exacting and pitiable characterization, which sheds some light on a tradition of abuse that damages everyone it grazes. Agg spends as much time, however, pontificating on food critics and the internet as on the patriarchy, which sometimes left me wondering if the point was that she had a bone to pick with macho restaurant culture, or if she just likes to pick bones.

“I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” is also a feminist mandate of a very specific variety — the kind that invites, or gives permission to, women to act like stereotypical men. If men can describe interactions in terms of having had sex or not, why can’t women? If a male restaurant manager can talk to a guest without smiling, why can’t a female one? I’m ambivalent. What will it accomplish if in the struggle to be treated equally, we assume the worst behaviors of the privileged group? Agg is cocky, profane, pro-conflict — as only men are “allowed” to be. Some part of me revolts: I want us to go the other way — to demand of men that they listen more and talk less, that they cooperate rather than enforce their wills. But then I second-guess myself: Am I criticizing Agg’s decorum? In this age of “she persisted”? I am, after all, a product of a culture that says I have to smile to be considered nice. Perhaps my hostility toward Agg’s healthy ego and libido and free hand with f-bombs comes from my having played with dolls.","‘I Hear She’s a Real Bitch’: A Swaggering, Feminist Restaurant Memoir",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/books/review/i-hear-shes-a-real-bitch-jen-agg-restaurant-memoir.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

(After this column went to print, The Times reported that Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page met with Russian government officials in a July 2016 trip to Moscow, something he has long denied. This further confirms another claim made in the Steele dossier.)

There’s more of this, but you get the point: The suggestion that the Steele dossier has been discredited is discreditable to the point of being dishonest.

This brings us to the second anti-Mueller contention, which is that his indictment of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for tax fraud connected to his political work in Ukraine, along with news of the guilty plea entered by Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos for lying to the F.B.I., is merely evidence of the slimness of the special counsel’s case.

The nonchalance about Manafort’s illicit ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine is almost funny, coming from the same people who went berserk over China’s alleged meddling on behalf of Democrats in the 1996 presidential campaign.

But if nothing else, the Manafort indictment underscores the Trump campaign’s astonishing vulnerability to Russian blackmail.

Did that vulnerability explain the campaign’s bizarre intervention (denied by Manafort) to soften the Republican Party platform’s language on providing help to Ukraine?

Why did the campaign pursue a course of semi-secret outreach to Russia through George Papadopoulos, giving him just enough visibility to let the Russians know he was a player but not so much visibility as to attract much media attention?

What else about Trump’s obsequious overtures to the Kremlin might similarly be explained by the contents of the Steele dossier?

These questions require answers, which is what makes calls to remove Mueller from his job or have Trump pardon Manafort, Papadopoulos and even himself both strange and repugnant. Since when did conservatives suddenly become conveniently bored with getting to the bottom of Russian conspiracies?

As it turns out, they’re not bored. They just want the conspiracies to involve liberals.

Thus the third Trumpian claim: That the real scandal is that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee paid for the Steele dossier. Somehow that’s supposed to add up to “collusion” between Clinton and the Russians, on the remarkable theory that Steele was merely retailing Kremlin-invented fables about Trump.

Yet how else was Steele supposed to investigate allegations of Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign except by talking to Russian sources with insight into the Kremlin? If Clinton was the beneficiary of the Kremlin’s designs, why did it leak her emails? And why would Putin favor the candidate most hostile to him in last year’s election but undermine the one who kept offering improved relations?

You already know the answers. The deeper mystery is why certain conservatives who were once Trump’s fiercest critics have become his most sophistical apologists.

The violence is not even over. One Rohingya advocacy group said this week that Rohingya homes were still being burned to the ground.

Each night here on the border, hundreds of Rohingya keep arriving in fleets of wooden boats that float silently across the mouth of the Naf River, the brackish waterway that separates the two countries.

A group of New York Times journalists waited in the darkness alongside worried family members as a searchlight on the Myanmar side swung back and forth, back and forth, an eerie metronome moving across the gloom.

“How can we talk about repatriation?” asked Tun Khin, one of the few Western-educated Rohingya representatives who have been able to reach out to the international news media. “People are still fleeing.”

Bangladesh now finds itself in an impossible situation. One of Asia’s poorest countries, it is home to 160 million people — half the population of the United States — squeezed into a space the size of Iowa. The Rohingya refugees have taken over hillsides, chopped down countless trees to build their shelters and put such a stress on the economy of Bangladeshi border villages that prices have shot up threefold, angering longstanding residents.

Helping the Rohingya

Facing international pressure to host the refugees and some domestic pressure to push them out, Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said that her country would continue to help the refugees on humanitarian grounds but that Myanmar must “take their nationals back.”

She has ordered the army to seal off roads around the camps to make sure Rohingya do not start migrating to towns. Her government has also decreed that Rohingya were not allowed to work or register for local cellphone service.

With no way to support themselves, the Rohingya refugees are completely dependent on aid. United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program have been feeding them, while international and Bangladeshi charities have provided medical care, plastic tarps, cooking pots and other basics.

How long the Rohingya are expected to stay will affect the next set of issues, including questions like whether Bangladesh or outside groups should begin building schools for them.

Many Bangladeshis worry that the Rohingya are perfect candidates to be radicalized — victims of anti-Muslim persecution who are now idle and dispossessed. Retaliation is a theme for the Islamic State and countless other Islamist militant groups, including the Rohingya group that attacked the security forces in Myanmar on Aug. 25, the Arakhan Rohingya Salvation Army.

“If they stay where they are living now,” said Anup Kumar Chakma, a retired Bangladeshi Army officer, “the entire area will become a fertile breeding ground.”",Fate of Stateless Rohingya Muslims Is in Antagonistic Hands,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-bangladesh-stateless.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Coghlan’s father, a British officer assigned to the United States during the Revolution, forced her at age 14 to marry the British lieutenant John Coghlan, probably to put an end to her dalliance with Aaron Burr. She detested her husband, ran away and availed herself of an English lord, whereupon her father sent her to a nunnery. After she escaped, he disowned her.

A string of lovers supported her passion for fine things, but one had gambling debts that mounted until he could not afford to pay her bills. Debtors’ prison was looming when her false death notice appeared in the newspapers. But soon she reappeared in Paris, and the pattern of lovers and debtors’ prison resumed. Then she disappeared from the historical record, leaving behind a mystery: Did she die in prison? Or did she get away with faking her own death once more?

Both Cornplanter and Margaret Coghlan met George Washington. It was otherwise for Venture Smith (whose Western African name was Broteer Furro). Brought to New England as a slave when he was a boy, he grew into a formidable man, over six feet tall, 300 pounds, and amazingly strong. He was of steady temper, though he could be pushed too far. When one master and his brother beat him, Smith stacked them on top of each other and stomped both at the same time.

Smith’s son Cuff marched with George Washington, but Smith himself was too absorbed in making a life for his wife and children to participate in the Revolution. By persuading one of his masters to hire him out, he earned the money to buy freedom for himself and his family and to invest in land, including a parcel in Connecticut where he built a three-level home, a barn and a forge. Although he never learned to write, he was adept at complex financial transactions and willingly used his skill to help other free blacks establish themselves.

In old age, stooped and blind, Smith was proud of his achievements but bitter about the obstacles he had faced because he was black. Still, he found reason for gratitude. “My freedom,” he said, “is a privilege which nothing else can equal.”

Closer to the Revolution was Abraham Yates, a shoemaker of deceptively meek appearance who educated himself in the law and, with help from the future New Jersey governor William Livingston, broke through New York’s ruling clans to become an influential politician. During the war he served in New York’s Provincial Congress, helped write New York’s Constitution and corresponded with Washington. Afterward, convinced that the United States Constitution was written for the privileged few, he threw himself into defeating its ratification. Losing the battle did little to deter him, and in the last years of his life, he was still defending the rights of the common man.

In a portrait painted by George Romney, Lord George Germain, another of Shorto’s subjects, wears a silver wig and red jacket. England’s secretary of state for the American colonies has a hint of hauteur about him, but also a sense of doubt.

He may be wondering whether England will defeat the American rebels. Should that fail to happen, Germain would never recover the reputation he’d lost some 20 years before when he had been court-martialed for purportedly refusing a direct order.

As it turned out, Germain’s anxiety was justified. In 1781, it was his duty to deliver news of the American victory at Yorktown to the prime minister, Lord North, who cried out, “Oh God, it is all over!”

George Washington is the hub of Shorto’s book, the figure with whom almost everyone else directly connects. Cornplanter sought his help for the Senecas. Coghlan attended a dinner at which he was present and got his attention when she saucily refused to toast the American cause. Yates exchanged letters with him. Germain was his opponent, and, like Washington, a tall, imposing man who hid vast ambition behind a usually unreadable visage. Shorto captures this resemblance, as well as the noble demeanor that separated Washington from nearly everyone else.

But like many who have written about Washington, Shorto has difficulty describing the president’s inner life. As his soldiers became more professional, Shorto writes, Washington “found himself overcome with emotion, thrilling in his heart at the feeling that he was becoming one with them.” Such a description deserves an example — or at least a footnote. The same is true when Shorto writes that while living in New York as the new president, Washington felt like a “bumpkin.” Perhaps, but where is the proof?

Still, Shorto’s achievement is a remarkable one. The intertwined stories of “Revolution Song” give a sense of how far-reaching a phenomenon the War of Independence was. It leaves to readers the pleasure of judging what each of the figures in the book — or perhaps the combination of them all — contributed to an event that changed the world.","The War of Independence, Seen Through Six Sets of Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/russell-shorto-revolution-song.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11 , as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Kudos to Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Wilber for debuting seven fabulous entries, the best of which, in my opinion, is COSMIC JOKE.

Tricky Clues

All of them. No, seriously. Well, except for 24D’s Jimmy CHOO, which was a gimme for me. I’ve never worn his shoes, but he was the only four letter surnamed shoe designer named Jimmy that I know.

The only thing I will say is that I really expected 55A’s “Sext symbols” to be EGGPLANT EMOJIS rather than HOT PEPPER EMOJIS, but the latter definitely makes sense.

Constructor Notes

Sam Donaldson : I’m guessing this will play a little harder than the usual Saturday. Some of the clues are pretty diabolical (I’m looking at you, 45- and 49-Down) and the vocabulary runs the gamut from conversational to erudite. (That’s code for “I had to look up a quarter of the words we used in the grid.”) I was pleased that our editorial judgment in the clue for 26-Down made the cut. Brad Wilber : The 26-Down clue is a great example of Sam’s vibe, so I’m glad everyone gets to see it. Ditto 44-Down. I liked contributing something new to MAGOO cluing besides his eyesight. The construction started out with ROGUE ONE in a central block that also contained EMOJI. Eventually we decided to cross the movie title and EMOJI in a different way. I’m really surprised, actually, that we get to debut ROGUE ONE, given the months that have gone by. Seeing it again here brings back memories of being in the cinema for it — my first time going to one of those theaters where you order a full dinner. Who had the idea that eating a meal in complete darkness would be a kick? I’M LIKE, “O.K., Bradley, the meat loaf is at twelve o’clock and the mashed potatoes are at three … ” Near the denouement I thought to myself, “We’ve made it through the movie and none of the boys (my four nephews) has dumped his soda ye — kersplash ... ” Oops. I’m revealing myself as something less than a true fan, aren’t I, if this is what sticks with me?

Thank you for that mental workout, gentlemen. I think I’m going to go lie down for a while to recover.

In Bangladesh and India, over 1,000 people died in an outsize monsoon flood. In the Caribbean and the United States, a succession of devastating hurricanes killed hundreds of people and cost thousands more their homes and businesses. In Hong Kong and southern China, over a dozen people were killed by a powerful typhoon.

Late Thursday, Twitter employees gathered in private Slack channels and used Twitter to send direct messages to one another to remark on how insecure Mr. Trump’s account had been, according to people involved in the conversations. Hundreds of employees can access the accounts of so-called Very Important Tweeters and can take actions like disabling the accounts, according to the current and former employees.

A Twitter spokeswoman referred to the company’s earlier remarks, noting it was conducting an internal investigation into the matter. On Friday, the company tweeted that it had added new safeguards to prevent a repeat of the incident, and said it would not be able to share all the details of its investigation.

Mr. Trump, for his part, remarked that the incident reflected the impact his Twitter messages have had. He tweeted with gusto on Friday, firing off more than a dozen messages over the course of the day on issues including ISIS and Hillary Clinton.

The discovery that it was a contractor who deleted Mr. Trump’s account is difficult for Twitter, as well as other technology companies. Nearly every major technology company including Google, Facebook and Apple relies on contract employees to fill positions. In general, the jobs tend to be nontechnical roles such as customer support or administrative and operational positions.

Many of these workers are brought on by staffing companies like Accenture, Adecco and Cognizant and work on renewable one-year contracts. Facebook, Twitter and other companies also outsource content review to third-party services like ProUnlimited and Cognizant, which are essentially internet call centers staffed with hundreds of workers who deal with customer service issues.

Many of these people work side by side with full-time employees, but they are often paid significantly less, are identified with different color employee badges, and are not afforded the same perks and amenities that full-time workers have.

At the congressional hearings this week, Facebook and Twitter had discussed how they planned to hire more people to help prohibit the misuse of their platforms. Facebook said it was hiring an additional 10,000 workers to review flagged content, bringing the total to 20,000 by the end of 2018.

But in a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Facebook said many of the new workers are not likely to be full-time employees; the company will largely rely on third-party contractors.

At Twitter, employees have long expressed concern about the widely available nature of internal tools for handling customer accounts. Disabling an account is typically an easy two- or three-step process, according to current and former Twitter employees. Certain teams at the company — including trust and safety, and operations — have access to all accounts including the highest levels.

Twitter customer support cannot, however, access customers’ private direct messages, nor can it tweet on behalf of other users, these people said.

In the past, Twitter has discussed adding additional layers of security that would prohibit wide internal access to V.I.T. accounts, according to these people. That included a kind of “dual layer” of security, requiring assurances from multiple employees to make significant changes to accounts.

In the end, the company did not follow through with the plans, these people said.

Much of the opposition to the Constitution turned on its lack of a guarantee of individual rights. Thomas Jefferson also lamented this absence, but Madison initially failed to see the need for such assurances, which he described as mere “parchment barriers,” easy for “overbearing majorities” to override.

But less than a year later, Madison, now a representative fulfilling a campaign promise to his constituents, introduced a series of such amendments in the House. “Without Madison, the bill of rights would not have been enacted,” Feldman writes. “The entire episode showcased Madison’s unique combination of theoretical brilliance and practical political flexibility. Although theory had told him a bill of rights was not necessary, political controversy and the need to get elected had shown that it was.”

The sharp differences between Madison’s vision of the new republic and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton’s triggered Madison’s second life as a partisan politician. He was taken aback by Hamilton’s Federalist blueprint for transforming the new United States into an economic powerhouse. The first phase was to be financial centralization through the national government’s assumption of state debts. At a dinner in June 1790, Madison and Jefferson negotiated a compromise with Hamilton, and the mostly satisfied Virginians came away with their own concession, an agreement to locate the new national capital along the Potomac. But a few months later Hamilton raised the stakes once more with a proposal to create a national bank.

Once the full scope of Hamilton’s ambitions was revealed, Madison accused him, as he wrote in a newspaper article in 1792, of trying “to pervert the limited government of the Union, into a government of unlimited discretion.” In a move to halt the Federalists and their Hamiltonian agenda, Madison and Jefferson organized the nation’s first political party, the Republicans — even though the notion of party politics ran against Madison’s constitutional design to dampen the effect of factions.

His shift away from total national sovereignty over states’ rights became complete in 1798 after Congress passed and President John Adams signed the Sedition Act, targeting Republicans and their newspapers by restricting First Amendment rights. In reaction, an incensed Jefferson wrote his Kentucky Resolutions, arguing fatefully that the states had the power to nullify federal laws and even threatening “revolution and blood.”

Troubled by Jefferson’s intemperate radicalism, Madison offered a moderate alternative in his Virginia Resolutions, contending that the states had the right “to interpose” against federal legislation they viewed as unconstitutional. Although the man who had once championed a national veto over state laws now seemed to assert the right of states to reject acts of Congress, Madison insisted that interposition meant only an appeal to public opinion. How exactly that was to happen remained conveniently obscure.

In Madison’s third life as secretary of state under President Jefferson and then as president himself, he was forced to reassess repeatedly his own foreign policy positions. As secretary of state, he had preferred to maintain neutrality with regard to the burgeoning conflict between Britain and France. Britain, however, was determined to bring its former colonies to heel by harassing American commercial shipping and impressing American seamen. Madison turned to the tactic of economic coercion with a ban on trade with Britain. “The efficacy of an embargo,” he confidently remarked to President Jefferson in 1805, “cannot be doubted.” But while it crippled the American economy, the embargo did virtually nothing to curb the British, and in June 1812, President Madison backed into war. The nation, he declared, could not remain “passive under these progressive usurpations, and these accumulating wrongs.”

After two years of fruitless conflict, both parties were ready for compromise. The signing of the Treaty of Ghent at the end of 1814 re-established the prewar status quo. By claiming that the American effort “cannot fail to command the respect” of all other nations, Madison “set an influential precedent,” Feldman astutely comments, “for subsequent American unwillingness to shine harsh light on wars that produced mixed results,” a precedent that resonates today in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Feldman does not discuss the elder statesman’s role in the fraught nullification crisis of the late 1820s and early 1830s, but it’s only a further example of Madison’s political flexibility. South Carolina, furious about federal tariffs, cited Madison’s Virginia Resolutions to argue that every state had the constitutional right to nullify federal laws and even withdraw from the union. For the rest of his life Madison rejected such an extreme interpretation of his Resolutions. The last of the founding fathers beseeched Americans to cherish and perpetuate their union, but the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions along with Madison’s unwillingness to call for the abolition of slavery would continue to imperil the republic he so treasured.

By the time of his death in 1836, the political order that Madison the dazzling political theorist had helped to design had been transformed by the partisan co-founder of the Republican Party, and had then barely survived a war under the executive leadership of the same man. Feldman’s deeply thoughtful study shows that the three identities of James Madison constituted one exceptional life, which effectively mirrored the evolving identity of the American republic in its most formative phase. In Feldman’s capable hands, Madison becomes the original embodiment of our “living Constitution.”",James Madison’s Zigzag Path,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/books/review/three-lives-of-james-madison-biography-noah-feldman.html

A prankster who liked to provoke — as the anonymous street artist Banksy has done since the 1990s — Mr. Hambleton came to public attention in the mid- to late 1970s by painting faux crime-scene outlines of bodies on pavement and adding “blood,” hoping to make people believe that a serial murderer was on the loose.

He began this “Image Mass Murder” series in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia, and then took it down the West Coast and across North America. He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.

“I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene,” Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in “Shadowman,” a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby. After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that “this may be something else, but I didn’t have any language for it.”

Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.

“I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint,” he says in the documentary, adding, “Blood has a beautiful color.”

Announcing that “Dick Trace-It,” also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the “murders” in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of “Mr. Reee” for the crimes.

In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere. He called it “I Only Have Eyes for You.” The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.

His early “Shadowman” period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases. By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades. Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a “black lung” effect.

Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952. His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.

By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings. “I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility,” he says in the documentary. “It’s about love.”

Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambleton’s paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early “Shadowman” work had not fully left him.

“There are three paintings called ‘Rainstorm,’ in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas,” Mr. Brenson wrote. “In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.”

Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his “beautiful” period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.

But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene. Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become “paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.”

His life had begun to unravel. His drug use continued. His skin cancer worsened. He lived in increasing squalor.

“His goal was to reach the sublime,” Ms. Woodward said. “He used drugs to get there. It was just who he was.”

In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani. For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.

The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible. But the moment did not last long. While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail. His cancer was eroding his face. His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions. He used his folding bicycle as a walker. At times he was homeless.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.

But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)",The Plot Against America,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/mueller-manafort-indictment.html

A coastal alliance, Mr. Inslee added, especially when cities such as Seattle and Portland, Ore., and throughout California are booming economically, would help make the case to a national audience that addressing climate change through energy policy is good for business and job creation.

“The more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,” he said.

Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area’s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.

Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party’s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.

Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the “blue wall” scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington “go the way of California” and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee’s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that “Seattle liberals” could wreak havoc on the state’s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.

“You don’t want to go the way of Oregon,” Ms. Englund said in an interview. “Washingtonians are more independent.”

Ms. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. “I think that’s wrong,” she said. “The role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what’s happening nationally.”

But the 45th District, a diverse suburban patchwork that stretches across the high-tech haven of Redmond and into more rural territory beyond — north and east of Bellevue — is emblematic of the territory that has lurched away from the Republican Party over the last year, recoiling from Mr. Trump’s brand of hard nationalism. Manka Dhingra, the Democratic candidate, has led in the polls by a comfortable but not overwhelming margin.

Ms. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies — though in a nod to the district’s moderate history, her campaign literature promises “independent leadership.” She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state’s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check “what’s coming out of Washington, D.C.”

“Frankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,” Ms. Dhingra said. “We have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women’s health care is protected.”

Republican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the “Trump factor” a drag on Ms. Englund.

Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.

“This is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,” Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: “They’ll have difficulties, because they’ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.”

Other local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.

Dow Constantine, the King County executive and a Democrat, said that the once very real political divisions of the region — Democratic-leaning Seattle on the West Side of Lake Washington, Republican-leaning enclaves to the east — have been shattered by demographic change, too, especially as the immigrants who came to work in tech jobs encouraged others in the countries they left to follow them.

“The comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,” Mr. Constantine said.

The area’s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired special education teacher, described Ms. Dhingra’s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump’s election.

With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, “I would stand up taller.”

Even some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. “She seems sensible and levelheaded,” Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.

Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is “not so sure” about the president.

Still, amid their exuberance, Democrats concede it could take time to assemble substantial policy achievements. Should they win, Democrats would be governing with the slimmest possible majority and with just one short legislative session before the next election in 2018. And like Democrats in other parts of the nation, they are divided. In 2013, two Democratic state senators crossed the aisle to caucus with the Republicans, creating a coalition majority, and wounds still linger from the 2016 presidential election, when Senator Bernie Sanders won in the Democratic caucuses but then lost to Hillary Clinton in the primary election.

Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: “You have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.”

Mr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.

“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said. “But what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.”","Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/washington-state-west-politics-democrats.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

And after really big floods, the program must rely on armies of subcontractors to determine payments, baffling and infuriating policyholders, like Mr. Clutter, who cannot figure out who is opposing their claims, or why.

Roy E. Wright, who has directed the flood insurance program for FEMA since June 2015, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that major changes were called for and said some were already in the works. The program’s rate-setting methods, for example, are 30 years old, he said, and new ones will be phased in over the next two years. But other changes — like cutting off coverage to homes that are repeatedly flooded — would require an act of Congress.

“The administration feels very strongly that there needs to be reform this year,” he said. “I believe strongly that we need to expand flood coverage in the United States, and the private insurers are part of that.”

The federal program was created to fill a void left after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when multiple levees failed, swamping an area bigger than West Virginia and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Insurers, terrified of the never-ending claims they might have to pay, started to exclude flooding from homeowners’ insurance policies. For decades, your only hope if your home was damaged in a flood was disaster relief from the government.

Policymakers thought an insurance program would be better than ad hoc bailouts. If crafted properly, it would make developers and homeowners pay for the risks they took.

When Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968, it hoped to revive the private flood-insurance market. Initially about 130 insurers gave it a shot, pooling their capital with the government. But there were clashes, and eventually the government drove out the insurers and took over most operations.

Since 1983, Washington has set the insurance rates, mapped the floodplains, written the rules and borne all of the risk. The role of private insurers has been confined to marketing policies and processing claims, as government contractors.

That worked for a few decades. But now, relentless coastal development and the increasing frequency of megastorms and billion-dollar floods have changed the calculus.

Unable to Keep Up With the Floods The National Flood Insurance Program has been in the red since 2005, when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and it suddenly had to pay out $16.3 billion in claims. $16 billion Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria National Flood Insurance Program: 14 12 Total premiums collected 10 Flood loss claims paid 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 Hurricane Katrina 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17 billion $16 National Flood Insurance Program: 14 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Total premiums collected 12 Hurricane Katrina Flood loss claims paid 10 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17

“Put plainly, the N.F.I.P. is not designed to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to members of Congress after the three huge hurricanes barreled into the United States this season.

Mr. Mulvaney called on Congress to forgive $16 billion of the program’s debt, which both houses agreed to do.

The program, however, needs more than a financial lifeline: Without major, long-term changes, it will just burn through the $16 billion in savings and be back for more.

The White House is hoping to lure companies back into the market, letting them try to turn a profit on underwriting flood policies instead of simply processing claims for the government.

One measure proposed by the Trump administration is for the government to stop writing coverage on newly built houses on floodplains, starting in 2021. New construction there is supposed to be flood-resistant, and if the government retreats, private insurers may step in. Or so the theory goes.

“The private market is anxious, willing and completely able to take everything except the severe repetitive-loss properties,” said Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which underwrites American risks for Lloyd’s of London, the big international insurance marketplace.

“Severe repetitive-loss properties” is FEMA’s term for houses that are flooded again and again. There are tens of thousands of them. While they account for fewer than 1 percent of the government’s policies, they make up more than 10 percent of the insurance claims, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued FEMA to get the data.

The Trump administration has also proposed creating a new category of properties that are at extreme risk of repeat flooding and that could have their insurance cut off the next time they flooded.

That might sound harsh. Environmental groups, though, argue it’s worse to repeatedly repair doomed houses on flood-prone sites as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the flood-insurance program should buy such properties so the owners can move somewhere safer.

The program, however, has only limited authority to make such purchases; homeowners need to line up funding through other government agencies. As a result, such buyouts are rare.

“I have mounds and mounds of paper, and I’m still waiting,” said Olga McKissic of Louisville, Ky., who applied for a buyout in 2015 after her house flooded for the fifth time. “I want them to tear it down.”

Ms. McKissic even had her house classified as a severe repetitive-loss property, thinking FEMA would give it higher priority. But FEMA has not responded to her application. Instead, it doubled her premiums.","A Broke, and Broken, Flood Insurance Program",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/a-broke-and-broken-flood-insurance-program.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Erica Wyatt struggled to pay down her debts and then searched for two years before she managed to get a mortgage from Fifth Third Bank to buy a four-bedroom home for $92,000.

Ms. Wyatt, who grew up in Detroit, said she was determined to move back into the city after renting a home in a suburb. “I wanted to make sure my children saw that not all of Detroit is bad and there are some beautiful neighborhoods,” said Ms. Wyatt, 39, who works for an insurance company.

Some of the ideas seem like stopgap measures. A social services group’s community of “tiny homes” — 400-square-foot structures with nothing more than a bedroom, a bathroom and small kitchen — is being erected to provide housing to homeless and handicapped people. The project, led by Reverend Faith Fowler, executive director of Cass Community Social Services, is taking place on a plot of vacant land the charitable organization bought from the city.

The dollhouse-like structures — seven so far — are near the organization’s main social services facility, in a rather desolate area of Detroit off Rosa Parks Boulevard. In all, Ms. Fowler hopes to build two dozen small homes, which will be rented for as little as $250 a month and eventually deeded over after seven years to a select group of homeless or poor individuals.

Tiny-house living can take adjustment, even for people with no roof over their heads at all. Ms. Fowler said that one homeless veteran told her the homes were too small to compete with a traditional homeless shelter.

Still, for some, the homes are perfect. One of the first tenants to move in this past summer is a former Methodist minister, David Leenhouts, who was forced to give up his ministry near Cleveland because of health issues that make it difficult for him to walk and talk.

Mr. Leenhouts, who grew up in the Detroit area, said his college-age son told him the small home, with a steepled ceiling, was all he needed because everything is within just a few steps. Mr. Leenhouts, 59, said, “I have no idea where I would be living if I was not chosen for a tiny house.”

That said, a cluster of tiny homes hardly seems scalable in a city as big as Detroit. And almost by definition, a tiny home isn’t a viable option for a family with children.

It’s also an example of why the long-term prognosis for Detroit’s housing market remains uncertain at best. Much of the work underway is taking place block-by-block — much like the tiny-home homeless experiment — and there are a lot of blocks in this 139-square-mile city.

“The pilot programs help some people, but they are on the margin,” said Gregory Markus, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan and executive director of Detroit Action Commonwealth, an advocacy group for low-income residents. “‘The root problem is that Detroit is the poorest big city in America.”’

The national poverty rate is 14 percent, and Detroit’s is 36 percent. Mr. Markus said that, without more jobs, home buying will remain a largely unattainable goal.

Detroit’s population peaked in the 1950s at nearly 2 million and has been falling ever since.

The Lost Children of Tuam

I was unable to continue the relationship because she was not able to acknowledge me to her family. She died in 1996, the year the information about the baby and mother’s homes were being more widely reported as was the existence of the Magdalen Laundries.

I felt the collective trauma again reading about Tuam and felt a cosmic wave realizing how deeply entrenched the stigma really was toward unwed mothers and their children.

The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.

Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz’s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan’s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry’s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you’ll get free contacts.

They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too — some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. “It went mini-viral,” Cogan says.

He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators — organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes — using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.

Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors’ offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.

Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble’s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.

When Hubble’s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.

In 2017, everyone seems to be wondering: Is Facebook taking over the world? Most of us now realize that the social network has become far more than a repository for selfies and political rants of its more than two billion users. To ad sellers, Facebook is now a gluttonous monster, which, along with Google, is gobbling up the digital advertising business in the United States; according to Pivotal Research Group, the two companies controlled 70 percent of the market and most of the growth in 2016. From the perspective of American intelligence agencies, Facebook is practically a weapon, used by a company linked to the Kremlin to foment extremism and influence the 2016 presidential election with at least $100,000 worth of targeted ads. For those with privacy concerns, Facebook plays the role of Big Brother, compiling ever more data on what we like, what we post and what we buy and even tracking where we are both online and in the physical world by tapping into the GPS locator on our phones.

In considering Facebook’s far-reaching influence, it’s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network’s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy — grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users’ news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?

“Facebook created the world’s greatest infomercial,” says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company’s influence. “It’s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you’re looking for.” As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.

“In the start-up-industrial complex, it’s like a systematic transfer of money” from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a “Beergorithm” to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days — or at any business school across the country. “There is a formula for this stuff,” Mulligan says. “And the reason why there is a formula is because it works.”

The process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning’s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook’s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don’t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It’s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.

The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network’s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on “influencer” marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product — a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company’s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.

“Sometimes we’ll look at each other and say, ‘God, there are just so many of them,’ ” says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.

While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States — some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.

And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don’t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.

One afternoon in March, I watched as Rosen selected three new ads from an extensive photo shoot the week before, his third in four months. Rosen resembled a sleep-deprived new parent — mussed hair, dull gaze. He spoke in a monotone. He attributed his fatigue, I would learn later, to Facebook’s artificial-intelligence software that placed Hubble’s ads. Rosen and his colleagues simply referred to it as “the algorithm.”

The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was “conversions,” or persuading users who had seen the company’s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.

What happened at 8 a.m. the next morning, when the ad set became active, was complex — and far removed from human sight. Just before Facebook places an advertisement in a user’s feed, it holds a sort of instantaneous auction to determine which advertiser gets the space. The amount of each advertiser’s bid is influenced by its budget size, of course, but the algorithm also weighs what it knows about the company, the ad and the individual Facebook user. Seeking to act like an intuitive matchmaker, the algorithm draws inferences from personal interests, current online behavior, the user’s potential value to each advertiser and the ad’s general appeal. Sometimes the winner is the advertiser that offered Facebook the most money. Sometimes the algorithm decides you are more likely to click a different ad and awards the space to that advertiser for less money.

This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.

But from Rosen’s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. “In an hour, it’ll get exciting.”

Photo

Twenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people — that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test’s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.

The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook’s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram — and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.

In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble’s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble’s money on it — first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook’s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.

“No idea why,” Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook’s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen’s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.

The morning’s ads were incredibly similar: “hubblecontacts,” the company’s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day’s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.

Advertising has always been an uncertain business. No one has ever known why, exactly, some people respond to an ad in a newspaper or a spot on TV, much less why specific individuals decide to buy products when they do. (The oldest cliché in the ad world, usually attributed to the department-store magnate John Wanamaker: “Half my advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don’t know which half.”) But to make money in advertising, you don’t have to be all-knowing; your ads simply need to work better than those of a competitor. To this end, advertisers inevitably pursue some combination of two major approaches. They test and refine their messages, trying to craft one as efficient and targeted as possible (junk-mailers of preapproved credit-card offers, for example). Or they showboat, putting on a huge spectacle that’s sure to attract someone (Super Bowl advertisers).

In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club’s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.

Facebook’s sales pitch — putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology — isn’t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, “computers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.” Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express’s transactional records: “Powerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.” Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.

A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.

What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook’s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there’s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm — why it ends up pushing some ads and not others — are all hidden.

Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm’s secrets — to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn’t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies’ ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements — from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed — beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said “Shop Now” or “Learn More” fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.

But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called “putting the algorithm to bed.” The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky — some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) “It occupies my brain constantly,” he says. “It’s that feeling of ‘Did you leave the oven on?’ ”

One night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore’s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. “Who cares about jokes?” he quipped afterward.

Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble’s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen — every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, “Step 1 is meditation.”

“It’s like a baby,” Jesse Horwitz told me. “If you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it’s probably dead.” (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)

Middlemen — creative agencies, media planners, publishers — have long ruled the advertising business. Yet until recently they have not been as omnipresent, opaque and inhuman as Facebook. The social giant now dictates, more fully and precisely than ever before, which ads we see and who sees which ads. Some of the implications of this are amusing, others troubling.

In my house, the strange new world of advertising announced itself in the form of a water pitcher. The Soma 6-Cup Pitcher is a paragon of Brooklynite beauty: folksy oak handle, sleek minimalist reservoir, filter cones made out of coconut shells (or something). I had never heard of it before my wife ordered one online. Plenty of my friends hadn’t, either. When our visitors opened the fridge, half of them were like me: Soma ignorant. The other half knew the brand immediately: Hey! You got a Soma? They had seen the pitcher on Facebook, on Instagram, all over the place. What was a familiar brand to some was totally unknown to me and others. We had been divvied up. It’s something I’ve noticed again and again: I see an ad for Aaptiv, a running app; my wife sees ads for a furniture website called Article that I’ve still never visited. Just as Facebook steers conservative and liberal talking points to users who already share those perspectives, we’re being sorted into commercial bubbles as well.

Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook’s software gave advertisers the option to target “Jew Haters,” for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific “ethnic affinities” from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.

This stereotyping isn’t a glitch of Facebook’s machine-learning process — it’s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It’s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments — when Facebook users feel “stressed,” “insecure,” “defeated” or “worthless.” Is that immoral, or simply crass?

Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don’t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights — and shows them ads for more yoga wear — would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.

“Sometimes data behaves unethically,” Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: “Someone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.”

As algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways — already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension — regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that’s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can’t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.

Facebook’s A.I. isn’t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers’ ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed “Jew Haters” and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis “was intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.”

Yet managing a platform this way — seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures — can be difficult to sustain. “This is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,” Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.

This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook — a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like “9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,” had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)

“We always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,” says Eli Pariser, Upworthy’s co-founder and president. “There’s going to be sunny days and stormy days.” In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.

“That certainly served Facebook well,” Pariser admits. “But you know, I also wouldn’t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,” he says, citing the reach of Upworthy’s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.

Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that — rather than cause wild swings in web traffic​ ​to a purveyor of viral videos — leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine​ ​multiple​ ​companies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices​ ​to suit Facebook.​ ​Even the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could​ ​hurt​ ​businesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.

As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies — start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations — are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook’s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don’t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?

By mid-March, a few weeks after I first followed Rosen, the Hubble team no longer had 15 Facebook and Instagram ad sets. It had 40 — all pointed at discrete audiences, each with its own handful of ads. But Rosen looked more rested, less frazzled. He explained that he and Paul Rodgers had developed something they called “Robo-Dan,” a few lines of code that checked the Ads Manager every hour, then adjusted the budget as Rosen would. He could wake up and let the ads run (although he had to fight the compulsion to check on Robo-Dan). Soon, he told me, they would upgrade to Robo-Dan 2, which would switch in new ads, taking over the nightly bedtime routine. (With 40 audiences, he told me, going through the process lasted almost as long as an entire episode of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”) Finally, he said, he was getting some distance from Facebook’s everyday machinations. Someday soon, he would be able to go to bed early, he told me. Or have an evening to himself.

But by the end of June, Rosen’s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days — the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.

Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. “There’s fewer levers; there’s less to stress out about.” Rodgers says. “You can push the button and get on with your life.”

In August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. “We ran their numbers — it’s something we could beat,” Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. “But it would destroy our lives.”

Thanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen. As Hubble advances into new territories, Facebook and the algorithm will be tagging along with them.",How Facebook’s Oracular Algorithm Determines the Fates of Start-Ups,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/how-facebooks-oracular-algorithm-determines-the-fates-of-start-ups.html

“The climate has changed and is always changing,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in the statement. “As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on ‘remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth’s climate’” to greenhouse gas emissions, he added.

Despite the scientific consensus presented in the report, the Environmental Protection Agency has scrubbed references to climate change from its website and barred its scientists from presenting scientific reports on the subject.

The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to warming. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, asserted Wednesday that “the science is out” on whether humans cause climate change.

Their agencies referred questions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversaw the research.

The report has provoked consternation in scientific circles for months. Though the study has been in the works since 2015, several scientists said the election of Mr. Trump, who has labeled climate change a “canard” and appointed cabinet members who disputed the scientific consensus, caused them to worry the report would be blocked or buried.

That did not happen. Scientists who worked on the report said none of the 13 agencies that reviewed it tried to undermine its findings or change its wording.

“I’m quite confident to say there has been no political interference on the message,” said David Fahey, a NOAA scientist and a lead author of the report. “Whatever fears we had weren’t realized.”

Responsibility for approving the report fell to Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, who generally believes in the validity of climate science and thought the issue would have been a distraction from the tax push, according to an administration official with knowledge of the situation.

One of Mr. Cohn’s top policy deputies, Michael Catanzaro, had the authority to block, delay or change the report. But Mr. Catanzaro, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush and former Speaker John A. Boehner, chose instead to follow the lead of the Obama administration by referring the report back to more than a dozen federal agencies for feedback.

That review, according to two people familiar with the process, went relatively smoothly, surprising some scientists who worked on the report who had expected more resistance.

The only significant turbulence, according to one person familiar with the process, came from a midlevel political appointee at the Department of Energy who grilled the report’s authors on changes that had been made to temperature and other climate data over the years. The authors responded by adding a more detailed explanation of their methodology and all of the agencies then gave their approval, the person said.

Mr. Trump was barely aware of the report’s existence, several White House officials said.

Some critics of climate change science attacked the report as the product of holdovers from the Obama administration and chastised the Trump administration for allowing it to be published.

“I’m saddened that they have decided they will let the permanent government, the civil servants, continue down this road without supervision,” said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group.

Scientists said the report’s findings were clear.

“This new report simply confirms what we already knew. Human-caused climate change isn’t just a theory, it’s reality,” said Michael E. Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. “Whether we’re talking about unprecedented heat waves, increasingly destructive hurricanes, epic drought and inundation of our coastal cities, the impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. They are upon us. That’s the consensus of our best scientists, as laid bare by this latest report.”

The report says the Earth has set temperature highs for three years running, and six of the last 17 years are the warmest years on record for the globe. Weather catastrophes from floods to hurricanes to heat waves have cost the United States $1.1 trillion since 1980, and the report warns that such phenomena may become common.

“The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases,” the report notes. “Extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world.”

In the United States, the report finds that every part of the country has been touched by warming, from droughts in the Southeast to flooding in the Midwest to a worrying rise in air and ground temperatures in Alaska, and conditions will continue to worsen.

“This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” the report states. “For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.”

The findings, other researchers said, create an unusual situation in which the government’s policies are in direct opposition to the science it is producing.

“This profoundly affects our ability to be leaders in developing new technologies and understanding how to build successful communities and businesses in the 21st century,” said Christopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “Choosing to be dumb about our relationship with the natural world is choosing to be behind the eight ball.”","U.S. Report Says Humans Cause Climate Change, Contradicting Top Trump Officials",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/climate/us-climate-report.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The results included the weather-beaten martial arts outfit of Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill; the monkish robes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guinness; the dusty cowboy look of Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford; and the pure white dress draped over Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher.

For the dark side, Mr. Mollo encased the imperial storm troopers in hard white carapaces and masks and hid Darth Vader, played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones, in a swooping black cloak and a helmet that brought to mind that of a samurai. The imperial outfits were designed to embody a fascist, dehumanizing order.

Mr. Mollo said he had never expected the film to be the blockbuster it became on its release in 1977.

“Most of the crew thought that the film was a bit odd while we were making it,” he told The Times of London in 2012. “We doubted that it would ever be shown. And I remember someone asking me what I was doing and I said, ‘It’s sort of a space western and one of the heroes is a dustbin.’ ”

“Star Wars,” the surprise hit of the year, won six Oscars, including the one for Mr. Mollo’s costumes. He accepted it at the award ceremonies flanked by actors dressed as Darth Vader and storm troopers.

“As you’ve seen, the costumes in ‘Star Wars’ are really not so much costumes as a bit of plumbing and general automobile engineering,” he said in his acceptance speech.

His second Academy Award, for “Gandhi,” was shared with Bhanu Athaiya. It was one of eight won by the film, including best picture.

John Mollo was born in London on March 18, 1931. His mother, the former Ella Cockell, was an artist. His father, Eugene Mollo, escaped Russia in the 1920s and started a company built around a process for spraying cement.

Mr. Mollo traced his love of military uniforms to his watching the film “Clive of India” (1935) when he was a child and returning home from the movie theater to sketch the costume of King George II of Britain. He grew up in London and near the town of Farnham, in Surrey, and studied in a local school in Godalming before attending an art school in Farnham.

Mr. Mollo served in the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry in Hong Kong, ending his service shortly before the Korean War began.

After returning home, he helped run his father’s cement company and studied military history on the side, conferring with historians and conducting his own research. His other books include “Military Fashion” (1972) and “Uniforms of the Seven Years War” (1977, also with illustrations by Malcolm McGregor).

His first film work came by way of his brother, Andrew, who was also a military historian and film consultant. Andrew recommended him for Tony Richardson’s remake of “The Charge of the Light Brigade” (1968), set in the Crimean War. Mr. Mollo supervised the creation of about 3,000 military uniforms.

Mr. Mollo also designed costumes for science fiction films like Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) and Paul W. S. Anderson’s “Event Horizon” (1997).

His first marriage, to Ann Farquharson, ended in divorce. He married Louise Pongracz in 1968. Besides her, he is survived by a son, Thomas; his brother, Andrew; and three grandchildren.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.
But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect.
Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive.
“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Courting the Superintendents

In Baltimore County and beyond, the digital makeover of America’s schools has spawned a circuit of conferences, funded by Microsoft, Google, Dell and other tech vendors, that lavish attention on tech-friendly educators.

Mr. Dance’s travel schedule sheds light on that world.

Between March 2014, when the laptop contract was announced, and April 2017, when he announced his resignation, Mr. Dance took at least 65 out-of-state trips related to the district’s tech initiatives or involving industry-funded groups, according to a Times analysis of travel documents obtained under public records laws — nearly two trips per month on average. Those trips cost more than $33,000. The Times counted only trips with local receipts, indicating Mr. Dance set foot in the cities.

At least $13,000 of Mr. Dance’s airline tickets, hotel bills, meals and other fees were paid for by organizations sponsored by tech companies, some of which were school vendors, The Times found. The $13,000 is an incomplete number, because some groups cover superintendents’ costs directly, which means school records may not include them.

Another way tech companies reach superintendents is to pay private businesses that set up conferences or small-group meetings with them. Superintendents nationwide have attended these events.

One prominent provider is the Education Research and Development Institute, or ERDI, which regularly gathers superintendents and other school leaders for conferences where they can network with companies that sell to schools.

ERDI offered several service levels this year, according to a membership rate card obtained by The Times. A $13,000 fee for Bronze membership entitles a company to one confidential meeting, where executives can meet with five school leaders to discuss products and school needs. Diamond members could pay $66,000 for six such meetings.

ERDI has offered superintendents $2,000 per conference as participating consultants, according to a Louisiana Board of Ethics filing. And there are other perks.

“Because we are asking for their time and expertise, we commonly offer to pay the cost of their food, transportation and lodging during their participation,” ERDI’s president, David M. Sundstrom, said in an email.

Mr. Dance’s calendar indicated that he had attended at least five ERDI events.

Mr. Dance received payment last year as an adviser for ERDI, according to his most recent district financial disclosure. It lists Dulle Enterprises, a company that owned ERDI in the past, as an employer from which he earned income.

Last February, at an ERDI conference in New Orleans, Mr. Dance met with Curriculum Associates, which makes reading software, as well as DreamBox Learning, a math platform.

At the time, both companies had contracts with the district. A few months after the event, the school board approved additional money for both companies. Each contract is now worth about $3.2 million.

A DreamBox spokeswoman said there was no connection between the meeting and its contract. “Even the appearance of impropriety is something we take very seriously and take steps to avoid,” she said.

A Curriculum Associates spokeswoman said: “These panels are not sales presentations, but rather focus-group opportunities to solicit feedback on products under development.”

Ms. White, the interim superintendent, has been involved with ERDI since 2013, according to Mr. Dickerson. He said Ms. White used vacation time to attend events, where she “provided guidance to education-related companies on goods, services and products that are in development to benefit student performance.”

Asked whether Ms. White had received ERDI payments, Mr. Dickerson said, “Participation in ERDI is done independently of the school system.” In an email, Ms. White said she found ERDI to be a “beneficial professional learning experience.” She didn’t respond to a question about ERDI compensation.

She added, “I do not believe there are any conflicts of interests” related to the district’s tech initiative.

Mr. Sundstrom, ERDI’s president, said education companies pay a fee to attend events “not to meet school leaders or make a sale,” but to get meaningful feedback on their education products from knowledgeable school leaders. He added that school officials do not make purchases at ERDI sessions and that it is their school boards that approve district purchases.

Baltimore County’s travel rules say, “No travel expenses will be paid by those seeking to do business with the Baltimore County Public Schools prior to obtaining a contract.” Mr. Dickerson explained that applied to companies currently bidding for contracts.",How Silicon Valley Plans to Conquer the Classroom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/silicon-valley-baltimore-schools.html

Much of the opposition to the Constitution turned on its lack of a guarantee of individual rights. Thomas Jefferson also lamented this absence, but Madison initially failed to see the need for such assurances, which he described as mere “parchment barriers,” easy for “overbearing majorities” to override.

But less than a year later, Madison, now a representative fulfilling a campaign promise to his constituents, introduced a series of such amendments in the House. “Without Madison, the bill of rights would not have been enacted,” Feldman writes. “The entire episode showcased Madison’s unique combination of theoretical brilliance and practical political flexibility. Although theory had told him a bill of rights was not necessary, political controversy and the need to get elected had shown that it was.”

The sharp differences between Madison’s vision of the new republic and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton’s triggered Madison’s second life as a partisan politician. He was taken aback by Hamilton’s Federalist blueprint for transforming the new United States into an economic powerhouse. The first phase was to be financial centralization through the national government’s assumption of state debts. At a dinner in June 1790, Madison and Jefferson negotiated a compromise with Hamilton, and the mostly satisfied Virginians came away with their own concession, an agreement to locate the new national capital along the Potomac. But a few months later Hamilton raised the stakes once more with a proposal to create a national bank.

Once the full scope of Hamilton’s ambitions was revealed, Madison accused him, as he wrote in a newspaper article in 1792, of trying “to pervert the limited government of the Union, into a government of unlimited discretion.” In a move to halt the Federalists and their Hamiltonian agenda, Madison and Jefferson organized the nation’s first political party, the Republicans — even though the notion of party politics ran against Madison’s constitutional design to dampen the effect of factions.

His shift away from total national sovereignty over states’ rights became complete in 1798 after Congress passed and President John Adams signed the Sedition Act, targeting Republicans and their newspapers by restricting First Amendment rights. In reaction, an incensed Jefferson wrote his Kentucky Resolutions, arguing fatefully that the states had the power to nullify federal laws and even threatening “revolution and blood.”

Troubled by Jefferson’s intemperate radicalism, Madison offered a moderate alternative in his Virginia Resolutions, contending that the states had the right “to interpose” against federal legislation they viewed as unconstitutional. Although the man who had once championed a national veto over state laws now seemed to assert the right of states to reject acts of Congress, Madison insisted that interposition meant only an appeal to public opinion. How exactly that was to happen remained conveniently obscure.

In Madison’s third life as secretary of state under President Jefferson and then as president himself, he was forced to reassess repeatedly his own foreign policy positions. As secretary of state, he had preferred to maintain neutrality with regard to the burgeoning conflict between Britain and France. Britain, however, was determined to bring its former colonies to heel by harassing American commercial shipping and impressing American seamen. Madison turned to the tactic of economic coercion with a ban on trade with Britain. “The efficacy of an embargo,” he confidently remarked to President Jefferson in 1805, “cannot be doubted.” But while it crippled the American economy, the embargo did virtually nothing to curb the British, and in June 1812, President Madison backed into war. The nation, he declared, could not remain “passive under these progressive usurpations, and these accumulating wrongs.”

After two years of fruitless conflict, both parties were ready for compromise. The signing of the Treaty of Ghent at the end of 1814 re-established the prewar status quo. By claiming that the American effort “cannot fail to command the respect” of all other nations, Madison “set an influential precedent,” Feldman astutely comments, “for subsequent American unwillingness to shine harsh light on wars that produced mixed results,” a precedent that resonates today in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Feldman does not discuss the elder statesman’s role in the fraught nullification crisis of the late 1820s and early 1830s, but it’s only a further example of Madison’s political flexibility. South Carolina, furious about federal tariffs, cited Madison’s Virginia Resolutions to argue that every state had the constitutional right to nullify federal laws and even withdraw from the union. For the rest of his life Madison rejected such an extreme interpretation of his Resolutions. The last of the founding fathers beseeched Americans to cherish and perpetuate their union, but the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions along with Madison’s unwillingness to call for the abolition of slavery would continue to imperil the republic he so treasured.

By the time of his death in 1836, the political order that Madison the dazzling political theorist had helped to design had been transformed by the partisan co-founder of the Republican Party, and had then barely survived a war under the executive leadership of the same man. Feldman’s deeply thoughtful study shows that the three identities of James Madison constituted one exceptional life, which effectively mirrored the evolving identity of the American republic in its most formative phase. In Feldman’s capable hands, Madison becomes the original embodiment of our “living Constitution.”",James Madison’s Zigzag Path,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/books/review/three-lives-of-james-madison-biography-noah-feldman.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

More than 16 million millennial women are now mothers, according to Pew, a number that grows by more than a million every year.

Eighty-two percent of children born each year are born to millennial mothers. That’s five out of every six babies. And their parents — let’s call them “parennials” — are challenging all sorts of commonly held beliefs about the American family.

Let’s examine their innovations one at a time.

#HASHTAGBABY

Parennials spent their formative years steeped in personal technology. As a result they’re “high-information parents,” said Rebecca Parlakian, the program director for Zero to Three, an organization that has been studying new parents since 1977.

“The good news is that parents know more about child development than ever before,” she said. “Google is the new grandparent, the new neighbor, the new nanny.”

The bad news is that parents feel overwhelmed by the volume of information, confused about the “right way” to do things and harshly judged by friends and relatives.

Kate Flynn, 32, lives in Brooklyn with her 11-month-old daughter, Isla, and her college sweetheart, Michael. Like many new parents, she felt unprepared for the responsibility. “We feel like kids who aren’t old enough to have kids,” she said.

To compensate, she relies on technology, from chat rooms to child development apps like Wonder Weeks and WebMDBaby.

“I’ll be on the phone with my mom and say, ‘The app is telling me that she is starting her 9-month sleep progression,’” Ms. Flynn said. “I just found out that Wonder Weeks only goes to when the child is one. I don’t know if that’s liberating or scary.”

Many parennials, accustomed to chronicling every fab appetizer and every failed job interview, give their children YouTube channels from the first sonogram and hashtags when they’re born.

Sara Mauskopf, 32, a onetime employee of Google from Philadelphia who is now a partner with Ms. Halsall in Winnie, a parenting start-up, even named her daughter with her social media profile in mind.

“I knew I wanted to name her Brynn, but when considering middle names, there were a couple of ‘A’ names we were thinking about. We chose Brynn Avery because I could get the Twitter handle @BrynnAvery,” Ms. Mauskopf said.

Others, like Kassandra Ortiz, 26, a stay-at-home mother of two in Brooklyn, are warier. After being stalked online by a classmate who posted her photo along with comments about what he wanted to do to her, Ms. Ortiz considers herself “overly protective” of her children.

“I like taking pictures of my kids walking away, so I avoid showing their faces,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I have this fear that if I post a picture on Instagram, then my child will become a meme.”

Goodbye, ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad.’ Hello, ‘Co-Parents.’

Brad Harrington, the executive director of the Boston College Center for Work & Family, has found that a third of millennial families follow traditional gender roles and are comfortable with their decision. Another third of them say spouses should share chores equally and feel they achieve this goal, while the final third strive for this equality but the female partner, in reality, does more.

“For 30 years we’ve been asking, ‘Can women have it all?’” Mr. Harrington said. “Now we’re asking if men can have it all.”

Gabe Wells, 33, a loan officer, was born in Iowa and moved to Portland, Ore., with his wife, Caitlin, who was his girlfriend at the time. When she became pregnant, the two went through a “rough patch,” he said, and went into counseling.

“The No. 1 thing I learned is that my language changed,” he said. “I don’t say ‘mother’ and ‘father’ anymore. I say ‘co-parent.’ It sounds odd to people in the Midwest, but it’s more reflective of what we’re trying to do.”

They realize 50-50 is “a pipe dream,” he said. “But If we can trade off going 60-40, that’s great.”

Co-parenting does come with downsides. Ms. Parlakian of Zero to Three said she’s begun to detect a new theme in her annual surveys of parents. She calls it “gate-keeping,” when the less-involved parent tries to step up but the primary parent slaps the partner down, saying “You did it the wrong way” or “Why did you put the baby in that?”

“Given the statement ‘I would like to be more involved with raising my child but my parenting partner interferes with my involvement,’ nearly half the dads agree,” Ms. Parlakian said, “while only 16 percent of moms do.”

From her experience running Winnie, Ms. Halsall has concluded that “millennial dads are different than their elders, in that they see it as a positive masculine trait to be involved with their children,” she said.

“The idea that women are more proactively issuing feedback to their co-parents that are male to me sounds very encouraging. It’s an indication that they see each other as partners.”

Can Granny Pay the Rent?

New parents of all ages often face money woes, but with parennials these challenges can feel particularly acute because they reached childbearing age during the Great Recession, are saddled with college debt and are perhaps job-hopping or part of the gig economy.

As a result, many parennials rely on their own baby boomer parents for financial support. Ms. Ortiz has started a photography business on the side while her husband, who hopes to get into real estate, drives for Uber. To make ends meet, they get financial help with rent from her mother-in-law.

“Money has always been an issue, but we do our best and hope God will provide,” Ms. Ortiz said. “I don’t know if it’s a millennial thing, but we spend so much money eating out. We’d be better off if we didn’t.”

Jess Laird, 31, grew up in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan with parents who were “broke actors,” she said, so she’s used to money struggles. She was working full-time when she had her first child at 29, but wanted to spend more time with her daughter. Since then, she has worked at a start-up that went out of business and now freelances remotely. She is still paying off her undergraduate loans, and her husband, Morgan, is doing the same with his law school debt.

With so much financial pressure, they rely on her mother for child care.

“Other moms I talk to who are 35 or 40 seem to be more settled financially,” she said. “It feels weird when I say, ‘My mom is taking care of my kid.’ I even use the word ‘mother’ because it sounds more adult.”

Losing Their Religion

Gender roles are not the only thing being challenged by parennials; other social norms are experiencing upheaval as well. Pew has found that almost four in 10 Americans married since 2010 have a spouse who is a different religious group, double the number from 1960. Nine in 10 millennials approve of interracial marriage or cross-cultural marriage.

The disdain of Andrew Moore, 33, and his wife, Rachel, 31, for religion has caused friction with his family, who were missionaries. “My mom just doesn’t talk about it,” said Mr. Moore, a physical scientist who is the father of Harrison, 2. “My father asked me, not long after I told him I was nonreligious, whether I would raise my children Christian. I was, like, ‘No, man, I don’t believe it.’”

The one thing they’re teaching him, he said, is “Some people get value from religion, and he might, too, as long as he realizes that what’s good for him might not be great for another.”

This sense of fluidity, of improvisation, of “making it work” in the words of one couple, or “getting by” in the words of another, appears to be an early, unifying theme of millennial parents. Maybe it’s their uncertain economic status, their sense of experimentation, or simply the times they grew up in, but many parennials seem less rigid than their elders.

“I thought we were supposed to do things a certain way,” said Ms. Flynn of Brooklyn, who had multiple jobs and multiple apartments when she was in her 20s. “Have the career, the house, the green grass, and then the kid. But that didn’t happen. My life has a different plan.

“Having a kid when things are unstable like this,” she said, “feels like a start-up. We kind of know where we are going with this, but we don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”",App Time for Nap Time: The Parennials Are Here,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/style/millennial-parents-parennials.html

For viewers craving more of the Canadian literary giant Margaret Atwood after Hulu’s Emmy-winning adaptation of her dystopian novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Netflix is offering a different side of the writer with this six-part mini-series, based on a piece of Atwood’s historical fiction. Directed by Mary Harron, written by Sarah Polley, and starring Sarah Gadon (all Canucks to the core), “Alias Grace” is about a real-life mid-19th-century Irish immigrant who was convicted of murdering her boss. Though not at as fantastical as “Handmaid,” the new show is equally concerned with how women who serve privileged masters take care each other — or fail to.

Although producer Steven Soderbergh gets a lot of credit for the TV version of “The Girlfriend Experience” (probably because he directed the movie it’s based on), the show is really the work of the writer-directors Lodge Kerrigan and Amy Seimetz, who in Season 1 collaborated to tell the story of a promising law firm intern who’s moonlighting as a call girl. The creative team returns for the 14-episode second season, handling two entirely new, separate story lines: Seimetz follows a high-end prostitute (played by Carmen Ejogo) in the witness protection program, and Kerrigan looks at an escort (Louisa Krause) who gets embroiled in a political blackmail scheme.

Mr. Steele could not have known that the Russians stole information on Hillary Clinton, or that they were considering means to weaponize them in the U.S. election, all of which turned out to be stunningly accurate.”

(After this column went to print, The Times reported that Trump foreign-policy adviser Carter Page met with Russian government officials in a July 2016 trip to Moscow, something he has long denied. This further confirms another claim made in the Steele dossier.)

There’s more of this, but you get the point: The suggestion that the Steele dossier has been discredited is discreditable to the point of being dishonest.

This brings us to the second anti-Mueller contention, which is that his indictment of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort for tax fraud connected to his political work in Ukraine, along with news of the guilty plea entered by Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos for lying to the F.B.I., is merely evidence of the slimness of the special counsel’s case.

The nonchalance about Manafort’s illicit ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine is almost funny, coming from the same people who went berserk over China’s alleged meddling on behalf of Democrats in the 1996 presidential campaign.

But if nothing else, the Manafort indictment underscores the Trump campaign’s astonishing vulnerability to Russian blackmail.

Did that vulnerability explain the campaign’s bizarre intervention (denied by Manafort) to soften the Republican Party platform’s language on providing help to Ukraine?

Why did the campaign pursue a course of semi-secret outreach to Russia through George Papadopoulos, giving him just enough visibility to let the Russians know he was a player but not so much visibility as to attract much media attention?

What else about Trump’s obsequious overtures to the Kremlin might similarly be explained by the contents of the Steele dossier?

These questions require answers, which is what makes calls to remove Mueller from his job or have Trump pardon Manafort, Papadopoulos and even himself both strange and repugnant. Since when did conservatives suddenly become conveniently bored with getting to the bottom of Russian conspiracies?

As it turns out, they’re not bored. They just want the conspiracies to involve liberals.

Thus the third Trumpian claim: That the real scandal is that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee paid for the Steele dossier. Somehow that’s supposed to add up to “collusion” between Clinton and the Russians, on the remarkable theory that Steele was merely retailing Kremlin-invented fables about Trump.

Yet how else was Steele supposed to investigate allegations of Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign except by talking to Russian sources with insight into the Kremlin? If Clinton was the beneficiary of the Kremlin’s designs, why did it leak her emails? And why would Putin favor the candidate most hostile to him in last year’s election but undermine the one who kept offering improved relations?

In “Lady Bird” the fights between mother and daughter are constant — at once background noise and main event.
At the New York Film Festival, she asked the crowd: “What is ‘Boyhood,’ but for a girl?
(We might call this good mothering, in that she is helping Lady Bird to separate from home.)
Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it.","Gerwig has acted in 25 films and co-written five, but “Lady Bird,” her first solo directorial project, is the most unadulterated distillation of her sensibility to date. The title character is a high-school senior, played with winning naturalness by Saoirse Ronan, who lives in Sacramento and attends an all-girls Catholic school. She was born Christine, but demands to be called by the name she has given herself — as if she were a pop star, or being constantly confirmed in the faith. The film’s working title was “Mothers and Daughters,” and Gerwig is especially attentive to Lady Bird’s tempestuous relationship with her mother, Marion, played with brilliant, wounded toughness by Laurie Metcalf. Their fights hit every note and tempo: nagging, bickering, quarrelsome, sniping, passive-aggression, shouting, screaming, wailing, whispered rage.

Lady Bird is a delicious and daring weirdo. She shows up to audition for the school musical with a prepared belter. She runs a long-shot campaign for class president every fall, just because she can. Her hair is stringy and dyed. She is sexy without being conventionally pretty, and when she decides she likes a boy, she writes his name in marker on her bedroom wall and pursues him boldly. Saying that she “puts herself out there” is an understatement. She throws herself over every cliff. (At one point, she throws herself out of a moving car.) She’s the girl — I’m stealing this from Ronan, who told me that she “admires” the character — whom you didn’t even know you wanted to be. That all this buoyant confidence feels so effervescently radical is a testament to the humor and intelligence of Gerwig’s script. That it is so rare is an indictment of our woman-hating culture, which makes a depiction of a smart teenage girl who likes herself and chases her desires seem like news.

Gerwig couldn’t have played Lady Bird; she’s 34. But it’s notable that she didn’t choose to write a character she could have played. Perhaps she didn’t want to confuse the issue. A female body onscreen has a way of obscuring, or distracting from, the intelligence offscreen. She is already well established as an actor — the critic Richard Brody has called her “the most important new actor” to emerge in the last 10 years of American independent film. What shines through in Gerwig’s performances is a quality of radiant openness. Jay Duplass, the filmmaker and actor who directed Gerwig in the 2008 movie “Baghead,” described her to me as a “spazzy genius” who has “the courage to let herself unfold in front of other people.” Think of her toddling down the steps behind the Times Square TKTS booth in “Mistress America,” issuing a cornball greeting to her soon-to-be-stepsister standing below: “Welcome to the Great White Way!” And the frozen smile on her face, as she continues her grand descent, trying awkwardly, antically, to hold on to the magic of making an entrance.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Her smile is of the huge, gum-baring variety. She talks with her whole body. She was a live wire in Mary Bronstein’s “Yeast” and enchanting in Whit Stillman’s “Damsels in Distress” and a little out of place in Pablo Larraín’s “Jackie,” where all she did was stand around. She needs to be moving — galloping down the street or shoving somebody through a door or doing a shuffle-ball-change. The writer, artist and filmmaker Miranda July, when I asked her about Gerwig’s physicality, told me, “She looks very strong, and she can either spin that into something that’s grounded and familiar and funny or into something that’s really quite beautiful and dancerly.” She can sing and tap too. I’ve heard her compared to Diane Keaton, which I’m sure she’d like — for a while as a teenager she tried to dress like Annie Hall — but I think of her as a taller Irene Dunne. Except that instead of being in movies about love affairs, she is in movies — and making movies — about women self-actualizing and paying their bills.

The check arrived, and I reached for my wallet. Gerwig became concerned. “You can put this on The New York Times?” she said. “I just always worry.” After breakfast, while we were power-walking through the West Village, I mentioned that I had seen that she was doing a voice part in Wes Anderson’s forthcoming animated movie, “Isle of Dogs.” She remarked that Anderson’s previous animated film, “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” isn’t “really” about animals. “It’s not?” I said, which prompted the beginnings of an earnest analysis, until I cut her off to explain that I had been kidding. “Ohhhhh,” she said. “I don’t understand sarcasm. I take it seriously!” Her T’s are shiny and bright, like the ringing of a hand bell.

When Gerwig went out to raise the money for “Lady Bird,” she noticed something interesting. Most of the potential funders she met with were men, of course — that’s not the interesting thing. It’s men, for the most part, who have the power and money to finance films. “What I typically found,” she said, “was that if they had daughters or had been raised with sisters, they understood what it was, and if they didn’t, they kind of couldn’t believe that women actually fought like that, which was an interesting window into why some stories can’t get told. People don’t understand that they’re even a story to tell.”

Gerwig has long been interested in how women fight. “Frances Ha” (2013), the film she made with her partner, Noah Baumbach, begins with two best friends sparring gleefully in Washington Square Park. Over the course of the film, they fall out in the usual way — very slowly and then all at once — but by the end are back in each other’s lives, casually, at arm’s length. In “Mistress America” (2015), which Gerwig and Baumbach also made together, a major act of betrayal leads to the severing of a bond between two women. In “Lady Bird” the fights between mother and daughter are constant — at once background noise and main event. Every situation is pretext for a confrontation: underdone eggs, a pile of rumpled clothes, a hand reaching too quickly for the radio. The question on the surface might be What did you do? but the feeling underneath is Who are you and why don’t you know how to love me?

The visual style of “Lady Bird” is intentionally unshowy — most shots are framed and still, so that attention is focused on the actors and the dialogue. Language is what matters. There was no improvisation on the set, and the movie matches the shooting script “probably 95 percent.” The writer and director Lena Dunham told me that what she often admires about Gerwig’s dialogue is the contrast between erudition and naturalism — “In one breath she’ll be referencing a superobscure book and also utilizing the awkward parlance of our times.” “Lady Bird” does that, too. Gerwig expects her audience to be well read enough to get what’s funny about a nun referencing Kierkegaard’s “love story” (Kierkegaard broke off his engagement) but also to laugh when Lady Bird tells her friend that they’re done with “the learning portion of high school.” The rhythm is very quick, and much of the humor lies in the way that characters respond to or undercut one another. My favorite joke of the movie is when Lady Bird, after passing her driver’s test, profusely thanks the guy from the D.M.V. “It’s not a thanking situation,” he says. “You either pass or you don’t.”

The plot is structured according to the “rituals” of senior year — homecoming, prom — which Gerwig has said she imagined “unfolding in a series of placed scenes like Stations of the Cross.” Emotional drama presents itself in the form of Lady Bird’s two boyfriends, Danny and Kyle, and a rough patch with her best friend, Julie, but the big narrative question is where Lady Bird will go to college. She longs to go to a private East Coast (i.e., outrageously expensive) college; her family expects her to stay in state. As it is, they’re barely keeping it together, moneywise. Marion works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse, and Lady Bird’s father, played by Tracy Letts, has lost his job. They live in a shabby, cramped house that is literally on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. (Marion and Lady Bird’s favorite Sunday-afternoon activity is dropping in at real estate open houses and admiring what they cannot have.) But “those East Coast schools” carry complex symbolic weight for Lady Bird: They mean possibility, and glamour, and leaving home, and something like self-worth. The movie doesn’t totally endorse her fantasy, but it is a little unsettling, in this moment, to witness a narrative triumph that hinges on a teenager’s assumption of a lifetime of student debt.

Gerwig wrote “Lady Bird” partly as a response to films about boys growing up. At the New York Film Festival, she asked the crowd: “What is ‘Boyhood,’ but for a girl? What is ‘The 400 Blows,’ but for a girl? What is personhood for young women?” In most films, girls exist to be looked at. Sometimes they help a male protagonist come to a realization about himself. Sometimes they die. Gerwig makes Lady Bird the one who looks: at boys but also houses, magazines, books, clothes and at the city of Sacramento. She also takes the wind out of a particular kind of male self-seriousness around cultural objects. Toward the end of the movie, a very drunk Lady Bird is in her dorm room with a boy — the kind of boy who would invite you to see “The 400 Blows” on a first date — who is flipping through her CD case. He scoffs that her taste in music sucks: All she has are greatest-hits albums. “But they’re the greatest,” she says. They immediately start making out.

As in “Boyhood,” “Lady Bird” is remarkable for what doesn’t happen. No one dies. No one overdoses. Conflicts are reconciled. The film is ostensibly about a young girl’s ambition, but the mood is one of poignant loss. “There is a certain vividness in worlds that are coming to an end,” Gerwig wrote in the production notes. “It is something beautiful that you never appreciated and ends just as you come to understand it.” Her characters are always preternaturally nostalgic, able to look back on recent hurts with the bittersweet regard that it takes more rancorous humans a lifetime to achieve. She loves Mike Leigh and Éric Rohmer, but the movie moment that will always stay with her is the end of “Annie Hall”: “When they leave each other, and he says it’s just nice knowing her, and you’re like, ugh! That’s life!”

There are no jerks or bullies in “Lady Bird,” no one who intentionally manipulates or abuses, no one who hates or is hateable, no one who holds a grudge. All the characters are doing their best — it’s just nice to know them. You can’t accuse Gerwig of a lack of seriousness; her conversation is peppered with references to George Eliot, Elena Ferrante, Maggie Nelson, Simone Weil, Milton and Kierkegaard. But the way she distributes sympathy has an undeniably magical effect. The result is delightful and a little bit romantic — delightful, perhaps, because it is romantic, showing life as it should be, or could be.

“I have a deep need to take care of my characters,” she said to me at breakfast. “It’s not that I don’t want to go down the dark avenues — I want to hold their hands down the dark avenues. I want to walk with them while they go there and give them the dignity of representing it honestly, and finding the thing that is grace-filled.”

Early reviews of “Lady Bird” have referred to the film as “autobiographical.” The word irks Gerwig. “I was doing interviews in Toronto,” she said to me, “and people would say, ‘Well, it’s autobiographical,’ and I’d think: Do you know my autobiography? How do you know that this is autobiographical? That’s a leap!”

“Autobiographical” can carry a whiff of dismissal, a suggestion that the achievement was somehow easier to pull off because it involved less creative effort. There are, to be sure, parallels to reality: Gerwig is from Sacramento and went to an all-girls Catholic school before attending a college in New York, Barnard, on scholarships and loans. But she wasn’t like Lady Bird as a high-school student. She followed the rules.

Still, only a person who liked high school could have written this movie. And Gerwig liked high school. There were the usual cliques and hierarchies, but because it was a Catholic school, the focus was on being a good citizen of the community and using your talents for a higher purpose. She refers to the nuns who taught her as “really groovy.” She admits to “some teenage anger” and says that her fights with her mother were “epic,” but “for me, epic fighting never spelled lack of love.” Her eyes widened. “Some of my friends have been, like, ‘You can really scare the [expletive] out of me,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, no, that’s just me being close!’ ”

“These are my parents,” Gerwig said, holding out her phone.

We were in a greenroom at Lincoln Center, during the New York Film Festival. Previously I had seen Gerwig dressed down in casual settings, carrying a backpack: drinking coffee on a park bench, being shushed at Film Forum for talking during a movie. Now she was in busy professional mode: Proenza Schouler dress, eyeliner, flanked by publicists. On the phone, her parents were squinting in sunshine, from what looked to be a very nice vacation in San Diego.

Gerwig is close to her parents. (They appeared as Frances’s parents in “Frances Ha.”) Her mother is a retired OB/GYN nurse and her father works in small-business loans for a credit union. “I always felt like they were both artists without being artists,” she said. At the holidays, the house overflowed with guests. Her father plays “a ton” of instruments. Her mother has a closet in the hallway where she keeps presents, wrapped, for all different ages — just in case someone comes over and it’s her birthday.

As a child, Gerwig had a tendency to become obsessive — first about ballet, which she had to quit (her hips lacked turnout, and her knees couldn’t take it), and then about fencing, which her mother urged her to put aside, lest she become “a mono-person.” In high school she got into theater, and in college she continued acting and writing plays. One play she wrote featured a seduction scene in which someone breaks a jar of mayonnaise onstage. Another one, which involved a daughter murdering her mother, was written in two weeks’ time, after a group lost the rights to perform “Misery.” She always liked movies, but it wasn’t until she started renting DVDs from the indie video store Kim’s while a student at Barnard that she thought of film as an art made by directors. “Beau Travail” was the movie that helped her truly understand cinema. She didn’t realize until she saw Claire Denis’s name in the credits that it had been directed by a woman. She remembers thinking: That’s a job you can have?

After she was rejected from M.F.A. programs in playwriting, she began acting in very-low-budget, independent “mumblecore” films, including “LOL,” “Hannah Takes the Stairs” and “Nights and Weekends,” which she directed with Joe Swanberg. In 2010 she broke through to the mainstream, when she appeared in Noah Baumbach’s “Greenberg.” After “Greenberg,” she and Baumbach, who had been married to Jennifer Jason Leigh, became a couple, and together they wrote two films that Gerwig starred in: “Frances Ha” and “Mistress America,” which feature some unmistakable Gerwigian traits. Their protagonists are semidelusional female dreamers, surrounded by rich people and anxious about money, with hearts pure enough to put them in a Dostoyevsky novel. But film is a director’s medium, and occasionally Gerwig’s work on these projects was dismissed by journalists and people in the industry. “Something that used to really hurt me is, people would say, ‘Did you help write the script?’ And I’d say: ‘I co-wrote it. I didn’t “help” to write it,’ ” she said. “It used to make my blood rise.”

Gerwig calls her last 10 years of working in film “my version of my 10,000 hours.” When she finished the writing of “Lady Bird” in 2015, she knew she had to direct it herself. “I thought, Yes, there is more to learn, but you are not going to keep learning it by not doing it. You will only now learn the next part if you go ahead and do it.”

Acting in films under two female directors, Rebecca Miller and Mia Hansen-Love, helped “shift” something in her. She recalls a conversation with Hansen-Love, who had been in two films directed by her partner, Olivier Assayas. “She had worked at Cahiers du Cinéma,” Gerwig says. “She said that the other young male writers there treated her dismissively because they thought of her as Olivier’s girlfriend, who got there because she was his girlfriend, and how they changed when she had her first movie at Cannes, when she was in her 20s. All of a sudden they looked at her like they’d never seen her before. I hung onto that story. All those little pieces I put in my pocket. I think I needed these little signs.”

Several years ago, Gerwig was at Miranda July’s house. It was early in their friendship (and before Gerwig’s turn as a punk photographer in “20th Century Women,” which was directed by Mike Mills, July’s husband). On her way out, July offered her a pair of shoes: Rachel Comey loafers that didn’t quite suit July. Not long after, Rebecca Miller, who was directing her in the romantic comedy “Maggie’s Plan,” handed over a pair of “sturdy English shoes that you can see women wearing who were on their way to work in the ’30s.” The meaning wasn’t lost on Gerwig. “I thought, If I wrote this into a movie, people would think it was too obvious of a symbol,” she says. “I was literally given shoes by two female directors. And it felt like, if you’re looking for a sign, there you go!” The shoes acquired talismanic powers. She wore them to the “Lady Bird” set whenever she needed an extra boost.

Movie sets have not historically been comfortable environments for women. Less than a month has passed since the publication of the articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker claiming sexual abuse of women by the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. That Gerwig is a confident young woman making movies about confident young women feels especially meaningful right now. It is not merely Gerwig’s being a woman that feels relevant but her directorial style. She extends the same protective impulse to her cast that she does to her characters, saying that the job of a director is to “hold the perimeter” of “a bubble of magic safety” so that actors can play. I spoke with several actors from “Lady Bird,” as well as with Sam Levy, the cinematographer, and heard again and again how cared-for, and safe, they felt on Gerwig’s set. She ran rehearsals at her apartment and conscripted the cast into awkward dance parties (a trick cribbed from Mills). She encouraged the actors to have secrets from her — things they knew about their characters that she didn’t.

“I trusted her completely,” says Metcalf, who adds that she relied on Gerwig to help her understand the character of Marion. “On the page it could just be like a nonstop aggression. But she taught me what the character was covering up.”

“I wanted Marion to secretly be the main character,” Gerwig told me. “I kind of wanted her to take over the movie.”

The history of mothers on film is one littered with angels and witches. Marion is neither. She’s tender and loving but doesn’t know how to express it; she is often impatient, can be nasty and aggressive and doesn’t support Lady Bird in the way she wants to be supported. (We might call this good mothering, in that she is helping Lady Bird to separate from home.) She doesn’t exactly take over the movie — the film ends on a shot of Lady Bird, alone, on a New York street, with Marion left behind — but she does center it. There is one scene in particular that is a kind of anchor. It shows Marion at her sewing machine, fixing a dress that Lady Bird will wear to a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at her boyfriend’s grandmother’s mansion. Marion would prefer that Lady Bird spend Thanksgiving at home, but she’s helping her anyway, first by shopping with her at the thrift store, and now by mending the dress.

The shot is framed squarely, in dim lighting, with Metcalf looking drab and dour in the center. It is very brief, a few seconds long, and silent, except for the wild thrum of the needle. It’s Gerwig’s homage to “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,” Chantal Akerman’s classic 1975 drama of a three-day unraveling, consisting mostly of shots of a woman doing repeated household chores. Gerwig told the audience at the New York Film Festival that she was moved by a remark that Akerman once made about the importance of seeing images of housework on film. “We value watching a woman get raped more than we value her making dinner,” Gerwig said, incredulity and disgust mixing in her voice. If there are Lady Birds in the world, it is only because there are Marions — mothers, and foremothers — who brought them up. Lady Bird will put on the dress and wear it out and think nothing of it. But we saw the care Marion took, late at night and all alone, to alter, ever so slightly, what was possible.",Greta Gerwig’s Radical Confidence,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/magazine/greta-gerwigs-radical-confidence.html

On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,” the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, “Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”

At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was.

In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion.

We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, “How do we use to get whole?” If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration.

But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver “very high level and sensitive information” as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. responded with delight: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”

The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.” The professor told him that Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.)",The Plot Against America,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/mueller-manafort-indictment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They found that Armillaria fungi had expanded their genomes by copying certain chunks of it, which meant additional capacity for making new rules of behavior. In a way, the fungus had more genes involved in making it really good at being bad. For example, the team found extra proteins for killing cells and gobbling up the glue that holds plant cell walls together.

They also found special tactics for hiding: Armillaria can reabsorb substances lost in the soil that alert trees of their presence and avoid the tree’s full defenses. This lets them kill trees undetected and start leeching nutrients from the dead stuff before competing bacteria and fungi arrived. And if and when competitors do show up, Armillaria can create a chemical environment intolerable for them.

However they find their hosts, pathogenic Armillaria are ancient. They arrived an estimated 21 million years ago and stuck around for a reason.

In healthy, natural, diverse forests, the fungi absorb carbon and kill only the weakest trees, like gangly, underground forest rangers. But in monocultures made up of genetically identical trees, stresses like drought can cause all the trees to fall weak simultaneously.

“This is how Armillaria can wipe out entire forests,” said György Sipos, a biologist at the University of Sopron in Hungary who led the study with László Nagy, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

The disease of extremism rampages through Albert Camus’s “State of Siege,” a deservedly minor 1948 play revived by the director Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota of Théâtre de la Ville in Paris and presented by the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The energetic staging — in French with English supertitles — is a master class in how to make a bad play better. But not even Mr. Demarcy-Mota’s stylish interventions can make “State of Siege” anything more than a hollow allegory.

On a breezy summer night in Cadiz, Spain, a ballad plays and couples sway. Then a comet flames across the sky, heralding the arrival of the Plague (Serge Maggiani) and his slinky secretary (Valérie Dashwood), a grim reaper in lingerie. The Plague seizes power in the town, bullying the populace and curbing civil liberties. Truth is a casualty, so is love. Language suffers, too. Words like freedom — liberté if you don’t like looking at the supertitles — lose all meaning.

How do we understand this Plague, a man who stomps around the stage in a black overcoat? Is he a grave illness or a fascist bureaucrat? Which is worse?

“State of Siege,” which flopped at its Paris debut, can be read as a peculiar companion piece to Camus’s 1947 novel “The Plague,” about a pandemic that overtakes an Algerian town. Here the symbolism is starker, the characters more crudely sketched.

It’s a political allegory, a form that has lately saturated New York theater. Like several other recent productions — “1984,” “Rhinoceros,” Shakespeare in the Park’s “Julius Caesar” — “State of Siege” sometimes misses the symbolic mark and sometimes hits it as squarely as a punch in the nose.

Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, N.E.R.D. snaps back to life, Bruce Springsteen contributes a song to a film about veterans coping with PTSD, and Feist honors Leonard Cohen.

Prettymuch, ‘Open Arms’

Kudos to whatever musicologist-historian is masterminding the rise of the new boy band Prettymuch. Maybe it’s Simon Cowell, who signed the group. Or maybe its ILYA, the Max Martin associate who produced (and contributed writing to) this song, the group’s third. Whoever it is, that person is savvily backdooring the sound and attitude of 1990s male R&B singing groups into modern pop. “Would You Mind,” the first Prettymuch single, contained some subtle nods to Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison” and Boyz II Men’s “Motownphilly.” And “Open Arms” has some strategic references to Shai’s “If I Ever Fall in Love.” Shuttling between pure a cappella and a spare, sharp beat, the group performs what feels like a deconstruction of that classic, emphasizing taut five-part harmonies doled out in tight bursts. The singing is mature, the attitude is poised, the eyes are on history. JON CARAMANICA

N.E.R.D and Rihanna, ‘Lemon’

Beginning in the early 2000s, N.E.R.D — Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the production duo the Neptunes) and Shae Haley — created inventive and pugnacious punk-funk born from hip-hop DNA. “Lemon” is its first single since its last album, in 2010 (not counting some songs for “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”). It features a beat that throbs and tinkles, Mr. Williams barking and jabbing as if in a boxing ring, and also Rihanna, rapping with tremendous attitude. “Lemon” also appears to mark the beginning of a full-fledged return of N.E.R.D (which stands for No One Ever Really Dies) which, in addition to releasing this song, is performing its first concert in years this weekend at ComplexCon in Long Beach, Calif. J.C.

Stella Donnelly, ‘Boys Will Be Boys’

A delicate waltz by the Australian songwriter Stella Donnelly carries a bitter reproach to blaming the victims of sexual assault. “Why was she all alone/Wearing her shirt that low?” she sings, and then her voice rises and roughens. “They said boys will be boys/Deaf to the word no.” She released the song earlier this year on an EP, “ Thrush Metal,” but the video clip appears right in time to reinforce the #MeToo movement. JON PARELES

Willow, ‘Oh No!!!!’

On her 17th birthday, Oct. 31, Willow Smith released her second album, “The 1st,” produced and written almost entirely on her own. It’s a daring, accomplished, stripped-down album a world away from any R&B expectations. The songs are far closer to the bare-bones settings and emotional volatility of early PJ Harvey, along with some of the metaphysical musings of late-1960s psych-folk. “Oh No!!!!” is one of its tormented love songs, wondering, “Why can’t I control it?” and arguing with itself over a clattering beat and dissonant guitar, an unresolved flare-up of romantic anxiety. J.P.

Bruce Springsteen, ‘Freedom Cadence’

A chant long used by marching soldiers, and updated with each new war, “Freedom Cadence,” supplied the words and melody of Bruce Springsteen’s song for the closing credits of “Thank You for Your Service,” a film about Iraq veterans coping with PTSD. “Freedom is won/through the blood of someone’s son,” he sings. It’s a lo-fi production, with piano, harmonium, banjo and a somber, simple drumbeat in the murky mix alongside the voice of Mr. Springsteen, alone and then joined by others including Adam Schumann, the soldier whose story underlies the film. It trudges onward, elegiac and determined. J.P.

Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band, ‘Within Everything’

With Brian Blade’s Fellowship Band, which has been together in one form or another for 20 years, the jazz combo becomes a kind of traveling backyard communion. In this music — Southern and ungothic, slow and almost hymnal — you hear dreams passed around between companions, atrophied memories held together in communal trust. On “Body and Shadow” — the Fellowship’s fourth album, out next week — Mr. Blade, a renowned drummer, lets his knack for ground-opening syncopations take a back seat; his compatriots forgo the kind of high-flown soloing that he’s so good at conjuring. Instead, coming to the fore is a rich shadow play of harmonies and earth tones. Together, Dave Devine’s guitar, Chris Thomas’s bass, Melvin Butler’s tenor saxophone and (on tracks other than this) Myron Walden’s bass clarinet make a sound like damp wood underfoot, welcoming your step on a trail you’ve long known. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Sam Smith, ‘Burning’ (Live From the Hackney Round Chapel)

Admire the patience of Sam Smith ’s bassist and backup singers in this live rendition of “Burning,” a despondent hymn of lost love tinged with nicotine addiction. Despite the tremulous purity of his voice, he claims to be smoking “oh, more than 20 a day” since the breakup, and as he yearns for a reunion, he offers, “Wish we could smoke again just for a day.” Reinforcing his loneliness, he’s accompanied for nearly the entire song only by piano chords; the others don’t join him until three minutes into the song, for one chorus, and then they’re silent again. J.P.

Feist, ‘Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye’

In a quiet tribute from one Canadian songwriter to another, Feist sings Leonard Cohen’s fond and profound farewell to a lover, “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye,” with quiet longing. Her version is both close to and distant from his; an acoustic guitar is the only instrument, while her layered voices portray her close attention to the song’s shifting moods. J.P.

Tee Grizzley, ‘Win’

The most striking aspect of Tee Grizzley’s breakout single, “First Day Out,” was its breathlessness. He raps with something more than urgency — it’s more like insistence. That song, an unexpected hit last year, felt like a barreling train that refused to slow down. On “Win,” his best song since, he hasn’t let up a bit, success be damned: “Without me my family wouldn’t have food/Anybody going ‘gainst me gotta lose.” Even though Tee Grizzley moves bullishly, what enlivens his verses are the quick flashes of mordant wit: “The Mustang used to always run out of gas/now I’m in that Wraith, touch the paint and it’s a body bag.” J.C.

Cam, ‘Diane’

The good old country cheating song gets even more twisted in “Diane”: an apology by a deceived lover, who knows she didn’t see any “gold wedding band,” to her lover’s wife. “I promise I didn’t know he was your man,” she sings. It’s not a lament: it’s a gallop, quick-strummed and belted. “All of those nights that he’s given to me/I wish I could give them back to you,” Cam offers, in a kind of adulterous humblebrag, over an arrangement that’s closer to the E Street Band than to Loretta Lynn. J.P.

Empyrean Atlas, ‘Echolocation’

Depending on the tune, the interwoven triple-guitar gamesmanship of Empyrean Atlas can run in few different directions: toward the mathy post-punk of Horse Lords or Battles, toward warmly anesthetic ambience (say, Pink Floyd meets Bradford Cox), or toward West African high life. On “Echolocation,” the clangy, lapping repetitions feel most in line with that last influence. The quintet’s movements are coiled and contained, but pulsing with small, ecstatic fibrillations.

We’re just in hoary old Hollywood, where showing a problem tends to be confused with addressing it. All we know about the family across the way — they’re the Mayerses — is that they’re new homeowners and that they’re black. And boy, are they restrained. When racists scream at her, Mrs. Mayers doesn’t scream back. She merely continues to pin the laundry on the clothesline. When she experiences a customized price hike at the grocery store (for her, every item is suddenly $20), she relents and makes the sort of stoic exit that a movie like this needs to double as a triumph of dignity.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mayers barely gets a line. But he mows a mean lawn. Their kid spends the movie playing with Nicky, who’s mandated to do it by his aunt. The mandate extends to Mr. Clooney, whose sense of social progressivism hits a ceiling. The way the Mayers family functions isn’t all that different from how Dianne Reeves’s jazz singing and the footage of the actual Annie Lee Moss’s testimony are deployed in Mr. Clooney’s 2005 docudrama, “Good Night, and Good Luck.”

They were flicking at progressivism that the movie didn’t have the political bandwidth to get into. But the difference is that both women (neither of whom achieves character status) are part of the movie’s wider sanctimony in recreating Edward R. Murrow’s battle in the 1950s with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his televised anti-Communist witch hunt. It’s righteousness on Ambien. But I put up with the movie’s turning Ms. Reeves and the footage of Moss into weapons: They served the movie’s thematic strategy. Unlike, “Suburbicon,” it had an argument. McCarthyism really is bad.

Yet it seems that in his films, “dignified” is the only way Mr. Clooney wants to imagine black people. Anytime a movie or television show retreats into certain American pasts, I’m both annoyed and relieved. “Back then” can provide cover for an all-white cast. It can feel like an excuse or a hide out. But filmmakers might want to be careful about where the time machine sends them. Sofia Coppola’s went back to the Civil War, for “The Beguiled.” Rather than deal with the moral centrality of slavery, she simply freed the slaves herself. Sometimes you get very good filmmaking anyway. You also get gentrification.

Mr. Clooney has directed six movies; five are set in the middle of the previous century. And “Suburbicon” clarifies why. Race is a blind spot. None of the scenes with the Mayerses go on for more than 90 seconds; most last less than 15. And all are intended as a moral counterpoint to the darkening frivolity going on at the Lodges’. The Times’s Manohla Dargis got at this inequality in her review of the film. The casting telegraphs the movie’s priorities. The black actors — Karimah Westbrook, Tony Espinosa and Leith M. Burke — may not be as famous as the movie’s white stars, but Mr. Clooney hasn’t given them a chance to show whether they’re also as good.

In September, after the “Suburbicon” premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, he told David Sims, of The Atlantic, that he knows his approach is imperfect. “In all fairness, there are a lot of people better qualified to make the African-American story in suburbia, I think,” Mr. Clooney said.

“There’s a version of this film I’d like to see from the other side that could be better represented by someone who can speak to that better than me, and probably should.” He went on: “I think my version was what I know, which is white angst and the fear of losing your place to minorities.” He also said that he’d like to see others directors — Ava DuVernay or Steve McQueen, say — do a version of this story.

Sure, it’s possible that the white riots happening in “Suburbicon” reflect the current tour of white nationalist pop-up events. And perhaps somewhere inside this movie lives a farce that reckons with white indifference in the face of national catastrophe. But no one had the audacity to find it. The movie is the catastrophe, instead. During the era in which this movie is set, you would get dramas like Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s “No Way Out,” from 1950, or “Pressure Point,” a social drama from 1962 that Stanley Kramer had a hand in. They both star Sidney Poitier, and neither is afraid of at least trying to see race “from the other side.” The violent, relentless depiction of racism in “No Way Out,” complete with a race riot, is actually still pretty shocking. They’re as square as the movies Mr. Clooney tends to make, but they’re also daring, however imperfectly, to look right at the present rather than hunkering down in the past.

The big surprise of Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is its conception of a racism that doesn’t need lynch mobs or a Confederate flag to make its point. Good, liberal white people — the ones for whom “I voted for Obama” is supposed to be an icebreaker — inflict as much harm as obvious bad ones. Mr. Clooney is not humanizing the Mayerses, per se. He is using them. The sad thing is that he didn’t need to. The black characters have nothing to do with the plot of this movie. They’re here almost against their will, kept in the white-controlled existential purgatory that Mr. Peele’s movie identifies as the sunken place.

By the final bogusly optimistic shot, it’s obvious what “Suburbicon” wants you to know: This movie voted for Obama.

If Hollywood movies are in trouble, something as confused as this one signals a hastening of their demise. Most of me will always want some version of this middlebrow entertainment in my life. But if fighting to keep that kind of movie alive also means fighting for the cynicism of “Suburbicon,” the rest of me wants to say get out.",George Clooney’s Awkward White Guilt in ‘Suburbicon’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/movies/george-clooney-suburbicon-racism.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.

“The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”

After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.

“2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”

The trafficker identified himself only as Tom and said he was based in Southeast Asia. Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another. Such ape shows are a growing business in Southeast Asia, despite international regulations that prohibit trafficking in endangered apes.

Several weeks later, after a few more rounds of text messages with Tom to firm up the details, Mr. Stiles decided to fly to Bangkok.

“I was way out on a limb,” Mr. Stiles admitted later. But he was eager to bring down Tom, who indicated that he could find orangutans and chimps with only a few days’ notice, the mark of a major dealer.","Smuggled, Beaten and Drugged: The Illicit Global Ape Trade",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/africa/ape-trafficking-bonobos-orangutans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Erica Wyatt struggled to pay down her debts and then searched for two years before she managed to get a mortgage from Fifth Third Bank to buy a four-bedroom home for $92,000. The transaction happened only because Ms. Wyatt, a single mother with four children, received $15,000 in down payment assistance.

Ms. Wyatt, who grew up in Detroit, said she was determined to move back into the city after renting a home in a suburb. “I wanted to make sure my children saw that not all of Detroit is bad and there are some beautiful neighborhoods,” said Ms. Wyatt, 39, who works for an insurance company.

Some of the ideas seem like stopgap measures. A social services group’s community of “tiny homes” — 400-square-foot structures with nothing more than a bedroom, a bathroom and small kitchen — is being erected to provide housing to homeless and handicapped people. The project, led by Reverend Faith Fowler, executive director of Cass Community Social Services, is taking place on a plot of vacant land the charitable organization bought from the city.

The dollhouse-like structures — seven so far — are near the organization’s main social services facility, in a rather desolate area of Detroit off Rosa Parks Boulevard. In all, Ms. Fowler hopes to build two dozen small homes, which will be rented for as little as $250 a month and eventually deeded over after seven years to a select group of homeless or poor individuals.

Tiny-house living can take adjustment, even for people with no roof over their heads at all. Ms. Fowler said that one homeless veteran told her the homes were too small to compete with a traditional homeless shelter.

Still, for some, the homes are perfect. One of the first tenants to move in this past summer is a former Methodist minister, David Leenhouts, who was forced to give up his ministry near Cleveland because of health issues that make it difficult for him to walk and talk.

Mr. Leenhouts, who grew up in the Detroit area, said his college-age son told him the small home, with a steepled ceiling, was all he needed because everything is within just a few steps. Mr. Leenhouts, 59, said, “I have no idea where I would be living if I was not chosen for a tiny house.”

That said, a cluster of tiny homes hardly seems scalable in a city as big as Detroit. And almost by definition, a tiny home isn’t a viable option for a family with children.

It’s also an example of why the long-term prognosis for Detroit’s housing market remains uncertain at best. Much of the work underway is taking place block-by-block — much like the tiny-home homeless experiment — and there are a lot of blocks in this 139-square-mile city.

“The pilot programs help some people, but they are on the margin,” said Gregory Markus, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Michigan and executive director of Detroit Action Commonwealth, an advocacy group for low-income residents. “‘The root problem is that Detroit is the poorest big city in America.”’

The national poverty rate is 14 percent, and Detroit’s is 36 percent. Mr. Markus said that, without more jobs, home buying will remain a largely unattainable goal.

Detroit’s population peaked in the 1950s at nearly 2 million and has been falling ever since. The financial crisis and the city’s bankruptcy filing in 2013 hollowed out what was left of its once large, middle-class African-American community.

Through a representative, Mr. Weinstein has steadily denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.
But in interviews with The Times and a statement through her lawyer, Ms. de la Huerta described a series of harrowing encounters in 2010.
First, she said, Mr. Weinstein raped her in her TriBeCa apartment.
Afterward, Ms. de la Huerta said, she had an emotional breakdown and struggled to work.","Chief Boyce said that Ms. de la Huerta “put forth a credible and detailed narrative” to his detectives and that those detectives found “corroboration along the way.” He said Ms. de la Huerta was able “to articulate each and every movement of the crime: where she was, where they met, where this happened and what he did.”

Despite the strong words from Mr. Boyce, officials in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., issued a statement suggesting they were not ready to charge Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Vance’s office would be responsible for prosecuting Mr. Weinstein if he were arrested.

Ms. de la Huerta’s claims resemble those by other women who have come forward. But even as the number of alleged Weinstein victims has increased, with a growing number of women across the world claiming that he harassed, assaulted or raped them, it is unclear whether Mr. Weinstein will face criminal charges. Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles and Britain have also confirmed that they are investigating accounts of sexual assault and abuse by Mr. Weinstein, but the announcement by the New York police is the first indication of a possible arrest.

Through a representative, Mr. Weinstein has steadily denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.

But in interviews with The Times and a statement through her lawyer, Ms. de la Huerta described a series of harrowing encounters in 2010. First, she said, Mr. Weinstein raped her in her TriBeCa apartment. “I know you’re ready to become a real actress,” she said the producer told her as he forced himself on her.

Ms. de la Huerta, who appeared in the HBO drama “Boardwalk Empire,” said that in the weeks afterward, Mr. Weinstein harassed her, calling her frequently, idling his car outside her apartment building and exposing himself to her at a Los Angeles hotel. “He would call me all the time,” she said, adding that his assistant repeatedly sought her out, saying, “Harvey wants to see you.”

“I was terrified,” she said, explaining why she did not go to the police and instead confided mainly in her therapist. “You keep quiet about it,” she added, describing why she stayed silent.

In December 2010, Mr. Weinstein called Ms. de la Huerta and told her he was waiting in her apartment building lobby and would not leave until she met him, she said. “I had said no to meeting him, no to functions,” she said. “He persisted until he was literally sitting in my lobby until I came home.”

She had been drinking that night because she was nervous, she said.

When she arrived in the lobby, Mr. Weinstein manipulated her into letting him into her apartment, saying they would have a calm discussion upstairs, she recalled. Once they got upstairs, he pushed her on the bed, overpowered her and raped her a second time, she said.

Afterward, Ms. de la Huerta said, she had an emotional breakdown and struggled to work. Her therapist, Sue Ann Piliero, did not return phone calls seeking comment but provided a short statement to the lawyer, Aaron Filler, who provided it to The Times. The statement partially backed Ms. de la Huerta’s recollections.

“I recall you telling me that Harvey Weinstein was seeking sexual contact with you on more than one occasion with the promise of additional roles,” she wrote. “I recall you reporting to me a sexual encounter with Harvey Weinstein involving intercourse in your apartment in 2010 that resulted in you feeling victimized. I recall you telling me that it felt coercive to you and that you didn’t want to have sex with him, but felt that you had to as he was a man of power and rank and you couldn’t say no to his sexual advances.”

Mr. Boyce faced questions about the case on Friday because a report in Vanity Fair quoted a New York police detective, Nicholas DiGaudio, saying the police were ready to move forward.

In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses.

Two officials in the district attorney’s office, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation, said one of the office’s most experienced sex crime prosecutors, Maxine Rosenthal, conducted the initial interview with Ms. de la Huerta.

But the officials cautioned that the investigation was still in the early stages and that detectives and prosecutors were still gathering evidence.

“We are taking it seriously and we are investigating it,” an official with the district attorney’s office said. “We are hoping to build a case. If we can build one, we will build one.”

In general, the Manhattan district attorney’s office will not go forward with a sex crimes prosecution unless prosecutors in its sex crimes unit are absolutely convinced they have enough evidence. This high bar for sex crimes exists largely to avoid subjecting a victim to a humiliating cross-examination that would doom the case and deter other victims from coming forward, prosecutors say.

That is one reason Mr. Vance has said he decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015, when Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, accused him of groping her during a job interview at his office.",Police Building Case to Arrest Harvey Weinstein After Sexual Assault Claim,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-new-york-police.html

Chinese migrants are moving steadily north into this vastly underpopulated Siberian back-of-beyond, rich in the natural gas, oil, timber, diamonds and gold that China covets. China lost part of this region to Russia only in the 19th century, when the Qing dynasty was in its death throes, and the rest in the 20th century.

At the same time, China is vanquishing Russia in Central Asia. In the last decade, the China National Petroleum Corporation has become Central Asia’s main energy player. China pumps Kazakh oil to Europe and also to China through a pipeline, and the Chinese transport natural gas from Turkmenistan to western China. Chinese money has also been coursing through Central Asia to build power grids and transportation infrastructure, altering the landscape and forming the backbone of the One Belt, One Road plan.

The prize is Iran. Lying at the other end of Central Asia from China, Iran has 80 million people and straddles the oil and gas fields of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, providing Beijing with the incentive to build rail lines through the Iranian plateau, make energy deals with Tehran, use Chinese state companies to excavate Iranian mines, and send armies of entrepreneurs there. Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union, including Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, was formed in 2014 to counter China’s growing influence in Eurasia.

Russia is not only losing out to China in its far east and Central Asia, but in Europe, too. While Moscow has been undermining the independence of the former Soviet republics in the Baltic and Black Sea basins through subversion and military incursions, Beijing has been strengthening trade ties throughout Europe. The Trump administration’s aversion to free trade — combined with its apparent ambivalence about defending European allies — has provided China with an opportunity in Europe, further enhancing Beijing’s plans for the western terminus of One Belt, One Road. China’s gains will weaken not only American influence in Europe, but Russian influence, too.

For example, Greece, because of its tensions with the European Union and its Orthodox religion, should be drifting closer to Russia. But it is slipping into China’s economic grasp, as the port of Piraeus becomes another western endpoint of the new Silk Road. China is also competing for nuclear power plants and other energy infrastructure in Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and the Czech Republic. President Vladimir Putin’s compulsion to challenge the West — while China under President Xi Jinping is quietly on the march all around him — demonstrates his strategic shortsightedness at a time of Russian economic vulnerability.

China and Russia refer to their relationship as a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” in which Russia supplies oil to China and the two countries hold joint military exercises. And, officially, their relationship has rarely been better.

But trade is lopsided in China’s favor; the fall in energy prices has made China considerably less dependent on Russia. Russia sells arms to China’s adversaries, India and Vietnam. And China has copied Russian weapons designs.

These deeper geopolitical realities mean China and Russia will be only allies of convenience. And because the Beijing-Moscow rivalry is long-term, understated and focused on remote terrain, thus lacking in appeal for the news media, it is easy to ignore.

China’s geopolitical ambitions, like Russia’s, arise out of internal insecurity. The Chinese state is weakest in the west — that is, in historic East Turkestan — home to the Muslim Turkic Uighur minority, which the dominant ethnic group, the Han Chinese, view with trepidation.

Islam represents an alternative identity for the Uighurs, one independent of the Chinese state. Unlike the Tibetans with their Dalai Lama, the Uighurs don’t have an elite leadership with which to communicate with Beijing. Rather, they embody an anarchic force that could be provoked into upheaval by an environmental disaster or other emergency. China’s One Belt, One Road initiative, by joining the rest of Turkic Central Asia economically and politically closer to China, is meant in part to deny the Uighurs a rear base in an uprising.

China can be stopped only by its own internal demons. As Samuel P. Huntington wrote in his classic 1968 study, “Political Order in Changing Societies,” the more complex a society gets, the more responsive its institutions must become, otherwise the creation of a large middle class is destabilizing.

China’s autocracy, precisely because of its successes, could face a crisis of legitimacy as social, ethnic and religious tensions intensify in both Han and Uighur areas, especially in the event of any further slowdowns in economic growth that thwart the rising expectations of its people. That’s why the ultimate success of One Belt, One Road will be determined less by what happens in Central Asia and elsewhere than by what happens inside China itself.

The United States, which has longtime allies to defend against Chinese bullying in East Asia and against Russian bullying in Central and Eastern Europe, is helped by the quiet geopolitical rivalry between Beijing and Moscow. Because the contest between China and Russia is largely determined by their geographical proximity and therefore must persist, America will have the greater possibility to maneuver, hardening or softening its position toward each power as the situation demands.

The United States must only prevent China from dominating the Eastern Hemisphere to the same extent that it has dominated the Western Hemisphere. But it must do this without selling out Central Europe and parts of the Middle East to Russia.

The solution to this conundrum for the United States lies outside geopolitics. It is precisely because Washington has no territorial ambitions in Eurasia that Americans are not viewed with suspicion by local populations there the way the Chinese and Russians are. By relentlessly promoting free trade, human rights and civil society America will gain credibility with societies undergoing rapid social transformation across the region.

This is how the United States gains entry into Eurasia without crudely trying to balance one power off against the other at a moment when the Chinese-Russian rivalry is far more subtle than it was in Nixon’s time. The very economic development that China promotes will make societies along the path of the new Silk Road — particularly in the sterile dictatorships of Iran and Central Asia — harder to manage, and thus to rule.

That inspired the title of the book — which will be published Nov. 14 by HarperCollins — as a quote that seemed to carry a double meaning.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Mr. Updegrove, the author of several books on the presidency, said in an interview. “But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia.”

In discussing Mr. Trump, the elder president was blunter. “I don’t like him,” Mr. Bush said in May 2016. “I don’t know much about him, but I know he’s a blowhard. And I’m not too excited about him being a leader.” Rather than being motivated by public service, Mr. Bush said Mr. Trump seemed to be driven by “a certain ego.”

The younger Mr. Bush was more circumspect, but also clearly disapproving. The Bushes felt stung by Mr. Trump’s ground-burning attacks that helped destroy the campaign of Jeb Bush, the son and brother of the presidents.

“You can either exploit the anger, incite it,” George W. Bush told Mr. Updegrove, “or you can come up with ideas to deal with it.” Jeb, he said, came up with solutions, “but it didn’t fit with the mood.”

“If you’re angry with the powers that be,” he added, “you’re angry with the so-called establishment, and there’s nothing more established than having a father and brother that have been president.”

When Mr. Trump declared that “I’m my own adviser,” Mr. Bush thought he did not understand the presidency. He also lamented Mr. Trump’s lack of humility. “As you know from looking at my family, it is a certain heritage, that’s what they expect, and we’re not seeing that” in Mr. Trump.

The release of the book comes weeks after the younger Mr. Bush delivered a speech seen as a rebuke of Mr. Trump’s approach to the presidency and the world.

Addressing a conference in New York, Mr. Bush decried what he called the “nativism” of today’s policies and the “casual cruelty” of today’s politics. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bush said that “bigotry seems emboldened” and “our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.”

Mr. Updegrove, the former director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum and now the founding chief executive of the National Medal of Honor Museum, got to know both Bushes in recent years and persuaded them to talk with him for a book on their relationship, a subject that they had been allergic to while their political careers were still active.

The two men disputed Shakespearean assumptions about father-son rivalries and insisted they remained close throughout the younger Mr. Bush’s presidency, despite suspicions about a rift over the Iraq war. But George W. Bush’s parents were clearly disturbed by the influence of Vice President Dick Cheney and neoconservative advisers.

The elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Updegrove reported, counseled his son to consider “shaking up the ticket” in 2004, meaning to replace Mr. Cheney as his running mate — just as the younger Mr. Bush suggested to his father about Vice President Dan Quayle in 1992. Like his father, the son disregarded the advice.

Barbara Bush told Mr. Updegrove that she believed Mr. Cheney changed because of his health troubles, including a heart attack followed by a stent operation shortly after the 2000 election. “I do think he was different,” she said. “I think his heart operation made a difference. I always liked him, but I didn’t like him so much for a while because I thought he hurt George. I wasn’t that fond of him. I think he pushed things a little too far right.”

The younger Mr. Bush resented the implication that anyone was steering him. “The fact that there was any doubt in anyone’s mind about who the president was blows my mind,” he said. He added that Mr. Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his defense secretary, “didn’t make one fucking decision.”

But he insisted Mr. Cheney served him well and said that the vice president’s sometimes dark reputation was inevitable. “I understand the way the system works,” he said. “Somebody has to be the bad guy.”",Both Bush Presidents Worry Trump Is Blowing Up the G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/politics/bush-president-book-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In Bangladesh and India, over 1,000 people died in an outsize monsoon flood. In the Caribbean and the United States, a succession of devastating hurricanes killed hundreds of people and cost thousands more their homes and businesses. In Hong Kong and southern China, over a dozen people were killed by a powerful typhoon.

1) 2 P.M. Latin Rhythms

El Barrio stretches north from East 96th Street to the Harlem River, but its heart is the commercial strip of East 116th Street, between La Marqueta, the revitalized historic market under the railroad tracks of Park Avenue, and First Avenue. Casa Latina Music Shop beckons with Latin rhythms blaring from loudspeakers. In the neighborhood for more than 50 years, the store is owned by the couple Vicente and Cristina Barreiro — he, Spanish; she, Argentine — who have survived both gentrification and music downloads with an eclectic mix of sounds, from salsa and reggaeton to vintage ballads. They also sell collectibles, books and percussion instruments like bongos and cowbells.

2) 2:30 P.M. Murals and Comfort Food

Not far away, at 168 East 116th Street, Cuchifritos entices with the aroma of Puerto Rican fritters like alcapurrias (green banana dough filled with ground beef, $1.50). Caribbean comfort food includes pork shoulder and rice with pigeon peas, for $8, but seating is limited to a counter with stools, so pick up a snack at the sidewalk window and keep walking as you munch. Along 116th Street, between First and Second Avenues, a mosaic portrait of the Puerto Rican educator and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Antonia Pantoja, founder of the educational youth organization Aspira, frames the entrance of the senior center at Corsi Houses, a public-housing project. The piece is just a sample of the multimedia artist Manny Vega’s artwork and a good start to a walking tour of the street art throughout the neighborhood, including the 1970s-era, four-story mural “The Spirit of East Harlem” on a residential building at 104th Street and Lexington Avenue, by Mr. Vega and Hank Prussing, depicting a domino game in progress, kids playing basketball and other neighborhood scenes and portraits.

3) 5 P.M. Peace and Party

The wooden fishing pier at the end of Dyckman Street in Inwood, a neighborhood on the northern tip of Manhattan with a large Dominican population, is an urban refuge, with stunning views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge and the sunset over New Jersey.

Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

On the afternoon that the Waldorf closed, Hilton Worldwide, which manages the hotel, treated employees to a party in the Grand Ballroom, complete with champagne.

“But champagne is for celebrations,” Ms. Gatewood said. “And what were we celebrating? We were losing our jobs. We needed a good strong vodka, or maybe a Scotch.”

At the end of the party, the employees turned toward the stage, where a large mock light switch was flipped and the lights went out.

Seeking a fit for her specialized skills was not Ms. Gatewood’s only concern: She feared the challenge of finding work in her 60s. She joined the 91,000 New York State residents who are 55 or older and looking for work. About a third of people in that demographic face long-term unemployment, or at least 27 weeks without work, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.

At the party, Ms. Gatewood said, many colleagues whispered hopes of returning when the hotel reopens. She hoped her $10,000 post-tax severance package would help carry her through, along with her savings of $50,000, roughly her annual salary. Ms. Gatewood provides for her two adult sons and her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. They live together in a home she rents for $1,000 a month.

Her younger son, Isaiah Page, 27, got a minimum-wage job about a year ago stocking shelves at a supermarket, but he is not yet able to contribute to the family’s expenses. His brother, William Page, 33, has been out of work for many years.

“This is my home away from home,” she said with a smile.

Last week, Ms. Gatewood started a temporary full-time job at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where she works as a room service attendant, filling in for a staff member on leave.

Hilton, when contacted this week for this article, offered to help Ms. Gatewood find a permanent job at one of its other locations in New York City.

Before securing temporary employment, Ms. Gatewood received $425 a week in unemployment benefits. She has many years of hospitality experience, but said she would like to one day work in real estate.

Ms. Gatewood said she wished that she could have spent more time with her sons when they were younger. After her partner left she began waitressing, and the flexible hours allowed her to see her sons off to school and day care. But long shifts kept her out sometimes until 5 a.m., leaving her older son to look after his brother. In 1998, they settled in the Staten Island neighborhood of Park Hill, where they still live today. Ms. Gatewood would occasionally work seven days a week and was not home enough, she said.

She wants her sons to find jobs they are passionate about and make lives for themselves.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

BERLIN — Ever since Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats lost five million voters to the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany in September, mainstream German conservatives have been in a panic. This is not just the usual blame game after a major electoral setback. It’s a long-simmering crisis finally boiling over — and Ms. Merkel is at the heart of it.

The past decades have put conservatism in Germany to an existential test. The grand currents of contemporary history in the Western world have smashed the shrine of its principles. Globalization and migration challenged the Christian Democrats’ embrace of a German “Leitkultur,” the notion that there is a single, coherent “leading culture.” Urbanization has threatened its traditional rural strongholds. Secularization and ethnic diversity called into question the privileges of Christianity in public life. And trends toward gender equality and gay rights and the rise of the post-nuclear family have undermined the party’s emphasis on traditional social values.

Mrs. Merkel’s answer to the many challenges during her 17 years as the party’s leader was if you can’t beat it, embrace it. She has allowed influential women in the party to modernize its view of the family. She overhauled the party’s course on nuclear energy after the Fukushima disaster. She cautiously modernized the party’s view on immigration and supported a greater public acceptance of Islam.

Ms. Merkel’s centrist course never went uncontested. Factions within her party, such as the so-called Berlin Circle of politicians, warned that conservatism was losing its substance. But they were muted by the obvious success of Ms. Merkel’s strategy, and the lack of a true alternative. And the modernizers around Ms. Merkel argued that conservatism is not necessarily a bulletpoint list of tangible policy issues, but rather a method of policy making. Doing it the conservative way meant to “do the necessary to protect what you hold dear,” as the party’s secretary general, Peter Tauber, once put it; it meant moving forward without losing sight of what’s worth keeping.

In the face of the worst result in the party’s history, however, many feel conservatism as a method, rather than a set of principles, is no longer enough, and that Merkelism has lost all meaning. Especially in light of the rise of the far right, they want to reclaim their party’s focus on national identity and Leitkultur. The postelection crisis of German conservatism amounts to these questions: How “deutsch” does conservatism have to be to win back voters from Alternative for Germany? And at what cost?

To understand where German conservatism may be headed, look at Jens Spahn. A Christian Democrat in the Bundestag, Mr. Spahn is not a nationalist, but he believes that a certain dose of nationalism could have healing powers — healing for both public insecurities and his own party’s misery. He is young, eloquent and ambitious, and an openly gay resident of Berlin. Political insiders consider him a potential successor to Ms. Merkel as the head of the Christian Democrats, if not as chancellor. He is too smart to indulge in the blunt copying of Alternative for Germany slogans that others in his party have taken to after the election. But he is aware of the power of political symbols and has supported a ban on wearing a burqa in public, as well as a ban on dual citizenship.",Does German Conservatism Have a Future?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/merkel-spahn-christian-democrats.html

This lets them kill trees undetected and start leeching nutrients from the dead stuff before competing bacteria and fungi arrived. And if and when competitors do show up, Armillaria can create a chemical environment intolerable for them.

However they find their hosts, pathogenic Armillaria are ancient. They arrived an estimated 21 million years ago and stuck around for a reason.

In healthy, natural, diverse forests, the fungi absorb carbon and kill only the weakest trees, like gangly, underground forest rangers. But in monocultures made up of genetically identical trees, stresses like drought can cause all the trees to fall weak simultaneously.

“This is how Armillaria can wipe out entire forests,” said György Sipos, a biologist at the University of Sopron in Hungary who led the study with László Nagy, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

So off he went to Africa, which is pretty much the last place in the world that needs more fossil fuels. There’s already a heck of a lot of coal and oil there, but it’s not doing poor villagers any good.

“Fossil fuels and the grid approach have had their reign for a hundred years now, and there are still a billion people without electricity,” said Kristina Skierka of Power for All, a global campaign for universal energy access.

And even if a grid did arrive, Skierka pointed out, the little girl would still be reading by the firelight since rural African transmission lines tend to be down more often than they’re working.

An obvious answer is solar power. “It’s similar to cellphones,” said Michael Brune of the Sierra Club. “You don’t have to build a new grid. You can just use solar power plus batteries and bring power to a community — not just much more cheaply but much more quickly.”

Wow, the little village girl could put a solar cell on the roof and power a battery for her reading light. And no pollution. That’s exactly the kind of thinking that drives Perry nuts. So there he was in Cape Town, spreading the faith and urging his audience to break the “culture of shame” around oil and coal.

Africa was actually the worst place possible for an American official to be waving the fossil fuel flag. Climate scientists expect it to be particularly hard hit by global warming, with expanding droughts on one hand and flooding on the other.

Perry has generally tried to avoid picking fights when it comes to the science of global warming — although he did once, in a presidential debate, appear to be comparing climate change deniers to Galileo. His bottom line is basically that whatever is going on, it should not have any impact on the continued consumption of oil and coal.

“If you admit you support fossil fuels, it’s like saying you’ve made some huge social error,” he complained in Cape Town.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

I can’t recall the precise moment now, but it was probably somewhere in the seventh inning of Game 7 of the World Series, right around the time the Astros’ Jose Altuve stole second base, that I thought of the novelist Don DeLillo.

I was in Houston, sitting on a milk crate on Waylon Doucett’s porch. There was beer, a jar filled with moonshine and the scent of marijuana in the air. Mr. Doucett’s home was very much like his city in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey — a work in progress. Roaches on bare concrete floors. Exposed vertical beams where there should be walls. A mound of clothes where there should be a bed.

But there was a raw joy in Mr. Doucett. His team was about to win the World Series. There was a pain, too, some unspoken melancholy and exhaustion, a yearning for the way the world used to be, at least the one he knew on the 9300 block of Lake Forest Boulevard. I was there to capture his thoughts and reaction to the Astros’ victory and what it means for a city devastated by the costliest natural disaster in United States history.

In Mr. DeLillo’s epic 1997 novel “Underworld,” in the book’s opening baseball section, he wrote: “Longing on a large scale is what makes history.” The longing of flood victims like Mr. Doucett made a kind of history on Wednesday night. It was powerful to watch. The Astros’ World Series run gave Houston a focus for some of this post-Harvey emotion, a place to put it all in.

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

Photo

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Photo

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined.

The house was fully renovated under the direction of the designer Leopoldo Rosati. It has 5,148 square feet, with four bedrooms and four and a half baths. The home had been in the spotlight about six years ago when it was rented to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Strauss-Kahn had been under house arrest there, accused of assaulting a housekeeper at a New York hotel. (Those charges were later dropped.)

Ms. Swift, whose latest album “Reputation” is due out this month, also owns a penthouse in TriBeCa, at 155 Franklin, and she had been renting a townhouse in the West Village, at 23 Cornelia Street. That property is now for sale, for just under $20 million.

THE PAVAROTTI PIED-À-TERRE, at the Hampton House, at 150 Central Park South, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, was sold for $9 million. The buyer was Alva Craft, an actress and singer, who was the wife of Robert Craft, an orchestral conductor who died two years ago.

The apartment, unit No. 2301, was first listed for sale in 2014, seven years after Mr. Pavarotti’s death. The price was $13.7 million. It was taken off the market and re-listed in early 2016 for $10.5 million, then later that year offered briefly as a potential combination with a smaller, neighboring apartment, No. 2302, for a total of $20.5 million. Last month’s sale was without a broker.

Mr. Pavarotti had purchased this 2,000-square-foot apartment, with two bedrooms and two baths, more than 30 years ago. His wife said he was drawn, in part, to the apartment’s proximity to the Metropolitan Opera House. It is also close to Carnegie Hall.

THE PENTHOUSE SOLD BY MR. NEWHOUSE is at 105 East 29th Street, a co-op building near Park Avenue South. It closed at $6.8 million, which was not far from the asking price.

According to the listing with Douglas Elliman, the full-floor, loft-like unit measures about 3,400 square feet and has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, with high ceilings and oversize windows. An antique iron staircase leads to a glass-enclosed room and a 1,400-square-foot roof terrace.

Mr. Newhouse was a cousin of S.I. Newhouse Jr., who controlled Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications, and died in early October.

Across town, Ms. Haydon, who ran the Kay Models agency and is the mother of Vanessa Haydon Trump, paid $6.4 million for unit No. 14A and a storage room at 1049 Fifth Avenue, a prewar condominium near 86th Street and facing Central Park.

This 2,458-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, along with two wraparound terraces totaling 705 square feet, according to the Douglas Elliman listing.

In Greenwich Village, Ms. Errico, who has starred in several Broadway shows, and Mr. McEnroe, who is a brother of the tennis champion John McEnroe, sold their five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath duplex at 250 Mercer Street for $5.2 million. The 3,883-square-foot apartment also came with a storage unit.

And in the West Village, Ms. Poehler paid $6.5 million to Mr. Arnett, from whom she is divorced, for their eighth-floor apartment at 1 Morton Square. The 2,446-square-foot unit has three bedrooms and three baths. They had purchased the home in 2007 for $5.28 million.","Recent Sales and Boldface Names, Including Taylor Swift",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/realestate/taylor-swift-recent-sales-boldface-names.html

De Blasio: 4 Years Later, Managing Expectations and Time

The government of New York City is enormous, with more than 295,000 full-time employees and an annual budget of $85 billion, presenting a host of challenges for any manager. The New York Times asked Mayor Bill de Blasio , the Democrat who is seeking a second term, about his approach to management, the experiences that inform his decisions as a manager and his vision for New York City over the next four years.

Mr. de Blasio spoke with The Times on the back porch of Gracie Mansion. Read a similar interview with Nicole Malliotakis , Mr. de Blasio’s Republican opponent.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Q. Four years ago, your message was ending the “Tale of two cities.” Now your slogan is “This is your city.” Whose city are you talking about?

A. It’s a city that belongs to all eight and a half million people, not just those who have done very, very well. And it’s implicitly a recognition that for the 20 years before I took office, there were many policies that favored a small group of New Yorkers rather than addressing the needs of the vast majority.

The way I’ve tried to address it is to lift wages and benefits for working people and provide them more direct benefits that reduce their economic burdens: pre-K, after-school, paid sick leave, the minimum wage increases we’ve done locally, and obviously the role that we’ve played in helping to get the state legislation. All of these are ways of addressing income inequality.

The reason we say “This is your city” is to show that government focused on the needs of everyday people actually can make a tangible difference in people’s lives, and that these policies change things in a short period of time.

Q. You’ve been mayor for four years, what have you learned about management during that time? How have you changed how you manage ?

A. I was always very detail-oriented, and in the time I spent in different roles — the elected official, the campaign manager — I had a tendency to want to push the creation of the product and really work on the critical path that would get to product. And I have found that that instinct really is needed in a big sprawling operation, particularly when confronting the challenge of bureaucratic culture. So that’s been a lot of what I’ve done, sort of, very hands-on, very forcefully going over the timelines, going over the checklist of “what’s it going to take.”

I think what has been eye-opening is the time dynamics; things move very, very quickly. Keeping a lot of different initiatives going and recognizing the time and energy that it takes, keeping a lot of things moving when there’s 100 other issues you’d like to work on. I feel like the basic model is a good one: Convene all the pertinent people and force a product orientation into the discussion.

Q. What do you mean by “product orientation?”

A. If you talk to a lot of people in government, they will talk about the pathway to getting something done rather than the thing itself. And I just talk about material outcomes. It was “pre-K: How many seats” and “where was the space going to come from, where are we going to get the teachers” and everything else. I tend to be very much about the physical manifestation of our vision, so I want to hear how we’re going to get from A to Z. Give me exact numbers, exact timelines, etc. My personal theory of management in this kind of context is, people have to hear that instruction often. They have to be constantly pushed to show their numbers, and they need to hear it from the boss, if there’s any lack of forward motion, they need to hear it from the boss on a regular basis.

Q. Was “product orientation” a phrase that was in your regular vocabulary when you came into City Hall?

A. Sure. A lot of time, what I find is, good people, hard-working people in government will, again, tell you how something is going to be engineered or will tell you about the history of the issue or the challenges, and I just want to know how we get to the actual outcome. So I always say, “Give me the product. Tell me what the product is.”

Q. Is there a risk there that you focus on the end to justify the means?

A. I don’t feel that because I recognize two things. One, the means have to be looked at, and sometimes the means are not worth it. Morally or practically, they are sometimes not worth it, and you have to ask the budgetary considerations, the legal considerations, the precedent you’re setting. These are the conversations we have all day long. I also talk constantly to people about unintended consequences. I ask that question all the time too.

Q. When you’re facing a problem in terms of how to get something done, who do you call and say “What did you do, what do you suggest?”

The first place I go is to the people I work with every day and look for different perspectives within. I don’t have an outside guru. I don’t have a single go-to person. I talk to a lot of people regularly in all different sectors of the city and get feedback that way, but I don’t have one I go to to sort of solve the riddle. I think a lot of the time, it is about continuing to force new ideas onto the table. I look at the trajectory of homelessness, which I’ve been very open about, the fact that I think I made mistakes and I missed opportunities to do more and better earlier. I think some of the ideas were there if we had pushed harder to find them.

Q. Can you expand on that? Why were you slow there?

A. I think it’s a classic situation of, we were solving for one problem and missing another one. The first focus was on undoing the damage done by the elimination of the Advantage program in 2011.

Q. Giving rental vouchers to people, essentially …

A. You have to understand this was an article of faith. We had seen this massive uptick in shelter population because of the destruction of the Advantage program, that was just three years old there. And we all came in the door saying, “This is the wrong we have to right.” And we focused in that direction and got some good work done, but, I think, missed some of the other pieces of the equation: the deep concern about street homelessness, which is very understandable, and that people were seeing something different than they had seen before or at least perceived themselves to be seeing something different. I should’ve focused on that a lot earlier.

Later on, in the third year, we finally recognized the structural problems in the system that were undergirding a lot of the other problems. For decades, the way the shelter system pushed people as far away from their home as possible, rather than keeping them as close to home. And we started to unravel the pieces and make sense of them. I don’t think there was anything about that thinking we couldn’t have done earlier if we had just asked the right questions. I hold myself responsible. Now I believe after four years, I’m getting better at asking the right questions.

We have a fun lightning round here …

Oooh! We’ll see how I feel about this lightning round.

So we’re going to throw out a few words —

Word association!

We want you to say the first word that pops into your mind: bike lanes.

What is the concept here?

What’s your first reaction?

Umm … They’ve been a success.

Desnudas.

Huh?

Desnudas.

I think they’re much less of an issue now.

Black Lives Matter.

It’s been an important movement that’s had a big impact on national consciousness.

Hillary Clinton.

She should be president right now.

Horse carriages.

I still don’t like ‘em.

Equity.

It’s what we work for every day, and I think we’ve made some real progress, but a lot more to do.

Starbucks .

I appreciate they’re a progressive company. I think if someone cares about their local businesses, they should shop at their local businesses.

That was more than one word.

I’m not following your ground rules! I’m very overt about that.

Sideburns.

My homage to Robert Redford and Peter Vallone Sr.

The press.

Complex

Gracie Mansion.

Beautiful today. But I still miss Brooklyn.

Andrew Cuomo.

I look forward to finding ways to work together, even if it’s not always easy.

Preet Bharara.

I’m interested in what he’ll do in his future.

Cargo shorts.

Valuable part of anyone’s wardrobe.

The gym.

Very important to keep to your gym routine. That’s my advice to everyone.

Q. You’ve tried more than once to increase taxes on the wealthy. How important to your ultimate legacy is a tax increase?

A. I start with, again, product orientation. If we get the work done, that’s what comes first. So that’s the pre-K model. I still think the tax that we proposed was right, but if this other model is what Albany was willing to do at the given point in time, it worked. That’s all that matters for all those 70,000 kids going to pre-K. It’s academic where the money came from.

But I believe there should be higher taxes on the wealthy. I believe that as a matter of philosophy. I think it’s better for the city and the state and the country. Unfortunately, I fear we’re going to go in the opposite direction in the next couple months in Washington. So no, I don’t think it’s a legacy question. I think the question before us is, “Do we get the vision achieved one way or another?” Meanwhile, I will be always pushing for what I think are fair and higher taxes on the wealthy. I think the bigger changes in our society to address income inequality require higher taxes on the wealthy.

Q. What do you see as your role on the 2018 congressional elections and the 2020 presidential election?

A. I want to ensure that the Democratic Party moves in a more progressive direction, substantively and message-wise. And goes out and reaches people all over this country. That connects to everything I care about, everything I believe in, but it also is inherently in the interest of New York City to actually get this party back on track. So, I’m certainly going to put some energy into trying to address that situation.

Q. You got criticism in your first term for leaving the city to travel around the country and abroad. Will we be seeing more of that in a second term?

I’m focused every day on New York and every hour on New York. It’s the nature of the job. I look at what Michael Bloomberg did and here’s an area where I agree with him a lot. I think he provided some really important leadership on climate change that was not only national, it was international. On gun safety legislation, on immigration, I think mayors historically have gotten involved in some of the bigger issues that affect New York City.

When I see an opportunity to have an impact, I’m going to try and contribute any way I can.

Q. Bloomberg got praise for what you’re describing. You got criticized for similar things. Is that unfair?

A. I really don’t have anything to say on the fairness question. It’s just something I’ve become accustomed to and it really doesn’t matter in the end. It’s the work that matters.

Q. Why do you get treated differently?

A. I’m not going to speculate. It’s just the work that matters.

Q. You have struggled to win support among white voters in New York. Why is that, and how do you reach them?

A. We’ve got a lot of folks who are categorized as white working class. We have to prove to them, rightfully, that our vision will materially improve their lives and address their needs and their families’ needs.

What I’m proud of is putting policies in place that affect every kind of community. It’s true of pre-K, it’s true of after-school. It’s true of, certainly, reducing crime. And very mundane things, if you will, but very, very important to people, like repaving roads.

Q. You’ve made mental health and access to therapy and destigmatizing therapy such a central mission. Can you talk about your personal experiences with that?

A. Mine personally were very brief — a few sessions some time in the 1980s, I think it was. And I had a favorable experience but not enough to continue it.

Q. Did anything prompt it?

A. I think a bad breakup was part of it, but I don’t remember a whole lot of the specifics.

Q. What musical concert do you most regret missing?

A. I didn’t go to the Bob Marley and the Wailers show twice in my life, and I’ve regretted it every day since. The first couple weeks I was at N.Y.U. in 1979 they played Madison Square Garden, and it turned out to be one of his very last shows. I thought of going, I just didn’t get around to it, and then we heard he had cancer like a few weeks later. And then he was at Harvard Stadium with a whole bunch of other bands. Like some really big, massive festival kind of thing for some cause when I was in high school. And I almost went and didn’t go. So that’s like a massive life regret.

For every Puerto Rico, St. John, St. Martin, Dominica and other islands ravaged by hurricanes this year, operators said, there’s an Aruba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and other Caribbean spots ready and open for business.

But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.

That would be me.

I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year’s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer’s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.

Through a cousin in Texas I found out about another cousin who lives near El Yunque National Forest in the northeast of Puerto Rico. Through another cousin in San Juan I learned about other relatives scattered in both urban and rural areas around the island. All my loved ones were safe, though in survival mode.

My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.

What was left of “El Yunque,” known for its waterfalls and endangered parrots, I wondered? I later learned that the 28,000-acre treasure, El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system and a major driver of the island’s tourism, was obliterated.

What about the restaurants and kiosks nearby along Luquillo Beach — Jibaro’s, Terruño, La Parrilla — always good for fritters like alcapurrias, home cooking and music after a day in the sun? Was Old San Juan still recognizable? Did the ice cream place with the long lines for the freshly made waffle cones, Mantecaditos Los Chicos, survive in Culebra, the Puerto Rican island municipality to the east? What was the damage to the delicate bioluminescent bay in Vieques, another island municipality?

What did Hurricane Maria not annihilate? How long would it take for it all to come back?

Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.

She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquerón, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition — they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.

Photo

“If worst comes to worst we go a month later,” she said.

Restored power was a big “if,” though. By early November, more than a month after the hurricane hit, the power company was generating less than 40 percent of electricity, government figures showed. Close to 20 percent of the island was without running water and about a third without telecommunication services.

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the White House to rebuild the power system, has warned that total power restoration could take nearly a year, partly because of the challenge of getting supplies like utility poles quickly to an island.

Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.

“Power lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,” Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.

Both governors in the American Caribbean — Puerto Rico with a population of 3.4 million, and the United States Virgin Islands, with about 110,000 residents — have optimistically said that nearly all power should be back by Christmas because of a ramp-up in restoration work.

In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.

Photo

But while cruise ship traffic has been rebounding, top hotels in Puerto Rico like El San Juan Hotel and Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, shut down because of damages and many of those that remained open with the help of generators were housing workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.

In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.

“We lost the last quarter of the year,” said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.

It is true that tourism-dependent islands have been able to recover quickly after hurricanes, even if visitors have to look at topless palm trees. When I reported from St. Thomas, St. Martin (divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten) and Antigua less than two months after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995, I found varying degrees of progress, but much of the tourist industry was ready for visitors and some tourists were trickling back.

Photo

But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.

José Izquierdo, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, said that such impact has led the agency to appeal to new types of travelers. One local tour operator that the agency has partnered up with, Local Guest, planned to take volunteers to mountainous regions where brigades of about 15 people each could plant crops of coffee and root vegetables, rebuild bridges and homes and help in other recovery efforts.

Some travel companies, like Global Works Travel, are signing up high school students to visit in 2018 and combine community service with a vacation.

Mr. Izquierdo said that he also expected more Puerto Ricans to visit from the mainland, perhaps those who had not visited in several years and were anxious to reunite with relatives on the island after the disaster. The local newspapers have noted the influx and I personally know friends who headed for the island as soon as flights became available to bring supplies and money and to check up on relatives. (By the same token, others were hosting Puerto Rican friends and relatives escaping the hardships of the island temporarily in New York and New Jersey.)

“A hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,” Mr. Izquierdo said. “The diaspora now takes a greater prominence.”

Within days of the hurricanes, volunteers started showing up in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where the organization All Hands Volunteers set up operations in the gym at the Kingdom Life International Christian Center in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.

The disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.

“Anyone can help,” he said. “There’s a need for people to carry things. There’s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.”

One volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as “lush, green and beautiful.” A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.

“Seeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,” said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. “This is something that I should be doing.”

Regular visitors to the Virgin Islands like Joanne Barker, a resident of Washington who last went to St. John in January, have found ways to send care packages directly to those in need. Ms. Barker said she was shopping in October to fill up boxes with items like baby powder milk formula and diapers after being paired up with families through a site — Adopt a Family in USVI — that matches donors to specific people.

“At least you’re doing something,” she said. “You just feel so helpless up here.”

Tourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only “minimal” structural damage (although it lost many trees).

And, he added: “At the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn’t washed away by the hurricane. That’s stronger than ever.”

But some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies — and no public health issues.

“Given the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Richards said, “it’ll take a long time for things to get restored.”

Puerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.

My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.

She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.

“I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we’re all working and that we’re doing better than a lot of people,” she told me over the phone, “but sometimes it’s hard not to get depressed.”

American airstrikes have more than doubled since President Trump announced in August a new strategy for Afghanistan. According to the United States Air Force, American aircraft dropped about 900 munitions in August and September, compared to about 260 for the same period last year.

Afghan officials have praised the strikes, saying they have helped fend off Taliban advances and decreased the risk that militants would take over cities and districts, but others have said the civilian toll from the airstrikes is unacceptably high.

Residents of Gharaw Qishlaq, a village in the Chardara district, said heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan commandos had continued for days, and Taliban targets in the village had been struck repeatedly.

“At night, they bombed many times in our area,” said Abdul Qayoum, a tailor in the village who lost three cousins in the airstrikes. “In the morning, after prayer, people got out to see what happened. My dad went, but I didn’t go. Then we heard another strike. When I came out, I saw people carrying bodies on carts.”

Haji Mahmoud, a resident, said the Taliban forced people in the village to retrieve the bodies of militants who had been killed the night before.

“They told us, and we had to, particularly when they said we are all Muslims and we can’t leave bodies lying out there,” he said. “I saw three Taliban bodies. When the boys were trying to dig up those bodies, the plane struck again. Thirteen people were killed. I am wounded in my head and my arm.”

In a separate development in Kabul, a court sentenced seven bodyguards for the country’s vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, to eight years in prison for abducting and raping a political rival.

Ahmad Ishchi, a former governor of Mr. Dostum’s home province of Jowzjan, claimed in December that he had been abducted by the vice president and his bodyguards from a sports event, and then raped with the tip of a gun.

The case, which has tested the government’s will to hold the powerful accountable, forced Mr. Dostum to go into de facto exile in Turkey. He tried to return once, but his plane was forced to turn around.

Although Mr. Dostum has refused to answer to questions from the country’s attorney general, seven of his guards submitted to questioning.

Baktash Ishchi, the son of Mr. Ishchi, said he and his father were present in the court during the sentencing on Saturday, when the judge sentenced the bodyguards to three years in prison for abduction and illegal detention and five years for rape.

“In total, 10 people, including Dostum, are involved in this case,” said Baktash Ishchi. “Some of them, including Dostum, were not present for investigations. The attorney general’s office will decide in coming days whether to send their cases to court also if they don’t show up for questioning.”","U.S. Strikes Caused at Least 13 Civilian Casualties, Afghans Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/asia/afghanistan-kunduz-us-airstrikes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Bagwell and Biggio reached the playoffs six times together but advanced to the World Series only in their final trip, in 2005, when they were swept by the Chicago White Sox.

Astros fans get a daily reminder of that loss in the team’s television analyst, Geoff Blum, who hit a 14th-inning homer at Minute Maid Park to win Game 3 for Chicago. Blum played only 33 career games for the White Sox and 580 for the Astros. Now, at last, his viewers might forgive him for his fling with an enemy.

“Please, finally!” Blum shouted in the clubhouse celebration on Wednesday night. “Although it’s going to be weird to see those two rings side by side.”

When the Astros earned their ring in Game 7, they wore orange jerseys for the first time in the World Series. That look is not as distinctive as their famous rainbow jerseys — worn from 1975 through 1986 and on throwback nights today — but orange is a part of their identity.

In the team’s first logo, orange smoke from a pistol formed the letter C in Colts. They were 64-96 in their inaugural season — far ahead of their hapless expansion brothers, the Mets — and within a few years they had budding stars like Rusty Staub and Joe Morgan. Alas, the Astros lost most of Morgan’s prime after a trade for the slugger Lee May.

When Morgan returned as a free agent, in 1980, the Astros lost an excruciating National League Championship Series to Philadelphia despite leading the decisive finale by three runs with Nolan Ryan on the mound. Six years later, they felt the sting of another N.L.C.S. loss, this time to the Mets, again despite a three-run lead in the final game. Both heartbreakers took place at the Astrodome.

“It’s not easy to do,” said Biggio, who played two decades with the Astros through 2007. “What did we have, the third-longest drought or whatever it was for the World Series? They’re hard to get, and they’re special to get.”

The Astros chased a ring in so many different ways. They made early forays to the Dominican Republic for Cesar Cedeño, and to Venezuela for several high-impact prospects like Bobby Abreu, Freddy Garcia and Johan Santana — who mostly thrived elsewhere.

They had a habit of luring Texas-bred aces through free agency, like Ryan, Doug Drabek, Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte. They made shrewd trades for Bagwell and others, and drafted future stars like J. R. Richard, Lance Berkman and Biggio.

None of it led to a title, and by 2012, Jim Crane’s first full season as owner, the team had the worst record in the majors. George Springer was a top prospect, but Altuve and Keuchel were not highly regarded around the game. Crane revived orange as part of the Astros’ color palate when the franchise moved to the American League in 2013, but otherwise looked forward, not back.

“We came in on the 50th anniversary, so we got a lot of bang out of that,” Crane said in an interview at his office in the summer of 2012. “But really we can put our own mark on it next year. We’re going to do that. We’re going to change the uniform, we’re going to remodel the stadium a little bit, freshen it up and create some new spaces.”

Crane did not want to shift leagues, he said. But baseball required it as a condition of the sale, to even the leagues at 15 teams apiece.

Photo

“People say, ‘Are you mad about it?’” Crane said then. “Not really. If we’re going to win a World Series, we got to beat everybody.”

They have done that now, largely with an approach that leans heavily on analytics under General Manager Jeff Luhnow. On the field after Game 7, Crane explained that he had learned to value analytics after studying several franchises while trying to buy a team.

“I could see some of the stuff they were doing that we weren’t doing,” he said. “And then I said, ‘You know, to really get good, we’ve got to challenge that and go a step further.’ So we allowed Jeff to do some of those things, and we’re still doing it and hope to build the organization to an even stronger position.”

Photo

Luhnow had made his mark in the last decade by finding amateur talent for the St. Louis Cardinals, leaving a business career for an industry that still apologizes, in some corners, for relying on numbers.

After Game 7, the Astros’ pitching coach, Brent Strom, said the team had targeted Charlie Morton — the surprise winner that night — partly because of the appealing spin rate of his pitches. The Astros helped Morton become the best version of himself through data that showed he should throw more curves and four-seam fastballs, and fewer sinkers.

It was sound reasoning. Yet in the middle of his explanation, Strom added, almost reflexively, “I hate to say this.”",How the Houston Astros Finally Hit on a Formula That Worked for Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/baseball/houston-astros-world-series-formula.html

PhotoFew have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said.
A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

Skip today’s trendier imperial stouts, which are often laden with gobs of heady vanilla and coconut.
Try stouts brewed with coffee, or even better, with no frills at all.
“Avoid a beer that’s too dessert-y,” said Nicole Erny, a beer consultant and educator in the Bay Area.
“You want it to almost be like black coffee with sugar.”Styles to look for: Imperial stouts.","And don’t worry that beer will leave you feeling too full. These styles can satisfy with sips instead of gulps, and have less alcohol than wine.

Here are some general principles and a few good picks for your dinner this year.

Snacks and Appetizers

While your guests graze, start with something light and easy to drink. This is a good time for dry, grassy, European-style hops. Used judiciously in a sharp, golden lager, they whet the appetite without bowling you over with big flavors or alcohol; these tend to clock in at 4 to 5.5 percent A.B.V. (alcohol by volume).

Don’t be afraid of cans — they’re the vessel of choice for many innovative breweries, and they chill down more quickly than glass bottles.

Styles to look for: Pilsner, helles lagers, dunkel lagers and light saisons.

Brands to try: Industrial Arts Metric, Stillwater Artisanal Extra Dry, Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel.

Turkey and Sides

For the main event, stock up on big bottles (750 milliliters) in two styles, and let guests pour for themselves. This lets them try both, allowing an option without overwhelming a table already filled with attractions.

“When I think about Thanksgiving, it’s a nice dichotomy of lighter, brighter flavors and darker, earthier flavors,” said Greg Engert, the beer director and a partner at the beer-conscious Neighborhood Restaurant Group in Washington, D.C. “It’s like light meat and dark meat.” (Or, if you prefer, like white wine and red.)

On the light end, look for classic saisons, also called farmhouse ales. They have a spicelike tingle thanks to Belgian yeast, with no actual spices added. For the meal, you’ll want a beer that’s heftier than for the appetizers, in the range of 6 to 8 percent A.B.V., which will lend enough body to stand up to gravy and sweet potatoes.

On the dark end, weizenbock is your secret weapon, a beer that will pair with everything on the holiday table. It’s a cross between a hefeweizen (German wheat beer) and a doppelbock (a strong brown lager), and its caramel sweetness is braced by faint acidity from the wheat and the frothy, celebratory carbonation.

Styles to look for: Saisons, weizenbocks and Belgian dubbels.

Brands to try: Sly Fox Saison Vos, Saison Dupont, Schneider Weisse Aventinus, St. Bernardus Prior 8.

Dessert

Beer with dessert is tricky, unless you stick to the basics. Imperial stouts, rich and roasty ales that can exceed 10 percent A.B.V., are one of the few styles that have enough sweetness to match a pumpkin or pecan pie. Skip today’s trendier imperial stouts, which are often laden with gobs of heady vanilla and coconut. Try stouts brewed with coffee, or even better, with no frills at all.

“Avoid a beer that’s too dessert-y,” said Nicole Erny, a beer consultant and educator in the Bay Area. “You want it to almost be like black coffee with sugar.”

Styles to look for: Imperial stouts.

Brands to try: Grimm Double Negative, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, Evil Twin Even More Jesus, Dieu du Ciel Péché Mortel.

Serving Tips

Banish all hand-wringing over glassware. The appeal of specialized beer glasses is largely aesthetic; short of a champagne flute, there’s scarcely a vessel that will make for a bad sip. Wineglasses are a nice choice because their small size invites guests to taste different beers, even switching between beer and wine if you’re serving both.

The ideal serving temperature for the beers mentioned here is around 45 to 55 degrees. If you pull them from the refrigerator when the turkey comes out the of the oven, they’re safe to keep tableside the rest of the night.

When you shop, as with any beer, buy only at stores that keep their inventory refrigerated. The styles listed here are slow sellers, so if the beer has been sitting around for a few months, make sure it’s been kept properly.

Any such switch would create a special complication for Connecticut since the northern part of the state is closely tied to Massachusetts, while many residents of the southern section commute to New York City.

The most frequently cited argument against a change is its effect on schoolchildren, who would most likely board buses in the dark on winter mornings. Proponents counter that the whole state of Maine, as well as communities including Boston, are considering pushing school start times back, too.

Plus, opponents say, such a change could create confusion for businesses and chaos for passengers taking Amtrak trains from New York to Boston and trying to figure out what time it is. Broadcast schedules — and with them, teams like the Patriots and the Bruins — could be affected as well.

“Once you start toying with the clocks, there are repercussions that people don’t bear in mind,” said Michael Downing, the author of “Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time.”

Time was kept locally in the United States until 1883, when railroad companies established the time zones. Daylight saving time began in Europe during World War I as an effort to save energy. It was adopted by the United States in 1918 but repealed the following year after strident objections from farmers, who preferred having more light in the morning, not in the evening.

But more cosmopolitan and some Eastern areas, like New York City and the state of Massachusetts, decided to keep it, opening up an inconsistent approach to timekeeping until Congress split the difference in 1966 and set the rule as six months of standard time and six months of daylight saving time. It is now observed between the middle of March and the beginning of November — except in Arizona and Hawaii, which have opted out.

If nothing else, the bills have sparked renewed rumination on time and light here in New England, and many people have their reasons for considering a change.

“Definitely it would mean a longer day of business,” said Lynn Archer, a chef who owns two restaurants in Rockland, Me., and groaned the other day as the harbor there glowed pink during an early evening sunset.

But the idea has left others — including the editorial board of The Bangor Daily News — aghast, saying it would isolate the state and hurt business. Plus, many Mainers are used to things as they are.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

“The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said.

At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers.

Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements.

“When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.”

Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car.

“More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens.

Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches.

They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot.

“Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei.

Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is.

“That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said.

Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000.

Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet.

“Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.”

Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.

That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair.

“You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.”

And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.”

The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles.

“We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said.

For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression.

“You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings. Wheels make a car that much more emotionally appealing.”","Wheels Drive Auto Industry Forward, in Showrooms and Aftermarket Shops",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/automobiles/wheels/wheels-rims-aftermarket.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be. This city’s theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places. Consider some of the new productions opening this month.

Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America. And, oh yes, space — as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.

The Band’s Visit

Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel. But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies. A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact — including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.

Perhaps the ultimate “escape from New York” fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress. City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location. Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of “An American in Paris,” and the cast includes Kelli O’Hara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too). Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of “Brigadoon” will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

For every Puerto Rico, St. John, St. Martin, Dominica and other islands ravaged by hurricanes this year, operators said, there’s an Aruba, St. Lucia, Jamaica and other Caribbean spots ready and open for business.

But many loyal visitors, especially those with relatives, friends and property in the affected areas, say they are still planning to travel to their getaways, eager to somehow help out, if only by injecting tourist dollars into battered economies.

That would be me.

I have lived in several states for more than 40 years but was born and raised in San Juan and visit every New Year’s Eve with my husband, Jim. In the agonizing first weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, I learned about the fate of my sister and extended family, including a cousin with Alzheimer’s living in a home for the elderly, at an excruciatingly slow pace and only through sporadic emails, texts, Facebook postings and snippets of phone conversations before the calls dropped. It was hard to sleep at night.

Through a cousin in Texas I found out about another cousin who lives near El Yunque National Forest in the northeast of Puerto Rico. Through another cousin in San Juan I learned about other relatives scattered in both urban and rural areas around the island. All my loved ones were safe, though in survival mode.

Photo

My attention turned then to the touchstones and places that give Puerto Rico its beauty and culture and that I now realize I have taken for granted all my life.

What was left of “El Yunque,” known for its waterfalls and endangered parrots, I wondered? I later learned that the 28,000-acre treasure, El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system and a major driver of the island’s tourism, was obliterated.

What about the restaurants and kiosks nearby along Luquillo Beach — Jibaro’s, Terruño, La Parrilla — always good for fritters like alcapurrias, home cooking and music after a day in the sun? Was Old San Juan still recognizable? Did the ice cream place with the long lines for the freshly made waffle cones, Mantecaditos Los Chicos, survive in Culebra, the Puerto Rican island municipality to the east? What was the damage to the delicate bioluminescent bay in Vieques, another island municipality?

What did Hurricane Maria not annihilate? How long would it take for it all to come back?

Ms. Westerman, who eventually confirmed the well-being of both her neighbors and condo and who has been mailing checks to some friends to help them cope, said she planned to see for herself.

She and her husband were planning to go back this year for their usual December to mid-April stay in Boquerón, a beach village in the town of Cabo Rojo on the southwestern tip of the island, with one condition — they will not fly down until the electricity is back on.

Photo

“If worst comes to worst we go a month later,” she said.

Restored power was a big “if,” though. By early November, more than a month after the hurricane hit, the power company was generating less than 40 percent of electricity, government figures showed. Close to 20 percent of the island was without running water and about a third without telecommunication services.

The Army Corps of Engineers, charged by the White House to rebuild the power system, has warned that total power restoration could take nearly a year, partly because of the challenge of getting supplies like utility poles quickly to an island.

Neighboring St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands had not fared much better.

“Power lines are strewn across our roads; utility poles snapped in half like matchsticks; boats lie sunken in the harbors; many thousands of our homes stand heavily damaged or destroyed and some of our major road systems are impassable,” Gov. Kenneth E. Mapp of the United States Virgin Islands wrote in an Oct. 12 letter to Congress, estimating that rebuilding would cost $5.5 billion.

Both governors in the American Caribbean — Puerto Rico with a population of 3.4 million, and the United States Virgin Islands, with about 110,000 residents — have optimistically said that nearly all power should be back by Christmas because of a ramp-up in restoration work.

In the meantime, tourism officials, hoteliers and others in the service industry were scrambling to get hotels, beaches and tourist attractions back on their feet to salvage at least part of their peak tourist season, a crucial economic engine that runs from mid-November to April 1.

But while cruise ship traffic has been rebounding, top hotels in Puerto Rico like El San Juan Hotel and Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, shut down because of damages and many of those that remained open with the help of generators were housing workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials have warned against bathing in beaches, rivers and streams because of possible raw sewage discharges as a result of hurricane damage to treatment plants.

In St. Thomas and St. John, major hotels have closed for 6 to 18 months and officials expected a significant decline in overnight visitors.

“We lost the last quarter of the year,” said Beverly Nicholson Doty, commissioner of tourism for the United States Virgin Islands.

It is true that tourism-dependent islands have been able to recover quickly after hurricanes, even if visitors have to look at topless palm trees. When I reported from St. Thomas, St. Martin (divided into French St. Martin and Dutch St. Maarten) and Antigua less than two months after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn in 1995, I found varying degrees of progress, but much of the tourist industry was ready for visitors and some tourists were trickling back.

Photo

But tourism officials in the American Caribbean acknowledged that Irma, which made landfall in the Virgin Islands on Sept. 6 as a Category 5 hurricane, and Maria, which hit Puerto Rico barely short of that magnitude as a Category 4, were like no other hurricanes in recent history because of their power and overwhelming reach. In Puerto Rico, hardly a corner of the island was spared its destruction, officials said.

José Izquierdo, executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, said that such impact has led the agency to appeal to new types of travelers. One local tour operator that the agency has partnered up with, Local Guest, planned to take volunteers to mountainous regions where brigades of about 15 people each could plant crops of coffee and root vegetables, rebuild bridges and homes and help in other recovery efforts.

Some travel companies, like Global Works Travel, are signing up high school students to visit in 2018 and combine community service with a vacation.

Mr. Izquierdo said that he also expected more Puerto Ricans to visit from the mainland, perhaps those who had not visited in several years and were anxious to reunite with relatives on the island after the disaster. The local newspapers have noted the influx and I personally know friends who headed for the island as soon as flights became available to bring supplies and money and to check up on relatives. (By the same token, others were hosting Puerto Rican friends and relatives escaping the hardships of the island temporarily in New York and New Jersey.)

“A hurricane like this changes the profile of tourists,” Mr. Izquierdo said. “The diaspora now takes a greater prominence.”

Within days of the hurricanes, volunteers started showing up in St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands, where the organization All Hands Volunteers set up operations in the gym at the Kingdom Life International Christian Center in the capital city of Charlotte Amalie.

The disaster relief group, based in Massachusetts, had received more than 1,600 applications by the end of October but can accommodate only about 70 volunteers at any given time in spartan quarters. People can come for as long as they want to work in cleanup, mold remediation, building temporary classrooms and permanent reconstruction, among other efforts.

Erik Dyson, All Hands executive director and chief executive, said the organization planned to extend its work to Puerto Rico by early 2018.

“Anyone can help,” he said. “There’s a need for people to carry things. There’s a lot of not highly skilled jobs.”

One volunteer who arrived in early November, Sid Sharma, 48, of Allen, Tex., spent his honeymoon 26 years ago in St. Thomas, which he remembered as “lush, green and beautiful.” A general contractor who does residential remodeling, he committed to three weeks of volunteer work.

“Seeing the devastation on the news, I just had a little time on my hands and a push from my heart,” said Mr. Sharma, who is still married and the father of two children. “This is something that I should be doing.”

Regular visitors to the Virgin Islands like Joanne Barker, a resident of Washington who last went to St. John in January, have found ways to send care packages directly to those in need. Ms. Barker said she was shopping in October to fill up boxes with items like baby powder milk formula and diapers after being paired up with families through a site — Adopt a Family in USVI — that matches donors to specific people.

“At least you’re doing something,” she said. “You just feel so helpless up here.”

Tourism officials say they have not totally given up on leisure travelers. Mr. Izquierdo noted that big attractions like Old San Juan suffered only “minimal” structural damage (although it lost many trees).

And, he added: “At the core of every successful tourism destination is the quality of the people and hospitality, and that wasn’t washed away by the hurricane. That’s stronger than ever.”

But some in the tourism industry warned that a minimum level of services is required to lure travelers back. Jack Richards, president and chief executive of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which books trips for 23 countries in the Caribbean, said that the destination must have electricity, phone service, internet, clean water and medical supplies — and no public health issues.

Photo

“Given the level of devastation in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Richards said, “it’ll take a long time for things to get restored.”

Puerto Rico residents like my younger sister, Mari Navarro, and two nephews were still living day to day in a kind of surreal, stressed-out world as November approached. Our family home in San Juan, not far from the airport, suffered only minor damages except for the landscaping, which was gone. But without electricity Mari was cooking on a small gas stove, washing clothes and towels by hand and using flashlights to see at night.

My sister had prepared well for Hurricane Maria, but supplies were running low and she asked me to send D batteries for flashlights and a battery-powered fan. She had to line up for food and bottled water at stores.

She was back on the job as an account executive with a health insurer but she avoided driving except to work, she told me, because most traffic lights were not working. On a recent outing, two cars in front of her had crashed into each other, setting off a panic attack.

“I’m grateful that I have a roof over my head, that we’re all working and that we’re doing better than a lot of people,” she told me over the phone, “but sometimes it’s hard not to get depressed.”

Taiwan’s armed forces, by contrast, have fallen way behind, struggling to recruit enough soldiers and sailors — and to equip those they have.

There are far easier things to do than find an international ape smuggler.

For six months I searched for illicit dealers selling gorillas, orangutans, bonobos or chimps. Thousands have been lost in an underground business that makes millions of dollars off endangered animals and caters to rich pet collectors and unscrupulous zoos. Many apes are traumatized, and even if they are eventually rescued they’re “all goofed up,” in the words of one specialist, having endured serious abuse at the hands of their captors.

I began at the source, motoring hundreds of miles upriver in a precarious, pencil-thin canoe in the Democratic Republic of Congo to an area where many bonobos have disappeared. Then I traveled to Thailand, where some of the biggest wildlife gangs operate. When I finally found an ape trafficker and had him on the phone, I stumbled over what, exactly, to say. All my instincts told me to hammer him with questions like: Where are you getting your apes from? Who are you? But my role was to observe his illicit operation firsthand, which meant not scaring him off. It was a journalistic pickle.

The trafficker introduced himself as “Tom,” clearly a fake name. He had been discovered by Daniel Stiles, a well-known wildlife researcher in Kenya and a source of mine for years. Mr. Stiles had seen Tom’s online advertisements and arranged a deal. The plan was to meet in Bangkok, where Mr. Stiles would give Tom around $15,000 for two endangered baby orangutans, enabling the Thai authorities to swoop in and arrest the smuggler. I would report the events as they unfolded, without getting involved in any exchanges or arrests.

But the plan quickly raised some journalistic questions. Mr. Stiles mentioned to Tom that he might bring a friend named Jeffrey with him to check out the orangutans.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

Photo

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

SYDNEY, Australia — Visitors to Uluru, a giant sandstone slab jutting from the central Australian desert, have for decades ignored a sign at the rock’s base that politely reads: “Please don’t climb.”

On Wednesday, the board members of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which manages the popular site also known as Ayers Rock, said they would soon stop requesting that hikers respect the landmark. Instead, they will demand it.

Beginning in 2019, climbing Uluru, which is considered sacred to the region’s indigenous Anangu people, will be banned, the board said.

“It is an extremely important place,” said Sammy Wilson, an Indigenous community representative who sits on the park’s board and is what is known as a traditional owner. Uluru, he said, is “not a theme park like Disneyland.”

Nor have most provincial governments decided on the minimum age for buyers, or where smoking marijuana will be legal. The federal government must also explain how it will deal with international drug treaties that prohibit marijuana sales.

Even the precise starting date for legal pot is a mystery.

On top of that, and perhaps counterintuitively, police forces are warning that successful inauguration of a legal system for selling marijuana will require an accompanying crackdown on the black market.

Despite all these challenges, suppliers are optimistic that legal recreational sales will be a reality by summer.

“I 100 percent think Canada will be ready,” said John Fowler, the chief executive of Supreme, which has been selling medical marijuana since 2016. “But I think the real question is: What does ‘ready’ mean?”

The answer, Mr. Fowler said, will be managing expectations in the early days.

“Canadians should not expect that on Day 1, the legal market is going to supply the billions of dollars of illegal cannabis being consumed in Canada,” he said in his windowless office at the greenhouse complex near the shore of Lake Huron where employees work in disposable suits and hairnets to avoid contaminating the multimillion-dollar crop. “That will take time, and I think that’s fine.”

Even with the uncertainty, many investors are betting there is money to be made on legal marijuana. Last month, Constellation Brands, a major wine and beer distributor in the United States, invested $245 million in Canopy Growth, the owner of several licensed medical marijuana growers in Canada.

While the commercial side is upbeat, many provincial leaders say Mr. Trudeau’s timetable of legalization by July — one of his main campaign promises — is unrealistic. Some have demanded a delay.

In a statement, Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that he and several of his counterparts believed a postponement was needed to deal with all the questions.

“Despite these concerns, the federal government has not changed its timetable,” Mr. Wall said.

Speaking with reporters last month, Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, said that his province is reluctantly working to meet the federal government’s schedule.

“That doesn’t mean I like it,” he said. “I’m going to continue to express my concerns about the rapidity of this change.”

But Bill Blair, the former police chief of Toronto and a Liberal member of Parliament tasked by Mr. Trudeau with overseeing the marijuana issue, said that the government will stick with its plan. He dismissed suggestions that the process was rushed, noting that the federal government had been discussing the issue with provinces for two years.

“I don’t minimize the complexity of the work ahead,” Mr. Blair said on Friday. “But by establishing a date for implementation, it’s focused the process.” Further delay, he added, “just facilitates vast windfalls of profit to criminal enterprises.”

Of the three provinces that have released broad outlines, the plans put forth by Ontario and Alberta, although sketchy, treat marijuana much like alcohol.

In Alberta, marijuana will be available in licensed, privately owned shops. Ontario, which has a population of 13.6 million spanning two time zones, will set up 150 government-owned stores. The buying ages will be 18 in Alberta, 19 in Ontario. (Ontario introduced legislation for its new system this past week, but many important details will come later.)

How the provinces and the federal government will divide the tax revenue is still unclear. Governments do not want a repeat of their experience with cigarettes, in which high taxes intended to discourage smoking created a large black market.

Many police forces are among the groups calling for a delay. While a new law will allow the police to use saliva tests to identify marijuana-impaired drivers, what will qualify as impairment has yet to be defined. Little equipment to conduct the tests is now in the field, and few officers have been trained in its use.

“Are we going to be ready?” asked Mario Harel, the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the head of the force in Gatineau, Quebec. “We don’t think so. We’re dealing with a lot of situations so we’re going to be doing our best to be as ready as possible.”

While some Canadians are questioning the accuracy of salvia tests, Robert Mann, a scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health who studies cannabis use, said the tests have proved valid in other countries, although he acknowledged that marijuana’s active ingredient was not as easily measured as alcohol.

His larger concern, he said, is changing public opinion about whether it is safe to drive under the influence of marijuana.

“There’s quite a common perception that you can drive safely under the influence of cannabis,” Dr. Mann said, adding that this view is based in part on now-refuted research from about 20 years ago. “It took quite a while for people’s attitudes about drinking and driving to change.”

The authorities have also faced black-market sales in stores after Mr. Trudeau’s legalization announcement. Cities and provinces have taken different approaches to the black-market shops. In Vancouver, where they are most numerous, officials try to keep control through business licenses. In other areas, particularly Quebec, the police have moved swiftly to close them down.

Mr. Trudeau’s government has repeatedly said that the stores are illegal and will not be a part of the new recreational market.

Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a licensed medical marijuana producer, said the experience of American states with legalization suggested that the stores will quickly wither away in the face of a legal alternative — provided that “there is adequate supply and adequate locations of legal products.”

Mr. Harel, the police chief, is less certain the black market will vanish anytime soon after legalization.

He anticipates that the illegal market will aggressively promote food laced with marijuana, one of many products that will not immediately be allowed under the new system. In his view, the success of the legal system will rest on swiftly and aggressively shutting down the black market.

“We figure it’s an $8 billion-a-year economy,” he said of illegal marijuana sales. Legalization, he added, will change the dynamics of the black market. “But we don’t think it will fade away.”","Ready or Not, Recreational Marijuana Use Is Coming to Canada",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/canada/canada-marijuana-legal-justin-trudeau.html

Or how about the Dodgers’ rival, the San Francisco Giants, who have been to the playoffs only four times in the past decade but won championships in three of those years? This season, the Giants finished 40 games behind the Dodgers. Their fans spent Wednesday night celebrating as if they had won the World Series, because the Dodgers did not. Sports are terrible, and baseball is the worst of all. It is designed to break your heart; this week it broke mine.

I cannot fault the adults in charge of raising me for failing to wake me up to see what might have wound up being the last Dodgers World Series championship. This wasn’t a Red Sox exorcism or a once-in-a-century Cubs triumph. It was the second time the Dodgers had won it in my lifetime; the first happened the month after I was born.

The Lakers won four championships in my first seven years on earth, and the first Olympics of my lifetime were held in my home city when I was 2. I was alive and running around with ribbons in my long blond hair and mud on my knees and elbows during the ’80s golden era of Los Angeles sports. I wasn’t old enough to appreciate any of it.

It’s very possible we are headed toward a second golden era. Besides the fact that I won’t have to endure watching the Dodgers shake hands with Donald Trump at the White House, I can find the smallest silver lining that after decades of falling short of the Fall Classic, this year’s team actually made the World Series, which is farther than they advanced when I wrote a book about the two seasons I thought they would win it all. It was no fluke. Las Vegas sports books give them the best odds to win next year.

More teams in Los Angeles mean more chances to turn Tinseltown back into Title Town. Things are certainly looking up in Lakerland. After four horrendous seasons, the Lakers finally have a front office that seems to know what it’s doing. That brain trust drafted the young point guard superstar Lonzo Ball in the first round, and his ability has so far eclipsed the baggage wrought by his stage-parent father. They might not win for a while, but the kid has made them watchable again.

The local band of ice hockey professionals, the Los Angeles Kings, have won two Stanley Cup titles since 2012, despite the fact that it has not snowed in downtown Los Angeles since 1962. The season is young, but at 10-2, they’re off to one of the best starts in the N.H.L. The Rams (5-2) moved back here from St. Louis last year, and against all odds, they are good. (The Chargers moved up from San Diego before the start of this season, but I don’t know anyone in Los Angeles who cares about them, so I can’t vouch.)

Los Angeles’s biggest selling point is its Mediterranean climate. For that reason I’ve never understood why “fair-weather fan” is used as a pejorative. I’ve been a Rams fan for a year, and I’m all in. If they win a Super Bowl at some point, I’ll drink and high-five strangers in bars. If they lose, I’ll get on with my life five minutes later. Isn’t that what fandom should be — all upside, no anguish?

Is she innocent, guilty, crazy? “Alias Grace” is less about finding the definitive truth than watching Grace feel her way to the answer that could save her.

“Alias Grace” is a story about storytelling — one character compares Grace with Scheherazade — which makes Ms. Gadon essential to its success. She is mesmerizing. She plays Grace convincingly as a timid child and a toughened inmate, and she brings both of them to Grace’s wary testimony.

The novel by Ms. Atwood (who has a bit part as “Disapproving Woman”) is a challenge to adapt visually. It’s as internal and retrospective as “Handmaid’s” is propulsive, though both protagonists are slyly defiant. The screenwriter, Sarah Polley (who adapted a story from the Canadian author Alice Munro into the film “Away from Her”), turns it into a sinuous, layered script that is constantly aware of what is being said, to whom and why.

Mary Harron (“I Shot Andy Warhol”) directs the series dynamically. In an early sequence, Grace’s meditates on the curious phrase “celebrated murderess” over quick cuts of the crime — a body tumbling to the floor, a strip of cloth tightening around a throat.

For all that, “Alias Grace” isn’t overly brutal. It’s an exquisitely woven fabric with blood staining the corners. The violence is often in the language, as when a servant woman describes a death scene — the result of an illegal abortion — as smelling like a butcher shop.

You could almost mistake the series for a nostalgic period piece, as when a bushy-bearded Zachary Levi (“Chuck”) enters as a silver-tongued peddler, or when Grace befriends Mary (Rebecca Liddiard), a feisty, politically aware servant who fatefully attracts the interest of one of her employer’s sons. (The series follows Netflix’s roughed-up “Anne With an E,” which surfaced the dark subtext of “Anne of Green Gables,” another story of 19th-century Canadian girlhood.)

The series is conscious of class — there’s a little primer on colonial Canadian populism — and of how patriarchy pits women against women, like Nancy Montgomery (Ms. Paquin), the housekeeper and jealous lover of Grace’s employer, who terrorizes the staff below her.

Above all, “Alias Grace” is about how men abuse power over women, and how that power is always present, even when the men aren’t. It’s present in something as innocuous as a wedding quilt, which Grace likens to a battle flag. A bed may seem like a place of rest, she tells Dr. Jordan, but “there are many dangerous things that need take place on a bed.”

It’s tempting to think of this series, like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” as especially timely, with today’s revelations of sexual abuse in places of power. But to say that would suggest that there have been moments when these ideas would not be timely.

That doesn’t seem to be the message of the Year of Atwood, with “Grace” and “Handmaid” standing like beacons centuries apart. Look back on the calendar, they say, and look forward. The year changes.

She was inspired by the national uproar over sexual harassment, but did not really think about joining that larger conversation. The post was intended for her family and friends, and they responded immediately. “I was feeling really loved and supported,” Ms. Kohler said in an interview.

But such is the nature of Facebook that others quickly read it as well, including an associate of Mr. Ratner’s. His attorney, Martin Singer, called before lunch. “I was totally caught off guard,” Ms. Kohler said.

Accounts of what happened next differ. Mr. Singer said that he had spoken to Ms. Kohler “in a cordial, nonthreatening tone” and that she had agreed that the post was fabricated. Ms. Kohler denied saying that, but said she had been so intimidated by the lawyer that she removed the post.

That, Mr. Ratner concluded, was not enough.

This week, even as accusations against the director alleging sexual harassment and misconduct were being published by The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times, Mr. Ratner sued Ms. Kohler for defamation. He said that her post was “entirely false, fabricated and fictional,” and that it had hurt his professional standing and caused “emotional distress.” Through a spokesman, the director declined to comment.

“I’m in a world I never thought I’d be in,” Ms. Kohler, 39, said. “If he wins, I don’t know what he thinks he’s going to get from me.”

She has high-powered help. Her attorney, Roberta Kaplan, is best known for representing Edith Windsor in the landmark 2013 Supreme Court case that forced the government to recognize same-sex marriages.

Ms. Kohler wrote in the Facebook post that the incident happened in 2004 or 2005, but now says it happened a few years later. At the time, she was doing marketing for a now-defunct start-up energy drink in Los Angeles. She said she had met Mr. Ratner at a club and had gone with him to his friend’s house.

“He forced himself on me after I said no and no and no again,” she wrote in the Facebook post, which was reviewed by The New York Times.

“There were only two people there, Brett Ratner and Melanie,” Ms. Kaplan said. “No other witnesses. One is telling the truth, and one is not. So the question is, why is Melanie going to come out with it now, other than with the goal she has — to help other women, and to make sure Brett Ratner or anyone else is unable to do this again?”

Mr. Ratner’s suit may not only be the first; it might also be something of a test case for the whole concept of pushing back in court. To the extent the suit draws attention to accusations that might have gotten little publicity without corroboration, it may backfire on the director and set a precedent that others are reluctant to emulate.

Mr. Singer explained in an interview last week, before the suit was filed, how he policed the internet on behalf of Hollywood stars.

“I have hundreds of high-profile clients,” he said. He did not name any, but they include Arnold Schwarzenegger, John Travolta, Charlie Sheen and, for a time, Bill Cosby.

“People write bad things about them all the time on social media,” Mr. Singer said. “You have to figure out when to deal with it and when not to deal with it.”

Two-thirds or three-quarters of the time, he said, he asks someone to take something down and they don’t. “I reach out, they give me the finger” he said, and “say, ‘I’m not doing anything.’”

It’s impossible to tell how many cease-and-desist or so-called demand letters are being issued now, although noses are being thumbed as readily as ever.

Yashar Ali, a contributor to HuffPost who was pursuing a sexual misconduct story, got a warning from a lawyer. The lawyer said that his client was innocent of any allegations and that the letter “may not be printed or published without my prior written consent.” Mr. Ali gleefully posted the letter on Twitter, although he blacked out the names first.

When Mr. Singer was interviewed, little had been published about Mr. Ratner, who is probably best known for the “Rush Hour” buddy cop movies. But Twitter was bubbling with anonymous secondhand allegations of unsavory behavior.

Mr. Singer dismissed such posts as beneath his attention. “Anonymous postings, that’s a problem forever. People hide themselves all the time,” he said. “There’s a lot of nut cases out there.”

That’s the fear among actors who said they had done nothing wrong but had gotten on the wrong side of a few of their fans. One actor, who was criticized on Twitter by an anonymous account for being overfriendly with female fans, responded with a tweet about bringing in lawyers. He now regrets drawing any attention.

“‘I didn’t do it’ is the exact same answer an innocent person would give as well as a guilty person,” he wrote in an email. “Nobody has time for a judge or a jury, just an accuser and an executioner.” He asked to remain anonymous because, he said, it would end his career if he publicly spoke up.

Mr. Singer said he wasn’t sure the downfall of the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had made a difference in the volume of assertions by victims.

“We were dealing with this back in the MySpace days” more than a decade ago, he said. But he added: “Do I think people may be more emboldened? Yes, they may.”

Other lawyers said that, at least for the moment, the landscape had changed significantly.

“There is less fear in making these assertions in various arenas, whether it’s through traditional media, social media or privately,” said Miles Feldman of the Los Angeles law firm Raines Feldman, which handles dozens of online defamation cases a year. “As a result, we’re seeing a serious uptick in inquiries and requests for action.”

But that is true of the victims as well, suggesting that all sorts of lawyers will be busy in the years to come.

Debra Katz, a Washington-based specialist in harassment and employment discrimination, acknowledged the appeal of taking complaints online.

“It’s a sweeter form of justice to out someone as a sexual harasser in a Facebook post than go through a lengthy, painful and expensive trial,” she said.

Turkey and Sides

For the main event, stock up on big bottles (750 milliliters) in two styles, and let guests pour for themselves. This lets them try both, allowing an option without overwhelming a table already filled with attractions.

“When I think about Thanksgiving, it’s a nice dichotomy of lighter, brighter flavors and darker, earthier flavors,” said Greg Engert, the beer director and a partner at the beer-conscious Neighborhood Restaurant Group in Washington, D.C. “It’s like light meat and dark meat.” (Or, if you prefer, like white wine and red.)

On the light end, look for classic saisons, also called farmhouse ales. They have a spicelike tingle thanks to Belgian yeast, with no actual spices added. For the meal, you’ll want a beer that’s heftier than for the appetizers, in the range of 6 to 8 percent A.B.V., which will lend enough body to stand up to gravy and sweet potatoes.

On the dark end, weizenbock is your secret weapon, a beer that will pair with everything on the holiday table. It’s a cross between a hefeweizen (German wheat beer) and a doppelbock (a strong brown lager), and its caramel sweetness is braced by faint acidity from the wheat and the frothy, celebratory carbonation.

Dessert

Beer with dessert is tricky, unless you stick to the basics. Imperial stouts, rich and roasty ales that can exceed 10 percent A.B.V., are one of the few styles that have enough sweetness to match a pumpkin or pecan pie. Skip today’s trendier imperial stouts, which are often laden with gobs of heady vanilla and coconut. Try stouts brewed with coffee, or even better, with no frills at all.

“Avoid a beer that’s too dessert-y,” said Nicole Erny, a beer consultant and educator in the Bay Area. “You want it to almost be like black coffee with sugar.”

Styles to look for: Imperial stouts.

Brands to try: Grimm Double Negative, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, Evil Twin Even More Jesus, Dieu du Ciel Péché Mortel.

Serving Tips

Banish all hand-wringing over glassware. The appeal of specialized beer glasses is largely aesthetic; short of a champagne flute, there’s scarcely a vessel that will make for a bad sip. Wineglasses are a nice choice because their small size invites guests to taste different beers, even switching between beer and wine if you’re serving both.

The ideal serving temperature for the beers mentioned here is around 45 to 55 degrees. If you pull them from the refrigerator when the turkey comes out the of the oven, they’re safe to keep tableside the rest of the night.

When you shop, as with any beer, buy only at stores that keep their inventory refrigerated. The styles listed here are slow sellers, so if the beer has been sitting around for a few months, make sure it’s been kept properly.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.","The Tire Rack has seen the benefits — its sales of aftermarket wheels have increased 25 percent since 2009, Mr. Edmonds said.

“The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said.

At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers.

Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements.

“When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.”

Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car.

“More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens.

Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches.

They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot.

“Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei.

Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is.

“That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said.

Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000.

Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet.

“Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.”

Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.

That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair.

“You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.”

And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.”

The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles.

“We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said.

For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression.

“You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings. Wheels make a car that much more emotionally appealing.”","Wheels Drive Auto Industry Forward, in Showrooms and Aftermarket Shops",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/automobiles/wheels/wheels-rims-aftermarket.html

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

In addition to their son, he is survived by a daughter, Jean Minuchin; a granddaughter; and a sister, Sara Itzigsohn.","“We are dazzled by Dr. Minuchin’s instant understanding of the deeper dynamics of every case and by his imaginative interventions,” Professor Freud wrote.

Paul L. Wachtel, of the City College of New York, called Dr. Minuchin “one of the founders of family therapy.” Discussing that branch of psychiatry in his review, also in The Times Book Review, of “Institutionalizing Madness: Families, Therapy and Society” (1989, with Joel Elizur), Professor Wachtel invoked the “no man is an island” metaphor.

“Family therapists,” he wrote, “are disciples not so much of Freud as of John Donne.”

Dr. Minuchin explored what he called psychosomatic families, finding that their common characteristics included avoidance of conflict and an ostensible civility that masked submerged anger.

A child may become anorexic as a result of rifts between her parents, he said in 1974. “So the child doesn’t fight; she doesn’t say, ‘No, I won’t,’ ” he explained. “She just doesn’t eat.”

He added: “We work with the family to get their conflicts out into the open, so that everybody can see that their problem isn’t that they have a little girl who won’t eat, but that the family is enmeshed — they are all into each other’s lives so much that the system simply can’t work. The children have no rights as children; the parents have no rights as parents.”

Dr. Minuchin said it made no sense to blame parents for their children’s psychosomatic disorders.

“There’s no perfect family; it’s a myth,” he said. “One set of circumstances might lead to an anorexic child, another to a depressive. Perfect parenting is an impossible thing, like being a perfect president or something like that. It’s trying to do good through a series of mistakes. It’s part of the human condition.

“No one,” he added, “knows how to do it right.”

Dr. Minuchin, a son of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born on Oct. 13, 1921, in San Salvador de Jujuy, Argentina, north of Buenos Aires. His father, Mauricio, owned a small store and, after it failed during the Depression, herded horses. His mother was the former Clara Tolachier.

Salvador Minuchin was inspired to help young delinquents after a high school teacher, quoting the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, described them as victims of society. He later became active in leftist protests opposing the military government’s seizure of Argentine universities and was jailed for several months.

After earning a medical degree from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, he enlisted in the Israeli Army during the 1948 war for independence.

Dr. Minuchin studied child psychiatry in the United States with Dr. Nathan Ackerman, who later established what is now the Ackerman Institute for the Family in Manhattan. He returned to Israel to treat Holocaust orphans and children displaced by wars, then came back to New York to train in psychoanalysis at the William Alanson White Institute.

He went on to work as a child psychiatrist at the Wiltwyck School for delinquent boys in the Hudson Valley, where he developed his theory of what became known as structural family therapy. He recounted his experiences with several co-authors in “Families of the Slums” (1967).

In the mid-1960s, Dr. Minuchin was the director of psychiatry at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, director of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.

He retired as the clinic’s director in 1975 and served as director emeritus and head of training until 1983. He then returned to New York to establish the Family Studies Institute (now the Minuchin Center for the Family), a nonprofit training center for therapists.

Annabelle Cantin, the head of marketing and communications at La Trinitaine, a food company in Brittany that makes buttery treats, told me that consumers and the media were only noticing now because of empty shelves in supermarkets.

“From a professional standpoint,” she said, “it has been visible for much longer.”

The Federation of Bakery Companies, another industry organization I reached out to, had even put out a statement in May, warning that “many companies will be struggling in the coming months, amidst relative indifference.”

I also recruited the help of our intern in the Paris bureau, Eloise Stark, who went to bakeries and supermarkets in Paris to see what shoppers and pastry makers had to say. One bakery told her that it had slightly increased prices, but only on the more fancy butter-based pastries, not on the sacrosanct croissant.

To get a better understanding of butter’s place in French culture and cooking, I reached out to Jean-Robert Pitte, a geographer and gastronomy specialist at the Sorbonne. He explained that France had long been divided in half, between a butter-using north and an olive oil-consuming south.

I later got confirmation from an impeccable source: my 89-year-old French grandmother, a Parisian whose family is originally from northern France but who married a southerner from the Hautes-Alpes region, where olive oil is more prominent.

“In my family, we bought groundnut oil for salads, but all the cooking was done with butter,” she said on the phone. I had reached her in the midst of her grocery shopping (she had got her hands on some butter, but not the renowned Beurre d’Isigny that she usually bought).

My grandmother also confirmed that there was something of a butter craze after the Second World War, which Professor Pitte had mentioned in our interview.

“At the beginning of the war we didn’t have ration cards yet and I had to wait in line for two hours just to get an eighth of butter,” she said, recalling how her father and uncle would travel to Normandy to get some directly from dairy farmers. “Because it was illegal, they had pockets made on the insides of their jackets and hid the butter in there.”

“So you can bet that after the war, people splurged,” she said, laughing.

Years ago, my wife introduced me to semi-salted butter, and I’ve never looked back. It’s simple and delicious when spread on a fresh baguette. Regular butter now tastes, well, boring.

Luckily, we haven’t run out ourselves. The last time I went shopping at the supermarket, there was some butter left on the shelves, right next to the margarine and other substitutes that previous shoppers had spurned.

I’m still monitoring the situation, and it is unclear how long the shortages will linger.

In July, the Food and Drug Administration took the important step of approving two final-phase clinical trials to determine whether a party drug that has long been on the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Schedule I list of banned substances could be used to treat a psychiatric condition that afflicts millions. The drug is MDMA, a psychedelic commonly known as Ecstasy, previously deemed to have “no currently accepted medical use.” The trials aim to determine whether the drug is, as earlier trials have suggested, a safe and effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, when combined with psychotherapy.

The F.D.A. approval is a beacon of hope for the roughly eight million Americans believed to suffer from PTSD, a group that includes victims of abuse, refugees and combat veterans. The shortcomings in the way we have typically treated PTSD mean that many are condemned to suffer from the condition for years, even decades, with little relief. Less than 20 percent of patients are estimated to get effective treatment through prescription psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft, which, along with psychotherapy, have been the global standard of mental health care since the 1990s.

This could change with the F.D.A.’s decision, which has given MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD the status of a potential “breakthrough therapy.” Based on promising early results, this designation permits the fast-tracking of trials in hopes of proving the drug, which has psychedelic and stimulant effects, to be safe and capable of doing what no other drug on the market can.

I consider myself living proof of the effectiveness of MDMA. A few years ago, I woke up confused and bruised, my head pounding. I had been the victim of a violent robbery. Although I remember little of the attack, the experience shattered me. In public, I kept up appearances. Behind closed doors, I was a wreck. I burst into sobbing fits for no apparent reason. Sleep, when I managed to get any, was filled with nightmares. I had PTSD.

The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military.","For instance, the 2014 assessment forecast that coastal cities would see more flooding in the coming years as sea levels rose. That’s no longer theoretical: Scientists have now documented a record number of “nuisance flooding” events during high tides. In 2014, nearly half of residents in Hampton Roads, Va., could not get out of their neighborhoods at least once because of tidal flooding.

Meanwhile, as the oceans have warmed, disruptions in United States fisheries, long predicted, are now underway. In 2012, record ocean temperatures caused lobster catches in Maine to peak a month earlier than usual — and the distribution chain was unprepared.

A focus on air quality

While much of the discussion of climate change looks at the role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in warming the planet, the draft report puts a renewed emphasis on the impacts of other atmospheric pollutants like ozone and smoke, which can cause respiratory problems and lead to premature death.

The draft notes with “high confidence” that climate change will increase ozone levels, as rising temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation affect local weather conditions. But the increases will not be uniform; by near the end of the century the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast.

The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.

Adaptation, adaptation, adaptation

Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. Unless, that is, communities take steps to prepare beforehand.

The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That’s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.

The United States military has long taken climate change seriously, both for its potential impacts on troops and infrastructure around the world and for its potential to cause political instability in other countries.

The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military. Climate change is already affecting American companies’ overseas operations and supply chains, it says, and as these impacts worsen it will take a toll on trade and the economy.

Global warming and natural disasters are also affecting development in less affluent countries. That, the draft says, puts additional burdens on the United States for humanitarian assistance and disaster aid.

It’s all tied together

The draft report suggests a different approach to assessing the effects of climate change, by considering how various impacts — on food supplies, water and electricity generation, for example — interact with each other.

“It is not possible to understand the full extent of climate-related impacts in the United States without considering these interactions,” the report says.

It gives several examples, including recent droughts in California and elsewhere that, in combination with population changes, affects demand for water and energy. The draft also cites Hurricane Sandy, five years ago, which caused cascading impacts on interconnected systems in the New York area, some of which had not been anticipated. Flooding of subway and highway tunnels, for example, made it more difficult to repair the electrical system, which suffered widespread damage.",What the Climate Report Says About the Impact of Global Warming,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/climate/climate-change-impacts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“What South Koreans fear the most is, what if Trump says something provocative, like a military option against North Korea,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “Trump is unpredictable.”

Mira Rapp-Hooper, a scholar of Asian security issues at Yale Law School, said Mr. Moon has struggled to balance his agenda with “a Trump strategy that simultaneously aggravates North Korea and threatens the alliance relationship with South Korea.”

“Usually when you are in a heightened security situation, you would expect to see an alliance pull closer,” she said. “But it is very difficult to do in a world where Trump is threatening South Korea itself.”

There have been some signs of pushback by Mr. Moon. He reached a deal with China on Tuesday to end their dispute over the deployment of an American missile defense system, agreeing not to accept additional launchers from the United States. He later said he wanted to pursue “balanced diplomacy” with Washington and Beijing, which favors talks with North Korea.

And in a speech Wednesday, Mr. Moon repeated his position that military action against the North “shall not be taken” without South Korea’s consent, undermining the credibility of Mr. Trump’s threats.

During a visit by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last week, South Korea also sought to take back operational control of its military forces in the event of a conflict, which would undo an agreement in place since the 1950s that puts its troops under United States command if fighting resumes.

Still, Mr. Moon appears to have concluded that South Korea has little choice but to stand by Mr. Trump and accept its status as the junior partner in the alliance — even though it would have the most to lose in a war.

“What we must realize, painfully, is that although this is a Korean Peninsula issue of greatest urgency for us, in reality, we have no power to resolve it,” Mr. Moon said on July 11 of the nuclear standoff. “We have no power to elicit an agreement.”

Scott Snyder, director of the program on United States-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Mr. Moon has proved to be a pragmatist.

“And any South Korean pragmatist is going to look at options for achieving South Korea’s security needs, and immediately recognize that the U.S. security guarantee is central,” he said.

Some of Mr. Moon’s supporters have accused him of betraying his principles by deferring to Mr. Trump and what they consider a reckless approach to the North. The conservative opposition, meanwhile, has seized on any deviation to accuse Mr. Moon of endangering the alliance with the United States.

But Mr. Moon’s approval ratings remain high, with many South Koreans instead faulting Mr. Trump. The administration’s hints of a preventive strike on North Korea have unnerved them as much as, if not more than, the North’s weapons tests.

Many were shocked and furious in August when Senator Lindsey Graham quoted Mr. Trump minimizing the potential for casualties in a war by saying they would occur in South Korea, not the United States.

Small groups of anti-American activists have since taken to the streets in Seoul, shouting “No Trump, No War!” and calling him a “dotard,” a derogatory word for an old person that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, used to condemn Mr. Trump after he threatened to “totally destroy” the North in September.

“South Koreans are frustrated that the United States has not allowed their country any wriggling room,” said Cho Han-bum, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification. “Trump is helping spawn anti-American sentiment here.”

Mr. Moon is also juggling concerns about the security of the coming Winter Olympics, which South Korea will host three months from now in Pyeongchang, a town about 60 miles from the border with the North.

When the South last hosted the Olympics, in 1988, North Korea attempted to disrupt the event, most notably by detonating a bomb on a Korean Air passenger jet, killing 115 people, less than a year earlier. And in 2002, as South Korea hosted the World Cup soccer tournament, the North provoked a naval skirmish that left six South Korean sailors dead and an unknown number of North Korean casualties.

There is additional anxiety because joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States are scheduled to begin during the Olympics. The North has condemned the annual drills as rehearsals for invasion, and often makes a point of responding with missile tests.

China has proposed suspending the exercises in exchange for a freeze in testing by North Korea, a proposal that both Mr. Moon’s government and the Trump administration have rejected.

When he meets with Mr. Trump, Mr. Moon is expected to discuss ways to ease tensions ahead of the Olympics. But South Korean officials said the exercises were unlikely to be scaled back or delayed, especially if North Korea continued its weapons tests.

Mr. Moon continues to argue that pressure alone will not persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear arms, and that the world must offer it carrots, including negotiations and, eventually, economic exchanges.

But he also has other political battles to fight, with youth unemployment over 9 percent and voters expecting action to end the culture of collusion between government and big business that was exposed by the impeachment of his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.

“There is so much weighing on him that I don’t think he has the political capital or ability to muster a strong coalition for sustained engagement” with North Korea, said Celeste Arrington, professor of international affairs at George Washington University. “That is currently kind of a pipe dream because the constraints are so great.”

By contrast, China’s president, Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan will host Mr. Trump next week after political victories at home. Mr. Abe recently won a commanding majority in parliamentary elections, while a Communist Party congress in Beijing elevated Mr. Xi to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong.

Mr. Abe has unequivocally supported Mr. Trump’s approach toward North Korea and argued that “dialogue will not work.”

North Korea has not conducted a missile test since Sept. 15, when it sailed an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan. It is unclear what is behind the lull, but South Korean officials hope to use it to reduce tensions — and build momentum for diplomacy during Mr. Trump’s marathon tour across Asia.

Mr. Trump plans to address South Korea’s legislature, the National Assembly — he would be the first American president to do so in nearly a quartercentury — and visit Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul and the host of Camp Humphreys, one of the largest American military bases.

The visit is intended in part to address Mr. Trump’s complaint that South Korea is not paying enough to support the American military presence.

“South Koreans hope that Mr. Trump’s visit will be an occasion to reconfirm the alliance and agree to a peaceful solution to the North Korean crisis,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “The last thing they want is for him to come here and add instability.”",South Korean Leader Boxed In as Trump Threatens North Korea,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/world/asia/south-korea-trump-nuclear.html

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Any such switch would create a special complication for Connecticut since the northern part of the state is closely tied to Massachusetts, while many residents of the southern section commute to New York City.

The most frequently cited argument against a change is its effect on schoolchildren, who would most likely board buses in the dark on winter mornings. Proponents counter that the whole state of Maine, as well as communities including Boston, are considering pushing school start times back, too.

Plus, opponents say, such a change could create confusion for businesses and chaos for passengers taking Amtrak trains from New York to Boston and trying to figure out what time it is. Broadcast schedules — and with them, teams like the Patriots and the Bruins — could be affected as well.

“Once you start toying with the clocks, there are repercussions that people don’t bear in mind,” said Michael Downing, the author of “Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time.”

Time was kept locally in the United States until 1883, when railroad companies established the time zones. Daylight saving time began in Europe during World War I as an effort to save energy. It was adopted by the United States in 1918 but repealed the following year after strident objections from farmers, who preferred having more light in the morning, not in the evening.

But more cosmopolitan and some Eastern areas, like New York City and the state of Massachusetts, decided to keep it, opening up an inconsistent approach to timekeeping until Congress split the difference in 1966 and set the rule as six months of standard time and six months of daylight saving time. It is now observed between the middle of March and the beginning of November — except in Arizona and Hawaii, which have opted out.

If nothing else, the bills have sparked renewed rumination on time and light here in New England, and many people have their reasons for considering a change.

“Definitely it would mean a longer day of business,” said Lynn Archer, a chef who owns two restaurants in Rockland, Me., and groaned the other day as the harbor there glowed pink during an early evening sunset.

But the idea has left others — including the editorial board of The Bangor Daily News — aghast, saying it would isolate the state and hurt business. Plus, many Mainers are used to things as they are.

He is the owner of DNAinfo, a local news site that covered New York City and Chicago with unparalleled skill, as well as Gothamist, a network of city-oriented websites that DNAinfo bought this year. He is also a major right-wing political donor of rather flexible morality. During the last presidential primaries, Mr. Ricketts spent millions of dollars funding ads that portrayed Donald Trump as an untrustworthy, dangerous misogynist. Once Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Ricketts spent a million dollars to support him.

One might think that such flexibility would allow Mr. Ricketts to bend but not break when faced with every plutocrat’s worst nightmare: a few dozen modestly paid employees who collectively bargain for better working conditions.

Alas, no.

Six months ago, reporters and editors at DNAinfo-Gothamist announced their intent to join the Writers Guild of America, East. This is the union that my colleagues and I at Gawker Media joined in 2015, and the union that has organized major online media companies like HuffPost, Vice Media, Slate and Thrillist in the past two years. In that short amount of time, unionized “new media” workers have won substantial raises, editorial protections and other improvements that writers at more mature companies take for granted. In defiance of the conventional wisdom that unions are outdated, this young, high-tech industry has been one of the most visible recent successes for organized labor in America.

The DNAinfo-Gothamist announcement sparked a zealous anti-union campaign: Management threatened employees by saying that Joe Ricketts might shut the whole place down if it unionized. Nevertheless, employees last week voted 25-2 in favor of unionization. And on Thursday, Mr. Ricketts abruptly shut the whole place down.

It is worth being clear about exactly what happened here, so that no one gets too smug. DNAinfo was never profitable, but Mr. Ricketts was happy to invest in it for eight years, praising its work all along. Gothamist, on the other hand, was profitable, and a fairly recent addition to the company. One week after the New York team unionized, Mr. Ricketts shut it all down. He did not try to sell the company to someone else. Instead of bargaining with 27 unionized employees in New York City, he chose to lay off 115 people across America. And, as a final thumb in the eye, he initially pulled the entire site’s archives down (they are now back up), so his newly unemployed workers lost access to their published work. Then, presumably, he went to bed in his $29 million apartment.",A Billionaire Destroyed His Newsrooms Out of Spite,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/dnainfo-gothamist-ricketts-union.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is D RIVE R ECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

It cannot force vulnerable households to buy insurance, even though they are required by law to have it. Its flood maps can’t keep up with new construction that can change an area’s flood risk.

Its records, for instance, show that a house in Spring, Tex., has been repaired 19 times, for a total of $912,732 — even though it is worth only $42,024.

And after really big floods, the program must rely on armies of subcontractors to determine payments, baffling and infuriating policyholders, like Mr. Clutter, who cannot figure out who is opposing their claims, or why.

Roy E. Wright, who has directed the flood insurance program for FEMA since June 2015, acknowledged in an interview on Friday that major changes were called for and said some were already in the works. The program’s rate-setting methods, for example, are 30 years old, he said, and new ones will be phased in over the next two years. But other changes — like cutting off coverage to homes that are repeatedly flooded — would require an act of Congress.

“The administration feels very strongly that there needs to be reform this year,” he said. “I believe strongly that we need to expand flood coverage in the United States, and the private insurers are part of that.”

The federal program was created to fill a void left after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when multiple levees failed, swamping an area bigger than West Virginia and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless. Insurers, terrified of the never-ending claims they might have to pay, started to exclude flooding from homeowners’ insurance policies. For decades, your only hope if your home was damaged in a flood was disaster relief from the government.

Policymakers thought an insurance program would be better than ad hoc bailouts. If crafted properly, it would make developers and homeowners pay for the risks they took.

When Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program in 1968, it hoped to revive the private flood-insurance market. Initially about 130 insurers gave it a shot, pooling their capital with the government. But there were clashes, and eventually the government drove out the insurers and took over most operations.

Since 1983, Washington has set the insurance rates, mapped the floodplains, written the rules and borne all of the risk. The role of private insurers has been confined to marketing policies and processing claims, as government contractors.

That worked for a few decades. But now, relentless coastal development and the increasing frequency of megastorms and billion-dollar floods have changed the calculus.

Unable to Keep Up With the Floods The National Flood Insurance Program has been in the red since 2005, when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and it suddenly had to pay out $16.3 billion in claims. $16 billion Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria National Flood Insurance Program: 14 12 Total premiums collected 10 Flood loss claims paid 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 Hurricane Katrina 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17 billion $16 National Flood Insurance Program: 14 Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Total premiums collected 12 Hurricane Katrina Flood loss claims paid 10 8 Hurricane Sandy 6 4 2 0 ’78 ’80 ’85 ’90 ’95 ’00 ’05 ’12 ’17

“Put plainly, the N.F.I.P. is not designed to handle catastrophic losses like those caused by Harvey, Irma and Maria,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a letter to members of Congress after the three huge hurricanes barreled into the United States this season.

Mr. Mulvaney called on Congress to forgive $16 billion of the program’s debt, which both houses agreed to do.

The program, however, needs more than a financial lifeline: Without major, long-term changes, it will just burn through the $16 billion in savings and be back for more.

The White House is hoping to lure companies back into the market, letting them try to turn a profit on underwriting flood policies instead of simply processing claims for the government.

One measure proposed by the Trump administration is for the government to stop writing coverage on newly built houses on floodplains, starting in 2021. New construction there is supposed to be flood-resistant, and if the government retreats, private insurers may step in. Or so the theory goes.

“The private market is anxious, willing and completely able to take everything except the severe repetitive-loss properties,” said Craig Poulton, chief executive of Poulton Associates, which underwrites American risks for Lloyd’s of London, the big international insurance marketplace.

“Severe repetitive-loss properties” is FEMA’s term for houses that are flooded again and again. There are tens of thousands of them. While they account for fewer than 1 percent of the government’s policies, they make up more than 10 percent of the insurance claims, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued FEMA to get the data.

The Trump administration has also proposed creating a new category of properties that are at extreme risk of repeat flooding and that could have their insurance cut off the next time they flooded.

That might sound harsh. Environmental groups, though, argue it’s worse to repeatedly repair doomed houses on flood-prone sites as oceans warm and sea levels rise. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that the flood-insurance program should buy such properties so the owners can move somewhere safer.

The program, however, has only limited authority to make such purchases; homeowners need to line up funding through other government agencies. As a result, such buyouts are rare.

“I have mounds and mounds of paper, and I’m still waiting,” said Olga McKissic of Louisville, Ky., who applied for a buyout in 2015 after her house flooded for the fifth time. “I want them to tear it down.”

Ms. McKissic even had her house classified as a severe repetitive-loss property, thinking FEMA would give it higher priority. But FEMA has not responded to her application. Instead, it doubled her premiums.","A Broke, and Broken, Flood Insurance Program",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/a-broke-and-broken-flood-insurance-program.html

The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.
Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Photo

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

And while Mr. Akhtar may have rejected many of the outer trappings of the Wall Street potboiler, he still hews to many of its clichés.
And for all his intelligence and focus, Mr. Akhtar seldom bucks the formula to provide answers.","With that breakout work, Mr. Akhtar showed a gift for explosive terseness, packing fraught layers of meaning into the interactions of a handful of precisely drawn characters who turned ideological stereotypes inside out and back again. His command of a wide reach within close quarters was confirmed in his equally compact “The Invisible Hand,” which managed to be both a high-stakes hostage thriller and a Shavian debate on capitalism and Islam.

“Junk” finds Mr. Akhtar filling a much bigger canvas. It has a cast of nearly two dozen (with an even greater roster of characters). And it runs two and a half hours, making it the longest of Mr. Akhtar’s plays.

But with expansion has come dilution, and a sense that characters and themes are being stretched into thin transparency. This is not to say that Mr. Akhtar seems lost in the larger space afforded by this play-by-play account of one man’s bid to become a master of the universe. On the contrary, “Junk” follows a labyrinthine, economically dense plot with remarkable briskness, efficiency and accessibility.

Still, these assets never quite erase the feeling that what we’re watching is a tale we’ve frequently been entertained and alarmed by during the past three decades. Memorable onstage variations include two British imports that flopped on Broadway: Caryl Churchill’s “Serious Money,” a dazzlingly mannered account (in rhyming couplets!) of a hostile takeover, and Lucy Prebble’s spectacularly flamboyant “Enron.”

On screen, there was pre-eminently Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street” (1987), which created a new genre of Hollywood biz flicks, with such worthy 21st-century descendants as “Margin Call,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “The Big Short.” And insider-y boardroom back stories are perennials on best-seller lists.

At their best, these works have been enlivened by piquant details that summon the quirks and ravening egos of predators in power suits. With glory-courting characters inspired not only by Mr. Milken but also by the mayor-to-be Rudolph Giuliani and the infamous stock trader Ivan Boesky, “Junk” might have easily been a parade of similarly outsized personalities in overpriced clothes with big shoulder pads.

Mr. Akhtar deliberately and honorably chose not to pursue that route. In prefatory notes in the script, he says, “The insinuation of the mid-1980s in costume and design must not be overdone.” The play is intended, he writes, as “a ritual enactment of an origin myth.”

The myth, in this case, is the culture of debt, which Mr. Akhtar posits is one in which we are still immersed. He does so without undue speechifying or instructional exposition, as he chronicles Merkin’s takeover by proxy of a third-generation Pennsylvania steel company, led by a clueless family scion (Rick Holmes).

The script is refreshingly nonjudgmental. At one point, Merkin complains about how reporters always go for “the simple story,” with a good guy and bad guy, adding, “They don’t understand how the real world works.”

Photo

Accordingly, every major character is allowed to present the viability of his or her viewpoint. Whether old-guard Protestant patriarchal types or rule-bending Jewish parvenus (who face anti-Semitic barbs now and then), none of them are unconditionally lovable or loathable.

Unfortunately, none of them are entirely convincing either. This is partly a matter of casting. Mr. Pasquale (“The Bridges of Madison County”) renders Merkin as a handsome cipher. You never sense the obsessive and infectious passion that drives him. (His code name in his insider trading deals, by the way, is Moby Dick).

As a reporter determined to strip Wall Street to its seamy underbelly, Teresa Avia Lim never conveys anything like rabid ambition. In contrast, Michael Siberry, who plays her white-shoed love interest, is a blustery, sputtering figure, a persona that feels out of sync with the old-order propriety he is meant to embody.

In supporting roles, Matthew Saldivar (as a crafty lawyer), Matthew Rauch (as a crude tyro on the rise) and Joey Slotnick (as the Boesky stand-in) at least have expressive physical presences. But no one emerges as a fully defined individual.

And while Mr. Akhtar may have rejected many of the outer trappings of the Wall Street potboiler, he still hews to many of its clichés. That includes a woman being brought to orgasm by the idea of her decrepit lover’s financial power, and the antihero Merkin solemnly lying to his wife (Miriam Silverman) in the manner of Michael Corleone.

And while the script offers some amusing lessons in shading language with hopeful sounding words to pitch a deal, Mr. Akhtar’s dialogue lacks its usual original snap. “When did money become the thing — the only thing?” Ms. Lim’s character asks in the opening monologue.

It’s an ever-intriguing question, but you’ve heard it before. And for all his intelligence and focus, Mr. Akhtar seldom bucks the formula to provide answers.

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

She could have used that opportunity to signal a new direction, breaking with the tarnished culture and bringing in fresh faces.

Rumors swept Westminster that she might appoint the first woman as defense secretary. People I spoke to were hopeful that she might pick one of the party’s talented female, black or Asian rising stars in Parliament.

Instead, in an astounding display of political deafness, Mrs. May went for the appointment that made her feel safest, moving her chief whip and one of her closest confidants, Gavin Williamson, into the job. His deputy, another white man, moved up to take his place.

The response from much of the younger section of the party has been fury. Mr. Williamson, though only 41, is known for his ties to the old guard. He was immediately described by two members of Parliament (though anonymously) as a “snake” or a “parasite.” This, after all, is the man whose job it has been to know exactly what his party members’ sexual transgressions are and to use them as weapons to ensure political loyalty, rather than deciding that some of them merit action by the party or the police. Mr. Williamson is at the heart of the old Conservative culture, not a representation of the new.

The problem for Mrs. May is that almost overnight, the previously moderate, quiescent center of the party has been galvanized. Until now they, unlike the hard-line Brexiteers, have followed a policy of declining to make trouble for the prime minister, recognizing how tough the task ahead of her is and giving her the benefit of the doubt. “Not anymore,” one said to me grimly.

These Tories are seriously afraid that unless something changes, they could be heading for electoral and economic disaster with a combination of a chaotic, ill-planned Brexit and the appearance of complacent and entitled nastiness. They know that Mrs. May, a principled woman, is personally blameless and embarrassed by the atmosphere of sexual scandal. But they have lost faith in her ability to control her party or her cabinet, and by her evident timidity when faced by Boris Johnson, her scheming, ambitious, incompetent foreign secretary.

Conservative members of Parliament fear that this void at the top of their party will have political consequences. Mrs. May has a tiny working majority in Parliament, and to prepare for Brexit she has to spend the next months passing immensely complex legislation transferring four decades of European rules into British law. She needs every vote she can get.

Now many of these moderate members of Parliament, distrusting her judgment, are saying that they are going to insist on amendments that would create a softer Brexit, retaining closer links with Europe, rather than the hard Brexit that the party’s Euroskeptics have been driving Mrs. May toward. (Whether they stand by these threats once temperatures cool remains to be seen.) “There are at least 150 of us,” one Conservative said. “And now we’re going to have a voice.”

But there is a limit to this threatened rebellion. No one yet wants to see Mrs. May out of power for the same reason that has kept her there since she failed to win the election: Every faction fears that whoever replaces her may be worse.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Among individual solvers, Japan’s Ken Endo was first, scoring 7,655 points, far ahead of Germany’s Ulrich Voigt (previous 11-time W.P.C. champion), in second place, with 6,782; and Kota Morinishi, also of Japan, in third, with 6,724. Each puzzle was worth 5 to 250 points depending on difficulty.

But it is an outrageously unfair provision and, incredibly, in a bill being advertised as major tax reform, it survives.

On Morning Joe Friday, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Representative Mark Meadows, insisted that the provision would be added later, as the bill moves through Congress. If that’s true, why wasn’t it in a 429-page bill that includes many trivial provisions, like imposing a small tax on large university endowments?

For his part, the next guest, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Kevin Brady, claimed that doubling the one year holding period for investments by users of the loophole would restore fairness. At least that’s what Mr. Brady said. But after scouring the bill, I could find no provision that remotely resembled what he said.

Even if his statement was true, it wouldn’t negate much of the advantage of the carried interest provision. Private equity investors, real estate developers and even hedge fund managers typically hold their investments for well over two years. That means they would still get the benefit of paying 23.8 percent on this income while high-income Americans earning over $1 million per year would still pay 39.6 percent.

The Lost Children of Tuam

6. I was adopted at the age of two and a half from St Patrick’s on the Navan Road, Dublin. I found my birth mother in 1983. It was a difficult reunion. I was unable to continue the relationship because she was not able to acknowledge me to her family. She died in 1996, the year the information about the baby and mother’s homes were being more widely reported as was the existence of the Magdalen Laundries.

I felt the collective trauma again reading about Tuam and felt a cosmic wave realizing how deeply entrenched the stigma really was toward unwed mothers and their children.

I am saddened I did not have this clarity when I spoke with my birth mother. It would have increased my understanding of her pain and externally imposed sense of shame.

There are tools that can help. Mr. Campagna organizes projects on Google Drive spreadsheets that he shares with his wife. Smartphone apps like HomeZada and BrightNest can also help you keep tabs on a to-do list that never ends.

Still, you need to know what to do — from the roof down to the basement, and out to the backyard. Here is how to get started.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

CHECK THE EXTERIOR

Start by giving the outside of your house a checkup. Walk around the perimeter and look for cracks in the siding or peeling paint. Are the windowsills in good condition? Check the roof for missing or broken tiles. Fix problems while the days are still relatively warm. After a rainstorm, walk around the house and look for any signs that water might not be draining properly, like pooling water or damaged gutters or downspouts.

“The objective is to get as much of the water away from your house as possible,” said Scott Johnson, the director of operations for WIN Home Inspection, a network of more than 190 home inspection firms in 33 states.

THE GUTTERS

Of all the fall chores, cleaning the gutters and downspouts is among the most critical. Your gutters direct water away from your roof and siding, and down into the drainage system. Clogged gutters can cause your roof to leak and lead to ice dams in cold weather. So clean them or hire someone to do the job after the leaves fall. “When the gutters aren’t kept clean, the moisture just sits on the rooftop,” said Dina Dwyer-Owens, a co-chair of the board of directors of the Dwyer Group, a parent company of home-repair franchises including Mr. Handyman and Mr. Rooter.

Just don’t do the work too soon. Clean the gutters before the last of the leaves fall, and you could find yourself back up on that ladder a few weeks later. “I think I did it a little too early,” said Mr. Campagna of West Orange, N.J., who rushed to clean his gutters before Mrs. Campagna, 30, gave birth to their first child in October. “That was a rookie mistake.” And a wasted Saturday afternoon.

If you plan to do the work yourself, be careful on that ladder. Ladder mishaps sent nearly 176,000 people to the hospital in 2013, according to the National Safety Council. If your ladder has seen better days, consider an upgrade. (These fiberglass models are recommended by Wirecutter, the New York Times’s product review site.)

If you hire a professional, expect to spend around $150 for the job, according to HomeAdvisor.

THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

If you have window air-conditioning units, take them out and store them until next summer. But handle those unwieldy appliances with care to avoid injury.

Or you could leave them in place. Ms. Levy of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, covers the outside of her window units with an insulated sheath and wedges towels between the sill and the unit to keep drafts out.

Next, swap out screens for storm doors and windows. “It’s something that we automatically do when it starts getting cold out,” Ms. Levy said. While you’re changing out the screens for glass, check your windows and doors for drafts. Add weather stripping or caulk wherever cold air seeps in.

SMOKE ALARMS

Three out of five home-fire deaths happen in properties without working smoke alarms, according to the United States Fire Administration. So make sure yours work. Change the batteries in all your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors once a year; the day you set the clocks back is a good one to do it.

Check the manufacturing date, too, and replace any detectors that are more than 10 years old. Any reliable model will do, but if you’re interested in one that will alert you to problems when you’re away, a smart smoke alarm like the Nest Protect is sensitive to slow- and fast-burning fires, and has apps that will alert you anywhere in the world if something’s amiss.

Laundry dryers cause 2,900 home fires a year nationally and failing to clean them is the leading culprit, according to the United States Fire Administration. So call a professional once a year to service your dryer vent and help remove lint, debris and other hazards that could spark a fire.

THE CHIMNEY

Heat, smoke and dangerous gases from your fireplace and heating system travel up your chimney and out of your house, keeping the air inside breathable. A dirty chimney could affect air quality and also pose a fire hazard.

So keep your chimney clean. The Chimney Safety Institute of America recommends having it inspected annually and cleaned as needed. “In general, with chimneys and fireplaces, the more you use it, the more likely you need it to be swept,” said Mr. Johnson, of WIN Home Inspection. Expect to spend between $125 and $200 on a chimney sweep, according to Angie’s List.

THE HEATING SYSTEM

If you were going on a long road trip, you would get your car tuned up before you started your journey, not afterward. The same goes for your heating system. Call a plumber or a furnace repair company to prepare your boiler or furnace for winter before the cold weather arrives.

Your contractor should clean the equipment, make sure it is working properly and let you know if it needs any repairs. “The heating system ain’t going to break down when it’s 80 degrees out,” said Kerry O’Brien, the president of T.F. O’Brien Cooling and Heating in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “You don’t want to be stuck when it’s five degrees in the middle of the night” with a heating system that won’t turn on.

THE PIPES

No one wants a frozen pipe, so keep an eye on yours. Drain the outside water faucets and shut them off before the first freeze. On very cold nights, open cabinets beneath the sink to let warm air in and, if you are especially worried about freezing pipes, let a slow drip of water run through them. Resist the urge to turn down the thermostat to save money – you want to keep the pipes warm. Extreme weather “is not a time to start trying to save on your energy bill,” Mr. O’Brien said. “Crank your heat up during those weeks.”

PUT THE GARDEN TO BED

By November, you may not be thinking much about your hydrangeas, but they still need you. Prune your shrubs and hedges now. Cut foliage away from the house so that ice or snow on the branches won’t damage your siding or let water into your home.

But use restraint, so as not to cut off next spring’s bloom. “Try to contain yourself. Cut back half of what you want to cut back,” said Jan Johnsen, a landscape designer in Mount Kisco, N.Y.

If you have trees on your property, the battle of the leaves may feel endless, but ignore the pile on your lawn and it could mold and suffocate your grass. But before you succumb to the mighty leaf blower and start blasting away, consider a more measured approach. Rake up most of the leaves and use them as mulch for your flower beds. Mow the rest in place with your lawn mower. By mowing over the leaves, you help break them down so they can decompose and feed the grass. All that foliage “is not garbage, it’s black gold,” Ms. Johnsen said. “There’s a reason the leaves fall to the earth.”

THE PATIO

Empty ceramic pots of soil and store them in your garage or basement for the winter so they do not crack in freezing temperatures. Drain the hoses and store them, too. Shut down the sprinkler system and call the pool maintenance company to close up your pool, if you have one. But wait for a crisp sunny to day to cover patio furniture — you don’t want to trap any moisture under the tarp.

STOCK UP ON FIREWOOD

If you plan to build a fire this winter, order seasoned firewood in the fall. Stack it loosely on pallets to keep moisture at bay. Cover the pile with a plastic tarp. You can store wood in an unheated garage, but do not store more than a week’s supply in the house, as the wood could attract insects, according to Michigan State University Extension.

BRACE FOR WINTER WEATHER

If you have a snowblower, check it. You may need to have it serviced, and many local repair companies will pick up and drop off a blower as part of the service. “Start it up, run it for a couple of minutes and make sure it’s O.K.,” said Rich Janow, 74, who has lived in a six-bedroom house in South Orange, N.J., for 32 years with his wife, Nancy Chiller Janow, 64. “Do it now so that if you have a problem and you need the repair people to fix it, you have enough time before the really bad weather sets in.”

If you don’t have a snowblower, now is the best time to buy one, when it’s early in the season. (Wirecutter has some suggestions.)

If you have a portable generator, check that, too. If you don’t have one, now is a good time to consider investing in one. Update your emergency supply kit with flashlights, fresh batteries, a first-aid kit, food, water and a portable radio.

Stock up on Snow Melt and make sure your shovels are in good condition before the weatherman tells you snow is imminent. Make sure the supplies are accessible (and you remember where you put them) before the snow starts falling. Otherwise, you may find yourself digging your way to that shovel.

If the winter is a snowy one, use a roof rake to remove excess snow from your roof, and stay on the lookout for ice dams, accumulations of ice and snow along your eaves that could damage your gutters, roof and siding.

STAY ON TRACK

Learn how your house works and you may find that maintenance is something you actually – gasp — enjoy. “For me, it’s been such a great love affair,” said Judy E. Mendoza, 69, a saleswoman for Halstead who has lived in a three-bedroom house in East Hampton for 27 years and starts preparing for winter in July. “I’ve enjoyed taking care of the house, and the house has taken care of me.”

There, guided by English-speaking teachers and surrounded by toddlers babbling in loose English, I adopted the new language quickly.

Young bats may not be so different.

Wild fruit bats, living in crowded roosts, are exposed to calls from hundreds of fellow bats from birth. Most often these calls are made in response to unsolicited physical contact, and essentially amount to a crabby “move out of my way.” In a study published Wednesday in PLOS Biology, a team of Israeli researchers found that bat pups match their vocalizations to the group sounds they are immersed in, even if this “dialect” differs from that of their mothers.

Human babies and toddlers pick up the utterances around them effortlessly. The ability, called vocal learning, is considered critical for our spoken language.

But vocal learning has rarely been proven to exist in animals other than humans or songbirds, said Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University who led the study with graduate students Yosef Prat and Lindsay Azoulay.

Video

In nonhuman mammals, much of the evidence for vocal learning “comes from animals that imitate human speech or other artificial sounds,” such as a zoo elephant emulating the Korean spoken by his keepers, Mr. Prat said. What he and his colleagues wanted to know was how an animal learns the sounds of its own species.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.
In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats.
Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk.
“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.","Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the attorney general and the F.B.I. director as his personal agents rather than independent figures, lashing out at both for not protecting him from the Russia investigation.

In May, he fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who later testified that he had refused Mr. Trump’s demands that he pledge loyalty and publicly declare that the president was not personally under investigation. In July, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he would never have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.

While his lawyers have for now persuaded Mr. Trump not to publicly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the president has not ruled out firing him, a scenario that other presidents facing special prosecutors considered virtually unthinkable. Asked on Friday whether he might fire Mr. Sessions if the attorney general does not investigate Democrats, Mr. Trump left open the prospect: “I don’t know,” he said.

The president’s Twitter posts and comments drew rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who served for six years under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s comments make the job of law enforcement officials more difficult.

“Combined with his improper attempts to influence Department of Justice actions, this demonstrates that he is a president who is willing to flout those norms that protect the rule of law,” Mr. Holder said in an interview.

Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who has broken with Mr. Trump, said the Justice Department should be free of political interference.

“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” he said.

Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump’s right to exercise oversight of the country’s law enforcement agencies, saying that it would be dangerous to have an attorney general and an F.B.I. director who were not answerable to elected leaders.

“The notion that law enforcement, in particular, is somehow to be insulated from political influences and therefore inevitably insulated from political accountability is a horribly dangerous idea from the standpoint of civil liberty,” said David B. Rivkin Jr., a White House and Justice Department lawyer under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.

However, Mr. Rivkin added, “That doesn’t mean you exercise your authority to direct those things in a crude and obscene fashion. You have to exercise some politesse about it.”

Other presidents have been criticized for political intervention when they spoke out about continuing criminal cases. Peter J. Wallison, who was the White House counsel under Reagan, said his president at times spoke out on cases of interest, including the investigation of Reagan’s onetime adviser Michael K. Deaver.

“I would try to discourage him, for all the good reasons people in the White House are probably trying to discourage Trump, but it was to no avail,” Mr. Wallison said. “Trump is doing the same, except to a greater extent.”

Mr. Wallison noted that Mr. Obama at times commented on investigations, recalling statements denying wrongdoing by the Internal Revenue Service when conservative groups found their tax exemptions targeted for scrutiny. “Presidents say these things because they are human beings and have emotions,” he said. “Nevertheless, there is little evidence that public statements have any effect on outcomes.”

Before Watergate, presidents were less reluctant to intervene in law enforcement. The administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had the F.B.I. wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. President Richard M. Nixon had the bureau eavesdrop on the telephone calls of reporters.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.

In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats. He cited Tony Podesta — the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — who stepped down from his firm this week amid scrutiny of his lobbying business by Mr. Mueller. And he cited a book excerpt by Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who wrote that last year’s primaries were tilted by a fund-raising agreement that the committee made with Mrs. Clinton.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving on a 12-day trip to Asia. “I’d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats. They should be looking at Podesta and all of that dishonesty. They should be looking at a lot of things. And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mrs. Clinton “stole the Democratic Primary” from Bernie Sanders and asserted that there was “major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering.”

“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he also tweeted.

Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk. The president’s support for capital punishment for the New York terrorism suspect, Sayfullo Saipov — “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” he tweeted — could pose problems for prosecutors and help defense lawyers who could argue that their client cannot get a fair trial.

Mr. Trump also weighed in again on Friday on the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering other troops by walking away from his base in Afghanistan and getting captured by the Taliban. Mr. Trump, who last year called Sergeant Bergdahl a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed, expressed outrage when a military judge on Friday gave the sergeant a dishonorable discharge but no jail time.

“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

But Mr. Trump’s own outspokenness may have helped lead to the very result he was condemning. The judge did not explain his reasoning on Friday but last week said he would consider the president’s past comments as evidence for a lighter sentence.",‘Very Frustrated’ Trump Becomes Top Critic of Law Enforcement,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/us/politics/trump-says-justice-dept-and-fbi-must-do-what-is-right-and-investigate-democrats.html

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?","This year is the 65th anniversary of Aperture, which has shaped the conversation around photography through its magazine and books. Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

During another part of the testimony, Mr. Page was questioned about a trip to Budapest, although it was not immediately clear why. Mr. Page told The Times earlier this year that he had taken that trip around Labor Day weekend last year, but he said he had not met with any Russians.

Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was never a secret, and during the trip, he gave a speech at a graduation ceremony at the New Economic School, a university there. But the trip was one of the triggers of a counterintelligence investigation begun by the F.B.I. later that month.

In his talk at the university, Mr. Page criticized American policy toward Russia in terms that echoed the position of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change,” Mr. Page said.

His remarks accorded with Mr. Trump’s positive view of the Russian president, which had prompted speculation about what Mr. Trump saw in Mr. Putin — more commonly denounced in the United States as a ruthless, anti-Western autocrat.

Mr. Page left the Trump campaign not long after the trip, and since then, Mr. Trump’s advisers tried to distance the campaign from Mr. Page.

During another trip to Moscow, in December 2016, after Mr. Page had left the Trump campaign, he said he planned to meet with “business leaders and thought leaders.” At the time, a Kremlin spokesman said that no government officials planned to meet Mr. Page and that the Kremlin had never had any contact with him.

“We have learned about this from the press,” the spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the news agency Interfax.

A former Navy officer and Annapolis graduate, Mr. Page was unknown in Washington foreign policy circles when Mr. Trump announced him as a member of his team of advisers in March 2016.

Mr. Page lived in Moscow from 2004 to 2007 while working as a junior investment banker for Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Page subsequently started his own investment firm, Global Energy Capital, and teamed up on some deals with a Russian businessman, Sergey Yatsenko. Mr. Yatsenko had been deputy chief financial officer for the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which is majority-owned by the government and has close ties to Mr. Putin.

Mr. Page was wrapped up — but not charged — in an F.B.I. investigation in 2013 that targeted people suspected of being Russian intelligence officers in New York. One of the of three men who was later charged with being an unregistered agent of a foreign power had met Mr. Page at an energy symposium, and was recorded describing him as having dreams of lucrative deals.

Any form of carbon pricing has become taboo in Australia — particularly in Mr. Turnbull’s conservative Liberal Party — even though such a market-based approach is the most efficient, cheapest way of reducing emissions. Last week, a report from Australia’s Productivity Commission reiterated this point, declaring Australia must “adopt a proper vehicle for reducing carbon emissions that puts a single effective price on carbon.”

Instead, Australians have contorted ourselves to look like we’re responding to climate change without really doing so. We’ve paid some companies taxpayer dollars to reduce their emissions, while imposing no penalties on those who don’t. We’ve legislated a “renewable energy target,” then announced it was under review, then finally reduced it. While we reviewed, we watched investments in large-scale renewables drop an astonishing 90 percent in a year.

As a target was settled, investment recovered. But, even then, because there was no carbon price — charges for those who emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — to make investments in renewable energy more commercially attractive, energy retailers weren’t giving investors the long-term contracts they needed to get bank loans. This naturally makes investment a shorter-term affair, limiting its scope and ambition. It also means that investments in renewable energy weren’t being directly connected to the retail market.

With the lost years and disconnections between investors and retailers, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that whatever renewables investment Australia now has, it should have had more. Meanwhile, Australia hasn’t even enjoyed the short-term financial benefits of repealing the carbon tax, which was demonized for making electricity unaffordable. As a result, Australia now has the most expensive energy prices in the world, and a power supply so unreliable that summer blackouts are now a real possibility.

There are many reasons for this, including an underdeveloped renewable energy grid and coal-fired power stations on which Australia has for so long relied that are nearing the end of their operating lives.

Enter the Turnbull government’s National Energy Guarantee. Perhaps its most fundamental change is that it addresses energy retailers, rather than generators. It’s a useful idea, ensuring that energy investments have a home in the consumer market.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The policy plan makes two fundamental requirements of the retail companies that sell energy to consumers. First, retailers have to meet a quota for reliable energy — “dispatchable” energy that can be made available immediately. This seeks to minimize the chance of blackouts, which the government has argued are at least partly a function of how renewable energies like solar and wind can fluctuate with weather unless effectively stored. This may be read as a way of giving an advantage to coal, though that seems less likely as storage of renewables increases.

Second, there is a limit on the amount of emissions intensity that will require retailers to purchase “clean energy” from energy generators. It’s a proposal that manages to obey the current laws of Australian politics. There’s no carbon price, no taxes and no explicit focus on renewable energy. The reliable energy quota is deliberately agnostic on the sources of energy, thereby making it a blank political canvas. If you really believe coal is the future, the quota can accommodate that. Same if you think renewables are becoming cheaper and more reliable every year. The policy plan holds at least the potential for broad support, which is something Australia has never achieved.

But that’s only possible because, for the moment, it’s largely content-free. Just about everything depends on what the relevant reliable energy quotas will be, but no one yet knows. Will they be set low and then increased? If so, how quickly? What relationship will they bear to Australia’s commitments under the Paris climate accord? Will they shift the emissions burden to the electricity sector, or will they require other sectors to make disproportionate reductions? And precisely how severe will the penalties be for retailers that fail to meet these targets?

These are not mere policy details. They are the essence of the political differences that remain on climate change.

That this is the best we can do — indeed that this is a relative triumph for Mr. Turnbull — illustrates just how tangled Australia’s climate politics have become. The country has taken a long, hard look at every warning about the costs of delayed climate action and ignored them all. And, subsequently, it has paid for those costs through high energy prices and curtailed investment.

At last, having long understood that a carbon price would be the most efficient solution, we’ve opted for what is a fairly blunt form of regulation. It’s where nobody would have recommended we be a decade ago, and it is not ideal. But it is something. And if we can find a way to work with it, perhaps the next decade will be better than the one before.",Australia Has a Climate Change Lesson for the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/australia-climate-change.html

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon said on Saturday that he had quit his post, blaming Iran for interference in Arab affairs and surprising his country, which is already awash with tensions and regional rivalries.

Mr. Hariri, speaking in a televised address from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on his second trip there this week, issued a blistering condemnation of Iran, which has taken an increasingly assertive approach in the region, and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political party that is part of the unity cabinet he led.

“Wherever Iran is present it plants discord and destruction, attested to by its interference in the Arab countries,” Mr. Hariri said, adding that “Iran’s hands in the region will be cut off.”

Comparing the atmosphere in Lebanon to the days before his father, the former prime minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in Beirut in 2005, he said that he believed his own life was in danger. “I sensed what’s being woven discreetly to target my life,” he said.

President Michel Aoun’s press office issued a statement saying that Mr. Hariri had contacted the president by phone and informed him of his decision, and that Mr. Aoun was waiting for Mr. Hariri to return to Beirut and “inform him of the circumstances of his resignation.” Mr. Aoun will hold consultations with Parliament members to try to agree on forming a caretaker government.

Mr. Hariri became prime minister in late 2016, in a compromise deal after Mr. Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, became president, ending a two-and-a-half-year political deadlock.

His resignation left the country reeling — even Mr. Hariri’s staff was taken by surprise — and Lebanese could do little other than speculate about why he had quit.

Mr. Hariri’s political party, the Future Movement, announced it would hold solidarity demonstrations for him across the country, including in Beirut and in the northern city of Tripoli. But just before 4 p.m., the party announced it was canceling the demonstrations.

Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, cut short a trip to Egypt to return to Beirut to deal with the crisis, the Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper, reported.

Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, which has been raging for more than six years.

That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah entered the Syrian war on the side of the government, Sunni militants joined insurgents, and well over 1 million refugees flooded this tiny Mediterranean country.

But Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.

In Lebanon’s political system power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.

The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of confessional groups, many of them former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war. Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia.

In recent years the rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.

Yet in the same period, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the regional stage have only increased, with the assertive new Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, taking a more aggressive stance as Iran continued to build its influence.

Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force. Hundreds of Iranians, including dozens of generals belonging to the Revolutionary Guards Corps, have died in the conflicts.

Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.

Over the years, analysts say, Iran has filled the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military, an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.

Saudi Arabia started a war with Yemen, supported extremist Sunni groups in Syria and Iraq and tried to garner a coalition against Iran. But the war in Yemen has become a quagmire for the Saudis and the rebel groups they supported have been largely defeated.

Now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with the government of President Bashar al-Assad holding onto control over a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.

The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks, and President Trump has declared that his administration wants tougher policies on Iran and criticized the landmark nuclear deal reached with Iran under President Barack Obama.

Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront, and outrage over his death ultimately lead to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, where they had been a longstanding presence.

Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.

Mr. Hariri said in his speech that he wanted to unite Lebanon and free the country from outside interference; his bloc has long opposed the fact that Hezbollah has maintained a military force outside the control of the Lebanese government.

At the same time, Mr. Hariri’s political foes saw him as a tool of Saudi Arabia, where his father built his fortune.

Hossein Sheikholeslam , an adviser to the Iranian foreign minister, described the resignation as having been masterminded by Mr. Trump and the Saudi crown prince, according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency.

Mr. Hariri met earlier this week with Saudi Arabia’s minister for Gulf affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, who had called for the “toppling” of Hezbollah and promised “astonishing developments” in the coming days, The Associated Press reported.

Mr. Hariri then returned to Saudi Arabia on Friday, for what was billed as another series of meetings with Saudi officials.

He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be free, independent, with no authority except that of the Lebanese.”

As suits go, I prefer Italian. British cuts strangle me, physically and emotionally. American suits, in so much as there is such a thing, have a certain stolidity to them. They are designed for earnest, dull labor, and, even in a fancy fabric, tend to hang like drapery.

The Italians grasp the eroticism and power of tailored clothing. At the Brioni store, that extends to the décor, heavy on marble and wood, with ample space to gaze upon the racks as if you are on safari. What the suits here lack in imagination they make up for in touch: The fabrics are lavish, the construction immaculate, if slightly old-fashioned.

Still, there was a quietness to the energy of these suits, which felt destined for a nice enough table at the Pool in the reopened Four Seasons. They screamed wealthy executive, not wealthy executive with panache. (Surprisingly, the other clothes did better at that, particularly a burgundy moto jacket, $6,450, and a luscious baby blue turtleneck, $950.)

Which is the point, of course, but not an approach that speaks to my Isaia-loving soul. The Boglioli store was, for me, more soothing. That carpet, made of purple, yellow and gray squares, would be perfect in my apartment. The fabrics communicated vim and joy, like the icy blue overcoat that screamed loudly, though not in my size ($2,000).

A fashionable couple came in to the store when I was there, and the woman instantly gravitated to this coat, trying it on and engaging a clerk about the possibility of having it tailored. (While we’re here, it turned out there was, indeed, one black belt, in suede. It was lovely but maybe a little too delicate.)

I admired the sport coats in heavier fabrics, including a beige herringbone ($1,950). But I was most intrigued by the company’s “K” jacket — generally called deconstructed, but which my salesman referred to as “empty.” It had a cheeky, philosophical bent to it.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

Whether used as code for “low income” or “underprivileged” or as a proxy for affirmative action, the label comes with assumptions: that the student’s parents have little or no experience navigating the academic, financial and cultural barriers to higher education, including an application process that stymies even the most savvy parent. Filling out financial aid forms can be a nightmare, especially when parents don’t speak English, Ms. Weingarten said.

“First gen” may be the latest buzz phrase in higher education but its import is not just academic. Colleges have always viewed their mission as promoting social mobility, but given rising income inequality and the skills needed to get high-paying jobs, they have intensified their efforts to enroll and lift disadvantaged students.

Nearly 60 percent of admissions directors said they were likely to increase their recruiting of first-generation students this year, according to a survey by Inside Higher Education in September. Many colleges will give admissions preference to these students for overcoming obstacles, or use the status to mitigate poor test scores.

They also try to make degrees more affordable. Both Bowdoin and Trinity colleges, for example, waive application fees for first-gen students; Pitzer College has a few endowed scholarships. The University of Wisconsin just began offering free tuition for first-gen transfer students, while Duke last year created one of the most generous, comprehensive programs of all. It will select 240 first gens to attend for free all four years; they will receive a computer, books and travel between semesters at no cost.

Colleges can identify first gens on the Common Application, which asks for parents’ education history. Along with the application, the organization sends a customized summary of candidates’ attributes, including, since 2013-14, first-generation status. When this is combined with the entry that shows that the application fee was waived for financial reasons, it’s apparent who is both low income and first gen. But the Common Application definition is different from the legislative one. It’s the same as the one used by the engineering school that Ms. Weingarten called — neither parent can have a bachelor’s, even if they didn’t raise the child.

It may seem like hairsplitting. But in the frenzied competition for admission to selective schools, where counselors have seen students get their DNA tested to see if they qualify as minorities, it’s an important distinction. Several said they advise their first-gen clients to highlight their status, either in essays or interviews. When Ms. Weingarten meets new clients, one of her first questions concerns their parents’ education level. “This process is so difficult, if you have an honest advantage, you should use it,” she said.

Certainly there are affluent parents who never went to college, punching holes in the idea that first gens are by definition disadvantaged. One college counselor told of a first-gen student on the East Coast who arrived at her counseling appointment in a Porsche. She wrapped herself in the first-gen mantle, bringing it up whenever she could and was admitted to several selective schools.

Conceivably, one can be both first gen and legacy. One first-generation student in Minnesota is applying to her grandmother’s alma mater. “I definitely don’t fit the stereotype for a first-generation student,” she said. “I’m a middle-class white girl.” Her mother owns a small business and her father works as a middle manager in information technology at a Fortune 500 company.

To be sure, most first-generation students come from families with low incomes and minimal exposure to college. Only 12.5 percent of all students whose parents didn’t get a bachelor’s degree come from families with incomes exceeding $106,000, according to an analysis of federal data by Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor at Seton Hall University. Many education experts even use the terms “first gen” and “low income” interchangeably. Officials who practice “holistic” admissions — examining family background, recommendations and essays in addition to grades and test scores — say they can figure out who is truly disadvantaged by looking at how candidates overcome obstacles, whatever those may be.

How much first-gen status really matters for college admissions is unclear. At Harvard, it’s “one of 50 factors” under consideration, said William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. “This is not a mechanical process.” Some counselors view it as a “tipping factor” for students who are tied with others in the admissions pool; others insist that it is much more important.

“It’s something that colleges love to brag about,” said Brian Taylor, managing director of Ivy Coach, a New York counseling company, noting that many colleges list their first-gen statistics in their brochures.

Many students turn to online communities like College Confidential and Reddit to question whether they fit the definition. One student, raised by his stepfather, wondered if he’d be disqualified because his biological father had a degree; another student worried about her mother’s online education from Kaplan University. A lively discussion followed a post by a student applying to Columbia who wanted to omit degrees her parents earned abroad.

Colleges don’t typically check information. But consultants urge their clients not to lie. Cyndy McDonald, a consultant in Visalia, Calif., encourages students to write essays about their first-generation backgrounds, even if they don’t meet a college’s definition.

“These students have unique experiences,” she said. “They don’t have the legacy card to drop.”

The most disadvantaged students don’t usually write essays about those experiences, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. They may think their backgrounds would be held against them or they may not even have heard of the first-gen label. Some assume they don’t qualify because they have siblings who have gone to college.

Anthony A. Jack, a Harvard education professor who researches the experiences of lower-income students, said a student once asked if he could join a support group even though his father had a master’s degree. The boy had been raised by extended family who had not gone to college, and the father, who had an arrest record, had not been part of his son’s life. “That’s not a parental influence,” Dr. Jack said.

Some support groups and scholarship organizations define the term broadly to be more inclusive. To underscore economic issues, the University of Pennsylvania has created an F.G.L.I. program for “first-generation and/or low-income students.” Brown opened its First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center last year.

Some public policy experts believe the definition should be narrowed for admissions and financial aid. Tomiko Brown-Nagin, a Harvard law professor, argues that only those most in need should receive special admissions considerations. She wants both parental education and income taken into account, limiting the definition to those whose parents never attended college and are eligible for Pell grants. That means an income below $50,000. “Universities must attack disadvantage at its roots,” she wrote in a University of Chicago Law Review article.

The Institute for Higher Education Policy last year released a report, financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, similarly calling for the definition to be narrowed so that students whose parents had an associate degree could no longer be counted as first gen.

The institute’s analysis of education statistics helps explain its reasoning. If students who attended a four-year college had parents with no education after high school, only 50 percent graduated within six years. If at least one parent had some college but no degree, the graduation rate was 57 percent. But if at least one parent had an associate degree or higher, the rate jumped to 72 percent.

Dr. Jack, who is serving on an American Sociological Association task force to tackle the issue, says he wants to focus on how people use the term. It evokes images of a Horatio Alger character striving for success, he said, which is far better than language that stigmatizes students for being at risk. For some people, “this is affirmative action that won’t ruffle any feathers. It’s more palatable.” But, he said, supporting first-generation students is no substitute for admissions that considers race.

To figure out what first generation really means, he said, it’s important to step back and examine the goals of higher education. “What,” he asked, “are we trying to do with the definition?”",Are You First Gen?

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

Everything is political in the Bay Area, but housing most of all.

Some restrictions make sense: Nobody wants skyscrapers poking up among Victorian houses, and nobody wants to tear down historical buildings. But many others don’t: There are scores of empty parking lots in San Francisco and Oakland that can’t be built on because of political opposition.

The lack of supply means rents and housing values increase faster than necessary. For homeowners, this is a boon, as their assets keep appreciating. For renters, this means an ever-increasing cost of living and for some, an impetus to pack up and leave.

One way to think about it is that the enormous increase in wealth generated by the tech boom is largely captured by homeowners in the urban core who bought before the boom. By fighting new market-rate housing, Nimbys and Bay Area progressives are de facto making the housing shortage worse. Ironically, given residents typically progressive political leanings, this has regressive consequences, because it helps rich insiders at the expense of everyone else.

The second negative consequence of the region’s restrictive housing policies in the urban core is environmental degradation on the periphery. Good environmental stewardship suggests that we should build more in the urban core near transit and jobs and less on the fringes. Yet because of cities’ strict housing regulations, we build more on farmland on the region’s outskirts and less in the city center where demand is higher.

Families who can’t afford San Francisco, Berkeley or Silicon Valley have to move to exurbs. Some 3,800 Californians leave urban parts of the Bay Area for cheaper housing in Sonoma and Napa Counties every year. This worsens traffic and heightens the pressure for development on the edge of the region — in places such as Santa Rosa, home to some of the neighborhoods hardest hit by this month’s fires.

This extracts enormous environmental costs. Bay Area urban progressives, by fighting new housing in their neighborhoods, cause more sprawl on the rural fringes. I’m a committed environmentalist, and it made me rethink the way I engage with such issues: For example, I was a member of the Sierra Club for a more than a decade. But because of all the unwise battles waged by the San Francisco chapter against smart housing growth in the city, I quit to support other environmental groups.

Just like fires, bad housing policies can carry horrendous social and environmental costs. As the smoke from the Northern California fires clears, our urban communities should follow the examples of other progressive cities, and embrace smart growth.

For this to happen, local urban progressives must moderate their reflexive opposition to all new market-based housing. The main winners will be the region’s most vulnerable: urban renters as well as the land and inhabitants of areas incinerated by the recent infernos.",Fires Aren’t the Only Threat to the California Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/california-fires-housing.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

(Many middle-class families could also see tax savings under the plan.)

“There is a difference between directing institutions to make sure they’re using their resources toward their stated mission — missions of education, missions of access — versus directing institutions toward filling gaps in Washington, and this seems to be the latter,” Sean Decatur, president of Kenyon College, said Friday.

Supporters of the proposed tax said it was an acknowledgment that universities increasingly were being run like businesses, with tuition continuing to rise and administrative ranks growing, especially at the wealthiest institutions.

Representative Tom Reed, a New York Republican whose district includes Cornell University, supports the proposed tax, though his main wish is to force schools with large endowments to spend more of them on tuition assistance. Like other proponents of an endowment tax, he noted that private foundations, which also are nonprofits under the tax code, already pay a tax of 1 to 2 percent on their investment income.

“Rather than fight for special treatment, universities should join me in recognizing that young adults are facing a college debt crisis as a result of the uncontrolled escalating costs,” Mr. Reed said in an email. “We should work together to solve this runaway price issue once and for all.”

The tax would affect about 140 colleges and universities, according to a list compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Universities have been fiercely protective of their endowments, and have ramped up lobbying efforts to keep control over them.

Some argued Friday that the tax plan would put a damper on gifts, because donors would not want to see the impact of their gifts diminished by the tax.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade group, said colleges and universities should be treated differently from foundations. “Private foundations give money away, that’s not the purpose of colleges and universities,” Mr. Hartle said. “If you wanted to treat them the same, you’d apply this to all colleges and universities regardless of the value of their endowments, not just a handful of private ones.”

At Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., which has an endowment of more than $200 million, the president, Elizabeth Kiss, said that most students were minorities and 40 percent had incomes low enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Because of the endowment, she said, “We are able to give financial aid to basically pretty much all of our students.”

The tax, she said, would amount to a $350,000 cut to an overall budget of $52 million. “This is an institution that had a 1 percent pay raise this year, so it’s not like we’re fat cats,” Ms. Kiss said.

A spokesman for Yale University, Tom Conroy, said that the plan would impose a permanent tax on student aid, teaching, research and community services at Yale. He pointed out that the universities with the wealthiest endowments are also those that have the resources to offer need-blind admissions and the strongest support to poor and middle-income students.

“It is disappointing that the legislation relies so heavily on colleges and universities, and especially the universities with some of the strongest records on financial aid, to raise revenue to enable tax cuts,” Mr. Conroy said. “We hope that the House of Representatives will reconsider these proposals.”

Ivy League schools generally have the biggest endowments, and they have been growing fatter since 2008, in part through high-earning investments like commercial real estate, venture capital and hedge funds.

At Yale, for instance, the endowment, helped by an 11.3 percent return on investments after fees, grew to $27 billion in the 2017 fiscal year. Harvard’s endowment, helped by an 8.1 percent return, stood at $37 billion.

The size of some of the endowments suggests that they could weather a 1.4 percent tax on earnings. But some university officials said that they must spend carefully to withstand occasional market downturns, and that large portions of many endowments have spending restrictions placed by donors.

A 2015 study by the Congressional Research Service found that in the previous fiscal year, colleges spent an average of 4.4 percent of their endowments, and the average rate of investment return was 15.5 percent. Larger institutions, which were more invested in hedge funds and private equity, had higher returns.

Yale’s endowment was nearly $2 million per student that year. Princeton’s was more than $2.6 million, and Harvard’s was nearly $1.3 million, according to the study. Harvard alone held 7 percent of all endowment assets that year, the report said.

At Cornell, the endowment typically goes toward financial aid, or helping cover faculty salaries and research, the president, Martha E. Pollack, said on Friday. If the tax goes through, Cornell would have to make the money up somewhere else, she said.

“This is very very serious for us; we’re estimating at this point that it would cost us approximately $10.5 million a year,” Dr. Pollack said. “And, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t satisfy any real policy objectives. It’s just a transfer of money from universities to permit a tax cut elsewhere in the system.”",Swelling College Endowments Tempt Lawmakers Looking for Tax Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/college-endowments-tax.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

All warmed up? Good, let’s see if we can achieve a personal best today.

Today we follow the path the marathoners will run on Sunday, by BOROUGH, and we are starting at the bottom of the grid. For example, the race begins on Staten Island, but that borough is no where to be seen, unless you jump down to 67A’s “Step 1: A passenger ship since 1817” and fill in FERRY. I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

We then lope — sorry, I mean run — into BROOKLYN, with 51A’s “Step 2: An old baseball team,” which is, of course the (BROOKLYN) DODGERS.

49A: The city of Zagazig is not only in EGYPT, it’s extremely fun to say out loud.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even. Meanwhile, I’ll also be doing a marathon of a different kind, playing Dungeons & Dragons all day to benefit children hospitals for [Extra Life].

The bears in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, in and around the park, are healthy now, and they have increased to at least 700 today from fewer than 150 in 1975, when they were listed as endangered.

But a genetic lifeline from Glacier bears, which are also related to the grizzlies of Canada, will mean a good deal more diversity to help assure the bears’ future. It’s so important that researchers have talked about trucking grizzly bears from the north to add to the Yellowstone gene pool.

“Because Yellowstone is a bit lower in genetic diversity, hundreds of years from now they might be less able to adapt to changing conditions — changing climate, changing food sources and disease resistance,” Dr. van Manen said.

While no one knows what advantageous traits the Glacier grizzlies might have in their genes, increasing diversity is the best way to assure resilience against those types of hazards.

Currently, the nearest interloper from the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem has bridged the 70-mile gap by working his way south. That grizzly is in the mountains near Butte, Mont., some 50 miles from the perimeter of the Yellowstone ecosystem.

In a study published in Ecosphere, researchers tracked grizzly bears from the northern and southern populations as they moved through western Montana, including the rugged Big Belt mountains near this city, which sits between the two national parks.

The effort to follow these nomadic bears was aided by satellite data collars and new, more powerful data analysis techniques. Some 124 males were monitored from 2000 to 2015, some for more than one year.

GPS collars can track a bear almost in real time, providing richly detailed information on the corridors and habitats they use that need to be protected.

While much of the land between the two parks is publicly owned and wild, it becomes a gauntlet in some places as bears migrate into towns, cities, ranches and farms.

The bears are likely to seek out dog food, beehives, garbage, chickens and even apple trees, getting into trouble that may require trapping and relocating them. Highway crossings, especially on I-90 and I-15, pose a serious risk.

Conservation groups and biologists say it’s a race against time to protect some of the open land between the two parks and to assure permanent transit routes for wildlife through land purchases or conservation easement.

Residential housing development north of Yellowstone around Bozeman, for example, is soaring.

“Even one house per square mile can be a problem for bears,” said Jodi Hilty, a wildlife biologist in Canmore, Canada. “At the same time, this is one of the most intact mountain ecosystems in the world.”

Dr. Hilty heads the group Yellowstone to Yukon, which seeks to link bears and other Yellowstone wildlife with populations in Glacier National Park and in vast tracts of wilderness in Canada. Protecting migration corridors between Yellowstone, Glacier and Canada would benefit not just bears, she said, but cougars, wolverines and other animals.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has removed the protections afforded under the Endangered Species Act from the Yellowstone grizzly because the population has grown so large. Dr. van Manen said that the number of grizzlies may exceed 1,000.

Environmentalists have sued the agency over its decision. They argue that climate change is a wild card that might someday cause the Yellowstone bear population to collapse.

With the bears delisted, some are concerned about plans by Montana officials to allow the hunting of Yellowstone grizzlies. Dr. David Mattson, a retired wildlife biologist, said that there is a good chance that “Montana will institute a more lethal regime, whether by sport hunting or by other means, that will compromise these prospects.”

The state has said it would not allow hunting in areas where the two populations might reconnect.

As bears explore far beyond their core habitats, people not accustomed to grizzlies need to be educated about bear-proofing garbage cans and sealing off beehives and chicken coops with electric fencing, Dr. van Manen said.

Carrying pepper spray has already become indispensable for hikers, hunters and others in many parts of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.

In 2016, four grizzlies were killed after confronting hunters in “defense of life” scenarios. Recently, a game warden near Cody, Wyo., shot and killed a female grizzly when it charged at him, leaving her cubs orphans.

Generally, though, the news for the big bear is good, said Dr. van Manen.

“There is strong scientific evidence that the recovery process that was put into place starting in the mid 1970s has paid off,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary effort for recovery of a species that has ability to kill people.

The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.

The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”

It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender.

The provision explicitly allows expectant parents to designate a “child in utero” as a beneficiary of a 529 plan.

Parents have long been able to set up 529 accounts for an unborn child, but the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.

“An unborn child means a child in utero,” the provision states. “A child in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, said the addition of the words “unborn child” was a major victory for their movement.

Eliminating it was an early campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s, and it has been a cause long championed by religious conservatives.

“Repealing the bigoted Johnson Amendment is long overdue,” Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a letter on Thursday to members of Congress.

“This clearly unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech has been used by the Internal Revenue Service to harass, intimidate and persecute the faith community for over six decades,” he wrote. “It is long past time to repeal it and we strongly support this legislation’s provision restoring the full First Amendment rights of people of faith.”

Still, doing away with the Johnson Amendment is not a cause that unites all conservatives, nor is it one that liberals are likely to let go quietly because of the considerable clout it would give pastors in the electoral process.

“The entire reason Donald Trump promised religious leaders he would help get rid of the Johnson Amendment was to empower the Christian right,” said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow for People for the American Way, a left-leaning political advocacy group.

Other aspects of the bill would make it harder for immigrant parents to claim the refundable child tax credit, even if their children were born in the United States. Under the legislation, filers would need to provide a Social Security number, rather than just a taxpayer identification number, in order to claim the benefit, which can be claimed even by those who owe no taxes. Social Security numbers are provided only to United States citizens or those authorized to work in the country.

The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the provision would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent born in the United States.

Those familiar with Mr. Yazbek as Broadway’s go-to songwriter for comedy film adaptations probably haven’t heard his solo work as frontman for a series of rock bands with names like Coke Machine, Moon Pudding, Barn and His Warmest Regards.

And vice versa: Those who groove to his sulfurous, often cheerfully pessimistic albums, with songs like “Monkey Baby Hanging on a Chicken Wire” and “Ultrasad,” would probably be surprised by brassy show tunes like “Here I Am” and unironic ballads like “Breeze Off the River.”

Which is why it’s understandable that the talk around Broadway about Mr. Yazbek and “The Band’s Visit,” which opens at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Nov. 9 in a production directed by Mr. Cromer, is so wrong.

This delicate, contemplative and thoroughly gorgeous musical, first seen last winter at the Atlantic Theater Company, does not represent, as some say, Mr. Yazbek’s unlikeliest disguise to date. Quite the opposite. “The Band’s Visit” is the truest version of him Broadway has yet heard, or is ever likely to.

“All my life I’ve written songs, right?” he half-asks, half-demands, lying like an analysand on a couch in the studio he built a few yards from his house in Rockland County. Unlike most people in analysis, though, he noodles gently on a bass as he speaks.

“I’ve made five albums that have nothing to do with musical theater,” he continues. “And, like most singer-songwriters, my motive for writing them was to tell people what I was thinking and feeling. That usually has to do with human connection and death, in a good way: How life is ennobled by the fact of death, and is deeper than what we run around frittering about all day.”

He pauses and plinks. “But unlike my other shows, in which I had a real but superficial connection to the characters’ issues, almost every song in ‘The Band’s Visit’ gives me the feeling that I’ve expressed something I feel deeply about.”

If that’s a tall order for a musical, “The Band’s Visit” is unusually ambitious, its many comic moments woven like countermelodies into a story of “human beings crying from the heart in joy or pain,” as Mr. Yazbek puts it.

With a book by Itamar Moses, based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, it concerns a ragtag Egyptian police orchestra that gets stranded in the wrong Israeli town en route to a gig at an Arab cultural center. Instead of exciting Petah Tikvah, with a ‘P,’ they wind up in a stultifying Negev outpost called Bet Hatkivah, with a ‘B’ — “like in basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah,” as one of Mr. Yazbek’s dead-on lyrics puts it.

The theme is miscommunication, including the romantic kind: the terrible gap between what we feel and what we say. In “The Band’s Visit,” the only cure is music, and yet it isn’t enough.

The Egyptians and the Israelis reach out to one another on waves of melody, from ethereal Arab song to thumping klezmer. Two in particular — the band’s leader, Tewfiq (Tony Shalhoub), and Dina, who houses him (Katrina Lenk) — nearly find a common language. But even they eventually have to acknowledge the emptiness, if perhaps a slightly less empty emptiness, that seeps back when melody passes.

Video

This theme and setting made “The Band’s Visit” a natural playground for Mr. Yazbek, who grew up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father and a half Jewish, half Italian mother. For a song about the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, he could call on his own memory of her voice on the radio in a cab while visiting his grandfather in Lebanon. To shape the score’s swirling contours, he did not have to study Middle Eastern scales or Egyptian instrumentation; he was already handy on darbouka (a goblet-shaped drum) and oud (a short-necked lyre). He was also in a good position to translate what he calls “the sound of Israeli sarcasm.”

But he had a surfeit of other sounds as well. Growing up surrounded by every kind of music — “Kiss Me, Kate” and Miles Davis on the stereo, the polyrhythms of congas in Central Park — he developed an early and eclectic ear. He started his first band, whose name cannot be published here, when he was 12; played gigs for a thousand students at college block parties; landed a solo recording contract at 28.

Another lifetime later, at 57, though married (to Elizabeth Doberneck, a meditation teacher) and with a son, Omar, in college, Mr. Yazbek retains the slightly hassled aura of a man who has almost made peace with his work — or, maybe more accurately, a man who remakes that peace every day. (He, too, meditates.)

This is a vast improvement over the person who seemed to be jumping out of his skin when I first encountered him in the “Full Monty” era. Back then, he seemed embarrassed that, of all the roads open to him, he’d found his biggest success on the one that led to Broadway, with its corny philosophies and unprovoked belting.

Among the roads less taken was comedy. Directly out of Brown, he wrote for David Letterman, part of a “Late Show” team that won an Emmy Award in 1984. (His favorite bit was called “The Most Dangerous Game,” in which a pack of bloodhounds searched 30 Rock for the announcer Bill Wendell.) And his career as a solo musical artist never took off the way he had planned — though that was, he says, his own fault.

“I made my own bed when I decided not to tour all the time,” he explains. “There were guys like Ben Folds and Dave Matthews who started off at the same time, doing what I should have done: get in a van with a baby grand, go up and down the East Coast circuit and make a subsistence living while developing a fan base. But if I doomed myself by staying home, it turns out it was a great doom. Now all those guys are sick of touring and want to write musicals.”

Even so, for a long time the regret was easily read on his face. The “man-dudes” in his poker game, hoping to annoy him into making mistakes, insisted on calling him “Broadway’s David Yazbek.”

That taunt would have been incomprehensible during the so-called Golden Age of musicals. Loesser, Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim, three of Mr. Yazbek’s idols, could aspire to nothing higher than Broadway success — though Mr. Sondheim, coming at the end of the line, eventually grew so disheartened that he threatened to give up musicals for murder mysteries or video games.

It’s worth noting that what toppled theater music from its position as the prime engine of popular culture was the same trend that Mr. Yazbek was hoping to ride: the rise of the rock singer-songwriter. Mr. Yazbek has played both sides of the fence, bringing to each discipline the skills and, well, the discipline of the other.

Thanks to rock, he writes musical theater lyrics that arise from their stories at unexpected angles and with a looser diction than most of the classics. The rhymes in “The Band’s Visit” are accurate enough to get laughs (awful/falafel; marrow/Pharaoh) but not obsessively mitered. Thanks to musical theater, his rock songs are tighter and better structured than almost anyone’s.

And after decades in which critics openly prayed for a savior to resuscitate theater music with the primal energies of pop, perhaps we can now see that Mr. Yazbek has been doing it, insufficiently heralded, for years. (He received Tony Award nominations for all three of his previous Broadway scores, but has never won.) In the shadow of “The Producers,” “The Full Monty” was a marginal hit; “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” recouped only on the road. “Women on the Verge,” through no fault of Mr. Yazbek’s, was a major flop (though a revised version met with more success in London). Even “The Band’s Visit,” despite its Off Broadway raves, is nobody’s idea of a sure thing.

Mr. Yazbek would, of course, love a hit, but his pleasure in the work itself acts as a kind of professional prophylaxis. He has nearly completed the score for a musical version of the 1982 hit film “Tootsie” — as flat-out a musical comedy as you could imagine — and is working on the lyrics to Henry Krieger’s music for a show about the evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. The luxury of writing only what he wants, while recording the occasional solo album, is enough, he says, to “service my pretensions.”

Servicing his spiritual aspirations is a different matter. This used to require performing in public: “The connection you make while sharing in the creation of music with other people in real time,” he says, “is the closest metaphor for the actual connection that every sentient being has, way beneath the surface, at the root of truth.”

Photo

Now, he says, he can achieve that connection without so much performing. Still, after certain performances, when company members gather outside the Barrymore or beneath its stage for a jam session of Arabic music, Mr. Yazbek sometimes joins in. On a recent evening, after a two-show day, he grabbed a spare drum from the darbouka player Ossama Farouk, while George Abud, who plays Camal in the musical, improvised on his oud, with Ms. Lenk on violin. They fed one another melodies like canapés.

A few rugs and lanterns could not disguise the grimness of what was actually the musicians’ locker room, with costume racks pressing in. But as the four worked through “El Hayah Helwa” (“Life Is Beautiful”) by Farid al-Atrash, and an Umm Kulthum song called “Awedt Ainy,” which Mr. Abud translated as “I’m Addicted to You,” all the discomforts disappeared.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGRE GOR / I’LL A SK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Tricky Clues

24D: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that this is more of a West Coast thing, but the portmanteau of “smoke” and “haze” is SMAZE.

35D: BOATS take you from riverbank to riverbank, so they are the “Connection between banks?”

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

The drop in atmospheric humidity often depletes skin of its moisture, a shift that requires your internal system to work harder to stay hydrated. Firing up the furnace at home doesn’t help matters, explains the New York-based dermatologist Dr. Julie Karen. “Changes in temperature — like going from the cold outdoors to the heated indoors — can aggravate redness,” she says, especially for those dealing with already-sensitive skin or chronic inflammation from eczema and rosacea. Relief, however, is coming in the form of next-generation skin soothers that combine active botanicals with calming agents to counteract the seasonal elements.

To speed healing, start by softening rough spots — delicately. “Gentle exfoliation can allow for better penetration of other ingredients, such as hydrators,” says Dr. Karen. Omorovicza Midnight Radiance Mask cushions salicylic acid with ultra-moisturizing hyaluronic acid and algae extract; the cooling gel should be worn overnight to maximize the time when skin repairs itself. A daily cleanser like May Lindstrom Pendulum Potion, meanwhile, clears pores with anti-inflammatory tamanu oil, replenishing fatty acids, and a spalike application ritual to quiet reactive skin. (Apply four to six pumps into palms and press onto dry skin. Then wet your hands and lightly massage it off.)

Next, prime skin to become more resilient to the forces of nature. True Botanicals Calm Pure Radiance Oil is rich in helichrysum — a plant that’s considered unique among botanists and skin-care enthusiasts for its ability to heal wounds and fight off bacteria that can weaken skin (Dr. Karen says it has potential to be a “hero” ingredient). The potent flower is also found in Tammy Fender’s Intensive Repair Balm Formula No. RB-410, a therapeutic salve with lipids and proteins to help reinforce the skin’s protective outer layer. And for a modern update on the classic oatmeal bath remedy, Pai Instant Calm Redness Serum delivers sea aster and wild oat in a lotion gel to strengthen blood vessels and minimize flushing — no matter the forecast.

That’s when Stage 2 is set to go down, per Irving’s instructions to Angela over breakfast ribs. With Elliot’s shipping counter-maneuvers and new tendency to randomly “show up” threatening the plan, Irving has either handed the keys to Wellick or set him up to take the fall. (Perhaps both.) We talked last week about Irving’s manipulative skill and here he reeled in Wellick like a rageful Swedish fish, using the man’s destiny-and-gods rhetoric against him. “This is the moment you were born for,” he says.

I want my family sent to Ukraine, Wellick says. Tell my wife about the plan.

“Of course,” Irving replies softly, Bobby Cannavale managing to convey both pity and pragmatism in one pregnant pause. (Remember Agent Santiago is one of the few people who knows Joanna is dead, which means that Irving does, too.)

Speaking of tragic families, the episode’s other major thread involved the beginning of a possible reconciliation between Darlene and Elliot, as we returned — after last week’s detour into the life and times of Tyrell Wellick, lumberjack fugitive — to the tense reunion at the FBI safe house.

Darlene blamed her hacking of Elliot’s computer on the fact that Mr. Robot was not to be trusted, a cagey diversion that also happens to be true. Soon they were walking Flipper and planning a sibling project, which in the Alderson clan means one of you staking out the other in case his sinister alter ego sneaks off to smash the world’s economy. (“It’s weird but I guess we passed weird a long time ago,” Darlene notes.) The gambit reveals that Angela is in league with Mr. Robot.

A theme this season has been the slow but steady revelation of how badly Darlene, too, has been scarred by the disintegration of her family. Her trauma lacks the Gothic edge of Elliot’s certainly, but it was devastating enough to drive her to murder.

The episode opened with her confessing her sins to a subway pickpocket, requesting the return of only a Polaroid of the Aldersons in happier times. “Metadata is story behind the data,” Elliot tells us later. When people post pictures to on social media, they don’t realize they’ve handed over a wealth of private information “all hidden inside the photograph’s metadata,” he said.

So what story is hidden within Darlene’s analog photo, or at least in its surpassing meaningfulness to her? That the only thing that Darlene cares about is her memory of a time when her family was intact, at least, and perhaps even happy. A time before her father’s death or Elliot’s mental break, before cellphone photos or cataclysmic hacks.

Perhaps it’s that while she’s tellingDom that her cooperation with the F.B.I. means that “I’m gonna lose my brother,” when the time comes to effectively sever that tie, she won’t be able to go through with it.

A Few Thoughts While We Turn In Our I.D. Badge

• Angela confirmed that she got Elliot the E Corp job because “it was the best way to manage him.” We all saw how that worked out, so now she’s having him banned from the building. I know this random employee doesn’t matter to you, she told Pryce, but while Angela may believe think that, it’s not really true, is it? Pryce told Whiterose he knows who was behind the 5/9 hack back in Season 1.

• By the way how is Elliot not collapsing, working with Wellick every night and at E Corp during the day? Or Angela either, for that matter? Probably best not to ponder this aspect too deeply.

• So what’s in Angela’s hypodermic, anyway? One shot and Dr. Jekyll reverts to Hyde.

So off he went to Africa, which is pretty much the last place in the world that needs more fossil fuels. There’s already a heck of a lot of coal and oil there, but it’s not doing poor villagers any good.

“Fossil fuels and the grid approach have had their reign for a hundred years now, and there are still a billion people without electricity,” said Kristina Skierka of Power for All, a global campaign for universal energy access.

And even if a grid did arrive, Skierka pointed out, the little girl would still be reading by the firelight since rural African transmission lines tend to be down more often than they’re working.

An obvious answer is solar power. “It’s similar to cellphones,” said Michael Brune of the Sierra Club. “You don’t have to build a new grid. You can just use solar power plus batteries and bring power to a community — not just much more cheaply but much more quickly.”

Wow, the little village girl could put a solar cell on the roof and power a battery for her reading light. And no pollution. That’s exactly the kind of thinking that drives Perry nuts. So there he was in Cape Town, spreading the faith and urging his audience to break the “culture of shame” around oil and coal.

Africa was actually the worst place possible for an American official to be waving the fossil fuel flag. Climate scientists expect it to be particularly hard hit by global warming, with expanding droughts on one hand and flooding on the other.

Perry has generally tried to avoid picking fights when it comes to the science of global warming — although he did once, in a presidential debate, appear to be comparing climate change deniers to Galileo. His bottom line is basically that whatever is going on, it should not have any impact on the continued consumption of oil and coal.

“If you admit you support fossil fuels, it’s like saying you’ve made some huge social error,” he complained in Cape Town.

Richard Sandler is on Instagram.","The street photographer Richard Sandler grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, but the chaos and menace of 1960s Manhattan was an irresistible lure for a young man. He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes they’d paid to finance their system.
“When you talk about health care, you’re not just talking about health care,” he said in his Toronto speech.","Mr. Sanders, who drew huge crowds as a presidential candidate in the United States last year, learned firsthand that he is also a household name in Toronto. His policy vision, decidedly from the left in the United States, matches mainstream Canadian views.

“You received the welcome here that is normally reserved for celebrity rock stars,” said Greg Marchildon, the director of the North American Observatory on Health Systems and Policies at the University of Toronto.

Ed Broadbent, the chairman of the progressive Broadbent Institute, called Mr. Sanders the most important social democrat in North America — even though Mr. Sanders is not a Canadian social democrat, and is not even a particularly powerful member of the Senate.

Lesson 2: Doctors like the system as much as patients do

Many developed countries have achieved universal health coverage, but Canada is relatively distinct in its insistence that individuals should not have to pay any money at the point of care. When Canadians go to the doctor or hospital, they just show their Canadian “Medicare” card.

At Women’s College Hospital, executives showed Mr. Sanders an empty billing window. The hospital, they told him, has one employee who manages bills. “For the entire hospital?” Mr. Sanders said, in mock disbelief.

Several patients told him about the comfort that comes from not having to pay for their care directly. And doctors, too, said they felt more comfortable recommending their patients get an operation or see a specialist than they might if those treatments weren’t free.

“I didn’t have to fill out any forms; I didn’t have to worry about how I was going to pay for the simple job of staying alive,” said Lilac Chow, a kidney transplant patient at Toronto General Hospital, who had been brought in to share her experience with the senator.

Whenever Mr. Sanders was asked what he learned about the Canadian system, the value of free care came up.

“What I think stuck out to me was from both the patients and the physicians, the importance of not having to worry about money in terms of the doctor-patient relationship,” he said in an interview after his trip on Tuesday.

His Medicare-for-All bill includes free care as a central feature. If the legislation became law, no American would pay directly for a doctor, dentist or hospital visit, and co-payments for prescription drugs would be limited. (Taxpayers would, of course, finance the system.)

Lesson 3: Sometimes, you have to wait

At a round-table discussion at Women’s College Hospital, the chief of surgery noted that Canadian patients can’t always get all the care they want right away. “Wait times, you could argue are a problem for certain procedures,” said Dr. David Urbach, before discussing the ways the province and hospital were working to shorten the lines. Mr. Sanders quickly turned to the glass-half-full interpretation. “What you are arguing — correct me if I’m wrong — is that waiting times are not a problem, and it’s an issue you are dealing with,” he said.

In Canada, where government finances health insurance and the private sector delivers a lot of the care, patients with life-threatening emergencies are treated right away. But patients with cataracts or arthritis often have to wait for operations the Canadian system considers elective. A governmental review of the Ontario system recently found that wait times were getting worse in some cases, like knee replacements.

The Canadian system puts hospitals on a budget and limits the number of specialists it trains, both factors that can lead to lines for complex care that’s not life-threatening. The system also limits access to services, like M.R.I. scans, that are much more abundant south of the border.

On his weekend tour, Mr. Sanders didn’t see the places where patients might wait. Hospital executives instead showed him a refugee primary care clinic, a neonatal intensive care unit and a cardiac surgery unit.

But he points out that many Americans who are uninsured — or who have limited savings and insurance with high deductibles — may wait even longer than Canadians for elective, or even urgent, care.

“If you’re very, very rich, you’ll get the highest-quality care immediately in the United States,” Mr. Sanders said, in the interview. “If you’re working class, if you’re middle class, it is a very, very different story.”

The Commonwealth Fund, a health research group, ranked the United States health system at the bottom of its most recent 11-country rankings, published in July. But Canada did only a little better, at No. 9. Of all the measures in the study, Canada ranked the worst on the “timeliness” of care. (A team of Upshot experts eliminated Canada in the first round in an eight-country virtual bracket tournament of international health system performance.)

Any single-payer system will need to grapple with how much it should spend over all, and where it will save money. Mr. Sanders’s Medicare-for-All bill currently includes few details about how the government would set budgets and allocate resources once all Americans were brought into the government system.

Lesson 4: Even Canada’s system has holes

Mr. Sanders wants to bring big, sweeping change to the American health care system. Unlike the Affordable Care Act, which filled in holes in an existing system, his Medicare-for-All plan would take away the health coverage that most Americans hold now, replacing it with a single, very generous government system. It would do away with the premiums, deductibles and co-payments that individuals and businesses pay for health care, and instead impose large tax increases.

That is not the kind of change that would be politically trivial. In his speech, he noted that the creation of a single-payer system in Canada and Britain followed grass-roots movements, and political landslides by the parties that favored the change. “Real change always happens from the bottom up,” he said, to big applause. “You’ve got to struggle for it. You’ve got to fight for it. You’ve got to take it. And that is the history of all real change in this world.”

Yet even in Canada, he learned, changes to the health care system have been difficult. The Canadian system, with insurance run at the province level, covers doctors and hospitals. But decades after the 1984 Canada Health Act, many Canadians pay for supplemental private insurance through their jobs for prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry — despite a growing recognition that medications are essential to care.

“Any one of us around the table is just a job loss away from having access to prescription medications, and that’s a problem,” said Danielle Martin, a vice president at Women’s College Hospital and policy researcher, who helped organize the trip, at a round-table discussion.

“I’m on my own going to the dentist,” said Naomi Duguid, a patient, sitting across the table. “It’s the only time I get to experience what it must be like to be an uninsured American.”

Ontario has recently started a program that will provide coverage for medications to residents under 25. And there is a patchwork of drug coverage programs for older people, the poor and those who get insurance from work. But even in Canada, it’s tough to find the resources to expand coverage.

“We have to find the money to fund the program up front,” said Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who helped establish the youth drug coverage program.

Lesson 5: Canadians seem to value fairness more than Americans do

Equity. Fairness. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Sanders kept asking Canadians what they thought about the higher taxes they’d paid to finance their system. Every one among the patients and doctors selected to meet him said the trade-off was worth it because it made the system fair.

“I think it’s a really fair way to do it,” said Frederick Brownridge, 67, of Etobicoke, Ontario, as he sat by the window in his Toronto General Hospital room, with IV lines in his arms. Mr. Brownridge had had two heart valves repaired and a double bypass three days earlier. “It also means if you’re in a lower economic status or higher economic status, you’ll get the treatment you need.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders said the uniformity of this message really stuck out to him: “There really is, I think, a deep-seated belief in Canada that health care is a right, and whether you’re rich or whether you’re poor or whether you’re middle class, you are entitled to health care.”

In the United States, though, Republicans control the presidency and the Congress, and many candidates last year ran on a promise to roll back government support for health care coverage.

Several recent public opinion surveys show majority support for a government guarantee of health coverage, but support declines substantially when pollsters mention that government coverage would mean higher taxes.

Mr. Sanders said he knows his bill isn’t going to become law anytime soon, but he thinks discussing the idea will help make its underlying values more broadly acceptable.

“When you talk about health care, you’re not just talking about health care,” he said in his Toronto speech. “You’re talking about values, because how a society deals with health care is more than medicine. It’s more than technology. It is about the values that those societies hold dear.”",What Did Bernie Sanders Learn in His Weekend in Canada?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/upshot/bernie-sanders-went-to-canada-and-learned-a-few-things.html

One major disconnect she has found is that many people don’t think climate change will affect them personally.
Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for instance, has largely disavowed climate science.
“But it highlights how isolated the administration’s position on climate change has become internationally.”","Yet that 2014 report did little to sway skeptical Republicans who have dismissed climate change as sketchy science and a liberal hobby horse. Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and a leading critic of climate science in Congress, responded by calling it a “political document,” emphasizing the lingering uncertainties in the report. He has also derided the expertise of what he calls “so-called self-professed climate scientists.”

Mr. Smith’s response highlighted a longstanding and uncomfortable dynamic: When scientific studies conflict with ingrained political values, it is all too easy to dismiss the scientists themselves as biased or to migrate toward a different set of authorities, however marginal, who can poke holes in an inconvenient report.

Similarly, few observers expect this new report to influence the Trump administration, which has pushed to repeal federal regulations on the greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and whose officials have expressed doubt about the causes of a warming planet.

“I think there are a range of attitudes and sentiments within the administration about causes of and risks associated with climate change,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and adviser to the Trump transition. “But two things everyone seems to share are a concern that climate sensitivity is overblown and a sturdy skepticism about any and all possible ‘remedies’ that have been proposed.”

“I don’t see where this report is going to alter either of those sentiments,” he said. “Nor do I think it should.”

Researchers who study public attitudes toward climate change are also skeptical that science alone can spur people to care about the issue.

“If someone is already not on board with climate science or is just disengaged and feels like it doesn’t matter, more information about ocean acidification or attribution of extreme weather events isn’t going to change their minds,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University who contributed to the federal climate report.

But that doesn’t mean public attitudes about climate change are frozen forever, incapable of shifting, added Dr. Hayhoe, who has made a habit of reaching out to conservatives and other skeptics of climate change.

One major disconnect she has found is that many people don’t think climate change will affect them personally. A recent survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that the majority of Americans think that global warming will negatively affect the country, but only a small minority thought that they themselves would suffer.

Dr. Hayhoe suggested that the second part of the National Climate Assessment, still in draft form and due out in 2018, could help alter those views. That report will explore in vivid detail the impacts that global warming will have on local communities, documenting trends like the sharp rise in tidal flooding that is already beginning to swamp cities like Hampton Roads, Va.

There is some evidence that even policymakers skeptical of human-caused global warming will take notice of worsening local impacts and act accordingly. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for instance, has largely disavowed climate science. But in December, his state emergency management agency nonetheless released a sweeping plan to prepare for higher temperatures and heavier rainfall events in the future.

“While there remains some debate about the cause of climate change, there has been a documented change in weather patterns over time in Wisconsin,” the report noted, adding later, “Climate resilience is a state and national priority.”

Dr. Hayhoe has also found that many conservatives are more skeptical about climate science when they think that the solutions to global warming look suspiciously like a liberal wish list involving extensive government intervention.

But there are signs that those attitudes are slowly shifting. Both solar and wind power, which have always been broadly popular, are growing fastest in many Republican-leaning states — a trend that could do far more than endless scientific reports to break the deadlock around climate politics.

“The place where I often tend to find common ground is when we can agree on solutions,” said Dr. Hayhoe. “Because if someone supports the growth of clean energy, does it matter why they support it?”

On that score, the Trump administration is less likely to rethink its priorities. Support for renewable energy and action on climate change often contradicts other key political priorities, such as supporting coal-mining communities and the domestic oil industry.

Even so, some observers wonder if the new climate science report could at the very least increase international pressure on the White House to take climate change more seriously, particularly after President Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

“I don’t think it’s going to have any impact on the policies of this administration,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser. “But it highlights how isolated the administration’s position on climate change has become internationally.”",A Climate Science Report That Changes Minds?

Or how about the Dodgers’ rival, the San Francisco Giants, who have been to the playoffs only four times in the past decade but won championships in three of those years? This season, the Giants finished 40 games behind the Dodgers. Their fans spent Wednesday night celebrating as if they had won the World Series, because the Dodgers did not. Sports are terrible, and baseball is the worst of all. It is designed to break your heart; this week it broke mine.

I cannot fault the adults in charge of raising me for failing to wake me up to see what might have wound up being the last Dodgers World Series championship. This wasn’t a Red Sox exorcism or a once-in-a-century Cubs triumph. It was the second time the Dodgers had won it in my lifetime; the first happened the month after I was born.

The Lakers won four championships in my first seven years on earth, and the first Olympics of my lifetime were held in my home city when I was 2. I was alive and running around with ribbons in my long blond hair and mud on my knees and elbows during the ’80s golden era of Los Angeles sports. I wasn’t old enough to appreciate any of it.

It’s very possible we are headed toward a second golden era. Besides the fact that I won’t have to endure watching the Dodgers shake hands with Donald Trump at the White House, I can find the smallest silver lining that after decades of falling short of the Fall Classic, this year’s team actually made the World Series, which is farther than they advanced when I wrote a book about the two seasons I thought they would win it all. It was no fluke. Las Vegas sports books give them the best odds to win next year.

More teams in Los Angeles mean more chances to turn Tinseltown back into Title Town. Things are certainly looking up in Lakerland. After four horrendous seasons, the Lakers finally have a front office that seems to know what it’s doing. That brain trust drafted the young point guard superstar Lonzo Ball in the first round, and his ability has so far eclipsed the baggage wrought by his stage-parent father. They might not win for a while, but the kid has made them watchable again.

The local band of ice hockey professionals, the Los Angeles Kings, have won two Stanley Cup titles since 2012, despite the fact that it has not snowed in downtown Los Angeles since 1962. The season is young, but at 10-2, they’re off to one of the best starts in the N.H.L. The Rams (5-2) moved back here from St. Louis last year, and against all odds, they are good. (The Chargers moved up from San Diego before the start of this season, but I don’t know anyone in Los Angeles who cares about them, so I can’t vouch.)

Los Angeles’s biggest selling point is its Mediterranean climate. For that reason I’ve never understood why “fair-weather fan” is used as a pejorative. I’ve been a Rams fan for a year, and I’m all in. If they win a Super Bowl at some point, I’ll drink and high-five strangers in bars. If they lose, I’ll get on with my life five minutes later. Isn’t that what fandom should be — all upside, no anguish?

Daniel Stiles, a self-styled ape trafficking detective in Kenya, had been scouring Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp for weeks, looking for pictures of gorillas, chimps or orangutans. He was hoping to chip away at an illicit global trade that has captured or killed tens of thousands of apes and pushed some endangered species to the brink of extinction.

“The way they do business,” he said of ape traffickers, “makes the Mafia look like amateurs.”

After hundreds of searches, Mr. Stiles found an Instagram account offering dozens of rare animals for sale, including baby chimpanzees and orangutans dressed in children’s clothes. He sent an email to an address on the account — “looking for young otans” (the industry standard slang for orangutans) — and several days later received a reply.

“2 babies, 7.5k each. Special introductory price.”

Mr. Stiles knew what Tom was hoping for: to sell the infant orangutans to a private collector or unscrupulous zoo, where they are often beaten or drugged into submission and used for entertainment like mindlessly banging on drums or boxing one another.

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections.","For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

But that doesn’t mean public attitudes about climate change are frozen forever, incapable of shifting, added Dr. Hayhoe, who has made a habit of reaching out to conservatives and other skeptics of climate change.
One major disconnect she has found is that many people don’t think climate change will affect them personally.
Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for instance, has largely disavowed climate science.
“But it highlights how isolated the administration’s position on climate change has become internationally.”","Yet that 2014 report did little to sway skeptical Republicans who have dismissed climate change as sketchy science and a liberal hobby horse. Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and a leading critic of climate science in Congress, responded by calling it a “political document,” emphasizing the lingering uncertainties in the report. He has also derided the expertise of what he calls “so-called self-professed climate scientists.”

Mr. Smith’s response highlighted a longstanding and uncomfortable dynamic: When scientific studies conflict with ingrained political values, it is all too easy to dismiss the scientists themselves as biased or to migrate toward a different set of authorities, however marginal, who can poke holes in an inconvenient report.

Similarly, few observers expect this new report to influence the Trump administration, which has pushed to repeal federal regulations on the greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and whose officials have expressed doubt about the causes of a warming planet.

“I think there are a range of attitudes and sentiments within the administration about causes of and risks associated with climate change,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and adviser to the Trump transition. “But two things everyone seems to share are a concern that climate sensitivity is overblown and a sturdy skepticism about any and all possible ‘remedies’ that have been proposed.”

“I don’t see where this report is going to alter either of those sentiments,” he said. “Nor do I think it should.”

Researchers who study public attitudes toward climate change are also skeptical that science alone can spur people to care about the issue.

“If someone is already not on board with climate science or is just disengaged and feels like it doesn’t matter, more information about ocean acidification or attribution of extreme weather events isn’t going to change their minds,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University who contributed to the federal climate report.

But that doesn’t mean public attitudes about climate change are frozen forever, incapable of shifting, added Dr. Hayhoe, who has made a habit of reaching out to conservatives and other skeptics of climate change.

One major disconnect she has found is that many people don’t think climate change will affect them personally. A recent survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that the majority of Americans think that global warming will negatively affect the country, but only a small minority thought that they themselves would suffer.

Dr. Hayhoe suggested that the second part of the National Climate Assessment, still in draft form and due out in 2018, could help alter those views. That report will explore in vivid detail the impacts that global warming will have on local communities, documenting trends like the sharp rise in tidal flooding that is already beginning to swamp cities like Hampton Roads, Va.

There is some evidence that even policymakers skeptical of human-caused global warming will take notice of worsening local impacts and act accordingly. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for instance, has largely disavowed climate science. But in December, his state emergency management agency nonetheless released a sweeping plan to prepare for higher temperatures and heavier rainfall events in the future.

“While there remains some debate about the cause of climate change, there has been a documented change in weather patterns over time in Wisconsin,” the report noted, adding later, “Climate resilience is a state and national priority.”

Dr. Hayhoe has also found that many conservatives are more skeptical about climate science when they think that the solutions to global warming look suspiciously like a liberal wish list involving extensive government intervention.

But there are signs that those attitudes are slowly shifting. Both solar and wind power, which have always been broadly popular, are growing fastest in many Republican-leaning states — a trend that could do far more than endless scientific reports to break the deadlock around climate politics.

“The place where I often tend to find common ground is when we can agree on solutions,” said Dr. Hayhoe. “Because if someone supports the growth of clean energy, does it matter why they support it?”

On that score, the Trump administration is less likely to rethink its priorities. Support for renewable energy and action on climate change often contradicts other key political priorities, such as supporting coal-mining communities and the domestic oil industry.

Even so, some observers wonder if the new climate science report could at the very least increase international pressure on the White House to take climate change more seriously, particularly after President Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

“I don’t think it’s going to have any impact on the policies of this administration,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser. “But it highlights how isolated the administration’s position on climate change has become internationally.”",A Climate Science Report That Changes Minds?

Through a representative, Mr. Weinstein has steadily denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.
But in interviews with The Times and a statement through her lawyer, Ms. de la Huerta described a series of harrowing encounters in 2010.
First, she said, Mr. Weinstein raped her in her TriBeCa apartment.
Afterward, Ms. de la Huerta said, she had an emotional breakdown and struggled to work.","Chief Boyce said that Ms. de la Huerta “put forth a credible and detailed narrative” to his detectives and that those detectives found “corroboration along the way.” He said Ms. de la Huerta was able “to articulate each and every movement of the crime: where she was, where they met, where this happened and what he did.”

Despite the strong words from Mr. Boyce, officials in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., issued a statement suggesting they were not ready to charge Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Vance’s office would be responsible for prosecuting Mr. Weinstein if he were arrested.

Ms. de la Huerta’s claims resemble those by other women who have come forward. But even as the number of alleged Weinstein victims has increased, with a growing number of women across the world claiming that he harassed, assaulted or raped them, it is unclear whether Mr. Weinstein will face criminal charges. Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles and Britain have also confirmed that they are investigating accounts of sexual assault and abuse by Mr. Weinstein, but the announcement by the New York police is the first indication of a possible arrest.

Through a representative, Mr. Weinstein has steadily denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.

But in interviews with The Times and a statement through her lawyer, Ms. de la Huerta described a series of harrowing encounters in 2010. First, she said, Mr. Weinstein raped her in her TriBeCa apartment. “I know you’re ready to become a real actress,” she said the producer told her as he forced himself on her.

Ms. de la Huerta, who appeared in the HBO drama “Boardwalk Empire,” said that in the weeks afterward, Mr. Weinstein harassed her, calling her frequently, idling his car outside her apartment building and exposing himself to her at a Los Angeles hotel. “He would call me all the time,” she said, adding that his assistant repeatedly sought her out, saying, “Harvey wants to see you.”

“I was terrified,” she said, explaining why she did not go to the police and instead confided mainly in her therapist. “You keep quiet about it,” she added, describing why she stayed silent.

In December 2010, Mr. Weinstein called Ms. de la Huerta and told her he was waiting in her apartment building lobby and would not leave until she met him, she said. “I had said no to meeting him, no to functions,” she said. “He persisted until he was literally sitting in my lobby until I came home.”

She had been drinking that night because she was nervous, she said.

When she arrived in the lobby, Mr. Weinstein manipulated her into letting him into her apartment, saying they would have a calm discussion upstairs, she recalled. Once they got upstairs, he pushed her on the bed, overpowered her and raped her a second time, she said.

Afterward, Ms. de la Huerta said, she had an emotional breakdown and struggled to work. Her therapist, Sue Ann Piliero, did not return phone calls seeking comment but provided a short statement to the lawyer, Aaron Filler, who provided it to The Times. The statement partially backed Ms. de la Huerta’s recollections.

“I recall you telling me that Harvey Weinstein was seeking sexual contact with you on more than one occasion with the promise of additional roles,” she wrote. “I recall you reporting to me a sexual encounter with Harvey Weinstein involving intercourse in your apartment in 2010 that resulted in you feeling victimized. I recall you telling me that it felt coercive to you and that you didn’t want to have sex with him, but felt that you had to as he was a man of power and rank and you couldn’t say no to his sexual advances.”

Mr. Boyce faced questions about the case on Friday because a report in Vanity Fair quoted a New York police detective, Nicholas DiGaudio, saying the police were ready to move forward.

In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses.

Two officials in the district attorney’s office, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation, said one of the office’s most experienced sex crime prosecutors, Maxine Rosenthal, conducted the initial interview with Ms. de la Huerta.

But the officials cautioned that the investigation was still in the early stages and that detectives and prosecutors were still gathering evidence.

“We are taking it seriously and we are investigating it,” an official with the district attorney’s office said. “We are hoping to build a case. If we can build one, we will build one.”

In general, the Manhattan district attorney’s office will not go forward with a sex crimes prosecution unless prosecutors in its sex crimes unit are absolutely convinced they have enough evidence. This high bar for sex crimes exists largely to avoid subjecting a victim to a humiliating cross-examination that would doom the case and deter other victims from coming forward, prosecutors say.

That is one reason Mr. Vance has said he decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015, when Ambra Battilana, an Italian model, accused him of groping her during a job interview at his office.",Police Building Case to Arrest Harvey Weinstein After Sexual Assault Claim,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-new-york-police.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mr. Page acknowledged his meeting with Russian government officials during sharp questioning by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, according to a congressional official familiar with the exchange.

During another part of the testimony, Mr. Page was questioned about a trip to Budapest, although it was not immediately clear why. Mr. Page told The Times earlier this year that he had taken that trip around Labor Day weekend last year, but he said he had not met with any Russians.

“It was a short four-day trip over a long holiday weekend at the end of the summer,” Mr. Page said at the time. “I had a nice trip up the Danube, to the Visegrad castle, did a lot of sightseeing and went to a jazz club. Not much to report.”

Court records unsealed on Monday revealed that another campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, met in 2016 with Russians who said they had connections to the government and was told about “dirt” regarding Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” The court records were released by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the presidential election last year and whether any of President Trump’s associates helped in that effort.

Mr. Page was questioned by the F.B.I. earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel’s inquiry.

Mr. Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016 was never a secret, and during the trip, he gave a speech at a graduation ceremony at the New Economic School, a university there. But the trip was one of the triggers of a counterintelligence investigation begun by the F.B.I. later that month.

In his talk at the university, Mr. Page criticized American policy toward Russia in terms that echoed the position of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. “Washington and other Western capitals have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change,” Mr. Page said.

His remarks accorded with Mr. Trump’s positive view of the Russian president, which had prompted speculation about what Mr. Trump saw in Mr. Putin — more commonly denounced in the United States as a ruthless, anti-Western autocrat.

Mr. Page left the Trump campaign not long after the trip, and since then, Mr. Trump’s advisers tried to distance the campaign from Mr. Page.

During another trip to Moscow, in December 2016, after Mr. Page had left the Trump campaign, he said he planned to meet with “business leaders and thought leaders.” At the time, a Kremlin spokesman said that no government officials planned to meet Mr. Page and that the Kremlin had never had any contact with him.

“We have learned about this from the press,” the spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the news agency Interfax.

A former Navy officer and Annapolis graduate, Mr. Page was unknown in Washington foreign policy circles when Mr. Trump announced him as a member of his team of advisers in March 2016.

Mr. Page lived in Moscow from 2004 to 2007 while working as a junior investment banker for Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Page subsequently started his own investment firm, Global Energy Capital, and teamed up on some deals with a Russian businessman, Sergey Yatsenko. Mr. Yatsenko had been deputy chief financial officer for the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which is majority-owned by the government and has close ties to Mr. Putin.

Mr. Page was wrapped up — but not charged — in an F.B.I. investigation in 2013 that targeted people suspected of being Russian intelligence officers in New York. One of the of three men who was later charged with being an unregistered agent of a foreign power had met Mr. Page at an energy symposium, and was recorded describing him as having dreams of lucrative deals.

Mr. Page had said he did not know the man was an intelligence officer.

The swift change to the law was made with none of the fierce public debate about free speech and patriotic duty that erupted in the United States after football players knelt in dissent when “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played. Such discussion would be nearly unthinkable in China, where the party squashes dissent and most people would object to such protests during the anthem, called “March of the Volunteers”

The lawmakers took the step even though there seem to be few, if any, cases of people protesting in China by reworking the national anthem. But the move reflects the deepening demands for patriotic devotion that have been encouraged by Xi Jinping, the president and party leader who has made the “Chinese Dream” his signature political theme.

“Using the rule of law to defend the dignity of the national anthem is a civilized step forward and also reflects a social consensus,” Xinhua, the state-run news agency, said in an editorial before the amendment passed. “Defended by rule of law, the melody of the anthem will be even more spirited and vigorous.”",Jail Time for Disrespecting China’s Anthem Jumps From 15 Days to 3 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/asia/china-hong-kong-national-anthem.html

New Yorkers are infamous for regarding their city as the center of the universe and, on especially self-satisfied days, as the only place to be. This city’s theater artists, though, know that big things happen in small and out-of-the-way places. Consider some of the new productions opening this month.

Their settings, which embrace both real and unreal estate, include a quaint little Scottish village that exists beyond the borders of time, a tiny Israeli desert town most notable for its lack of distinguishing features, an American high school soccer field and most of the vast area classified as Latin America. And, oh yes, space — as in the cosmos, where meteors fly.

The Band’s Visit

Indisputable proof that boring (or at least bored) people can be terrifically exciting company, this beautiful and surprising musical from the composer David Yazbek and the playwright Itamar Moses takes place in a terminally sleepy provincial corner of Israel. But then a touring Egyptian band (mistakenly) winds up there, and new life blooms, shyly and unexpectedly, beneath desert skies. A sold-out hit for the Atlantic Theater Company in the spring, this wide-awake sleeper arrives on Broadway with most of its original team intact — including its inspired director, David Cromer, and a cast led by Tony Shalhoub and the incomparable Katrina Lenk.

Perhaps the ultimate “escape from New York” fantasy, this 1947 Lerner and Loewe musical drops two jaded Manhattanites into a mirage of a Scottish town that has never been tainted by urban bustle and stress. City Center has come up with a dream team to give life to this dream location. Its director and choreographer is Christopher Wheeldon, who triumphed with the stage version of “An American in Paris,” and the cast includes Kelli O’Hara, Patrick Wilson and the virtuosic dancer Robert Fairchild (who can act, too). Like the town of its title, this deluxe concert staging of “Brigadoon” will materialize only briefly, from Nov. 15 to 19, to be exact.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress.","The company attributed its slow pace so far to difficulties in producing battery packs at its Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory. It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.

“We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,” Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. “Speed is the ultimate weapon.”

Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter — considerably short of its target of 1,500.

And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.

While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.

But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.

And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Tesla’s overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.

One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing system — which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats — is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said. “Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.”

Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.

While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla’s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.

The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.

Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3’s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.

“At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.”

Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.

Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance. Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.

But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.

One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory — and he believed he had been fired for it.

“Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,” Mr. Grant said in an email. “That’s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that’s why I handed out fliers.”

The U.A.W. has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.

“I don’t believe I was fired for performance,” said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.

Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.

Ditto with “Dinkins years” (the “gorgeous mosaic,” tennis rackets, Crown Heights riots), “Giuliani years” (squeegee men, Derek Jeter, Twin Towers) or “Bloomberg years” (bike lanes, luxury condos, waterfront parks). Love ’em or hate ’em, each of them had their drama.

The “de Blasio years”? The mind goes blank. It’s hard to say, four years in, what represents this era. Gourmet food trucks, maybe? Food halls? As the mayors got taller, the mayoralty got smaller.

The public scourges Minnie Mouse and Elmo are confined to mascot ghettos in Times Square known as designated activity zones. There was, if memory serves, a blizzard that everyone freaked out about, although it’s hard to remember when, or why. It’s hard enough to remember just how to spell the mayor’s name. (It’s not “DiBlasio,” but you can be forgiven if you have to Google it.)

Mayor de Blasio’s New York is neither a city on the brink (despite this past week’s deadly terror attack) nor a city reborn. Crime is down, and test scores are up, but few seem to be paying close enough attention to know that.

At last, here’s an image that floods to mind: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

To be fair, no one was shrugging at Terminal 5, the music club on West 56th Street, this past Monday, as the mayor took the stage with his wife, Chirlane McCray, and Senator Bernie Sanders, in what passes for a climactic campaign appearance in a mayoral battle that is shaping up to be as lopsided as ... something incredibly lopsided. Polls show the mayor, seeking a second term, ahead of his Republican challenger 61 percent to 17 percent. (Extra credit if you can name Mr. de Blasio’s Republican challenger — double extra credit if you can spell it: It’s Nicole Malliotakis.)

Despite the presence of Mr. Sanders, the hall was maybe half full. Efforts to get a “four more years!” chant faded quickly as the mayor, looking like a retired Knicks power forward (he is 6-foot-5), rose to tower over the podium in a gray suit and yellow power tie.

“I want to start with a tale of audacity,” Mr. de Blasio said, sounding more amiable than audacious, before ticking off his administration’s accomplishments, which included universal pre-K, two rent freezes and free legal counsel for people facing eviction.

The mayor spoke glowingly of Mr. Sanders as the shining beacon of his own “progressive” politics. (Mr. de Blasio backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.)

“Bernie Sanders defines the idea of audacity,” he said, showing America’s left “that we had a power that we didn’t even know we had.”

A crowd of union members in red jackets sipped beer from plastic cups in the back. That seemed fitting: The affable, jocky Mr. de Blasio, more than any mayor in memory, certainly fits the time-honored political test of “who would you want to have a beer with?” (If you tried to play quarters with Mr. Giuliani, he’d probably arrest you for gambling.)

But the mayor tacitly acknowledged that he is more of a conduit for a political philosophy than a lightning rod.

“The candidate matters,” he said, quoting a Sanders talking point, “but the movement matters even more.”

Mayor de Blasio’s movement, such as it is, has left a mark. Despite howls that changes to policing would send the city spiraling back to the “Death Wish” 1970s, school crime is down and major crimes are down 9 percent during his tenure — with, the administration says, a 93 percent reduction in the “stop and frisk” tactics by police that long have marred the daily life of, in particular, young African-Americans. What’s more, a recent Quinnipiac University survey reported that 82 percent of likely African-American voters expressed a favorable opinion of the mayor.

The problem is that Mr. Giuliani long ago cemented his legacy as the crime fighter mayor in the public imagination, however deserved that may be. Any mayor who follows is simply Crime Fighter 1B.

Mayor Bloomberg never achieved quite the same action-hero persona, but as an archetype of the politician-as-C.E.O., he was nationally famous enough that he is still having to explain why he did not grace the 2016 presidential ticket with his presence.

Mayor de Blasio, in theory, might someday enter the White House (without joining a group tour). But as what, exactly? What is his “brand?” Many of his administration’s headline-making initiatives seem comically pointillist in scope, even absurdist, as if conjured by a late-night Mad Libs sessions in City Hall. Who can forget the crackdown on motorcycle wheelies? The striking down of the ban on ferret ownership? The new curbs on subway pole dancing?

That is the outsider’s view, anyway. To those who work in or around city politics, this administration has been anything but dull. The mayor — at times feisty, at times aloof — has become embroiled in countless headline-grabbing tussles with the tabloids, the police force and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. He has had to fight off both a state and federal investigation into his fund-raising.

Legacy, however, is about perception, not policy, and when it comes to perception, timing is everything. It is neither fair nor sane to credit (or blame) a mayor with everything that happens in the city on his watch. Everyone does it anyway.

New Yorkers, for example, tend to forget the patronage scandals and crack wars of the years under Mayor Edward I. Koch. What they remember is “Hizzoner,” a cuddly cartoon vision of an irrepressible New Yorker who we think brought New York back from the dead.

Not that Mr. Koch had much to do with the booming stock market, which flooded the streets with Salomon Brothers bonus money that heated up the market for TriBeCa lofts, bad installation art and squid-ink pasta to surface-of-Mercury levels. Mayor Koch was not out there on the floor at Danceteria, teaching a young Madonna her moves, or scribbling rhymes for Slick Rick, or guiding Basquiat’s paintbrush. But it is all part of the lore of the “Koch years.”

Mayor de Blasio, by contrast, inherited a city that was in fine health, but even so, we’re left feeling around for its pulse.

The new mayor had not even moved from his home in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Gracie Mansion when celebrated New Yorkers, including David Byrne, the former frontman of the Talking Heads, started to decree the city “over.” In an oft-quoted Guardian essay from 2013, Mr. Byrne decried the sterile, moneyed New York as a lifeless museum city, like Venice — since “most of Manhattan and many parts of Brooklyn are virtual walled communities, pleasure domes for the rich.”

The next year, Moby, the techno pioneer, tea shop entrepreneur and longtime cultural truffle pig, went so far as to declare Los Angeles, not New York, the new mecca for young bohemians, in another Guardian essay. Having done the Horace Greeley thing himself, Moby, a former East Village resident, hailed his new West Coast headquarters as a place where young artists “can really experiment” — and live cheap and fail fast.

This creeping bouge-ification that left the city a sea of chain stores and Starbucks did not happen overnight. But even Mr. Bloomberg had the Strokes.

Those tattooed New York cool kids who haven’t yet decamped for Silver Lake might at least give Mayor de Blasio credit for trying. His tenure has seen the loosening of marijuana enforcement (low-level possession often results in a summons, not arrest, particularly for whites), and the overturning of the oft-derided cabaret law, which made it illegal to dance in bars, going back to the days of the Charleston.

Even so, the aging hipsters who forever croak about the grit and glamour of the bad old days will hardly find solace in a New York where CBGB is still a John Varvatos boutique, smoking remains taboo unless we’re talking lox at Barney Greengrass, and the police hand out $190 tickets for running a red light ... on a bicycle. Sodom and Gomorrah this ain’t.

Maybe we should count it as a blessing that, after a four-decade journey back from the brink, New York as a whole has, for what may be a very brief moment between recessions and terror attacks, the luxury of worrying about small things.

On a recent trip home to Brooklyn on the F train, for instance, I spotted a poster sponsored by the Office of the Mayor. “Midnight Snack,” the message read, over a close-up of a raccoon’s masked face. “Like all New Yorkers, raccoons know where to find a good meal. Please don’t feed NYC’s night life.”

The 98 specimens that the team had analyzed came from across the northern part of Siberia and had been collected over the course of four decades. The oldest were more than 60,000 years old, and the youngest, a specimen known as “Lonely Boy,” was about 4,000 years old. The genetic data did not provide insight into how old the mammoths were when they died, only their sex.

To obtain the DNA, the team first had to limit contamination. For that, they worked in a clean laboratory and wore lab suits similar to what Ebola doctors wear. They shaved off a few millimeters from the surface of their samples and then drilled into them to extract genetic data. They found that 66 were males and 29 were females.

The biggest limitation in the study is that their explanation for the skew is speculative and based mostly on the behavior of present-day elephants. The thought is that mammoths, like today’s elephants, lived in matriarchal societies where adult females protected the young. But around the ages of 14 or 15 when puberty set in, males left their herd and either became loners or joined bachelor groups, which were often led by inexperienced males. That was when they were more likely to do something risky, and find themselves stuck in frozen muck.

The natural traps buried their bodies quickly, protecting them from scavengers. The researchers said that their findings say nothing about the sex ratio of mammoths when they were alive, which they think may have been 50-50, only that males were more likely to die in ways that kept their remains preserved for thousands of years.

Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary molecular biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, said she was surprised by the results and that the team’s hypothesis was sensible given what we know about elephant behavior. She added that it would be interesting to see if there is a sex ratio difference for other prehistoric mammals preserved in the permafrost, like bison and horses.

Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan, said the hypothesis was well-founded, but that tusks should not have been used in the study because males often broke their tusks while fighting each other, but that did not mean they died.

The authors said that even discounting their tusk fragments and only using teeth, bone and hair samples, they still had more dead males.","Male Mammoths Died in ‘Silly Ways’ More Often Than Females, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/mammoth-fossils-males.html

There are far easier things to do than find an international ape smuggler.

For six months I searched for illicit dealers selling gorillas, orangutans, bonobos or chimps. Thousands have been lost in an underground business that makes millions of dollars off endangered animals and caters to rich pet collectors and unscrupulous zoos. Many apes are traumatized, and even if they are eventually rescued they’re “all goofed up,” in the words of one specialist, having endured serious abuse at the hands of their captors.

I began at the source, motoring hundreds of miles upriver in a precarious, pencil-thin canoe in the Democratic Republic of Congo to an area where many bonobos have disappeared. Then I traveled to Thailand, where some of the biggest wildlife gangs operate. When I finally found an ape trafficker and had him on the phone, I stumbled over what, exactly, to say. All my instincts told me to hammer him with questions like: Where are you getting your apes from? Who are you? But my role was to observe his illicit operation firsthand, which meant not scaring him off. It was a journalistic pickle.

The trafficker introduced himself as “Tom,” clearly a fake name. He had been discovered by Daniel Stiles, a well-known wildlife researcher in Kenya and a source of mine for years. Mr. Stiles had seen Tom’s online advertisements and arranged a deal. The plan was to meet in Bangkok, where Mr. Stiles would give Tom around $15,000 for two endangered baby orangutans, enabling the Thai authorities to swoop in and arrest the smuggler. I would report the events as they unfolded, without getting involved in any exchanges or arrests.

But the plan quickly raised some journalistic questions. Mr. Stiles mentioned to Tom that he might bring a friend named Jeffrey with him to check out the orangutans.

A prankster who liked to provoke — as the anonymous street artist Banksy has done since the 1990s — Mr. Hambleton came to public attention in the mid- to late 1970s by painting faux crime-scene outlines of bodies on pavement and adding “blood,” hoping to make people believe that a serial murderer was on the loose.

He began this “Image Mass Murder” series in his hometown, Vancouver, British Columbia, and then took it down the West Coast and across North America. He carried squeeze bottles filled with white paint for the outline and red paint for the make-believe blood.

“I remember stumbling on one of them and thinking it was a real crime scene,” Penny Arcade, the performance artist, says in “Shadowman,” a forthcoming documentary about Mr. Hambleton, directed by Oren Jacoby. After seeing another outline, she says, she realized that “this may be something else, but I didn’t have any language for it.”

Mr. Hambleton studied maps to determine where, in each city, he would strike next.

“I began to think I was murdering people, going back to my hotel covered in paint, blood, blood-red paint,” he says in the documentary, adding, “Blood has a beautiful color.”

Announcing that “Dick Trace-It,” also known as Richard Hambleton, was the private detective trying to solve the “murders” in Vancouver, he posted 4,000 fake wanted posters seeking the apprehension of “Mr. Reee” for the crimes.

In 1980, soon after moving to the Lower East Side, he started another urban art project, installing full-size photographic images of himself, dressed up in a suit and tie and staring, on walls around the city and elsewhere. He called it “I Only Have Eyes for You.” The images were printed on paper that stretched when moistened and faded to white shadows after three months.

His early “Shadowman” period led to shadow images of bucking horses and riders on walls and canvases. By 1984, he had turned to the Marlboro Man, the cowboy figure whose macho image promoted cigarettes for decades. Mr. Hambleton, who smoked, toyed with the image, painting shadow figures over it, sometimes mixing tobacco with black paint for what he called a “black lung” effect.

Richard Art Hambleton was born in Vancouver on June 23, 1952. His parents, Arthur and Vale Hambleton, survive him, as do two sisters and a brother.

By the mid-1980s he had begun his transition to creating enormous seascapes, among them turbulent ocean-wave paintings. “I wanted to do something that was a different sensibility,” he says in the documentary. “It’s about love.”

Reviewing an exhibition of Mr. Hambleton’s paintings at the Piezo Electric Gallery in the East Village in 1985, Michael Brenson of The New York Times wrote that the violence inherent in his early “Shadowman” work had not fully left him.

“There are three paintings called ‘Rainstorm,’ in which raging water seems to be rushing toward us from within the canvas,” Mr. Brenson wrote. “In each of the paintings, sea and sky rage a bit more until they seem on the point of swallowing everything.”

Mr. Hambleton soon moved into his “beautiful” period, painting landscapes with gold and silver leaf and tinted varnishes.

But by the early 1990s he had begun to withdraw from the art scene. Mr. Haring had died of AIDS at 31, Mr. Basquiat of a drug overdose at 27, and Mr. Hambleton, Ms. Woodward said, had become “paranoid about gallery culture and the impact on the artist and his freedoms.”

His life had begun to unravel. His drug use continued. His skin cancer worsened. He lived in increasing squalor.

“His goal was to reach the sublime,” Ms. Woodward said. “He used drugs to get there. It was just who he was.”

In 2009, two art entrepreneurs cajoled him into producing some new work, paintings of shadowy figures wearing suits, which were added to a retrospective exhibition in New York sponsored by Giorgio Armani. For his documentary, Mr. Jacoby filmed Mr. Hambleton as he procrastinated and battled with his anxious patrons.

The show, which traveled to Europe the next year, was successful, and a comeback seemed possible. But the moment did not last long. While Mr. Hambleton kept painting almost until he died, he was becoming increasingly frail. His cancer was eroding his face. His back was bowed and lopsided from his spinal conditions. He used his folding bicycle as a walker. At times he was homeless.

“At least Basquiat, you know, died,” he says bitingly in the documentary, during a scene shot in 2014. “I was alive when I died, you know.

While there are the inevitable “Infinity” rooms on view in Chelsea, the shows give her paintings a new forcefulness; with their fluctuating rhythms and imaginative images, they could even win over fans who only have eyes for her Instagrammable environments.

On all fronts, Ms. Kusama has a formidable urge toward art and fame fueled by what seems to be a steely will and also a great mental focus — partly a function of psychological imbalances that have led to periods of hospitalization. (She began to experience visual and auditory hallucinations as a child and they continue.) She has characterized art as her chance for salvation both here and in the afterlife.

Now 88, Ms. Kusama works nonstop and, if you’re wondering, does all the painting herself, save for a ground color applied by assistants. Recently she shifted her workweek from five days to six, saving Sunday for writing, reading, talking on the phone and making smaller paintings. She and her art run the gamut from avant-garde to popular to outsider to whiz-bang conjuring. The pixieish creature we see in a bright orange wig wearing clothes printed with patterns from her art is only her most recent public persona. She plays cute grandma to Jeff Koons’s cheerful robot, to cite another widely known artist’s self-presentation.

The new Zwirner space in New York, on East 69th Street, is presenting “Infinity Nets,” a beautiful display of 10 paintings, all from this year, that make a surprisingly good case for Ms. Kusama’s continuing reprises of her Net paintings from the early 1960s. Who knows how many of these works exist, but individually they can mesmerize.

The Hamar, numbering 45,000 throughout the valley, are known to be pastoralists. The village was overflowing with cattle. As in Dus, the dwellings were simple, built of sticks and grass, and well ordered. Young men tended cattle while a woman skinned and butchered a goat with the help of her toddler, who hung pieces of the animal on a fence beside an AK-47 and a belt of ammo.

“The AK-47 has replaced the spear,” Mr. Jones said.

Mr. Biwa nodded. “As long as you have AK, you are respected,” he said. “Your family feels safe and proud. Someone with no AK, people look down on them. If you do not have AK your family will go to someone who does.”

They were American-made, I was told, gathered during the war in neighboring Sudan.

But they are not cheap,” Mr. Biwa said.

“How much do they cost?” I asked.

“Five cows,” he said.

Beside firearms, I witnessed few other accommodations to the contemporary world in the Omo. Yet for a place so far off the grid, news traveled fast throughout the valley. While in the Hamar village we heard word of a nearby bull-jumping ceremony. The bull jump is a ritual initiation to manhood for both the Hamar and Karo communities. We headed east.

At the end of a long, deeply rutted road we came upon a dusty village in the midst of a celebration. Old men and women gathered in the shade. Young men painted their faces red and white. Young women were draped in skirts and wore large bells wrapped around their calves. Their hair was ornately done in rings caked with ochre-colored mud. Each carried a small horn and blew it incessantly.

When one young woman turned away from me I noticed fresh welts on her bare back, dripping blood; she seemed unaware and continued to dance. Then I saw her approach a young man, stand close in front of him, and blow her horn in his face. She began to jump up and down, her bells clanging, her horn blaring. The young man bent to the ground and picked up a long switch and raised it over his head. The woman blew her horn more insistently, then suddenly stopped. She stared at the young man. He struck her with the whip, which snapped around her body and lashed across her back with a sharp cracking sound. She did not flinch. She lifted her horn, blew it in his face and danced away, fresh blood rising on her back. The same performance was repeated again and again by many of the young women. Their backs were covered in old scars and new welts, yet none of them displayed any outward signs of pain.

As the sun was setting, a dozen bulls were led to a clearing and aligned flank to flank. The women clustered together and began jumping, their bells ringing out, their horns blasting. Others began to chant. Suddenly a naked young man leapt up on the back of the first bull and raced across the spine of each. He jumped down after the last bull, but then he was up again, racing across their backs in the other direction. He repeated the back-and-forth exercise three times. If he fell it would be a disgrace he would carry for life, Mr. Biwa had warned me. But the youth never faltered — the next morning he would awake a man, able to sit among the elders.

The women continued to blow their horns and the celebration continued on into the night. We drove away under a moonless sky, the Southern Cross hanging low, silence filling our car.

The next morning we headed up river to a small village of the Nyangatom people. Relations between Karo and Nyangatom have long been strained. Intertribal conflicts over cattle rustling and grazing land have kept the valley bristling with internal strife for decades, passed down from generation to generation, Mr. Biwa said.

“Where we are going, this was our land until 15 years ago,” Mr. Biwa said as he throttled our engine through the brown water. “The Nyangatom are fierce fighters. They pushed us across the river. Our women tell us we are weak. Not just with their words. They dance — in front of everyone. It is a shame we wear.”

We passed large crocodiles cooling themselves on the muddy banks, their jaws resting open. Black-and-white colobus monkeys leapt from branches of fig trees. A dugout canoe sat unattended on the riverbank. A Goliath heron lumbered into the air.

In time the heavy foliage lining the river thinned, then grew sparse. Thirty-foot cliffs began to rise up and the landscape turned parched. Ahead, on the west bank, bony cattle were drinking from the river, kicking a choking dust high into the sky and across the sun, casting everything in an eerie patina. Atop the cliff, two men stood sentry. One had an AK-47 slung from his shoulder; the other wore what in a more urban setting might have been called a hipster hat. The tribes wore a mishmash of clothing — brightly colored traditional wraps, animal skins and adornments, mixed freely with Chelsea football jerseys, rakish caps and fatigue shorts — creating an all too apt picture of Africa’s disparate influences, all vying for dominance.

The men on the cliff greeted us with stares, and we set out across the arid land. Distant hills of Kenya were visible to the south. Three young girls with water jugs balancing on their heads silently caught up with us. One carried the designs of scarification — small, raised scars created by rubbing charcoal in deliberately administered cuts, causing the skin to welt in intricate patterns. They made this two-mile walk to and from the river twice daily — in Africa carrying water is women’s work.

At the outskirts of the village, a half-dozen expressionless men loitered. The tallest sported a vaguely military-looking beret, worn at a jaunty angle, and an AK-47. The rest held long sticks. Some wore rubber sandals made from scavenged truck ties; the others were barefoot.

Many Nyangatom are seminomadic and this village appeared haphazardly thrown together, as if built in a rush, without care. There was no central meeting area, no sense of organization. Children did not rush to greet us. We huddled with the men in the scant shade of a scraggly date tree. Cigarettes were passed around and smoked.

Photo

In time, more than a dozen women emerged from the honeycomb-shaped dwellings that looked as if they could neither contain nor shelter life. One old woman began to chant, then just as suddenly stopped. All wore heavy ropes of beaded necklaces piled high and were wrapped from the waist in once colorful cloth, and several held small children. Fatigue hung in the blistering heat. It would have been difficult to imagine daily life clinging closer to the edge of existence.

“The cradle of mankind is no Garden of Eden,” Mr. Jones said softly as we tracked back cross the barren land to the boat.

Back down the river, the mood was more celebratory — a ceremony was underway in Dus. Two hundred men from Mr. Biwa’s Karo community were gathering in a large semicircle on a bluff above the river. Seating was arranged from the youngest to the most senior elder. I was offered a spot in the dirt much too far along the timeline for my liking.

A bull was being roasted over an open fire in the center of the gathering. Three men with machetes hacked the animal to pieces. Chunks of meat and fat, clinging to large bones, were deposited onto small beds of leaves before the assembled. A part of the animal I couldn’t identify was dropped in front of me. The old man beside me with heavily pierced ears and a pointed stick protruding below his lower lip offered me his knife. He watched as I sliced into the mysterious blob, then grinned as I put it in my mouth. Just beyond the circle a dozen hooded vultures gathered.

When the entire animal had been consumed, one of the elders got up and began to speak.

“Our approach to the environment is damaged, our political system is damaged and our communication with each other — especially through social media — is deteriorating,” Mr. Fairey said, ticking off themes in his new work. “But this show is not all about me being angry and apocalyptic; I’m trying to diagnose problems and move forward.”

Malliotakis as Manager: Lessons From Hurricane Sandy and Albany

The government of New York City is enormous, with more than 295,000 full-time employees and an annual budget of $85 billion, presenting a host of challenges for any manager. The New York Times asked Nicole Malliotakis , the Republican candidate for mayor, about her approach to management, the experiences that would inform her decisions as a manager of city government and her vision for New York City over the next four years.

Ms. Malliotakis spoke with The Times in a conference room in the Midtown office tower where she has her campaign headquarters. Read a similar interview with Mayor Bill de Blasio , Ms. Malliotakis’ Democratic opponent.

This interview has been condensed and edited.

Q. What in your life, in your work experience, prepares you to lead the biggest municipal government in the United States?

A. First of all, seven years in the Legislature. I have a good understanding of government, just how it works, what needs to be done to get things accomplished. I’ve established good relationships with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and that’s very important, particularly now where we’re seeing a rift between the mayor and the governor. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo, following what was a crisis situation in my district, with Hurricane Sandy having devastated my district.

Hundreds of families were affected by Hurricane Sandy, and so I had to work under pressure, under a serious devastation in getting my constituents food, water, clothing. Getting them emergency shelter. That is real emergency management, crisis management, on-the-job training that I had during the months following Hurricane Sandy.

Q. What did you learn about what worked in managing a large group of people and what doesn’t work?

A. I was coordinating efforts of hundreds of volunteers at a time, even on various cleanup efforts. I think it’s about having good people helping you. I think with what we see now in the administration is you have ideologues. I really intend on bringing in people in my administration who have, not only a passion for a particular area, but have also the capability to implement things.

When you look at the recovery program, seven years in the Assembly has also trained me to see where there’s mismanagement and where there are things that are inefficient. And if you look at the Hurricane Sandy recovery program, the rebuilding program, Build it Back, that is the poster child of mismanagement.

Q. You said you worked with Governor Cuomo after Sandy. How many times did you speak to Governor Cuomo and —

A. I would work with his agency. I was dealing with, we had a person who was assigned to Staten Island, or we had multiple people that were assigned. So personally speaking, one-on-one with the governor, I had not.

Q. How many employees do you have as an Assembly member?

A. I mean roughly 10 altogether with …

Q. Full-time, paid employees?

A. Full time? Well, you know what the Assembly members’ budget is right?

We just want to establish the baseline here.

All right, so you’re trying to belittle my job, is that what you’re trying to do?

We’re talking about management, and so ...

Management doesn’t necessarily mean the people who are reporting to you. There’s a lot more than that. We utilize volunteers, we utilize interns. That’s important. It’s not just the two full-time, I have what, three full-time people? It’s not just that, I have part-time staff, I’ve got volunteers whom I rely on who serve almost as part-time or full-time staff; it’s just not costing the taxpayer money.

I would say that I do a lot more with less than other Assembly members do who have three or four times the amount of staff that I have. That’s also a major display of my management ability, is to do more with less.

Image If elected mayor, Ms. Malliotakis said that she intended to keep an open dialogue with city workers. Credit Holly Pickett for The New York Times

Q. How you would approach managing the enormous operation of city government?

A. First of all, I feel it’s important to surround yourself with people who reflect your work ethic. My chief of staff is one of the hardest. I would put my chief of staff up against anybody else because the hours and the amount of time that he would put in, the dedication to the position. I will be surrounding myself with people who are passionate about the area that they’re focused on. I see a lot of, actually, Democratic colleagues whom I would like to bring into my administration because they are not only passionate but they’re capable. And I think that that’s really important. You don’t want people who are just ideologues, which is what I see right now. You want people who have ideas and have vision and have the ability to implement.

I want to have an open dialogue with my commissioners. So I would like to have a weekly call or biweekly call, depending on — obviously, there’s a lot of agencies — and being really somebody who meets with and is accessible to the leadership of each department. I feel there’s a lot of apathy right now with city workers. And I feel that the rank-and-file doesn’t have a voice or a seat at the table. So, I want to know from the people who are the first line.

Q. How would you do that?

A. I’m going to go personally and will pick a handful of employees who are on the front lines and talk to them. And say, “What are you hearing? What are you experiencing? What is it like out there?” And I feel the second thing that’s very important is the public. I want to have my town halls at the beginning of my term, not at the end of my term. I feel that we need to work closer with the borough presidents. We need to work closer with the City Council members, because they know their community better than anybody else.

I’m not someone who’s looking to be a dictator and force things down throats — but instead I want to have the people and the city workers part of the conversation. Of course, at the end of the day, I make the decision because I’m the executive, but I think that it’s important to listen to the opinions of those who are closest to the ground.

Q. How would you manage a situation in which you have a policy goal in mind that the local officials disagree with, and you’re convinced that you’re right?

I’m going to be listening and getting their take and getting all the information but at the end of the day, you know, I’m the mayor and I’m going to be making those decisions based on what I think overall is right. An effective leader listens and then makes a decision based on having information, all the information.

Q. You would be the youngest mayor in a century. Tell New Yorkers how your age would impact your mayoralty and what about New Yorkers who say they want someone who is more seasoned?

I bring a new, fresh vision. I am among the new crop of leaders who are taking office, and it’s not just happening here in the United States, it’s happening across the world. I mean we just saw the new head of France, we just, I think it was Austria, right, the other day? I’m pretty sure it was Austria, you can look it up later. But we’re seeing leaders of nations who are emerging. It would be good for New York City because I’m going to bring New York City into the 21st century.

We have a lightning round. It’s very fun.

It’s fun? I hope something’s fun today.

We’re going to throw out some words or phrases and we want you to say the first word that pops into your head.

Q. Do you think that the city has been too lax in allowing the homeless to sleep on the city’s streets, subways, and hasn’t done enough to address both the shelter issue and street homelessness?

A. I do. Look at the disaster that’s been made. When you’re spending nearly double on Department of Homeless Services and the problem’s getting worse. That’s ineffective management. I really feel that they’ve been very lax. I think there needs to be more urgency in transitioning people out of the shelter system.

I don’t agree with reducing the welfare-to-work programs. I feel that we need more. There is a waiting list for vocational training opportunities. We should provide them. I think there’s a lot of things that could be done with existing city and state land that could help relieve the issue. You have a lot of seniors in homeless shelters. You have veterans in homeless shelters. Let’s start with giving property to nonprofits who can provide housing for them as a permanent solution as opposed to what the mayor’s looking to do, to build 90 additional homeless shelters at an expense of hundreds of millions of dollars. You can’t allow people to sleep all over Penn Station. Underneath expressways, there are encampments. This is not acceptable. That’s a breakdown, breakdown of society.

Q. Do you think it’s a problem, then, that the city has a right to shelter?

A. I think it is a major problem. You know, there was legal action, it was upheld. And so it’s something that has to be dealt with. But so we can’t create an environment where people feel that they can sleep on the street, aggressively panhandle, sleep on the subway. There has to be some order as well.

Q. What would you do to establish that order?

A. Well I think we fell behind the 8-ball here because we didn’t build more supportive housing, like we got, there’s a lot of catch-up that needs to be done.

Q. How would you instruct your police commissioner regarding the use of stop and frisk?

A. I think that stop and frisk is a tool that, when used appropriately, it is effective. But in no way should it be a tool that we’re looking to target any particular group. But if someone is stopped and they’re questioned, there’s a reasonable suspicion, I think to frisk is appropriate, but it’s got to be used appropriately.

I’ve spoken to mothers of victims who have been killed by gun violence, and they wished that their perpetrator was stopped, questioned and frisked. So I think we certainly shouldn’t go back to the Bloomberg days of stop and frisk, but we should allow our police, and we should properly train them, and allow them to utilize it as a tool when it’s necessary and there’s reasonable suspicion.

Q. You’ve suggested that crime in the city is higher than the Police Department acknowledges. Do you think that they’re presenting false statistics?

No, I don’t think that they’re presenting false statistics, but look what happened the other day when the mayor’s saying summonses are down 90 percent — that doesn’t mean that public urination has gone down or that smoking marijuana in the street has gone down. That just means that it’s not being enforced. I think it’s great murder is down. But I think when most people walk down the street, they’re not afraid of being murdered, they’re afraid of, women, in particular, are afraid of rape, you know men, afraid of maybe some type of assault.

Q. In a recent poll you performed far better with white voters than with blacks or Hispanics. Why do you think that is?

A. I don’t know. You’d have to ask them. But I do believe that I’ve been getting a great response in the Latino community as I travel around. I’ve done a lot of campaigning. My mother comes around with me, I have Assemblyman Jose Rivera traveling to various events in the Bronx, and we’ve received a great response.

Image Ms. Malliotakis supports President Trump but she says that some of his policies “are not good for New York City.” Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times

Q. Do you think that President Trump has been or will be harmful to New York City?

A. I think that the job of the mayor is to make sure that he’s not harming New York City. I think some of the policies that he’s putting out there are not good for New York City.

Q. Namely?

A. Well, so for example, anything that diminishes services for Medicaid. Anything that’s going to change our tax structure where we can’t write off income tax or property tax is going to be hurtful. Those are my concerns. I’ve already said how I feel about the DACA, that I don’t believe we should be stripping status from DACA recipients.

Q. One of the things that people say about this mayor is that he doesn’t go out and enjoy the city that much. Do you envision yourself out on the town?

A. I’ve never been someone who was into bars or clubs. Even when I was in college. But what I think one of the great experiences of running this campaign has been, being able to go out into the communities and just meeting people, experiencing their culture, trying different restaurants.

You need to ride the subway. You need to take the ferry. I want to be someone who’s out with the people and plan on going to a gym nearby Gracie Mansion. I’m not going to be going to Staten Island to go to the gym. But I still want to be able to do things that I love. CrossFit. Boxing. Yoga. Obviously when time permits. I mean I don’t anticipate a lot of free nights.

At the Waldorf Astoria, she caught glimpses of Donald J. Trump, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

That’s to name just a few of the politicians Regina Gatewood spotted in her 16 years as a banquet waitress at the Waldorf, on Park Avenue in Manhattan.

One time, Phillip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, asked her for directions to the restroom. “I feel like I know you,” she recalled telling him. “And he said, ‘You do know me.’”

Ms. Gatewood has come far since her mid-30s, when she entered New York City’s shelter system with her two sons after their father left. She worked long hours as a waitress and in temporary jobs until she could afford public housing, and eventually her own home on Staten Island. She started at the Waldorf in 2000 and worked her way up, becoming a full-time employee in 2010.

“I never thought about retiring,” Ms. Gatewood, 62, said. “I thought I would die in the Jade Room.”

But when the luxury hotel closed its doors on March 1 for years of renovations, Ms. Gatewood found herself without a job, along with more than 1,200 unionized hotel employees . Although they had known the closing was coming, Ms. Gatewood said, there was still an atmosphere of disbelief. Her work at the Waldorf was highly specialized — waiters served in pairs and did not use a computer-ordering system — and Ms. Gatewood worried such specialization would make it difficult for her to find employment elsewhere.

On the afternoon that the Waldorf closed, Hilton Worldwide, which manages the hotel, treated employees to a party in the Grand Ballroom, complete with champagne.

“But champagne is for celebrations,” Ms. Gatewood said. “And what were we celebrating? We were losing our jobs. We needed a good strong vodka, or maybe a Scotch.”

At the end of the party, the employees turned toward the stage, where a large mock light switch was flipped and the lights went out.

Seeking a fit for her specialized skills was not Ms. Gatewood’s only concern: She feared the challenge of finding work in her 60s . She joined the 91,000 New York State residents who are 55 or older and looking for work. About a third of people in that demographic face long-term unemployment, or at least 27 weeks without work, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics.

At the party, Ms. Gatewood said, many colleagues whispered hopes of returning when the hotel reopens. She hoped her $10,000 post-tax severance package would help carry her through, along with her savings of $50,000, roughly her annual salary. Ms. Gatewood provides for her two adult sons and her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer’s disease. They live together in a home she rents for $1,000 a month.

Her younger son, Isaiah Page, 27, got a minimum-wage job about a year ago stocking shelves at a supermarket, but he is not yet able to contribute to the family’s expenses. His brother, William Page, 33, has been out of work for many years.

With her savings in jeopardy, Ms. Gatewood decided she needed to develop skills for a different career. In March, she enrolled at Grace Institute , a job-training program serving low-income women in New York City. During a recent interview, Ms. Gatewood walked the green-and-white halls of the building in the financial district, her head held high, her pace brisk.

“This is my home away from home,” she said with a smile.

She commuted an hour and a half from Staten Island to Lower Manhattan by train, ferry and CitiBike to attend classes five days a week in professional development and typing. In August, she graduated from the institute, which is affiliated with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York , one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. That month, Catholic Charities provided her with $279 from the fund for a suit, shirt, shoes and coat for job interviews.

Last week, Ms. Gatewood started a temporary full-time job at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where she works as a room service attendant, filling in for a staff member on leave.

Hilton, when contacted this week for this article, offered to help Ms. Gatewood find a permanent job at one of its other locations in New York City.

Before securing temporary employment, Ms. Gatewood received $425 a week in unemployment benefits. She has many years of hospitality experience, but said she would like to one day work in real estate.

Ms. Gatewood said she wished that she could have spent more time with her sons when they were younger. After her partner left she began waitressing, and the flexible hours allowed her to see her sons off to school and day care. But long shifts kept her out sometimes until 5 a.m., leaving her older son to look after his brother. In 1998, they settled in the Staten Island neighborhood of Park Hill, where they still live today. Ms. Gatewood would occasionally work seven days a week and was not home enough, she said.

She wants her sons to find jobs they are passionate about and make lives for themselves.

“My job as a mother isn’t done,” she said. “I still have to continue to keep them, to assist them, to guide them. I have to fulfill my responsibility to them. If there’s parenting left to be done, you keep doing it. And I’m still going.”

Ironically, Mr. Trump’s comments may have contributed to the decision not to sentence him to prison. After Mr. Trump seemed last month to endorse his harsh criticism from the campaign trail, Colonel Nance ruled that he would consider the comments as mitigating evidence at sentencing.

With the sentence still facing review by General Abrams and military appellate judges, Mr. Trump’s post-verdict comments on Twitter seemed to bolster efforts by the defense to have the sentence thrown out on appeal, some military law experts said, on the grounds that the president had unlawfully influenced the case.

“Trump just exponentially increased Bergdahl’s chances of getting this whole case tossed on appeal,” said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and a retired Air Force lawyer.

The tweet could be interpreted as an effort to pressure officers who still have some control over the sergeant’s fate not to reconsider his sentence, military law experts said.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s chief defense lawyer, Eugene R. Fidell, called the sentence “a tremendous relief” and said his client was still absorbing it.

Standing outside the military courthouse here, Mr. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, then took sharp aim at the commander in chief.

“President Trump’s unprincipled effort to stoke a lynch-mob atmosphere while seeking our nation’s highest office has cast a dark cloud over the case,” he said. “Every American should be offended by his assault on the fair administration of justice and disdain for basic constitutional rights.”

Even though the defense had told the judge that a dishonorable discharge would be appropriate, Mr. Fidell said he hoped that it would be overturned. He noted that such a discharge would deprive his client of health care services and other “benefits he badly needs” from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Sergeant Bergdahl is expected to return to an Army base as the case winds through the appeals process.

Sergeant Bergdahl was 23 and a private first class when he left his base in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009. Army investigators would later characterize his departure as a delusional effort to hike to a larger base and cause enough of a stir that he would get an audience with a senior officer to report what he felt were problems in his unit.

But the soldier, who is now 31, was captured by the Taliban within hours and spent five years as a prisoner, his treatment worsening after every attempt to escape. He was beaten with copper cables and held in isolation in a metal cage less than seven feet square. He suffered dysentery for most of his captivity, and cleaned feces off his hands with his own urine so that he could eat enough bread to survive.

The military searched for him, and several troops were wounded during those missions. One of them, Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, was shot through the head and lost the ability to walk, talk or take care of himself, and now has minimal consciousness. His wife, Shannon, testified that he is not even able to hold hands with her anymore. On a separate rescue mission, Senior Chief Petty Officer Jimmy Hatch, a Navy SEAL, suffered a leg wound that required 18 surgical procedures and ended his long career in special operations.

Army investigators quickly dismissed claims that troops had died searching for Sergeant Bergdahl — who was promoted during captivity — or that he had intended to defect to the Taliban. They suggested that he could be prosecuted for desertion and for some lesser crimes. But in March 2015, the Army raised the stakes, accusing him not only of desertion but also of misbehavior before the enemy, an ancient but rarely charged crime punishable by up to life in prison. In this case, the misbehavior was endangering the troops sent to search for him.

Even so, the sergeant’s defense seemed to have some momentum. The Army’s chief investigator on the case testified at Sergeant Bergdahl’s preliminary hearing that he did not believe any jail time was warranted, and the preliminary hearing officer suggested the whole episode might have been avoided “had concerns about Sergeant Bergdahl’s mental health been properly followed up.”

But at Fort Bragg, General Abrams ordered that Sergeant Bergdahl face a general court-martial on both charges.

Once Mr. Trump was inaugurated, Sergeant Bergdahl’s defense team demanded that the case be dismissed. There was no way the sergeant could receive a fair trial, his lawyers said, since everyone in the military justice system now reported to President Trump as commander in chief.

Colonel Nance labeled Mr. Trump’s comments about Sergeant Bergdahl “disturbing,” but declined to throw out the case. Then, last month, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse his earlier sentiments about Sergeant Bergdahl, saying, “I think people have heard my comments in the past.”

After another protest by the defense, Colonel Nance ruled that he would consider the president’s comments as mitigation evidence.

During the sentencing hearing, Sergeant Bergdahl apologized for his misconduct, saying he never intended for anyone to get hurt, and that he grieved “for those who have suffered and their families.”

He added, “I’m admitting I made a horrible mistake.”

The lead Army prosecutor, Maj. Justin Oshana, drew a comparison between Sergeant Bergdahl and those who were hurt through his actions.

“It wasn’t a mistake,” Major Oshana said of the sergeant’s decision to walk off his base. “It was a crime.”

Responding to testimony about how captivity had left Sergeant Bergdahl with physical pain, Major Oshana noted that at least the sergeant was able to talk about it. Sergeant Allen was constantly in pain, too, he said, but no longer possessed the ability to describe it.

“Sergeant Bergdahl does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices,” Major Oshana added.

The defense argued that Sergeant Bergdahl had already suffered a severe penalty for his crimes by being tortured during five years in captivity.

“It is undisputed that Sergeant Bergdahl paid a bitter price for the decision he made,” one of his lawyers, Capt. Nina Banks, told Colonel Nance. She said that a dishonorable discharge was appropriate, but asked that he be spared prison.

The defense argued that Sergeant Bergdahl’s decision to walk away was influenced by a then-undiagnosed severe personality disorder.

Captain Banks also told the judge that the harsh comments by Mr. Trump meant that the sergeant’s persecution did not stop when he was freed.

“Sergeant Bergdahl has been punished enough,” she said.",Bowe Bergdahl Avoids Prison for Desertion; Trump Calls Sentence a ‘Disgrace’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/us/bowe-bergdahl-sentence.html

“The climate has changed and is always changing,” Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said in the statement. “As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on ‘remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth’s climate’” to greenhouse gas emissions, he added.

Despite the scientific consensus presented in the report, the Environmental Protection Agency has scrubbed references to climate change from its website and barred its scientists from presenting scientific reports on the subject.

The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to warming. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, asserted Wednesday that “the science is out” on whether humans cause climate change.

Their agencies referred questions to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversaw the research.

The report has provoked consternation in scientific circles for months. Though the study has been in the works since 2015, several scientists said the election of Mr. Trump, who has labeled climate change a “canard” and appointed cabinet members who disputed the scientific consensus, caused them to worry the report would be blocked or buried.

That did not happen. Scientists who worked on the report said none of the 13 agencies that reviewed it tried to undermine its findings or change its wording.

“I’m quite confident to say there has been no political interference on the message,” said David Fahey, a NOAA scientist and a lead author of the report. “Whatever fears we had weren’t realized.”

Responsibility for approving the report fell to Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, who generally believes in the validity of climate science and thought the issue would have been a distraction from the tax push, according to an administration official with knowledge of the situation.

One of Mr. Cohn’s top policy deputies, Michael Catanzaro, had the authority to block, delay or change the report. But Mr. Catanzaro, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush and former Speaker John A. Boehner, chose instead to follow the lead of the Obama administration by referring the report back to more than a dozen federal agencies for feedback.

That review, according to two people familiar with the process, went relatively smoothly, surprising some scientists who worked on the report who had expected more resistance.

The only significant turbulence, according to one person familiar with the process, came from a midlevel political appointee at the Department of Energy who grilled the report’s authors on changes that had been made to temperature and other climate data over the years. The authors responded by adding a more detailed explanation of their methodology and all of the agencies then gave their approval, the person said.

Mr. Trump was barely aware of the report’s existence, several White House officials said.

Some critics of climate change science attacked the report as the product of holdovers from the Obama administration and chastised the Trump administration for allowing it to be published.

“I’m saddened that they have decided they will let the permanent government, the civil servants, continue down this road without supervision,” said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group.

Scientists said the report’s findings were clear.

“This new report simply confirms what we already knew. Human-caused climate change isn’t just a theory, it’s reality,” said Michael E. Mann, a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. “Whether we’re talking about unprecedented heat waves, increasingly destructive hurricanes, epic drought and inundation of our coastal cities, the impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. They are upon us. That’s the consensus of our best scientists, as laid bare by this latest report.”

The report says the Earth has set temperature highs for three years running, and six of the last 17 years are the warmest years on record for the globe. Weather catastrophes from floods to hurricanes to heat waves have cost the United States $1.1 trillion since 1980, and the report warns that such phenomena may become common.

“The frequency and intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to increase in the future as global temperature increases,” the report notes. “Extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world.”

In the United States, the report finds that every part of the country has been touched by warming, from droughts in the Southeast to flooding in the Midwest to a worrying rise in air and ground temperatures in Alaska, and conditions will continue to worsen.

“This assessment concludes, based on extensive evidence, that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,” the report states. “For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.”

The findings, other researchers said, create an unusual situation in which the government’s policies are in direct opposition to the science it is producing.

“This profoundly affects our ability to be leaders in developing new technologies and understanding how to build successful communities and businesses in the 21st century,” said Christopher Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “Choosing to be dumb about our relationship with the natural world is choosing to be behind the eight ball.”","U.S. Report Says Humans Cause Climate Change, Contradicting Top Trump Officials",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/climate/us-climate-report.html

In July, the Food and Drug Administration took the important step of approving two final-phase clinical trials to determine whether a party drug that has long been on the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Schedule I list of banned substances could be used to treat a psychiatric condition that afflicts millions. The drug is MDMA, a psychedelic commonly known as Ecstasy, previously deemed to have “no currently accepted medical use.” The trials aim to determine whether the drug is, as earlier trials have suggested, a safe and effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, when combined with psychotherapy.

The F.D.A. approval is a beacon of hope for the roughly eight million Americans believed to suffer from PTSD, a group that includes victims of abuse, refugees and combat veterans. The shortcomings in the way we have typically treated PTSD mean that many are condemned to suffer from the condition for years, even decades, with little relief. Less than 20 percent of patients are estimated to get effective treatment through prescription psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft, which, along with psychotherapy, have been the global standard of mental health care since the 1990s.

This could change with the F.D.A.’s decision, which has given MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD the status of a potential “breakthrough therapy.” Based on promising early results, this designation permits the fast-tracking of trials in hopes of proving the drug, which has psychedelic and stimulant effects, to be safe and capable of doing what no other drug on the market can.

I consider myself living proof of the effectiveness of MDMA. A few years ago, I woke up confused and bruised, my head pounding. I had been the victim of a violent robbery. Although I remember little of the attack, the experience shattered me. In public, I kept up appearances. Behind closed doors, I was a wreck. I burst into sobbing fits for no apparent reason. Sleep, when I managed to get any, was filled with nightmares. I had PTSD.

The provision explicitly allows expectant parents to designate a “child in utero” as a beneficiary of a 529 plan.

Parents have long been able to set up 529 accounts for an unborn child, but the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn.

“An unborn child means a child in utero,” the provision states. “A child in utero means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, said the addition of the words “unborn child” was a major victory for their movement.

“It is fantastic because the unborn child is appropriately represented in the tax code,” she said. “All of these things represent a serious commitment to treating the unborn child, as she or he should be, equal and protected in the eyes of the law.”

The bill also contains a sought-after change by the religious right: repeal of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations like churches from engaging in political activity.

Eliminating it was an early campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s, and it has been a cause long championed by religious conservatives.

“Repealing the bigoted Johnson Amendment is long overdue,” Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said in a letter on Thursday to members of Congress.

“This clearly unconstitutional restriction on freedom of speech has been used by the Internal Revenue Service to harass, intimidate and persecute the faith community for over six decades,” he wrote. “It is long past time to repeal it and we strongly support this legislation’s provision restoring the full First Amendment rights of people of faith.”

Still, doing away with the Johnson Amendment is not a cause that unites all conservatives, nor is it one that liberals are likely to let go quietly because of the considerable clout it would give pastors in the electoral process.

“The entire reason Donald Trump promised religious leaders he would help get rid of the Johnson Amendment was to empower the Christian right,” said Peter Montgomery, a senior fellow for People for the American Way, a left-leaning political advocacy group.

Other aspects of the bill would make it harder for immigrant parents to claim the refundable child tax credit, even if their children were born in the United States. Under the legislation, filers would need to provide a Social Security number, rather than just a taxpayer identification number, in order to claim the benefit, which can be claimed even by those who owe no taxes. Social Security numbers are provided only to United States citizens or those authorized to work in the country.

The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the provision would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families, including about 80 percent born in the United States.

WASHINGTON — Deaths by drug overdose in the United States surged last year by more than 17 percent over 2015, another sign of the growing addiction crisis caused by opioids, according to a report released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Preliminary data from the 50 states show that from the fourth quarter of 2015, through the fourth quarter of 2016, the rate of fatal overdoses rose to nearly 20 people per 100,000 from 16.3 per 100,000.

It’s a good question to ask when planning a menu. The original New World Thanksgiving dinner — a several-days-long feast — was lavish, but it is likely that green vegetables were not abundant.

Gourds, melons, pumpkins and squashes were the vegetables of choice, or carrots and parsnips grown from seed brought by the settlers. Dried native corn was ground, and either baked into cakes or cooked for porridge. Berries and other wild fruits such as plums, gooseberries and grapes were much appreciated.

But mostly there was game to eat, and plenty of it. Wild turkeys and pheasants, ducks, geese and swans were spit-roasted, as was a vast supply of venison. Cod and lobster were plentiful. Shellfish was abundant, too; huge coastal beds were stacked with oysters, clams and mussels, just waiting to be plucked.

Over centuries, the Thanksgiving menu has changed. Giant turkeys and hams now dominate the meal, and vegetables have more real estate on the sideboard. In many respects, however, the repertoire has remained the same — somewhat bland and soft. We put forth mashed potatoes, soggy peas, green-bean casserole, creamed onions, marshmallow-topped canned sweet potatoes and bread stuffing. Salads are shunned by many Thanksgiving cooks. (With exceptions, of course.)

I get it. Nostalgia makes us, myself included, crave these dull and mellow accompaniments. Even so, I’m usually inclined to tinker just a little. I monkey around with the bird’s seasoning, and, for the vegetables, I want some bright flavors and colors to contrast with the generally monochromatic basics. I always turn my cranberries into spicy chutney, for instance. This year, I’m playing with basic vegetables like carrots, cauliflower and brussels sprouts.

Mashed carrots may bring baby food to mind, or a fancy French purée, but these “smashed” ones are something else, and they have texture. Add the salty tang of feta cheese and lots of chopped fresh mint, and the carrots’ sweetness becomes a playful partner in a new scheme. Throw a little garlic at them, and a hint of crushed red pepper.","Same Vegetables, New Flavors",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/dining/thanksgiving-vegetable-recipes.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Col. Jeffrey R. Nance, the sentencing judge, acknowledged the import of Trump’s toxic statements, but despite the protests of Sergeant Bergdahl’s lawyers, Colonel Nance felt that he could remain unbiased and refused to dismiss Sergeant Bergdahl’s case.

Sergeant Bergdahl and future troops would have benefited from a swift condemnation of Mr. Trump’s de facto attempts at judge-tampering. Sergeant Bergdahl’s sentence is under final review by military authorities, including the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, and on Friday, the president continued to try to exert influence, calling the sentence, as it stands, a “total disgrace to our country and our military.”

Sergeant Bergdahl will soon receive his dishonorable discharge. He will be a civilian with significant physical disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder and a very high risk of suicide. Of the six types of discharge, dishonorable is the most punishing. When he is discharged, Sergeant Bergdahl will be denied almost all reintegration benefits — including comprehensive medical — and he will also not be recognized as a veteran by the federal government. He will come back wounded to family and friends who love him, without the expert medical care of a country that must balance its responsibility to punish him and to heal him.

The trajectory of Sergeant Bergdahl’s career speaks to tragic and avoidable flaws in the military mental health care system. Sergeant Bergdahl suffers from schizotypal personality disorder, and it was only after a mental health-related discharge from the Coast Guard that the Army enlisted him on a medical waiver. If his illness had been treated before his crimes, he could have been eligible for an honorable discharge with benefits. The available military record shows that when Sergeant Bergdahl left his place of duty, he was an exemplary, idealistic young soldier who lived with mental illness, not a traitor.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s offenses put the lives of fellow soldiers at risk. At his court-martial, prosecutors highlighted several profound and permanent injuries to troops during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, but Army investigators have stated that none were killed during attempts to find him.

Sergeant Bergdahl has expressed profound remorse and admitted that he “made a horrible mistake” when he left his post. In his skewed logic, he believed that he “was trying to help,” and it was never his intention “for anyone to be hurt.”

There is still a chance for the military to review and reduce the sentence, but if they choose to uphold it, Sergeant Bergdahl deserves the immediate intervention of civilian-led authorities who have the power to use clemency to grant a less severe discharge. By definition, clemency is an act of mercy. It would not absolve Sergeant Bergdahl of guilt, but both the secretary of the Army and the Army Board for Correction of Military Records have the authority to use it to give him a less severe discharge that preserves the benefits that he needs to heal and to lead a long life.

Clemency is rare, but if Sergeant Bergdahl’s voluminous public record is a guide, I believe that he could present a strong case. Authorities must consider mitigating factors, including his in-service conduct, wounds he received in action, his mental health, and whether he met normal military accession standards.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s military service cannot be reduced to his crimes. I would argue that his profound and unexpected contribution to the military truly began the day he was captured.

Although Sergeant Bergdahl had left his post and put others in danger, he fought, resisted, collected a “gold mine” of intelligence on the enemy and — at great risk to his life — tried to escape multiple times, including a daring attempt in which he eluded the Taliban for eight and a half days. In time, his exemplary service to our country as a prisoner of war will direct and inspire the survival of other P.O.W.s.

If necessary, members of Congress should send a bipartisan letter to the secretary of the Army in support of a less severe discharge for Sergeant Bergdahl that ensures medical benefits. Moreover, this year, Congress must pass a bill that ensures medical care and disability benefits for all former prisoners of war, regardless of discharge status.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s permanently injured, would-be rescuers are selfless and brave. But we must remember that — regardless of Sergeant Bergdahl’s tragic and unnecessary circumstances of capture — it was the enemies of America who tortured him and tried to kill those who sought to rescue him.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s misguided crimes can’t be forgotten, but his punishment must have limits.

Many of these men now seek community online. Mr. Trump knows how to speak to them, and he adopted the modern man-child’s medium.

Today, young women are more likely to attend college than young men, while young men are more likely to live with their parents, and it’s not only student loan debt that’s driving them home. Economic shifts that have decreased employment in blue-collar jobs but increased opportunity in female-dominated sectors have had a psychic as well as financial impact. Care jobs are not jobs men are generally willing to take, in part because of the depressed pay, but also because of social constraints: Nursing, elder care and child care are women’s work.

A desire to reclaim this psychic masculinity is why Mr. Trump fetishizes a specific (and specifically white) kind of rough-hewed American maleness while embodying an envy-inducing lack of obligation. The white working men of Trump speeches have the kind of dirty-fingernail jobs so revered in the American imagination: coal miners, firefighters, autoworkers. In real life, more Trump voters work in cubicles than in coal mines. But the point was never Mr. Trump’s understanding of reality. It was his grasp of white male aspiration and identity.

Mr. Trump’s own life and actions paint an appealing picture of masculine entitlement for those who want power without the shackles of responsibility. He may not be the smartest or most qualified guy in just about any room, but his money allowed him to marry and reproduce with a succession of models, star in a reality television show, live in vulgar gold-plated glory, say whatever offensive thing danced through his brain and still make a successful run for president. It was a plus that in the three Trump marriages, there have been no “power couple” partnerships of equals, just Mr. Trump on “The Howard Stern Show” talking about his wife’s breasts and bragging that he never changed a diaper.

Most American men are unable to actually achieve this level of authority minus accountability; as a result, admiration for men like Mr. Trump gets paired with an “if I can’t have it, no one can” nihilism. White male power remains a dominant force in America, but it is no longer the only force that matters. For many men, this is not a leveling of the playing field, but a plundering of what was rightly theirs.

Resentful of the changing order of things, some men have simply leaned in to chaos: If the system no longer serves them, it will at least be fun to blow it all up. Which is exactly why the old rules of political engagement don’t work with Mr. Trump or his base.

The president is a perfect figurehead for this bizarre moment: a man who carries all of the negative characteristics of stereotypical masculinity while adopting almost none of the virtues, occupying the most powerful and exclusively male seat of power in the nation (and perhaps in the world), who ascended in large part because a yawning fear of female power kept one of the best-qualified candidates in history out of office. He is ego unchecked, narcissism in place of dignity.

In a 1961 essay for Vogue, Joan Didion wrote that people with “self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things.” The piece went on to say, “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character.” Character, she wrote, is “the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life.”

Our current president, who can’t even accept responsibility for his own social media use or admit that all-caps tweeting might suggest he’s angry about continuing criminal investigations and low poll numbers, may indeed be a new low. Mr. Trump has ushered in a fresh era of noxious manhood wherein bullying is conflated with toughness and self-interest is more important than self-respect. But all is not lost.

Regina LaBelle, who was chief of staff in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Barack Obama, said the recommendations recognized “the importance of proper and appropriate treatments” for addiction, particularly medications that help people avoid cravings and symptoms of withdrawal. But, she added, “There needs to be more funding for this.”

The head of the commission, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, suggested in a television interview Sunday that Mr. Trump would soon ask Congress to allocate far more money for fighting the nation’s addiction problem. “I would say that you’re going to see this president initially ask for billions of dollars to deal with this,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The White House issued a statement thanking the commission and saying it would review the recommendations.

It is hard to determine how much money is truly needed. When Senate Republicans added $45 billion in addiction treatment funds to an Obamacare repeal bill that ultimately failed, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, said that amount was akin to “spitting in the ocean.”

More Reporting on Opioids

Richard Frank, a health economics professor at Harvard Medical School who worked in the Obama administration, estimated that it could cost roughly $10 billion a year to provide medication and counseling to everyone with opioid use disorder who is not already in treatment. Treating opioid-dependent newborns, meeting the needs of children in foster care because of their parents’ addiction and treating hepatitis C and other illnesses common among opioid addicts would cost “many billions more,” Mr. Frank said.

Mr. Frank also cautioned that block grants would not work if the administration decided to include federal Medicaid funding for addiction treatment in them. “When one starts to carve out certain services as grants, as opposed to insurance funding, one undermines the insurance,” he said. “It is a method of killing Medicaid with 1,000 nicks.”

Some of the commission’s other recommendations included making it easier for states to share data from prescription drug monitoring programs, which are electronic databases that track opioid prescriptions, and requiring more doctors to check the databases for signs of “doctor shopping” before giving a patient opioids.

The commission encouraged the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to review policies that it claimed discouraged hospitals and doctors from prescribing alternatives to opioids, especially after surgery. According to the commission’s report, C.M.S. pays a flat, “bundled” payment to hospitals after patients undergo surgery, which includes treatment for pain. Because they get a flat fee, hospitals are encouraged to use cheap products – and most opioid medications are generic and inexpensive.

“Purchasing and administering a non-opioid medication in the operating room increases the hospital’s expenses without a corresponding increase in reimbursement payment,” the report said.

More broadly, the report said the federal government as well as private insurers should do a better job of covering a range of pain-management and treatment services, such as non-opioid medications, physical therapy and counseling. And it recommended that the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies eliminate any reimbursement policies that limit access to addiction medications and other types of treatment, including prior authorization requirements and policies that require patients to try and fail with one kind treatment before getting access to another.

One prevention measure the commission did not embrace is expanding syringe exchange programs, which public health experts say save money and lives by reducing the spread of H.I.V. and hepatitis C with contaminated syringes.

“I was hoping to see that in this report,” Ms. LaBelle said.

The commission’s members – Mr. Christie, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican; Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat; Pam Bondi, the Republican attorney general of Florida; Patrick Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island and Bertha Madras, a Harvard professor – all voted for the final recommendations, which came about a month later than expected.

His voice quaking with emotion, Mr. Kennedy said during the commission’s meeting Wednesday that Congress needed to appropriate sufficient funds for the initiative, suggesting at least $10 billion.

”This town doesn’t react unless it hears from real people“ who will vote in the next election, he said, nodding to guests who had testified about their families’ searing experiences with addiction, stigma, lack of treatment options and the refusal of insurance companies to cover treatment.

Mr. Kennedy also noted that insurance coverage is crucial to fighting addiction; in another commission meeting earlier this year, he took Republicans to task for working to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid.",Panel Recommends Opioid Solutions but Puts No Price Tag on Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/health/opioids-trump-commission.html

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

A scene from “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

• “What’s at the X?” Bob wondered as he looked at Will’s map. “Pirate treasure?” You may recall that as Mikey in “The Goonies,” one of the ur-texts of “Stranger Things,” Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willy’s loot. It was one of several fun meta moments this season. (See also: Max dismissing Lucas’s description of last season’s events as “a little derivative in parts.”)

• In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyce’s side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was. I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modine’s evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in “Aliens,” another of this series’ touchstones.

• “Mistakes have been made,” Dr. Owens told Nancy and Jonathan. “You killed Barbara,” Nancy countered. “Abundant mistakes,” he replied.

• R.I.P. Barb, finally.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season? Were you fine with Eleven being away from the main action for so long? How many puffs of Farrah Fawcett Hair Spray does it take you to achieve Harrington-like coif perfection?

The law was championed by Republicans, who argued that it was crucial to public safety and a rebuff to an overreaching city government in Charlotte, and attracted some Democratic support.

Critics organized a staggering backlash to a measure they called intolerant, anachronistic and contrary to generations of political moderation in North Carolina. Some of the nation’s most influential corporations openly attacked the law; the N.C.A.A. said it would stop hosting championship events in this sports-crazed state; and the Justice Department, under President Barack Obama, brought what could have become a momentous civil rights lawsuit.

About a year after the law took effect, with the potential economic costs projected to run into the billions of dollars, officials struck a deal that transgender rights groups attacked as a “fake repeal” that did not strip away the intent of the measure.

The national outrage ebbed anyway, business groups and convention planners appeared mostly satisfied, and the N.C.A.A. relented.

But, in a signal of how North Carolina has so far been unable to outrun the law’s legacy, political tensions flared again last month when Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, proposed a settlement in related litigation. As part of the deal, Mr. Cooper agreed to declare that “transgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.”

The General Assembly’s leading Republicans, who either declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests, swiftly condemned the proposal as “a stunt” that proved that Mr. Cooper “acted in bad faith and lied about wanting to end the focus on H.B. 2.” (A federal judge in Winston-Salem is considering the proposed settlement.)

Indeed, Republicans contend that any lingering discussion about the law and its repercussions is driven only by transgender rights activists, their elected allies and the news media.

“There is no escape because there are certain interest groups that want to keep bringing it up, and the media loves it, too,” said Pat McCrory, the Republican former governor whose support for H.B. 2 contributed to his defeat last November, when Donald J. Trump easily carried North Carolina.

“Most of us, including me, would just as soon move on,” Mr. McCrory added.

Mr. Cooper, who said in March that the repeal legislation “cannot be the only step,” defended his decisions and said, “They set the fire, and I’m working to put it out.”

“I think most North Carolinians believe we are moving in the right direction, but many of them know we still have more work to do,” said Mr. Cooper, whose actions last month were timed for the day before the deadline for proposals for Amazon’s second headquarters. “But I believe that North Carolina is a welcoming place and a great state to do business. We have taken enough important steps to signal to the world that we’re open for business, and it’s pretty clear that businesses are responding in a positive way.”

Strategists on both sides of the debate agree that voters have tired of talk about H.B. 2, but there is no consensus on how much the law will influence next year’s elections.

“I find it highly unlikely that you will find the national money trying to make North Carolina a cultural battleground state at the legislative level,” said Art Pope, a conservative financier who served in Mr. McCrory’s administration.

A poll conducted by Elon University in April found that about two-thirds of North Carolina’s registered voters thought the state’s reputation had worsened in the year since the law’s approval. Issues like the economy and education now appear most crucial to winning over state voters, but surveys suggest that residents remain irritated over H.B. 2 and the issues that surround it.

“I think the volume has been turned down,” Mr. Hirschy of Equality North Carolina said. “The fervor is still there in our community, and if you ask our opponents, their fervor is still there.”

Perhaps so, to the possible political benefit of both sides. An influential group of religious conservatives recently produced an advertisement complaining that a candidate for mayor of Charlotte “endorsed a radical, national L.G.B.T. agenda allowing men in women’s locker rooms and bathrooms.” The election is Tuesday.

But for many of the state’s transgender residents, estimated at nearly 45,000 by a research institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, H.B. 2’s repercussions do not play out on television screens. They are reflected, transgender people said, in quick decisions about whether to have a second cup of coffee and in choices about how much to share about themselves in conversation.

“Before, whether or not you identified yourself as being transgender to someone was based on whether or not you perceived them as an ally or someone who would be O.K. with it,” said Candis Cox, an activist who is a transgender woman. “Now, what we have is a climate in which you really have a lot of trepidation about trusting people because we have now seen that people can seem to have all of the support in the world for you but have ulterior motives.”

And there is a measured sense that the fury of the H.B. 2 debate could someday be rekindled. On this matter, at least, there is some agreement.

“What we’re seeing is a kind of holding of the breath,” Ms. Cox said. “That’s where we’re at right now because we were dealt this awful blow, and it’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don’t know where we are. The people who supported H.B. 2 — the citizens, the politicians — we know that they’re still there.”",An Embattled North Carolina Seeks to Outrun a Law’s Bitter Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/north-carolina-transgender-law.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Afghan and American forces have struggled to clear the city of Kunduz and the surrounding area after the Taliban briefly overran the city twice in the past two years.

Following the first fall of the city, in 2015, American gunships mistakenly targeted the Doctors Without Borders hospital in the province, killing 42 people and destroying much of the hospital. Then, last year, American aircraft were involved in another deadly episode involving civilians, killing 33.

American airstrikes have more than doubled since President Trump announced in August a new strategy for Afghanistan. According to the United States Air Force, American aircraft dropped about 900 munitions in August and September, compared to about 260 for the same period last year.

Afghan officials have praised the strikes, saying they have helped fend off Taliban advances and decreased the risk that militants would take over cities and districts, but others have said the civilian toll from the airstrikes is unacceptably high.

Residents of Gharaw Qishlaq, a village in the Chardara district, said heavy fighting between the Taliban and Afghan commandos had continued for days, and Taliban targets in the village had been struck repeatedly.

“At night, they bombed many times in our area,” said Abdul Qayoum, a tailor in the village who lost three cousins in the airstrikes. “In the morning, after prayer, people got out to see what happened. My dad went, but I didn’t go. Then we heard another strike. When I came out, I saw people carrying bodies on carts.”

Haji Mahmoud, a resident, said the Taliban forced people in the village to retrieve the bodies of militants who had been killed the night before.

“They told us, and we had to, particularly when they said we are all Muslims and we can’t leave bodies lying out there,” he said. “I saw three Taliban bodies. When the boys were trying to dig up those bodies, the plane struck again. Thirteen people were killed. I am wounded in my head and my arm.”

In a separate development in Kabul, a court sentenced seven bodyguards for the country’s vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, to eight years in prison for abducting and raping a political rival.

Ahmad Ishchi, a former governor of Mr. Dostum’s home province of Jowzjan, claimed in December that he had been abducted by the vice president and his bodyguards from a sports event, and then raped with the tip of a gun.

The case, which has tested the government’s will to hold the powerful accountable, forced Mr. Dostum to go into de facto exile in Turkey. He tried to return once, but his plane was forced to turn around.

Although Mr. Dostum has refused to answer to questions from the country’s attorney general, seven of his guards submitted to questioning.

Baktash Ishchi, the son of Mr. Ishchi, said he and his father were present in the court during the sentencing on Saturday, when the judge sentenced the bodyguards to three years in prison for abduction and illegal detention and five years for rape.

“In total, 10 people, including Dostum, are involved in this case,” said Baktash Ishchi. “Some of them, including Dostum, were not present for investigations.

The violence is not even over. One Rohingya advocacy group said this week that Rohingya homes were still being burned to the ground.

Each night here on the border, hundreds of Rohingya keep arriving in fleets of wooden boats that float silently across the mouth of the Naf River, the brackish waterway that separates the two countries.

A group of New York Times journalists waited in the darkness alongside worried family members as a searchlight on the Myanmar side swung back and forth, back and forth, an eerie metronome moving across the gloom.

“How can we talk about repatriation?” asked Tun Khin, one of the few Western-educated Rohingya representatives who have been able to reach out to the international news media. “People are still fleeing.”

Bangladesh now finds itself in an impossible situation. One of Asia’s poorest countries, it is home to 160 million people — half the population of the United States — squeezed into a space the size of Iowa. The Rohingya refugees have taken over hillsides, chopped down countless trees to build their shelters and put such a stress on the economy of Bangladeshi border villages that prices have shot up threefold, angering longstanding residents.

Helping the Rohingya

Facing international pressure to host the refugees and some domestic pressure to push them out, Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has said that her country would continue to help the refugees on humanitarian grounds but that Myanmar must “take their nationals back.”

She has ordered the army to seal off roads around the camps to make sure Rohingya do not start migrating to towns. Her government has also decreed that Rohingya were not allowed to work or register for local cellphone service.

With no way to support themselves, the Rohingya refugees are completely dependent on aid. United Nations agencies such as the World Food Program have been feeding them, while international and Bangladeshi charities have provided medical care, plastic tarps, cooking pots and other basics.

How long the Rohingya are expected to stay will affect the next set of issues, including questions like whether Bangladesh or outside groups should begin building schools for them.

Many Bangladeshis worry that the Rohingya are perfect candidates to be radicalized — victims of anti-Muslim persecution who are now idle and dispossessed. Retaliation is a theme for the Islamic State and countless other Islamist militant groups, including the Rohingya group that attacked the security forces in Myanmar on Aug. 25, the Arakhan Rohingya Salvation Army.

“If they stay where they are living now,” said Anup Kumar Chakma, a retired Bangladeshi Army officer, “the entire area will become a fertile breeding ground.”",Fate of Stateless Rohingya Muslims Is in Antagonistic Hands,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/world/asia/rohingya-myanmar-bangladesh-stateless.html

(Many middle-class families could also see tax savings under the plan.)

“There is a difference between directing institutions to make sure they’re using their resources toward their stated mission — missions of education, missions of access — versus directing institutions toward filling gaps in Washington, and this seems to be the latter,” Sean Decatur, president of Kenyon College, said Friday.

Supporters of the proposed tax said it was an acknowledgment that universities increasingly were being run like businesses, with tuition continuing to rise and administrative ranks growing, especially at the wealthiest institutions.

Representative Tom Reed, a New York Republican whose district includes Cornell University, supports the proposed tax, though his main wish is to force schools with large endowments to spend more of them on tuition assistance. Like other proponents of an endowment tax, he noted that private foundations, which also are nonprofits under the tax code, already pay a tax of 1 to 2 percent on their investment income.

“Rather than fight for special treatment, universities should join me in recognizing that young adults are facing a college debt crisis as a result of the uncontrolled escalating costs,” Mr. Reed said in an email. “We should work together to solve this runaway price issue once and for all.”

The tax would affect about 140 colleges and universities, according to a list compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Universities have been fiercely protective of their endowments, and have ramped up lobbying efforts to keep control over them.

Some argued Friday that the tax plan would put a damper on gifts, because donors would not want to see the impact of their gifts diminished by the tax.

Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade group, said colleges and universities should be treated differently from foundations. “Private foundations give money away, that’s not the purpose of colleges and universities,” Mr. Hartle said. “If you wanted to treat them the same, you’d apply this to all colleges and universities regardless of the value of their endowments, not just a handful of private ones.”

At Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., which has an endowment of more than $200 million, the president, Elizabeth Kiss, said that most students were minorities and 40 percent had incomes low enough to qualify for federal Pell grants. Because of the endowment, she said, “We are able to give financial aid to basically pretty much all of our students.”

The tax, she said, would amount to a $350,000 cut to an overall budget of $52 million. “This is an institution that had a 1 percent pay raise this year, so it’s not like we’re fat cats,” Ms. Kiss said.

A spokesman for Yale University, Tom Conroy, said that the plan would impose a permanent tax on student aid, teaching, research and community services at Yale. He pointed out that the universities with the wealthiest endowments are also those that have the resources to offer need-blind admissions and the strongest support to poor and middle-income students.

“It is disappointing that the legislation relies so heavily on colleges and universities, and especially the universities with some of the strongest records on financial aid, to raise revenue to enable tax cuts,” Mr. Conroy said. “We hope that the House of Representatives will reconsider these proposals.”

Ivy League schools generally have the biggest endowments, and they have been growing fatter since 2008, in part through high-earning investments like commercial real estate, venture capital and hedge funds.

At Yale, for instance, the endowment, helped by an 11.3 percent return on investments after fees, grew to $27 billion in the 2017 fiscal year. Harvard’s endowment, helped by an 8.1 percent return, stood at $37 billion.

The size of some of the endowments suggests that they could weather a 1.4 percent tax on earnings. But some university officials said that they must spend carefully to withstand occasional market downturns, and that large portions of many endowments have spending restrictions placed by donors.

A 2015 study by the Congressional Research Service found that in the previous fiscal year, colleges spent an average of 4.4 percent of their endowments, and the average rate of investment return was 15.5 percent. Larger institutions, which were more invested in hedge funds and private equity, had higher returns.

Yale’s endowment was nearly $2 million per student that year. Princeton’s was more than $2.6 million, and Harvard’s was nearly $1.3 million, according to the study. Harvard alone held 7 percent of all endowment assets that year, the report said.

At Cornell, the endowment typically goes toward financial aid, or helping cover faculty salaries and research, the president, Martha E. Pollack, said on Friday. If the tax goes through, Cornell would have to make the money up somewhere else, she said.

“This is very very serious for us; we’re estimating at this point that it would cost us approximately $10.5 million a year,” Dr. Pollack said. “And, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t satisfy any real policy objectives. It’s just a transfer of money from universities to permit a tax cut elsewhere in the system.”",Swelling College Endowments Tempt Lawmakers Looking for Tax Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/college-endowments-tax.html

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean? I stared at my mostly finished grid and then I saw it. Running down the center of the grid was the phrase HEAVY METAL BANDS. And across the center of the top three grids was POINT BLANK RANGE.

O.K., Mr. Arbesfeld, now I’ve got you. Across the middle of my grid, I had ___ OPTIC CABLE, so I filled in FIBER across the middle of grid No. 4. Sure enough, it was an answer and I conquered that grid.

Since this is the first appearance of a Walls and Doors puzzle, I asked Mr. Arbesfeld to tell me a bit about how it came to be:

Constructor Notes

I got the idea initially from a Sunday puzzle back in January called “Rolling in the Aisles,” in which the word HA was used as a rebus for Down clues, but yet blocked off from the accompanying Across clues. It seemed to me that the Across clues had walls, while the Down clues had doors. I think this also struck a chord for me because of the 2016 election, in which one candidate talked of building walls while the other wanted to open doors. And finally, there’s a Jackson Browne song I love with the same title. I initially created it in a more traditional crossword puzzle manner for a Thursday, but found that it was too easy. So then I hit upon the idea of making each of the nine 5x5 sections its own puzzle, with the six interlocking 15-letter entries running through. This seemed much more suitable as a Sunday Variety puzzle, so I presented it to Will Shortz as such.

I really enjoyed this puzzle, with its roller coaster ride of mulling over clues and conquering grids. I would definitely do one of these again.",Variety Puzzle: Walls and Doors,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/crosswords/variety-puzzle-walls-and-doors.html

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.
In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats.
Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk.
“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.","Mr. Trump has made clear that he sees the attorney general and the F.B.I. director as his personal agents rather than independent figures, lashing out at both for not protecting him from the Russia investigation.

In May, he fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who later testified that he had refused Mr. Trump’s demands that he pledge loyalty and publicly declare that the president was not personally under investigation. In July, Mr. Trump told The New York Times that he would never have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known that Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.

While his lawyers have for now persuaded Mr. Trump not to publicly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the president has not ruled out firing him, a scenario that other presidents facing special prosecutors considered virtually unthinkable. Asked on Friday whether he might fire Mr. Sessions if the attorney general does not investigate Democrats, Mr. Trump left open the prospect: “I don’t know,” he said.

The president’s Twitter posts and comments drew rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who served for six years under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump’s comments make the job of law enforcement officials more difficult.

“Combined with his improper attempts to influence Department of Justice actions, this demonstrates that he is a president who is willing to flout those norms that protect the rule of law,” Mr. Holder said in an interview.

Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican who has broken with Mr. Trump, said the Justice Department should be free of political interference.

“President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” he said.

Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump’s right to exercise oversight of the country’s law enforcement agencies, saying that it would be dangerous to have an attorney general and an F.B.I. director who were not answerable to elected leaders.

“The notion that law enforcement, in particular, is somehow to be insulated from political influences and therefore inevitably insulated from political accountability is a horribly dangerous idea from the standpoint of civil liberty,” said David B. Rivkin Jr., a White House and Justice Department lawyer under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.

However, Mr. Rivkin added, “That doesn’t mean you exercise your authority to direct those things in a crude and obscene fashion. You have to exercise some politesse about it.”

Other presidents have been criticized for political intervention when they spoke out about continuing criminal cases. Peter J. Wallison, who was the White House counsel under Reagan, said his president at times spoke out on cases of interest, including the investigation of Reagan’s onetime adviser Michael K. Deaver.

“I would try to discourage him, for all the good reasons people in the White House are probably trying to discourage Trump, but it was to no avail,” Mr. Wallison said. “Trump is doing the same, except to a greater extent.”

Mr. Wallison noted that Mr. Obama at times commented on investigations, recalling statements denying wrongdoing by the Internal Revenue Service when conservative groups found their tax exemptions targeted for scrutiny. “Presidents say these things because they are human beings and have emotions,” he said. “Nevertheless, there is little evidence that public statements have any effect on outcomes.”

Before Watergate, presidents were less reluctant to intervene in law enforcement. The administrations of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had the F.B.I. wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. President Richard M. Nixon had the bureau eavesdrop on the telephone calls of reporters.

But in the past four decades, no president has sought to publicly pressure law enforcement as much as Mr. Trump.

In a barrage of a dozen tweets on Thursday night and early Friday, Mr. Trump railed at law enforcement agencies for not investigating Democrats. He cited Tony Podesta — the brother of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta — who stepped down from his firm this week amid scrutiny of his lobbying business by Mr. Mueller. And he cited a book excerpt by Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who wrote that last year’s primaries were tilted by a fund-raising agreement that the committee made with Mrs. Clinton.

“I’m really not involved with the Justice Department,” Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving on a 12-day trip to Asia. “I’d like to let it run itself. But honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats. They should be looking at Podesta and all of that dishonesty. They should be looking at a lot of things. And a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mrs. Clinton “stole the Democratic Primary” from Bernie Sanders and asserted that there was “major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering.”

“At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper,” Mr. Trump wrote.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he also tweeted.

Mr. Trump’s interest in directing law enforcement decisions extends beyond his political opposition but carries its own risk. The president’s support for capital punishment for the New York terrorism suspect, Sayfullo Saipov — “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” he tweeted — could pose problems for prosecutors and help defense lawyers who could argue that their client cannot get a fair trial.

Mr. Trump also weighed in again on Friday on the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to desertion and endangering other troops by walking away from his base in Afghanistan and getting captured by the Taliban. Mr. Trump, who last year called Sergeant Bergdahl a “dirty rotten traitor” who should be executed, expressed outrage when a military judge on Friday gave the sergeant a dishonorable discharge but no jail time.

“The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

But Mr. Trump’s own outspokenness may have helped lead to the very result he was condemning. The judge did not explain his reasoning on Friday but last week said he would consider the president’s past comments as evidence for a lighter sentence.",‘Very Frustrated’ Trump Becomes Top Critic of Law Enforcement,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/us/politics/trump-says-justice-dept-and-fbi-must-do-what-is-right-and-investigate-democrats.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Our back-and-forth continued over the years: at faculty lunches, in Israel, in arguments before the Supreme Court, in books, articles and letters — and in personal conversations.

The closest he ever came to complimenting me was when he wrote, “You are not as nasty a guy as my right-wing friends believe.” Nor was he as nasty as some of my left-wing friends believe, despite the surliness he occasionally insisted on inserting into some of his judicial opinions.

Reading “Scalia Speaks” — the marvelous collection of his speeches, lovingly compiled by his son and a former law clerk — brought Nino back to life for me. His words, even when read, are provocations to argue, disagree and think. They cannot be read passively. They cry out for dialogue. They demand answers — or surrender.

So here are my answers, to which, in fairness to my departed opponent, I try to append what he might have said in rebuttal.

The central thrust of Justice Scalia’s speeches — indeed of his entire judicial career — was an attack on the concept of a “living Constitution” that “evolves” over time to meet the changing needs of the public. He insisted on going “back to the good, old dead Constitution,” as he once put it in an NPR interview. In the speeches contained in this book, he uses the slightly less inflammatory term “static Constitution.” But it comes down to the same point. Here in Justice Scalia’s words:

“Let me begin by telling you what originalism is. The Constitution, as you know, contains a number of broad provisions, which are necessarily vague in their application: due process of law, equal protection of the laws, cruel and unusual punishments, the freedom of speech, to name a few. Originalism gives to those terms the meaning they were understood to have when the people adopted them. Is the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment? A hard question, perhaps, for the non-originalist. I have sat with four colleagues who thought it was. But for the originalist the answer is easy: At the time the people ratified the Eighth Amendment — the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause — no one thought it forbade the death penalty.”

The same would be true of “equal protection” and other broad provisions of the Constitution.

So, in my classroom debate with the justice, I challenged him with the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which ended racial segregation of public schools in the Southern states. As a matter of indisputable historic fact, following the Civil War the “people” who “adopted” the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment had to take into account what would surely be the continued segregation of public schools, and not only in the Deep South. Had they suggested that the Equal Protection Clause meant the immediate end of all segregated public education, the amendment itself would never have become a reality. All that the proponents — even the most radical among them — could hope for was that over time, attitudes toward racial differences would “evolve” and that the powerful words “equal protection of the laws” would eventually be interpreted to require public schools to be equal and not separate, instead of “separate but equal” as the Supreme Court had permitted in 1896.

I asked Justice Scalia, whether if had he been on the court in 1954, he could have joined the unanimous court without violating his principle of originalism. He was both candid and self-effacing in his response, saying that no theory of constitutional interpretation — including originalism — was perfect. But he still insisted that originalism was “better” and “safer” than any other theory, because it precluded honest judges from substituting their own philosophies for those of the founding generation. In his own provocative words: “Show Scalia the original meaning, and he is prevented from imposing his nasty, conservative views upon the people. He is handcuffed. And if he tries to dissemble, he will be caught out.”

But was he really handcuffed?

Consider the monumental case of Bush v. Gore, which may have decided the 2000 presidential election. In my book “Supreme Injustice,” I once again challenged Justice Scalia. I showed that until Bush v. Gore, Justice Scalia had taken an extremely narrow view of “equal protection,” rejecting the notion that judges should depart from its original understanding in the 14th Amendment as referring to racial inequality. He had railed against imposing “progressively higher degrees” of equality in other contexts. He wrote that when a practice “not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down.” In so writing, Justice Scalia could easily have been describing Florida’s practice of allowing manual recounts in the case of contested election results. But when Bush v. Gore came before the court, he voted to strike down this recount process as violative of — you guessed it — the Equal Protection Clause, citing the unfairness of imposing “arbitrary and disparate treatment” to ballots throughout the state.

I was surprised, though I shouldn’t have been, when Justice Scalia responded to my calling him out on this inconsistency in a letter that acknowledged the problem, with a touch of humility and humor:

“If my joining the equal-protection opinion was a mistake, I will be delighted if it is the worse one I make on the job.... I have frankly not revisited the issue, or read the extensive commentary (mostly critical, I gather) concerning it. At the time, however, I thought that ground correct. Even if you think that was wrong, considering the severe time constraints, the pressure to come out with a near-unanimous opinion, and the fact that it did not determine my vote in the case, you should cut me some slack.”

I had also criticized him for granting the stay that effectively ended the recount and the election, pointing out that he routinely voted against granting stays even in capital punishment cases. He responded: “As for the stay: I think I can persuade you it was proper. We will talk about it some time — as you say, before senility.”

We did get to talk about it, but the argument persisted.

Liberal constitutional lawyers will continue to debate Justice Scalia many years after his death, because when it comes to jurisprudence, he was the most transformative jurist of our generation. His views cannot be ignored. That is his enduring legacy. But he was more than an influential justice. He was a great man, who lived life to the fullest — as a devout Catholic, a proud Italian-American, a devoted family man, a loyal friend, and a person of humor and culture who fondly remembered his roots in Queens and New Jersey. “Scalia Speaks” gives us a glimpse of the man, as I came to know and respect him, despite — no, because of — our arguments.","Antonin Scalia’s Speeches, Collected for Argument’s Sake",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review/antonin-scalia-speaks-speeches-alan-dershowitz.html

In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future.","And while the biggest impacts show up in the performances of amateurs and weekend warriors, elite runners are not immune to these effects. When considering the top 20 finishing times at the largest marathons, the assessment found that temperatures in the 50s did not slow them, relative to days in the 40s. But temperatures in the 60s increased their times by three minutes, and those in the 70s increased their times by four minutes.

Since temperature has such a big effect on times, would it make sense to adjust marathon times for the weather? If this were done, five of the 25 fastest men’s marathon times through March 1, 2017, would beat the current adjusted world record. Indeed, three of them would be more than two minutes faster.

The current world-record holder is Dennis Kimetto from Kenya, but the temperature-adjusted record-holder would be Kenenisa Bekele from Ethiopia, who would move up from No. 3 on the list. The second-fastest time would belong to the Ethiopian Tamirat Tola, who would move up from No. 18.

Adjusting times for temperatures would lead to smaller changes among women. Paula Radcliffe of Britain (who has won the New York race three times) would remain the record-holder.

The interactions between climate and a sport like long-distance running are only going to get more pronounced as the climate changes. Over the last 50 years, the temperature has exceeded 60 degrees on just 5 percent of the days during the first week of November, when the New York race is typically held. By 2050, this is projected to rise to 18 percent of days, and by 2090 it is expected to be 38 percent.

How will runners and organizers react? National governments, city planners and large corporations are all realizing that a warmer world will force them to change the ways they do business.

Marathons will be no exception. The organizers of the New York race will probably not want their event to be one where it is difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for people to set their personal best or to lower the world record. So they may want to adapt by moving the marathon to later in the year.

At the same time, runners may switch from the New York City Marathon to others held in cooler climates to find the perfect temperature at just the right time of year. Could a Montreal Marathon be among the world’s most prestigious by 2050?

Athletic equipment companies will surely develop new technologies to aid adaptation as well. For runners, the breathable mesh and cooling towels of today could easily be traded in for shirts with built-in air-conditioners. Seem far-fetched? They already exist. Indeed, I was one of the authors of a recent study of just how powerful a role technology can play in helping people adapt to warmer temperatures. For example, the rise of air-conditioning has reduced the mortality consequences of extremely hot days in the United States by more than 70 percent since 1960.

Marathons and marathon runners appear likely to be able to adapt to climate change with relative ease through changes in when, where and how. But in many other areas of our lives, the costs of climate change are expected to be greater. More intense hurricanes, and the increased occurrence of extremely hot days, will elevate risks to life and property, which can only be offset through costly adaptation efforts. These include building more expensive housing, accelerating the deployment of air-conditioning and making painful decisions to move away from current homes — as well as acceptance of increased risks.

In this way, the climate choice in front of us is similar to the one faced by people training for a marathon. More time spent training makes for a faster marathon. It’s not a great idea to show up on the day of the race without having invested much in your performance. The time for that is well in advance of the big day.

In the case of climate change, we can devote resources now to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that we face lower costs in the future. As with so many things in life, both marathons and the climate problem are subject to an old rule — no pain, no gain.",Your Race Against Time: How Climate Affects the Marathon,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/upshot/your-race-against-time-how-climate-affects-the-marathon.html

Today’s Theme

We’re taking “Selfies” at each of our vacation stops, with a hilarious editorial acknowledgment of the selfie phenomenon in the circled/shaded squares (they all say “ME.”)

Each of the theme entries is a destination where Ms. Gray takes a selfie and then updates her Facebook status with the photo and a description of where she is. For example, at 16D she waxes (sorry) eloquent about visiting MADAM TUSSAUD’S museum: “Facebook Status: ‘Vegas, baby!

Sun and surf in Cancún, Mexico! Bring on the unlimited piña coladas!’ ”

Some areas of the puzzle will be tough if solvers are not familiar with a destination or how it’s described.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

Everything is political in the Bay Area, but housing most of all.

Some restrictions make sense: Nobody wants skyscrapers poking up among Victorian houses, and nobody wants to tear down historical buildings. But many others don’t: There are scores of empty parking lots in San Francisco and Oakland that can’t be built on because of political opposition.

The lack of supply means rents and housing values increase faster than necessary. For homeowners, this is a boon, as their assets keep appreciating. For renters, this means an ever-increasing cost of living and for some, an impetus to pack up and leave.

One way to think about it is that the enormous increase in wealth generated by the tech boom is largely captured by homeowners in the urban core who bought before the boom. By fighting new market-rate housing, Nimbys and Bay Area progressives are de facto making the housing shortage worse. Ironically, given residents typically progressive political leanings, this has regressive consequences, because it helps rich insiders at the expense of everyone else.

The second negative consequence of the region’s restrictive housing policies in the urban core is environmental degradation on the periphery. Good environmental stewardship suggests that we should build more in the urban core near transit and jobs and less on the fringes. Yet because of cities’ strict housing regulations, we build more on farmland on the region’s outskirts and less in the city center where demand is higher.

Families who can’t afford San Francisco, Berkeley or Silicon Valley have to move to exurbs. Some 3,800 Californians leave urban parts of the Bay Area for cheaper housing in Sonoma and Napa Counties every year. This worsens traffic and heightens the pressure for development on the edge of the region — in places such as Santa Rosa, home to some of the neighborhoods hardest hit by this month’s fires.

This extracts enormous environmental costs. Bay Area urban progressives, by fighting new housing in their neighborhoods, cause more sprawl on the rural fringes. I’m a committed environmentalist, and it made me rethink the way I engage with such issues: For example, I was a member of the Sierra Club for a more than a decade. But because of all the unwise battles waged by the San Francisco chapter against smart housing growth in the city, I quit to support other environmental groups.

Just like fires, bad housing policies can carry horrendous social and environmental costs. As the smoke from the Northern California fires clears, our urban communities should follow the examples of other progressive cities, and embrace smart growth.

For this to happen, local urban progressives must moderate their reflexive opposition to all new market-based housing. The main winners will be the region’s most vulnerable: urban renters as well as the land and inhabitants of areas incinerated by the recent infernos.",Fires Aren’t the Only Threat to the California Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/opinion/california-fires-housing.html

Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

Volkswagen’s Audi luxury brand also continues to grow. Its sales climbed 9.6 percent in October from a year earlier, to 19,425 vehicles, and were up 6 percent in the first 10 months the year.

Although its United States sales are rising again, Volkswagen is still working through the impact of the diesel scandal. It has agreed to pay $22 billion in settlements and fines in connection with the matter, including $4.3 billion to settle a case that was brought by the Justice Department. It also agreed to compensate American customers and buy back or fix the diesel models equipped with the illegal software.

All told, Volkswagen used the illegal software in some 11 million cars worldwide, including about 600,000 sold in the United States. Affected models included the diesel-powered versions of some of the VW brand’s most popular cars, such as the Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Passat. Certain vehicles sold by Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche brands were also equipped with the illegal software.

As of August, Volkswagen had repurchased or modified more than 308,000 vehicles in the United States equipped with 2.0-liter diesel engines, at a cost of $6.4 billion, according to an independent auditor monitoring the process. Roughly 200,000 claims for buybacks remain to be processed. The company had also repurchased about 35,000 vehicles with 3.0-liter engines, out of a total of 53,000 claims filed.

While reporting a drop in earnings last week — a decline largely due to diesel settlements — Volkswagen acknowledged that the damage from the scandal was “nowhere near an end.” Diesel cars have been a bigger part of the company’s product mix in Europe than in United States, handicapping a worldwide recovery.

In one good sign on Wednesday, Volkswagen shares climbed to 167.85 euros on the Frankfurt stock exchange, finally exceeding the price at which they were trading before the diesel scandal.

Volkswagen’s revival in the United States is being driven by two new sport-utility vehicles that arrived in showrooms this year. Even before the diesel problems, VW’s United States sales had been declining since 2012 as consumers, spurred by low gasoline prices, flocked to S.U.V.s and turned away from sedans and compact cars. VW, like other automakers, was caught off guard and scrambled to beef up its S.U.V. offerings.

One of the new S.U.V.s, the Atlas, is a full-size model that enables VW to compete with big sellers like the Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot. The 2018 Tiguan is redesign of an existing model. It comes with extra roominess to appeal to American car buyers.

“We can now target the heart of the S.U.V. market,” Hinrich J. Woebcken, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, told reporters last month. “We are at a fundamental turning point for the brand and our strategy for our American customers.”

Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds.com, an auto information website, said VW “is not completely out of the woods,” but noted that American consumers had a history of forgiving automakers who had erred. G.M. faced heavy criticism and investigation after it was slow to recall faulty ignition switches that were eventually linked to fatal crashes.

“Americans follow something for a certain amount of time, but won’t turn their backs on a brand like VW for life,” Ms. Caldwell said. “Eventually they forget or forgive.”

For Volkswagen, keeping up the growth in the United States won’t be easy. The VW brand still lacks a compact S.U.V. for the American market, and the next two new models are sedans, the kind of cars fewer and fewer consumers are buying. One is a redesign of the Jetta compact, and the other a new full-size car called the Arteon. Both are due next year.

The slowdown in overall car sales may also pose a headwind. The industry is likely to report a decline this year after seven years of growth and record sales of 15.5 million cars and light trucks in 2016.

In declaring the opioid epidemic a public health emergency last week, President Trump promised that the federal government would start “a massive advertising campaign to get people, especially children, not to want to take drugs in the first place.” But past efforts to prevent substance abuse through advertising have often been ineffective or even harmful.

Perhaps the most famous American antidrug advertisement featured a sizzling egg in a frying pan to the sound of ominous music and a stern voice-over warning, “This is your brain on drugs.” A sequel to this ad featured Rachael Leigh Cook smashing an egg and the better part of a kitchen to dramatize the impact of heroin.

Many other ads denouncing drugs and emphasizing their destructive effects — as in the “Just Say No” campaign — appeared regularly on television and in print beginning in the 1980s. Most of them were funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which received hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Congress for such campaigns.

Visually dramatic though the ads were, evaluations of them were deeply discouraging. The billions spent from the late 1980s through the mid-2000s at best had no effect on drug use, research shows. At worst, exposure to the campaign might have actually increased the likelihood of adolescent marijuana use.

Why was the original campaign such a failure? In part it suffered from perverse incentives. Congress provided substantial money for the ads and was intensely interested in them at the height of the so-called war on drugs, creating internal pressure to make the ads appealing to members of Congress. But while ads that lectured or scared people about drugs might have seemed compelling to the modal member of Congress (a 60-year-old white male), they did not necessarily dissuade drug use by adolescents.

Structured as a call and response between eight of his most significant articles and briefer, more personal essays arranged by year, Coates gives us something between a mixtape and a Künstlerroman, demonstrating how he came to dominate the nonfiction genre. Even without the framing of the lively if clipped “this is what I was doing that year” portions, we can see Coates’s growing power and prowess from the progression of the pieces themselves. Picking up steam with “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” from February 2012, Coates is in full command by the time we reach “Fear of a Black President,” an essay that captures the Obama that many are nostalgic for and others continue to rage against.

In “Fear of a Black President,” Coates offers a cleareyed assessment of the racism that limited what the 44th president could say. After the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Coates reminds us, the initial popular reaction was mournful and respectful — it was only after Obama offered the mildest of identifications with the dead child (“If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon”) that negative responses flooded the airways. White people posted pictures of themselves “Trayvoning”: wearing hoodies and pretending to be dead with a package of Skittles. Rather than ushering in a post-racial paradise, Coates writes, the election of Obama became a rallying cry for racists and “effectively racialized white Americans’ views, even of health care policy.” The fear has now become a formula, and “Fear of a Black President,” which was published in the fall of 2012, now feels like both prophecy and jeremiad. (A small criticism: The book doesn’t clearly provide these original publication dates in the text itself, making the exact timing hard to parse.)

In Coates’s essays from the early years of the Obama administration, he regularly identifies a conservatism that black culture often aligns with but that outsiders find hard to name. There is, in fact, another unrealized book here, one in which Coates would have traced this tradition as he started to in an early essay on Bill Cosby. Thankfully he didn’t — instead, the prologues introducing each year often serve as retrospectives, letting him amend the record; with Cosby, Coates says he should have made more of “the torrent of rape allegations that swirled around him even then,” missing a chance to point out the hypocrisy of Cosby’s moralizing “call-outs” about the black community. Coates senses a strain of “the organic black conservative tradition” in both Malcolm X and Obama, calling the former president “a conservative revolutionary” and comparing him to Booker T. Washington. This feels a bit too simplistic. In reality Obama complicates any genealogy of radicals or reactionaries, just as Coates rewrites the narrative of being a public intellectual.

At the start of Coates’s own “two terms,” he is writing in Harlem while living check to check, hoping to give his young family stability; by the following year, he has been invited to attend the Aspen Ideas Festival. The leap seems both unexplained and now inevitable, with the book’s episodic form letting Coates gloss over such gaps. Still, the emotional journey he does detail feels real, and realized. “It is, I think, the very chaos of America that allowed me to prosper,” he writes in “Notes From the Eighth Year.” “I suspect, though I do not know, that the lack of both ceilings and safety nets is how we got a black president. I suspect it is how, at least for these eight years, I came to thrive.”

Always passionate, the essays grow increasingly precise. With “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” Coates found not so much his subject as a language for it. He starts to quote historians to show where we’ve been; makes regular reference to Reconstruction and the regression and receding of the American dream; invokes the demonization of “super-predators” and Sistah Souljah — all with elegance and insight. His is one of the chorus of voices (following, I’d argue, those of our poets) critiquing not only American nostalgia, both black and white, but the very notion of progress.

It is the record of his struggle as a writer that is of great interest here. As in Baldwin, the struggle of the writing dovetails with the struggle of the race. This becomes clearest in his 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations,” which became Coates’s calling card, and rightly so: It provides a remarkable pocket history of the financial toll of white supremacy, from disenfranchisement to land grabs to redlining, offering a harrowing account of the economic injustices imposed on African-Americans. Framed by one man’s moving from Mississippi to Chicago during the Great Migration only to encounter the same-old systematic shafting in what we used to call “Up South,” it isn’t cross-burning but the slow burn of oppression that makes the blood boil. Compelling and compulsory, “The Case for Reparations” is as convincing in its restraint and pacing as it is in its depth of research and recognition of black humanity. Even if readers don’t see their own families, as I did, in the tales of the Federal Housing Administration’s discriminatory practices or the “kleptocracy” of black-owned land “taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism,” we can see the forms of injustice that persist and speak to basic rights: Where can one live? Indeed, who gets to live?

“Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred,” Coates points out. “It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.” He also highlights the effect of racist policies on the polity — and just how “plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient,” affecting everything from subprime mortgages to mandatory minimum sentencing. This story is now one that others are telling more fully — books like Carol Anderson’s “White Rage” and Ibram X. Kendi’s “Stamped From the Beginning” help detail the history of reactions to and restrictions of black advances — yet few have done it more succinctly than Coates, or with more power: “What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.”

Obama remains an important foil for Coates, one he fruitfully returns to with “My President Was Black,” a feature begun before the 2016 election (and published after) that shows Coates’s new status — he is now a regular enough White House visitor that he scores an extensive interview — while foreshadowing the ways both men underestimated the opposition, if for different reasons. To Coates, and to many, Obama “became a symbol of black people’s everyday, extraordinary Americanness”; but where Obama’s blindness to Trump’s electoral victory stems, Coates believes, from Obama’s essential optimism, for Coates, any unseeing came from a well-earned pessimism: “I was shocked at my own shock.”

The election of President Obama inspired not only Coates but, as he points out, “a crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during his two terms.” The undeniable black renaissance in poetry and cinema, from documentaries like “I Am Not Your Negro” to horror films like “Get Out,” has been met by fellow adventurers in the essay, from Teju Cole to Jesmyn Ward to Kiese Laymon to Roxane Gay. Obama also embodies a phrase that might serve as an alternative subtitle of “Eight Years,” since it appears so often: Being Twice as Good. This phrase is simultaneously the injunction black families have had to give their progeny in a world redlined against them, while also being the very idea that Coates examines as an unjust “double standard.” It is this double standard, he argues, that brought about President Trump: “Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that in working twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump’s counter is persuasive — work half as hard as black people and even more is possible.”

As Coates turns the heat lower, his brilliance cooks more evenly — and more urgently. Never is this more true than in “The First White President,” his recent cover story for the Atlantic. The essay, presented here as an epilogue, manages to be as bloodless as it is blistering. Coates rebukes those on the left who try to pawn Trump off “as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning.” To Coates, Trump’s “ideology is white supremacy in all of its truculent and sanctimonious power”; to pretend otherwise is to treat “white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else.”

If there’s anything to critique in Coates, it is that for him black autobiography — the story black folks tell themselves and sometimes others — is chiefly trauma. There is another, blues-based tradition, embodied by the likes of the poet Lucille Clifton or Zora Neale Hurston — an ethos that is often as Southern, countrified and womanist as Coates’s vision is Northern, urban and male — which, while forgoing easy optimism, sees black life as a secret pleasure, or at least sees joy, however hard-earned, as “an act of resistance.” (The depiction of joy is from the poet Toi Derricotte; Clifton used to inscribe her books with “Joy!,” which I always took not as balm but challenge.) Coates means to address this when he says that black cultural identity offers “the balm for such trauma,” yet he insists “it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.” Hurston would offer something else: “Even in the helter-skelter skirmish that is my life, I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more or less. No, I do not weep at the world — I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.” Her declaration, suffused with a blues aesthetic, even rhymes.

For Coates, his tragic view is usefully defiant: “Our story is a tragedy. I know it sounds odd, but that belief does not depress me. It focuses me.” Coates’s book brings us to a boil, then lets us simmer, and anyone who wants to know who we are — and where we are now — must sit with him for a good while. “Eight Years” confirms why Coates is enjoying his extended moment, while also pulling back the curtain on all the hard work that preceded and produced his success. It should inspire us as writers, and as Americans, that he urges us, in exile or online, to become better — or at least clearer on why we’re not.",Between the Presidency and Him,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/books/review/we-were-eight-years-in-power-ta-nehisi-coates-essays-memoir.html

One moonless night in late October, we located another new North Vietnamese unit, about 20 kilometers from where we were sitting. As if to underline the enemy’s proximity, while we were reporting the new unit’s appearance, we suddenly came under attack from mortars. The only casualty, it turned out, was a portable outhouse. Still, we were spooked.

Before the end of October, the North Vietnamese 1st Division and its three subordinate regiments had all moved to the Dak To area of Kontum Province — a region of steep hills and deep jungle valleys. There was a Special Forces base at Dak To, a tempting target, but it was clear to us that it wasn’t the only objective. Low-level reconnaissance communications appeared, a sure sign that combat was imminent. Then the division headquarters dispatched a forward command post that took control of the regiments. They were ready.

We informed the American 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Brigade that an attack on the Dak To area would very likely begin between Oct. 30 and Nov. 4, dates we learned from the reconnaissance unit’s messages. But we also warned that units throughout the highlands were preparing for combat. This, we said, was going to be big.

At this point we hit an unexpected obstacle: credibility. Several of us went to brief the commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Maj. Gen. William Peers. I warned him that a multi-division North Vietnamese attack on Dak To would take place at any moment, coincident with attacks throughout the highlands. He shook his head and pointed to our camp on Engineer Hill. “So I’m supposed to believe that some kind of magic allows a bunch of shaky girbs” — acronym for “G.I. rat bastards” — “distinguished more for their spit than their polish and abetted by a civilian, to use a tangle of antennas and funny talk to divine the combat plans of the enemy?” He waved us away. The briefing was over.

But we were right. On Nov. 1, a bomb dropped from a B-57 struck somewhere near Dak To. It hit an enemy supply dump, setting off secondary explosions, proof positive that significant numbers of North Vietnamese troops were out there. General Peers sent a unit from the division’s 1st Brigade to investigate and make contact with the Special Forces camp at Dak To. Two days later, one of the brigade’s battalions landed by helicopter on Hill 978, near Dak To, expecting to meet little resistance. Instead they found thousands of North Vietnamese soldiers, well entrenched and ready. The battalion was decimated. That same day, another American battalion ran into similar trouble on nearby Hill 882. General Peers and the other generals soon recognized the gravity of what we’d been trying to tell them: that the North Vietnamese had moved into the area in force and were itching to fight.

The weekslong series of engagements that followed, collectively known as the Battle of Dak To, was one of the biggest in the war, and one of the conflict’s few pitched battles. The North Vietnamese had established defensive positions on several hills, forcing the American and South Vietnamese forces to fight uphill, culminating in a horrifically bloody engagement at Hill 875, from Nov. 19 to Nov. 23. By the end of Dak To, nine American battalions from the 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade — some 16,000 men — had been committed. American bombers flew more than 2,000 sorties. The Americans eventually won, but at great cost to both sides: More than 2,100 North Vietnamese were killed, as were 376 Americans and 61 South Vietnamese soldiers.

I left the highlands in December when the offensive was all but over. I moved south to work with another team near Bien Hoa, just north of Saigon. When I got there, I saw all the same sorts of communications indicators we were picking up in the highlands before Dak To. We weren’t alone; American signals-intelligence units in the northernmost part of South Vietnam were intercepting the same patterns. We realized that an offensive was going to occur throughout the country starting at the end of January.

The N.S.A. pulled together all the evidence, and once again we presented it to the military leadership. And once again, the generals refused to believe us. At the time, Marines in the north were under siege at Khe Sanh, and the top brass in Saigon was convinced that any other North Vietnamese activity was only a diversion, an effort to pull away American forces from what they and Washington believed was Hanoi’s plan to reprise the victory over the French at the siege of Dien Bien Phu, 13 years earlier. Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, they did not prepare for an all-out assault, and at the end of January they were thrown back on their heels by the Tet offensive.

Put differently, it’s not quite correct to say that Tet caught the Americans and South Vietnamese by surprise. The intelligence was there, and the recent experience leading up to Dak To should have persuaded General William Westmoreland to take it seriously. Instead, he chose not to believe it.

The problem was bigger than Generals Peers and Westmoreland; eight years later, the same mistake was made with the fall of Saigon. By then I was the N.S.A. station chief in the city. I warned Graham Martin, the American ambassador, about overwhelming evidence showing that Saigon was about to be attacked. He refused to believe me and didn’t call for an evacuation of the thousands of American civilians still in the city, along with our South Vietnamese counterparts. When the North Vietnamese attacked a few days later, the city descended into panic. I escaped under fire. My South Vietnamese partners, the men I was working with, weren’t so lucky. Some 2,700 of them were killed or captured and sent to “re-education” camps.

As suits go, I prefer Italian. British cuts strangle me, physically and emotionally. American suits, in so much as there is such a thing, have a certain stolidity to them. They are designed for earnest, dull labor, and, even in a fancy fabric, tend to hang like drapery.

The Italians grasp the eroticism and power of tailored clothing. At the Brioni store, that extends to the décor, heavy on marble and wood, with ample space to gaze upon the racks as if you are on safari. What the suits here lack in imagination they make up for in touch: The fabrics are lavish, the construction immaculate, if slightly old-fashioned.

Which is the point, of course, but not an approach that speaks to my Isaia-loving soul. The Boglioli store was, for me, more soothing. That carpet, made of purple, yellow and gray squares, would be perfect in my apartment. The fabrics communicated vim and joy, like the icy blue overcoat that screamed loudly, though not in my size ($2,000).

A fashionable couple came in to the store when I was there, and the woman instantly gravitated to this coat, trying it on and engaging a clerk about the possibility of having it tailored.

I admired the sport coats in heavier fabrics, including a beige herringbone ($1,950).

When she experiences a customized price hike at the grocery store (for her, every item is suddenly $20), she relents and makes the sort of stoic exit that a movie like this needs to double as a triumph of dignity.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mayers barely gets a line. But he mows a mean lawn. Their kid spends the movie playing with Nicky, who’s mandated to do it by his aunt. The mandate extends to Mr. Clooney, whose sense of social progressivism hits a ceiling. The way the Mayers family functions isn’t all that different from how Dianne Reeves’s jazz singing and the footage of the actual Annie Lee Moss’s testimony are deployed in Mr. Clooney’s 2005 docudrama, “Good Night, and Good Luck.”

They were flicking at progressivism that the movie didn’t have the political bandwidth to get into. But the difference is that both women (neither of whom achieves character status) are part of the movie’s wider sanctimony in recreating Edward R. Murrow’s battle in the 1950s with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his televised anti-Communist witch hunt. It’s righteousness on Ambien. But I put up with the movie’s turning Ms. Reeves and the footage of Moss into weapons: They served the movie’s thematic strategy. Unlike, “Suburbicon,” it had an argument. McCarthyism really is bad.

Yet it seems that in his films, “dignified” is the only way Mr. Clooney wants to imagine black people. Anytime a movie or television show retreats into certain American pasts, I’m both annoyed and relieved. “Back then” can provide cover for an all-white cast. It can feel like an excuse or a hide out. But filmmakers might want to be careful about where the time machine sends them. Sofia Coppola’s went back to the Civil War, for “The Beguiled.” Rather than deal with the moral centrality of slavery, she simply freed the slaves herself. Sometimes you get very good filmmaking anyway. You also get gentrification.

Mr. Clooney has directed six movies; five are set in the middle of the previous century. And “Suburbicon” clarifies why. Race is a blind spot. None of the scenes with the Mayerses go on for more than 90 seconds; most last less than 15. And all are intended as a moral counterpoint to the darkening frivolity going on at the Lodges’. The Times’s Manohla Dargis got at this inequality in her review of the film. The casting telegraphs the movie’s priorities. The black actors — Karimah Westbrook, Tony Espinosa and Leith M. Burke — may not be as famous as the movie’s white stars, but Mr. Clooney hasn’t given them a chance to show whether they’re also as good.

In September, after the “Suburbicon” premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, he told David Sims, of The Atlantic, that he knows his approach is imperfect. “In all fairness, there are a lot of people better qualified to make the African-American story in suburbia, I think,” Mr. Clooney said.

“There’s a version of this film I’d like to see from the other side that could be better represented by someone who can speak to that better than me, and probably should.” He went on: “I think my version was what I know, which is white angst and the fear of losing your place to minorities.” He also said that he’d like to see others directors — Ava DuVernay or Steve McQueen, say — do a version of this story.

Sure, it’s possible that the white riots happening in “Suburbicon” reflect the current tour of white nationalist pop-up events. And perhaps somewhere inside this movie lives a farce that reckons with white indifference in the face of national catastrophe. But no one had the audacity to find it. The movie is the catastrophe, instead. During the era in which this movie is set, you would get dramas like Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s “No Way Out,” from 1950, or “Pressure Point,” a social drama from 1962 that Stanley Kramer had a hand in. They both star Sidney Poitier, and neither is afraid of at least trying to see race “from the other side.” The violent, relentless depiction of racism in “No Way Out,” complete with a race riot, is actually still pretty shocking. They’re as square as the movies Mr. Clooney tends to make, but they’re also daring, however imperfectly, to look right at the present rather than hunkering down in the past.

The big surprise of Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” is its conception of a racism that doesn’t need lynch mobs or a Confederate flag to make its point. Good, liberal white people — the ones for whom “I voted for Obama” is supposed to be an icebreaker — inflict as much harm as obvious bad ones. Mr. Clooney is not humanizing the Mayerses, per se. He is using them. The sad thing is that he didn’t need to. The black characters have nothing to do with the plot of this movie.

I HEAR SHE’S A REAL BITCH

By Jen Agg

Illustrated. 355 pp. Penguin Books. Paper, $17.

From the first pages of Jen Agg’s memoir, “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch,” a reader knows she is dealing with a formidable ego. Agg isn’t a writer but a restaurateur. She owns five beloved restaurants and bars in Canada, where she is a fixture of the food press, both for her success and for her occasionally impolitic forthrightness. In “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch,” Agg brags, she swaggers, she writes in great detail about her appetites — for junk food, music, sex. She is also relentlessly digressive — one of the truest signs of robust self-regard. Reading Agg’s book, I felt as if I was spending hours with someone who was pacing and rambling, expecting me to scribble disorderly dictation into my steno pad, stopping on occasion to ask me imperiously: “Are you getting all this?”

Whether I was depended entirely on which of the several books contained in “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” I was reading.

As a memoir, the book is sometimes unbearable. Memoir is a difficult form. It finds success, paradoxically, when its writer, self-absorbed enough in life to believe her story worth telling, is humble and curious on the page. The great ones are truly great. Think of “Speak, Memory” and “Black Boy,” of “A Moveable Feast” and “Just Kids.” Most humans care mostly about themselves. Good memoirs exhale humility. Agg is too proud of herself for that. (“Running Cobalt” — her first bar — “came very naturally to me.”) There is a nine-page chapter recounting what Agg has tweeted. It segues into a description of a conference Agg staged called “Kitchen Bitches: Smashing the Patriarchy One Plate at a Time.” The conference sounds interesting, but Agg finds ways to keep the narrative anchored to her: “The perfect name and tagline popped into my head immediately. … Over the next few days I somehow managed to plan this conference.”

I found myself wishing Agg would withhold some of what she discloses. I support talking about sex and cursing, but I gasped out loud at a scene involving spiked grape soda, oral sex and purple puke. Other readers may find such revelations disarmingly open and unedited.

The “how to open a bar or restaurant and then how to run it” book, which is hidden amid prolix self-observation, is instructive. Agg’s talent is as a restaurant proprietor and designer. I can’t argue that the passages about renovations — “We had to drill a subfloor through the grout, a bit of an easier drill than through the tile” or “We re-coat with a few layers of urethane every few years, and it still isn’t enough to keep it from wearing, but it will serve you very well for at least five years and costs almost nothing” — make for scintillating reading. But if I were an aspiring restaurateur, I would reopen my steno pad. I wished for lists, worksheets and diagrams rather than the dirty comics that are scattered throughout.

The third book inside the same two covers is a feminist diatribe. Or, that’s how Agg’s “I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” is being marketed. Publicity material promises a “story of how she fought her way through the patriarchal service industry” and, for a bit more panting, “a rallying cry for a feminist revolution in the culinary world.”

As a feminist project, I’m … not sure. The issue of how women are treated in kitchens mainly comes up secondhand because Agg isn’t a chef. How traditional masculinity suffocates restaurant culture comes up firsthand, just over halfway through the book — not in those words, which are my distillation and my own firsthand observation. At that point, Agg makes good arguments. The best are not about her own fight but about what she calls “an absurd, militaristic, master-servant relationship that happens in restaurant kitchens.” This is accurate and historically correct. “Men bond with bosses who treat them like dogs and then throw them a bone with a few ‘atta boys’ and a couple of cold beers after service,” she writes, “like somehow their brutal behavior ceases to matter when the gas is turned off.” It is an exacting and pitiable characterization, which sheds some light on a tradition of abuse that damages everyone it grazes. Agg spends as much time, however, pontificating on food critics and the internet as on the patriarchy, which sometimes left me wondering if the point was that she had a bone to pick with macho restaurant culture, or if she just likes to pick bones.

“I Hear She’s a Real Bitch” is also a feminist mandate of a very specific variety — the kind that invites, or gives permission to, women to act like stereotypical men. If men can describe interactions in terms of having had sex or not, why can’t women? If a male restaurant manager can talk to a guest without smiling, why can’t a female one? I’m ambivalent. What will it accomplish if in the struggle to be treated equally, we assume the worst behaviors of the privileged group? Agg is cocky, profane, pro-conflict — as only men are “allowed” to be. Some part of me revolts: I want us to go the other way — to demand of men that they listen more and talk less, that they cooperate rather than enforce their wills. But then I second-guess myself: Am I criticizing Agg’s decorum? In this age of “she persisted”? I am, after all, a product of a culture that says I have to smile to be considered nice. Perhaps my hostility toward Agg’s healthy ego and libido and free hand with f-bombs comes from my having played with dolls.","‘I Hear She’s a Real Bitch’: A Swaggering, Feminist Restaurant Memoir",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/books/review/i-hear-shes-a-real-bitch-jen-agg-restaurant-memoir.html

His resignation left the country reeling — even Mr. Hariri’s staff was taken by surprise — and Lebanese could do little other than speculate about why he had quit.

Mr. Hariri’s political party, the Future Movement, announced it would hold solidarity demonstrations for him across the country, including in Beirut and in the northern city of Tripoli. But just before 4 p.m., the party announced it was canceling the demonstrations.

Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, cut short a trip to Egypt to return to Beirut to deal with the crisis, the Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper, reported.

Mr. Hariri headed a 30-member national unity cabinet that was crafted to protect the country from any spillover from the multisided war in neighboring Syria, which has been raging for more than six years.

That mission has largely been successful, even though Hezbollah entered the Syrian war on the side of the government, Sunni militants joined insurgents, and well over 1 million refugees flooded this tiny Mediterranean country.

But Lebanon, which is governed by a sect-based political system, has long been deeply divided between a bloc aligned with Shiite Hezbollah and Iran, and one aligned with Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni country in the region.

In Lebanon’s political system power is divided between a prime minister, who must be Sunni; a president, who must be Maronite Christian; and a speaker of Parliament, who must be Shiite.

The exercise of real power in the country is a more complicated affair of alliances, rivalries and division of spoils between the leaders of confessional groups, many of them former warlords from Lebanon’s civil war. Hezbollah, which rose to prominence fighting the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, is the strongest because of its powerful militia.

In recent years the rival blocs have essentially agreed to confine their fight to Syria, where Iran backed the government and Saudi Arabia backed the insurgents.

Yet in the same period, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the regional stage have only increased, with the assertive new Saudi crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, taking a more aggressive stance as Iran continued to build its influence.

Iran has supported several militias in Iraq that have managed to defeat Islamic State forces in that country and remain a fighting force. Hundreds of Iranians, including dozens of generals belonging to the Revolutionary Guards Corps, have died in the conflicts.

Iranian leaders say their interference is needed to stop terrorism, and to create a security zone for their country. The country’s influence started to rise after the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq in 2011, leaving behind an incomplete army and a pro-Iranian government.

Over the years, analysts say, Iran has filled the vacuum created by the departure of the United States military, an extremely worrying development for Saudi Arabia and some other Arab states, who have seen their efforts to fight proxy wars with Iran largely fail.

Saudi Arabia started a war with Yemen, supported extremist Sunni groups in Syria and Iraq and tried to garner a coalition against Iran. But the war in Yemen has become a quagmire for the Saudis and the rebel groups they supported have been largely defeated.

Now that the Syrian war seems to be entering a new phase, with the government of President Bashar al-Assad holding onto control over a devastated country, there are fears that tensions that had been pushed to the back burner — inside Lebanon, between Hezbollah and Israel, and elsewhere — could re-emerge.

The United States has stepped up sanctions on Hezbollah in recent weeks, and President Trump has declared that his administration wants tougher policies on Iran and criticized the landmark nuclear deal reached with Iran under President Barack Obama.

Mr. Hariri’s father was killed when his motorcade was bombed on Beirut’s seafront, and outrage over his death ultimately lead to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, where they had been a longstanding presence.

Several Hezbollah members are being tried in absentia in a special United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague, although the militant group has denied involvement in the assassination.

Mr. Hariri said in his speech that he wanted to unite Lebanon and free the country from outside interference; his bloc has long opposed the fact that Hezbollah has maintained a military force outside the control of the Lebanese government.

At the same time, Mr. Hariri’s political foes saw him as a tool of Saudi Arabia, where his father built his fortune.

Hossein Sheikholeslam, an adviser to the Iranian foreign minister, described the resignation as having been masterminded by Mr. Trump and the Saudi crown prince, according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency.

Mr. Hariri met earlier this week with Saudi Arabia’s minister for Gulf affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, who had called for the “toppling” of Hezbollah and promised “astonishing developments” in the coming days, The Associated Press reported.

Mr. Hariri then returned to Saudi Arabia on Friday, for what was billed as another series of meetings with Saudi officials.

He pronounced himself “full of optimism and hope that Lebanon will be free, independent, with no authority except that of the Lebanese.”","Saad Hariri Quits as Lebanon Prime Minister, Blaming Iran",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saad-hariri-lebanon-iran.html

He subscribes to the Zen concept of mushin, imparted to him by Fassel, which means a mind cleared of all distraction. Hekker has forgotten many of his punts, and when the long-snapper Jake McQuaide asks whether he liked a snap, he remembers only that he caught it.

“I would like to think I’m a top-10 guy in the league,” Hekker said, “but really I have a lot more work to do.”

During the spring, Hekker grew disgusted when he reviewed all 98 of his punts from last season and determined that many did not land where he wanted them. Again, this was the best punting season in history. Fassel said Hekker has yet to peak, which only reinforces Snead’s claim that he might be the best punter ever.

That claim is not drenched in hyperbole, and does not insinuate any bias from a man who in September tacked two more years onto the six-year, $18 million deal Hekker signed in 2014. John Turney, a prominent football historian, is working on a project about punting, and he said Hekker, three times a first-team All-Pro, has produced a statistically overpowering trail that places him on a trajectory to join Ray Guy as the only full-time punters in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

“I don’t know what else you can ask of a specialist,” Turney said.

For the influence that Hekker wields on a game, his capacity for maximizing field position, diminishing scoring probabilities and running a fake, Turney considers Hekker the best special-teams player in the league.

Quite a compliment, but what if Hekker is even more than that? He does not pass like Tom Brady or run like Kareem Hunt or catch like Antonio Brown, or come close to playing nearly as many snaps as they do. Hekker, who also holds for Zuerlein, has taken only 31.9 percent of the Rams’ special-teams snaps.

Hekker Stands Apart Johnny Hekker of the Rams leads in two of punting’s most important statistics: net yards and pinning the opponent inside their 20. Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Sanchez Palardy King Bosher McAfee Anger B. Colquitt Haack 40 Jones Wing D. Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponent’s 20-yard line Net punting yards 50 Hekker Vogel Martin Palardy King McAfee Anger B. Colquitt Haack 40 Wing D. Colquitt Locke Schmidt Lee 30 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Percent of punts not returned to opponent’s 20-yard line

But when Hekker jogs onto the field on fourth down, his mind uncluttered and his limbs loose, and with 1.2 seconds to catch the snap and rotate the ball and drill it toward a small target area some 45 yards away, he almost never makes mistakes discernible to the naked eye.

And because of that, maybe, just maybe, Hekker does his job better than anyone else in the league.

Sustaining Excellence

Sitting in his office, arms folded, brows furrowed, Snead pondered that possibility. He inherited a 2-14 team in February 2012, two and a half months before the draft. The Rams needed receivers and defensive linemen and cornerbacks.

They also needed a punter.

Fassel attended Hekker’s pro day at Oregon State and wanted him. Early in the seventh and final round, Snead mulled picking Hekker.

“The guy actually had a punt in college that went backward,” Snead remembered saying that day.

Figuring that the 31 other teams had seen it, he decided to take a linebacker.

Hekker’s friends remind him all the time of the punt, against Wisconsin during his senior season. It traveled minus-4 yards. It keeps him grounded, as does what happened after the season, when he went searching for an agent because none deemed him worth contacting.

After signing with the Rams, Hekker began watching film of punters he respected, an exercise that endures. He marveled at the technique used by Thomas Morstead of New Orleans, quiet and refined. He gaped at how purely Dustin Colquitt of Kansas City strikes the ball, especially in a venue as unforgiving as Arrowhead Stadium. He admired the misdirection deployed by Sam Koch of Baltimore, how he would show left, then crush the kick right.

“I revere these guys,” Hekker said. “I need their posters on my wall. They keep me humble. I watch them punt and I think I’ve got a long way to go.”

The craft has evolved since Sammy Baugh let ’em rip 75 years ago, Turney said, cycling through several phases until this current era, which rewards those few punters who can kick consistently with power and precision. The two most revealing indicators, Turney said, are net average (how far the ball travels minus return yardage or touchbacks) and the ratio of inside-the-20 punts to touchbacks. Hekker holds the career record in each, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. (Those statistics began being tracked in 1976.)

To sustain that excellence, Hekker relies on a catalog of punts. A sampling: the end-over-end one that swaps distance for control, the dastardly knuckler, the directional spiral and the famed banana, adapted from Australian rules football. Spinning sideways, the banana fooled Indianapolis returner Quan Bray in its regular-season debut, in Week 1, skidding at the 11 before helicoptering out of bounds at the 7.

Many punters mess with the banana in practice, but few have the confidence or audacity to try it in a game. Hekker’s next trick could be the punt he has been fiddling with: It spins as if kicked with his left foot.

“I don’t think Johnny’s afraid of anybody,” said Jeff Feagles, the N.F.L. career leader in punts. “I think they’re afraid of him.”

Sometimes they are afraid he won’t punt at all. By his own admission, Hekker was a quarterback who punted at Bothell High School in suburban Seattle. And the Rams capitalized on his passing talent immediately.

Against San Francisco as a rookie, Hekker completed a 21-yard pass from his own end zone. Then, with about five minutes left and the Rams trailing by 4 points, he connected on a 19-yarder that keyed a go-ahead scoring drive. In all, his 13 passes since 2012 – with eight completions, all for first downs or touchdowns – are 11 more than any other punter has attempted, according to Sportradar. (He has also passed for a 2-point conversion.)

Fassel said the Rams have called about 40 other fakes with Hekker that they checked out of at the line of scrimmage. His versatility vexes opposing coaches who every week struggle with how to set up a runback and guard against a fake. “We’ve been really vanilla against him,” said Brian Schneider, the Seahawks’ special-teams coach, whose team has been foiled by Hekker twice on fakes, after a September practice. “We don’t have much of a choice.”

Demanding Standards

Hekker developed that arm, and a fierce competitive streak, playing football with his four older brothers. His fear of losing motivated him across his childhood, when he would turn household chores – like carrying grocery bags into the house – into contests.

After high school, once he had committed to pursuing punting in college, Hekker learned fundamentals at a camp in Alabama run by Mike McCabe, a former all-American punter at Illinois State.

“He wasn’t very good,” McCabe said.

As a walk-on at Oregon State, Hekker beat out Ryan Allen (now the Patriots’ punter) as a freshman for the starting job. Throughout college, Hekker returned to Alabama to train with McCabe, who said he now learns from him.

On the practice field, competing against himself, Hekker is no less demanding. This season he is trying for three or fewer touchbacks (he has one so far) and for what he considers excellent direction on eight of every 10 punts. He aims for a narrow alleyway two or three yards from the sideline.",The N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Might Be ... a Punter?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/sports/football/johnny-hekker-rams-punter.html

Behold a child.

A slight girl all of 6, she leaves the modest family farm, where the father minds the livestock and the mother keeps a painful secret, and walks out to the main road. Off she goes to primary school, off to the Sisters of Mercy.

IRELAND Tuam Dublin GALWAY

Her auburn hair in ringlets, this child named Catherine is bound for Tuam, the ancient County Galway town whose name derives from a Latin term for “burial mound.” It is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese, a proud distinction announced by the skyscraping cathedral that for generations has loomed over factory and field.

Two miles into this long-ago Irish morning, the young girl passes through a gantlet of gray formed by high walls along the Dublin Road that seem to thwart sunshine. To her right runs the Parkmore racecourse, where hard-earned shillings are won or lost by a nose. And to her left, the mother and baby home, with glass shards embedded atop its stony enclosure.

Behind this forbidding divide, nuns keep watch over unmarried mothers and their children. Sinners and their illegitimate spawn, it is said. The fallen.

But young Catherine knows only that the children who live within seem to be a different species altogether: sallow, sickly — segregated. “Home babies,” they’re called.

The girl’s long walk ends at the Mercy school, where tardiness might earn you a smarting whack on the hand. The children from the home are always late to school — by design, it seems, to keep them from mingling with “legitimate” students. Their oversize hobnail boots beat a frantic rhythm as they hustle to their likely slap at the schoolhouse door.

A sensitive child, familiar with the sting of playground taunts, Catherine nevertheless decides to repeat a prank she saw a classmate pull on one of these children. She balls up an empty candy wrapper and presents it to a home baby as if it still contains a sweet, then watches as the little girl’s anticipation melts to sad confusion.

Everyone laughs, nearly. This moment will stay with Catherine forever.

After classes end, the home babies hurry back down the Dublin Road in two straight lines, boots tap-tap-tapping, and disappear behind those Gothic walls. Sometimes the dark wooden front door is ajar, and on her way home Catherine thrills at the chance of a stolen peek.

Beyond those glass-fanged walls lay seven acres of Irish suffering. Buried here somewhere are famine victims who succumbed to starvation and fever a century earlier, when the home was a loathed workhouse for the homeless poor.

But they are not alone.

Deep in the distant future, Catherine will expose this property’s appalling truths. She will prompt a national reckoning that will leave the people of Ireland asking themselves: Who were we? Who are we?

At the moment, though, she is only a child. She is walking home to a father tending to the cattle and a mother guarding a secret, away from the Irish town whose very name conjures the buried dead.

Ritual and Remembrance

In Ireland, the departed stay present.

You might still come across old-timers who recall how families in rural stretches would clean the house and set out a drink on the first night of November — the eve of All Souls’ Day — in the belief that the dead will return. How it was best to stay in the center of the road when walking at night, so as not to disturb the spirits resting along the wayside.

Even today, the Irish say they do death well. Local radio newscasts routinely end with a recitation of death notices. In a country where the culture of Catholicism, if not its practice, still holds sway, this alerts the community to a familiar ritual: the wake at the home, the funeral Mass, the long gathering at the pub, the memorial Mass a month later, and the anniversary Mass every year thereafter.

Wry acceptance of mortality lives in the country’s songs, literature, and wit. A standard joke is the Irish marriage proposal: “Would you like to be buried with my people?” A standard song describes a thrown bottle splattering whiskey – from the Irish for “water of life” — over a corpse. Thus the late Tim Finnegan is revived at his wake; see how he rises.

Respect for burial grounds runs deep, with crowds gathering in their local cemetery once a year to pray as a priest blesses the dead within. This reverence for the grave may derive from centuries of land dispossession, or passed-on memories of famine corpses in the fields and byways, or simply be linked to a basic desire expressed by the planting of a headstone:

To be remembered.

Some 60 years have passed since Catherine’s primary school days. It is a gloomy June afternoon, and she is walking the grounds once hidden behind those shard-studded walls. As rain falls from the crow-flecked sky, she drapes her black jacket over her head, almost like a shawl.

Her name now is Catherine Corless, née Farrell. At 63, she is a grandmother with a smile not easily given, and any fealty to Catholicism long since lost.

True, she occasionally volunteers to paint the weathered statues outside the local country churches: the blue of the Blessed Virgin’s eyes, the bronze in St. Patrick’s beard. But this is for the community, not the church. She finds deeper meaning in her garden, in the birds at the feeder outside her kitchen window, in the earth here at her feet.

Few photographs exist of the grim building that once loomed over this corner of Tuam (pronounced Chewm), perhaps because few desired the memory. In its place stand drab rows of subsidized housing and a modest playground. A silvery swing set, a yellow slide, a jungle gym.

One day, a few years back, Catherine began to inquire about the old home that had stoked her schoolgirl imagination. She set out on an amateur’s historical quest, but whenever she focused on the children who lived there, so many questions arose about the children who died there — the ones who never made it to the classroom, or even past infancy.

What, then, of Patrick Derrane, who died at five months in 1925, and Mary Carty, at five months in 1960, and all those in between, children said to have been “born on the other side of the blanket”? The Bridgets and Noras and Michaels and Johns, and so many Marys, so many Patricks, their surnames the common language of Ireland.

Would people pause at their graves? Would they be remembered?

In asking around, what Catherine heard was:

Ah, them poor children. Them poor children.

The more she dug, the more a distant time and place was revealed. Now, standing on the sodden grass, she can nearly see and hear all that was. The polished halls and bustling dormitories, the babies’ nappies and nuns’ habits, the shouts, the whimpers, the murmur of prayer.

‘Waiting for the Crucifixion’

The women and their newborns often arrived after the inquisitive streetlamps of Tuam had dimmed. They came from towns and crossroads with names like snatches of song. Portumna and Peterswell, Claremorris and Lettermore, Moylough and Loughrea.

And now they were here at the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home, a massive building the color of storm clouds, a way station for 50 single mothers and 125 children born out of wedlock.

The building opened in 1846 as a workhouse, but almost immediately it began receiving victims of the Great Hunger, a famine so horrific that the moans of the dying, The Tuam Herald reported, were “as familiar to our ears as the striking of the clock.” It later became a military barracks, serving the new Irish government formed after a treaty between Irish rebels and Great Britain in 1921. One spring morning during the civil war that followed, six prisoners — republicans who disagreed with concessions in the treaty — were marched into the yard and executed against the ashen wall.

The government repurposed the building to be among the institutions intended as ports of salvation where disgraced women might be redeemed. These state-financed homes were invariably managed by a Catholic order, in keeping with the hand-in-glove relationship between the dominant church and the fledgling state.

Given the misogyny, morality, and economics that informed the public debate of the time — when a pregnancy out of wedlock could threaten a family’s plans for land inheritance, and even confer dishonor upon a local pastor — imagine that naïve young woman from the country: impregnated by a man, sometimes a relative, who would assume little of the shame and none of the responsibility. She might flee to England, or pretend that the newborn was a married sister’s — or be shipped to the dreaded Tuam home, run by a religious order with French roots called the Congregation of Sisters of Bon Secours.

Their motto: “Good Help to Those in Need.”

You rose early and went down to the nursery with your infant. Mass at 8, then porridge and tea for breakfast. Breast feeding next, after which you rinsed your child’s diapers before moving on to your daily drudgery. You might polish the dormitory floors with beeswax or clean bedsheets stained with urine.

“An awful lonely ould hole,” recalled Julia Carter Devaney.

Born in a workhouse and left in the care of the Bon Secours, Julia became an employee who lived in the home for almost 40 years. Although she died in 1985, her rare insight into this insulated world — one she described as “unnatural” — lives on in taped interviews.

The gates remained unlocked to accommodate deliveries, but so powerful was the sense of cultural imprisonment that you dared not leave. Save for the chance gift of a cake from the bread man, you starved for love or consolation over the loss of your innocent courting days.

“Many a girl shed tears,” Julia said.

The Bon Secours sisters who watched your every move were doing the bidding of Irish society. They, too, existed in a repressive patriarchy with few options for women. They might have experienced a spiritual calling as a young girl, or simply desired not to be a farmer’s wife, having seen overworked mothers forever pregnant, forever fretting. A vocation offered education, safety and status, all reflected in clean, freshly pressed habits.

And Julia remembered them all.

Mother Hortense had a big heart, yet was quick to punish; Mother Martha was more enlightened, but a thump from her could “put you into the middle of next week.” This one hated the mere sight of children, while that one used kindness the way others used the rod. So it went.

The sisters frequently threatened banishment to the mental asylum in Ballinasloe, or to one of the Magdalen Laundries: institutions where women perceived to be susceptible or errant — including “second offenders” who had become pregnant again — were often sent to work, and sometimes die, in guilt-ridden servitude.

You preferred instead to suffer at the mother and baby home, bracing for that day when, after a year or so of penitent confinement, you were forced to leave — almost always without your child. Waiting for that moment of separation, Julia recalled, was “like Our Lady waiting for the Crucifixion.”

Typical is the story of one unmarried woman who had been sent to the home from a remote Galway farm. Determined to remain close to her child, she took a job as a cleaner at a nearby hospital and, for several years, she appeared at the home’s door on her day off every week to say the same thing:

That’s my son you have in there. I want my son. I want to rear him.

No, would come the answer. And the door would close.

For the children left behind, there were swings and seesaws and donated Christmas gifts from town, but no grandparents and cousins coming around to coo. They lived amid the absence of affection and the ever-present threat of infectious disease.

“Like chickens in a coop,” Julia said.

Many survivors have only the sketchiest memories of those days, a haze of bed-wetting and rocking oneself to sleep. One man, now in his 70s, remembers being taken for a walk with other home babies, and the excitement of seeing themselves in the side-view mirrors of parked cars.

“We didn’t even know it was a reflection of ourselves in the mirror,” he recalled. “And we were laughing at ourselves. Laughing.”

Until they were adopted, sent to a training school or boarded out to a family, the older children walked to one of the two primary schools along the Dublin Road, some of them calling out “daddy” and “mammy” to strangers in the street. Shabby and betraying signs of neglect, they sat at the back of the classroom, apart.

“I never remember them really being taught,” Catherine said. “They were just there.”

Teachers threatened to place rowdy students beside the home babies. Parents warned children that if they were bad they’d go right to “the home.” And even though the babies were baptized as a matter of routine, there remained the hint of sulfur about them.

“They were the children of the Devil,” recalled Kevin O’Dwyer, 67, a retired principal who grew up just yards from the home. “We learned this in school.”

Still, when a bully targeted a young Kevin during one recess, the child who came to his rescue was a home baby. You leave him alone, the older girl warned. I see you doing that to him again, I’ll get ya.

The man has never forgotten his protector’s name: Mary Curran.

One September day in 1961, a rare and ferocious hurricane howled across Ireland, downing power lines, destroying barley fields, battering cottages. As gales flicked away slates from the roof above, Julia helped lock the doors of the mother and baby home for good. Its conditions were poor, some of its staff untrained, and County Galway officials decided not to proceed with a planned renovation.

Abandoned, the massive H-block building devolved into an echoing, eerie playscape, where games of hide-and-seek unfolded in dull halls once polished with beeswax. Even the old chapel became a place where children became the priests and confessors. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. I shot Brother Whatever,” Kevin recalled. “That kind of thing.”

The years passed. Galway County moved forward with plans to demolish the home and build subsidized housing. And the memories of hobnailed pitter-patter faded, replaced by the faint sounds of children outracing the home baby ghosts that inhabited the property at night.

In Pain, Finding Purpose

Catherine still wonders what led her to the story of the mother and baby home. Chance, perhaps, or distant memories of the little girl she once teased. Despite her bone-deep modesty, there are even times when she feels chosen.

She thinks back to her solitary childhood, her best friend a dog she called “Puppy,” her time spent navigating the sadness that enveloped her mother. She admired the woman’s deep empathy for others, but was puzzled by her refusal to say much about her own people back in County Armagh, a good 140 miles northeast of Tuam. Sure they’re all dead and gone, is all she’d say, and God help you if you pried much further.

“A troubled soul,” her daughter said.

Catherine graduated from secondary school, left a Galway art college for fear of lacking the necessary talent, and found satisfaction as a receptionist. In 1978, she married Aidan Corless, a man as gregarious as she was shy, a fine singer, nimble on the accordion, comfortable on the community theater stage.

Four children quickly followed. Before long, Catherine was minding the children of neighbors as well, immersing herself in the homework, play and exuberance of the young.

Her mother, Kathleen, died at 80 in 1992, leaving behind so much unsaid. Catherine eventually headed up to Armagh to examine public records that might explain why her mother had been so withholding, so unsettled.

As if part of some cosmic riddle, the answer was provided in the absence of one. On her mother’s birth certificate, in the space reserved for the name of the father: nothing.

Her mother had been conceived out of wedlock.

Other telltale strands to the woman’s early years came to be known: Fostered out, moving from family to family before finding work as a domestic. Then harboring until death a secret she found shameful enough to keep from her husband.

“That she went through her life, that she didn’t like telling us,” Catherine said. “That she was ashamed to tell us…”

In this patch of pain and regret, a seed was planted.

The revelations about her mother fueled in Catherine an interest in understanding the forces that shape who we are and how we behave. While attending a rigorous night course in local history, she learned an invaluable lesson:

“If you don’t find something, you don’t leave it. You ask why it’s not there. You use ‘why’ a lot.”

With the children grown, Catherine began contributing essays to the journal of the Old Tuam Society about local history, all the while grappling with debilitating headaches and anxiety attacks. The episodes might last for days, with the only relief at times coming from lying on the floor, still, away from light.

Burrowing deep into the past, though, provided welcome distraction, and at some point she chose to delve into the subject of the old mother and baby home: its beginnings as a workhouse, its place in Tuam history, the usual. Nothing deep.

But there were almost no extant photographs of the home, and most of the locals were reluctant to talk. Every question Catherine raised led to another, the fullness of truth never quite within reach. Why, for example, did one corner of the property feature a well-manicured grotto centered around a statue of the Blessed Virgin?

Oh that, a few neighbors said. A while back an older couple created the peaceful space to mark where two local lads once found some bones in a concrete pit. Famine victims, maybe.

The story made no sense to Catherine. The famine dead weren’t buried that way.

Who were these boys? What did they see?

Frannie Hopkins was about 9, Barry Sweeney, about 7. The two were at the fledgling stage of boyhood mischief as they monkeyed around some crab apple trees, all within view of the deserted home that figured in their fertile imagination.

Some evenings, Frannie’s father would delay his pint at the Thatch Bar, at the top of the town, until he had watched his son race down the Athenry Road, dodging ghosts from the old home to his left and the cemetery to his right, all the way to the family’s door. But on this autumn day in the early 1970s, the boys were daring in the daylight.

Jumping into some overgrowth at the property’s southwest corner, they landed on a concrete slab that echoed in answer. Curious, they pushed aside the lid to reveal a shallow, tank-like space containing a gruesome jumble of skulls and bones.

Frannie nudge-bumped Barry, and the younger lad fell in. He started to cry, as any boy would, so Frannie pulled him out and then the two boys were running away, laughing in fun or out of fright. They told everyone they met, prompting Frannie’s father to say he’d get a right kick in the arse if he went back to that spot.

County workers soon arrived to level that corner of the property. The police said they were only famine bones. A priest said a prayer. And that was that.

In adulthood, Barry Sweeney would go to England to find work, and Frannie Hopkins would travel the world as an Irish soldier. Both would return to Tuam, where their shared story would come up now and then in the pub or on the street.

People would tell them they were either mistaken or lying. Barry would become upset that anyone would doubt a story that had so affected him, but Frannie would take pains to reassure him.

Barry, he would say. The truth will out.

The Marys, Patricks and Johns

Now, 40 years later, here was Catherine Corless, amateur historian, trying to unearth that truth, applying what she had learned in her community center research class: Use “why” a lot.

When her headaches and panic attacks eased, she pored over old newspapers in a blur of microfilm. She spent hours studying historic maps in the special collections department of the library at the national university in Galway City. One day she copied a modern map of Tuam on tracing paper and placed it over a town map from 1890.

And there it was, in the cartographic details from another time: A tank for the home’s old septic system sat precisely where the two boys had made their ghastly discovery. It was part of the Victorian-era system’s warren of tunnels and chambers, all of which had been disconnected in the late 1930s.

Did this mean, then, that the two lads had stumbled upon the bones of home babies? Buried in an old sewage area?

“I couldn’t understand it,” Catherine said. “The horror of the idea.”

Acting on instinct, she purchased a random sample from the government of 200 death certificates for children who had died at the home. Then, sitting at the Tuam cemetery’s edge in the van of its caretaker, she checked those death certificates against all the burials recorded by hand in two oversize books.

Only two children from the home had been buried in the town graveyard. Both were orphans, both “legitimate.”

Neither the Bon Secours order nor the county council could explain the absence of burial records for home babies, although it was suggested that relatives had probably claimed the bodies to bury in their own family plots. Given the ostracizing stigma attached at the time to illegitimacy, Catherine found this absurd.

In December 2012, Catherine’s essay, titled “The Home,” appeared in the historical journal of Tuam. After providing a general history of the facility, it laid out the results of her research, including the missing burial records and the disused septic tank where two boys had stumbled upon some bones.

“Is it possible that a large number of those little children were buried in that little plot at the rear of the former Home?” she wrote. “And if so, why is it not acknowledged as a proper cemetery?”

She also shared her own memories, including that joke she and a classmate had played on two home babies long ago. “I thought it funny at the time how those little girls hungrily grabbed the empty sweet papers, but the memory of it now haunts me,” she wrote.

Her daring essay implicitly raised a provocative question: Had Catholic nuns, working in service of the state, buried the bodies of hundreds of children in the septic system?

Catherine braced for condemnation from government and clergy — but none came. It was as if she had written nothing at all.

There was a time when Catherine wanted only to have a plaque erected in memory of these forgotten children. But now she felt that she owed them much more. “No one cared,” she said. “And that’s my driving force all the time: No one cared.”

She kept digging, eventually paying for another spreadsheet that listed the names, ages, and death dates of all the “illegitimate” children who had died in the home during its 36-year existence.

The sobering final tally: 796.

Five-month-old Patrick Derrane was the first to die, from gastroenteritis. Weeks later, Mary Blake, less than 4 months old and anemic since birth. A month after that, 3-month-old Matthew Griffin, of meningitis. Then James Murray, fine one moment, dead the next. He was 4 weeks old.

In all, seven children died at the mother and baby home in 1925, the year it opened. The holidays were especially tough, with 11-month-old Peter Lally dying of intestinal tuberculosis on Christmas Day, and 1-year-old Julia Hynes dying the next day, St. Stephen’s Day, after a three-month bout of bronchitis.

Measles. Influenza. Gastroenteritis. Meningitis. Whooping cough. Tuberculosis. Severe undernourishment, also known as marasmus.

Nine home babies died in 1930. Eleven in 1931. Twenty-four in 1932. Thirty-two in 1933.

The Tuam home was not alone. Children born out of wedlock during this period were nearly four times more likely to die than “legitimate” children, with those in institutions at particular risk. The reasons may be many — poor prenatal care, insufficient government funding, little or no training of staff – but this is certain: It was no secret.

In 1934, the Irish parliament was informed of the inordinate number of deaths among this group of children. “One must come to the conclusion that they are not looked after with the same care and attention as that given to ordinary children,” a public health official said.

Thirty died in the Tuam home that year.

In 1938, it was 26. In 1940, 34. In 1944, 40.

In 1947, a government health inspector filed a report describing the conditions of infants in the nursery: “a miserable emaciated child…delicate…occasional fits…emaciated and delicate…fragile abscess on hip…not thriving wizened limbs emaciated…pot-bellied emaciated…a very poor baby…”

That year, 52 died.

Catherine felt obligated to these children. Continuing to plumb the depths of the past, she eventually cross-checked her spreadsheet of 796 deceased home babies with the burial records of cemeteries throughout counties Galway and Mayo. Not one match.

“They’re not in the main Tuam graveyard where they should have been put initially,” she remembers thinking. “They’re not in their mothers’ hometown graveyards. Where are they?”

Catherine, of course, already knew.

The Truth Outs, a Nation Reels

Catherine lives simply, almost monastically. She favors practical clothing, usually black, and has never been one for a night at the pub. She doesn’t drink alcohol or eat meat. Give her a bowl of muesli at the kitchen table and she’ll be grand.

Those headaches and anxiety attacks, though, remain a part of her withdrawn life. Aidan, her husband, has become accustomed to attending wakes and weddings by himself. A few years ago, he booked a Mediterranean cruise for two; he traveled alone.

“A very quiet, introverted person, wrapped up in her own thoughts,” Aidan said of his wife. “Suffering, if you like.”

But thoughts of the dead children of Tuam pushed Catherine beyond her fears. Believing that the body of even one “legitimate” baby found in a septic tank would have prompted an outcry, she suspected that the silence met by her essay spoke to a reluctance to revisit the painful past — a past that had consumed her own mother.

Now she was angry.

Adding to her fury was the knowledge that when a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours closed in 2002, the religious order disinterred the bodies of a dozen nuns and reinterred them in consecrated ground outside the nearby pilgrimage town of Knock.

“I feel it at times: that those poor little souls were crying out for recognition, a recognition they never got in their little, short lives,” Catherine said. “It was a wrong that just had to be righted some way.”

Seeing no other option, she contacted a reporter for The Irish Mail on Sunday, a national newspaper. Not long after, in the spring of 2014, a front-page story appeared about a certain seven acres in Tuam.

It became the talk of Ireland.

All who had been quiet before — the clerics, politicians and government officials — now conveyed shock and sadness, while the besieged Bon Secours sisters hired a public relations consultant whose email to a documentarian did little for the religious order’s reputation:

“If you come here, you’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried and a local police force casting their eyes to heaven and saying ‘Yeah, a few bones were found — but this was an area where Famine victims were buried. So?’”

The news from Tuam had shocked many in the country, but the dismissive email reflected the lurking doubts about Catherine’s work. She was, after all, only a housewife.

Mary Moriarty was getting her light-blond hair done at a salon in Tuam one day when the beauty-parlor chatter turned to this troublemaker Catherine Corless.

The entire matter should be forgotten and put behind us, someone said.

Mary, a grandmother well known in town for her advocacy work, would have none of it.

Well, she said. Every child is entitled to their name, and their mothers could be any one of us but for the grace of God.

She left the salon, introduced herself by telephone to Catherine, and recounted a story that she rarely shared.

In 1975, Mary was a young married mother living in one of the new subsidized houses built on the old mother and baby home property. One morning, close to Halloween, a neighbor told her that a boy was running about with a skull on a stick.

The boy, Martin, said he had found his prize in the overgrown muck, and there were loads more.

What the boy mistook for a plastic toy was actually the skull of a child, with a nearly complete set of teeth. “That’s not plastic, Martin,” Mary recalled saying. “You have to put it back where you found it.”

Mary and a couple of neighbors followed the boy through the weeds and rubble, across the soft wet ground. Suddenly, the earth beneath her feet began to give, and down she fell into some cave or tunnel, with just enough light to illuminate the subterranean scene.

As far as she could see were little bundles stacked one on top of another, like packets in a grocery, each about the size of a large soda bottle and wrapped tight in graying cloth.

When her friends pulled her up, Mary’s legs were scratched and her mind was on fire. What had she seen? That very morning, she reached out to a person in town who might know. Soon a stout older woman arrived on a bicycle, her faithful dogs trotting by her side.

Julia Carter Devaney, who used to work at the home.

“Ah, yeah, that’s where the little babies is,” Mary recalled her saying as she came to a stop.

Julia bent down at the hole and peered in. Mary never forgot what the older woman said next: “Many a little one I carried out in the nighttime.”

Mary did not know what to make of this. Perhaps these were the bodies of stillborns – and therefore unbaptized. Stillborns. Yes, that’s what they must be.

Eighteen months after falling into the hole, Mary gave birth to her son Kevin at a Tuam hospital run by the Bon Secours sisters. After breakfast, a nun presented her with her newborn, who was swathed like a little mummy. The young mother’s mind instantly recalled those stacks of graying bundles, and straightaway she unwrapped her precious child.

Now, after listening to the woman’s tale, Catherine asked whether Mary would be willing to tell her story on national radio.

Of course.

The Dead and the Living

The veteran geophysicist guided her mower-like contraption over the thick grass, back and forth across a carefully measured grid. Equipped with ground-penetrating radar, the machine sent radio waves through the topsoil and down into the dark earth.

The curious machine was hunting for secrets concealed in the ground of the old mother and baby home, all beneath the gaze of a statue of the Blessed Virgin.

This subterranean trawling was being conducted on an early autumn day in 2015 for the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, a panel created by an embarrassed government in response to Catherine’s research. Its charge: to examine a once-accepted way of Irish life in all its social and historical complexity.

The commission’s investigation into the homes — a network that by the late 1970s was falling into disuse — is focused on 18 institutions scattered across Ireland: in the capital city of Dublin, and in Counties Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Meath, Tipperary and Westmeath. The high infant mortality rate in some of these facilities was startling. In the Bessborough home in Cork, 478 children died from 1934 to 1953 — or about one death every two weeks.

The investigation’s broad mandate also includes scrutiny of the network’s links to the notorious Magdalen Laundries. The apparent coercion of unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption, often to Catholic Americans. The vaccine trials carried out on mother-and-baby-home children for pharmaceutical companies. The use of home-baby remains for anatomical study at medical colleges.

It was all part of a church-state arrangement that, decades earlier, a longtime government health inspector named Alice Litster had repeatedly denounced, mostly to silence. This system marginalized defenseless Irish women, she asserted, and turned their unfortunate offspring into “infant martyrs of convenience, respectability, and fear.”

The Tuam case incited furious condemnation of a Catholic Church already weakened by a litany of sexual abuse scandals. Others countered that the sisters of Bon Secours had essentially been subcontractors of the Irish state.

But laying the blame entirely on the church or the state seemed too simple — perhaps even too convenient. After all, many of these abandoned children had fathers and grandparents and aunts and uncles.

The bitter truth was that the mother and baby homes mirrored the Mother Ireland of the time.

As its investigation continued, the commission would occasionally provide cryptic updates of its work in Tuam. In September 2016, for example, it announced that forensic archaeologists would be digging trenches to resolve questions “in relation to the interment of human remains.”

While she waited for the commission to complete its work, the woman responsible for this national self-examination, Catherine Corless, returned in a way to those days when her children and the children of neighbors packed the house. Only now the ones gathering about her were in their 60s and 70s, with hair of silver.

Home babies.

Often lost in the uproar over the many children who died at the Tuam home were the stories of those who had survived. And once Catherine’s research became international news, they began calling and emailing her, seeing in this introverted woman their only hope of trying to find out who their mothers were, who their siblings were — who they were.

Catherine assumed the role of pro bono private detective, following paper trails that often led to some cemetery in England, where many unmarried mothers had gone to start anew. The children they were separated from, she said, needed to hear that their mother had “fared all right.”

Before long, some of these survivors were gathering at the Corless house for a cup of tea and a chat. In their habits and manners of speech, they reminded Catherine of someone close to her who also had been born out of wedlock.

“They all have a kind of low self-esteem,” she said. “They feel inadequate. They feel a bit inferior to other people. It mirrored, really, the way my mother was.”

During her research, Catherine had built a detailed, wood-and-clay model of the home, large enough to cover a dining-room table. It had helped her to visualize.

Now she and Aidan would occasionally remove the model from a high shelf in the barn out back so that survivors could do the same. They would touch the gray walls and peer into the small windows, as if to imagine themselves in the arms of their mothers.

P. J. Haverty, a retired mechanic, sat at the Corless kitchen table one day, sipping tea and eating a ham-and-butter sandwich. He was born in 1951, the son of a 27-year-old woman who had been left at the home by her father when she was eight months pregnant. Eileen was her name, and she seemed to vanish a year after giving birth.

The white-haired man remembers only a few snapshot moments of the home. Wetting the bed mattresses that would then be propped against the window to dry. Seeing himself for the first time in a car’s side-view mirror. Walking out the door with his new foster parents, the father choosing him because he looked sturdy for farm work, the mother because he had smiled at her.

P. J. was happy enough until his teens, when he was called a “bastard,” and people avoided the pew he sat in, and girls at a dance tittered at the sight of him. “If the parents found out,” he said, “they’d tell them to keep away from that lad, you don’t know where he came from.”

He considered drowning himself in the fast-moving river that coursed through his foster father’s field. “The things that I was called,” he said. “I just thought everyone was against me.”

Thanks to a hint dropped here, a secret whispered there, P. J. managed in adulthood to locate his birth mother in South London. Plump and with graying hair, she reassured him that she hadn’t abandoned him. After leaving the Tuam home, she had taken a cleaning job at a nearby hospital and, for more than five years, returned every week to demand that she be given back her child — only to be turned away at the door.

P. J.’s voice caught as he recalled what his mother, now dead, had said she told the nuns to no avail.

“That’s my son you have in there. I want to rear him. I want to look after him.”

‘Chamber of Horrors’

It was true.

In early March of this year, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission reported that “significant quantities of human remains” had been discovered on the grounds of the Tuam home.

The ground-penetrating radar and delicate excavation had revealed what appeared to be a decommissioned septic tank. And in 17 of that septic system’s 20 chambers, investigators found many human bones. A small sampling revealed that they were of children, ranging in age from 35 fetal weeks to three years, and all dating from the home’s 36 years of operation.

Expressing shock, the commission vowed to continue its investigation into “who was responsible for the disposal of human remains in this way.”

Once again, Ireland’s past had returned to haunt.

His voice trembling with passion, the prime minister, Enda Kenny, addressed the Irish legislature on what he called the “chamber of horrors” discovered in Tuam. In the “so-called good old days,” he said, Irish society “did not just hide away the dead bodies of tiny human beings.”

“We dug deep and we dug deeper still,” he said. “To bury our compassion, to bury our mercy, to bury our humanity itself.”

Though the prime minister said that “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children,” others directed their wrath at the Catholic Church and, of course, the Bon Secours order, whose only response so far has been to express its “continued cooperation and support” for the commission’s work.

The Corless household, meanwhile, became an international newsroom, with family members fielding the constant telephone calls and accommodating the television crews forever at the door. Catherine answered every question out of duty, not vanity. But when Ireland’s most popular television program, “The Late Late Show,” invited her to appear as a guest, she balked.

There was her ever-present anxiety, which now limited her driving to little more than weekly five-mile runs to the SuperValu grocery in Tuam. More than that, she feared being accused of self-aggrandizement at the expense of dead children.

With her family all but demanding that she accept — Imagine how many home-baby survivors, suffering in silence, might be reached — Catherine reluctantly consented, but only if she would already be seated when the program returned from a commercial break. She did not want to be summoned from the curtain to unwanted applause.

Aidan drove her into Galway City to buy an outfit: black pants and a black top, of course, brightened slightly with a silver trim. Then up to Dublin.

“I was a mess,” Catherine recalled. “But I said: ‘This is it. I have to do it.’”

When she finished telling the story of the Tuam home on live television, the audience rose in what the host described as a very rare standing ovation. Catherine nodded, smiled slightly, tightly, and exhaled. Watching on a monitor in an adjacent room, her husband fought back tears.

“I’m married to her for 40 years,” he said later, still astonished. “And I don’t know her at all.”

Catherine’s Final Quest

Photographs of grandchildren adorn the tan walls. A silver kettle rests on the stove. A laptop computer sits open on the counter, beside a window that looks out on a garden, a bird feeder and, beyond, an undulating field of grass.

This is the kitchen of Catherine Corless, and her office. She conducts her online research here, and keeps assorted documents on the kitchen table for easy retrieval when yet another call comes in. Can you help me find my mother, my sister, my… She never refuses.

The future of the Tuam grounds that her questioning disturbed has yet to be revealed. The government is grappling with many complexities, including the sad fact that the remains of infants and children, the Marys and Patricks, the Bridgets and Johns, are commingled.

One option is to leave everything as is. Another is to disinter the remains for possible identification and proper burial — although it is unclear whether DNA evidence can be recovered from those who died so young, and so long ago.

Other issues also need resolution. Potential compensation for home baby survivors; litigation against the Bon Secours sisters, who run a vast health-care network; the propriety of children playing above the bones of other children.

And there remains the maddening mystery of why a Catholic order of nuns would bury these children in such a manner. Was it to save a few pounds for the cost of each burial? Was it meant as a kind of catacombs, in echo of the order’s French roots?

The baptism of these children entitled them under canon law to a funeral Mass and burial in consecrated ground. But perhaps the baptismal cleansing of their “original sin” was not enough to also wipe away the shameful nature of their conception. Perhaps, having been born out of wedlock in an Ireland of another time, they simply did not matter.

Her auburn hair cut short, Catherine stands now at her computer, gazing through the window at the garden that blesses her with a sense of oneness with it all. Her begonias are blood-red bursts, her lobelias the bluest of blue, her mind forever returning to the past.

A candy wrapper. Empty.

She has searched school and government records many, many times. So far, though, she has been unable to find the name of one particular little girl from the mother and baby home, her long-ago classmate.

“It would be nice to meet her,” Catherine says, leaving no doubt as to what she would say if given the chance.",The Lost Children of Tuam,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/world/europe/tuam-ireland-babies-children.html

It’s their job to try to see things clearly. Often, what they see in their workplaces is low salaries, inept management and poor communication — ills that plague many workplaces across America. For more than two years now, online media outlets have been unionizing as a way to make our industry better. This week, we learned just how horrifying some rich people find the idea of employees coming together to improve their workplace.

Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade whose family owns the Chicago Cubs, is worth more than $2 billion. He is the owner of DNAinfo, a local news site that covered New York City and Chicago with unparalleled skill, as well as Gothamist, a network of city-oriented websites that DNAinfo bought this year. He is also a major right-wing political donor of rather flexible morality. During the last presidential primaries, Mr. Ricketts spent millions of dollars funding ads that portrayed Donald Trump as an untrustworthy, dangerous misogynist. Once Mr. Trump secured the nomination, Mr. Ricketts spent a million dollars to support him.

One might think that such flexibility would allow Mr. Ricketts to bend but not break when faced with every plutocrat’s worst nightmare: a few dozen modestly paid employees who collectively bargain for better working conditions.

Alas, no.

Six months ago, reporters and editors at DNAinfo-Gothamist announced their intent to join the Writers Guild of America, East. This is the union that my colleagues and I at Gawker Media joined in 2015, and the union that has organized major online media companies like HuffPost, Vice Media, Slate and Thrillist in the past two years. In that short amount of time, unionized “new media” workers have won substantial raises, editorial protections and other improvements that writers at more mature companies take for granted. In defiance of the conventional wisdom that unions are outdated, this young, high-tech industry has been one of the most visible recent successes for organized labor in America.

The DNAinfo-Gothamist announcement sparked a zealous anti-union campaign: Management threatened employees by saying that Joe Ricketts might shut the whole place down if it unionized. Nevertheless, employees last week voted 25-2 in favor of unionization. And on Thursday, Mr. Ricketts abruptly shut the whole place down.

It is worth being clear about exactly what happened here, so that no one gets too smug. DNAinfo was never profitable, but Mr. Ricketts was happy to invest in it for eight years, praising its work all along. Gothamist, on the other hand, was profitable, and a fairly recent addition to the company. One week after the New York team unionized, Mr. Ricketts shut it all down. He did not try to sell the company to someone else. Instead of bargaining with 27 unionized employees in New York City, he chose to lay off 115 people across America. And, as a final thumb in the eye, he initially pulled the entire site’s archives down (they are now back up), so his newly unemployed workers lost access to their published work.

They called themselves the Glass Ceiling Club.

A group of young and ambitious women in the 1990s from the investment bank Bear Stearns would gather at local restaurants every couple of months to discuss how to make the workplace more female friendly. The conversations would inevitably turn to their male colleagues, including the ones who behaved badly, said Maureen Sherry, a former managing director, who met regularly with the other women.

“Of course, our conversations would revert to sharing facts we knew about the men we worked with,” recalled Ms. Sherry, who spent nine years at Bear Stearns before leaving in 2000, adding, “yes, it was mostly the same men who preyed on young women.”

For women who had to interact with some of the most notorious sexual harassers, Ms. Sherry said she recommended they stay on the trading floor — a very public space.

“Survival hints like that were shared pretty freely,” Ms. Sherry wrote in an email.

That was the whisper network at work.

For as long as women have been in the labor force, this kind of behind-the-scenes support system has served as a vital source of shared information and a safe space for communal commiseration. Advice on salary negotiations, office politics and the work-life balance would be disseminated through informal conversations at cubicles, in cafeterias and over drinks at happy hour.

But the network also allowed employees to clue each other into a spectrum of behavior that was often unseen or ignored by their employers — the boss who scoffs at maternity leave, the manager known for ribald jokes, the colleague rumored to be a groper, or worse.

Now, with the internet offering a clearinghouse for complaints — intensified by the outpouring of allegations against prominent figures like the producer Harvey Weinstein — whisper networks have been amplified. Through public forums, invitation-only Facebook groups, private Google surveys, locked websites and shielded threads on anonymous apps, women — and some men — are seeking catharsis and validation by sharing their stories.

“We’re in this interesting period right now, kind of a hopeful period, where having prominent people name and talk about harassment has put a heightened awareness of it on the table,’’ said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women’s Law Center.

“When you have one person come forward, they become a huge target,” she added, “but when more people come out, it’s hard to go after all of them.”

In many cases, the network is driven by firsthand knowledge. Other times, it can be pure speculation. Allegations are often made anonymously and can quickly spread in online forums, damaging reputations before the accused can defend themselves. Men targeted by whisper networks complain of being subject to vigilantism and public shaming; some have threatened legal action.

At Bear Stearns — which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in 2008, during the financial crisis — the Glass Ceiling Club would warn others about the senior manager who had a history of affairs and a tendency to relocate his previous liaisons to remote offices, recalled Ms. Sherry, who last year published a semi-autobiographical novel, “Opening Belle,’’ about her experiences.

The women in the whisper network “weren’t best girlfriends,’’ Ms. Sherry said.

“What we did have in common was that we were ambitious professionals with the common goal of a more equal place of employment and so yes, that included our perplexity over outrageous behavior that went unchecked.“

Two decades later, fewer than two in 10 female harassment victims ever file a formal complaint, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .

The reluctance stems in part from the risks associated with reporting harassment, including fear of retaliation, according to The Harvard Business Review . Many women have reported being fired or sidelined at work after speaking up and labeled troublemakers while their tormentors face few, if any, consequences.

But when the whisper network moves onto social media platforms, accusations can gather momentum and quickly yield results.

In early October, a number of women came forward on Twitter to accuse Andy Signore, the creator of the popular YouTube series “Honest Trailers” and “Screen Junkies,” of sexual harassment.

One woman, April O’Donnell, said in a series of Twitter posts that Mr. Signore had tried to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. Ms. O’Donnell, who did not return several attempts to reach her, said on her Twitter feed that she and two other women had reported Mr. Signore in August to human resources at Defy Media, which owns “Screen Junkies,” which said it started an investigation.

But on their Twitter feeds, some women said the investigation seemed to stall and it was not until the allegations became public that Defy Media took action.

In a statement on Twitter on Oct. 8, Defy Media confirmed Mr. Signore’s termination, saying that new information had become available and the “scope and magnitude of his inappropriate actions became apparent.”

In a statement through his lawyer, Yana Henriks, Mr. Signore denied any allegations of sexual assault, harassment or retaliation. He said that Defy Media used the allegations made against him as an opportunity to deprive him of his ownership stake in the company.

Social media helps retain and spread what Ms. Graves, of the National Women’s Law Center, calls “institutional memory.” A written story is easier to pass along than a spoken one, even if the original teller is anonymous, based in another office or leaves the company, she said.

The invitation-only Facebook group Tech Ladies provides information on job openings and invitations to networking events. But it also has a discussion called #HelpASisterOut where members can solicit advice about how to come forward with a harassment complaint or to ask about a company’s reputation or culture.

“What we’ll see is someone post that they are applying for a job at a company and ask if anyone has any good or bad stories about it,” said Allison Esposito, the founder of Tech Ladies. “If it was great, you’ll see that in the comments. But if it wasn’t, people will say ‘DM me’ or ‘let’s take it to the phone,’ to share the information.”

An app called Blind allows all employees from more than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Airbnb, to sign up through their work email but then chat anonymously about office and industry issues.

But in the past year, Blind has also become a hotbed for frank talk about sexual harassment.

When Susan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, claimed on her personal blog in February that her sexual harassment accusations against a direct supervisor were ignored by the company’s human resources department, Uber employees logged in to Blind more than 10 times on average each day — spending more than 3.5 hours — to discuss the scandal.

Outlets now abound for women — especially younger, newer employers — who might be left out of tightly guarded cliques of trust at work.

In private Facebook groups, women in the comedy profession share a list of men who have been banned from various venues across the country for inappropriate sexual behavior.

BetterBrave , an online guide to resources for sexual harassment victims in the workplace, has had more than 30,000 visits since being started this summer by three female friends in the tech industry. SheWorx, an advocacy group for female entrepreneurs, hosts an online survey asking for anonymous submissions of experiences related to gender-based bias and harassment, “from egregious incidents to the small paper cuts and micro-aggressions experienced every day.”

The anonymity attached to some allegations has spurred debate. A Google spreadsheet that named dozens of men in the media world, identifying individuals with descriptions ranging from leering to sexual harassment to assault, drew a mixed reaction when it was publicized in October.

Some applauded the public outing of the men who were accused. But others were outraged that the document had been widely disseminated, that the allegations had been made anonymously and the accused given no opportunity to defend or remove themselves from the list.

For Amanda Aiken, the whisper network worked. Sort of.

Ms. Aiken was a new paralegal at a small Canadian real estate investment firm when, during a company event in 2011, a top executive repeatedly tried to cajole her into going back to his home.

“His entire body was touching mine — I would try to get away from him, physically move away, and he would try to follow me,” she recalled in an interview.

In the following days, she learned that several other female colleagues had similar stories, including her friend, Erin Carson. After word filtered up to management, the women were soon summoned to a meeting with one of the company’s owners to discuss their allegations.

“There was some anger, there were some tears,” Ms. Carson, a receptionist at the firm in Victoria, B.C., said in an interview. “But it was kind of reassuring to know we weren’t alone.”

The executive left the company soon afterward. Ms. Aiken quit her job, citing a lingering feeling of awkwardness.

“Too many women have commented about how they just gave up because men didn’t listen when we said no and we felt powerless,” she said. “I want to get my power back.”

In most of the country, it is still unclear whether marijuana will be sold only in government-run stores. And most provinces have yet to decide the amount of marijuana that individuals will be able to possess or grow.

Nor have most provincial governments decided on the minimum age for buyers, or where smoking marijuana will be legal. The federal government must also explain how it will deal with international drug treaties that prohibit marijuana sales.

Even the precise starting date for legal pot is a mystery.

On top of that, and perhaps counterintuitively, police forces are warning that successful inauguration of a legal system for selling marijuana will require an accompanying crackdown on the black market.

Despite all these challenges, suppliers are optimistic that legal recreational sales will be a reality by summer.

“I 100 percent think Canada will be ready,” said John Fowler, the chief executive of Supreme, which has been selling medical marijuana since 2016. “But I think the real question is: What does ‘ready’ mean?”

The answer, Mr. Fowler said, will be managing expectations in the early days.

“Canadians should not expect that on Day 1, the legal market is going to supply the billions of dollars of illegal cannabis being consumed in Canada,” he said in his windowless office at the greenhouse complex near the shore of Lake Huron where employees work in disposable suits and hairnets to avoid contaminating the multimillion-dollar crop. “That will take time, and I think that’s fine.”

Even with the uncertainty, many investors are betting there is money to be made on legal marijuana. Last month, Constellation Brands, a major wine and beer distributor in the United States, invested $245 million in Canopy Growth, the owner of several licensed medical marijuana growers in Canada.

While the commercial side is upbeat, many provincial leaders say Mr. Trudeau’s timetable of legalization by July — one of his main campaign promises — is unrealistic. Some have demanded a delay.

In a statement, Brad Wall, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that he and several of his counterparts believed a postponement was needed to deal with all the questions.

“Despite these concerns, the federal government has not changed its timetable,” Mr. Wall said.

Speaking with reporters last month, Brian Pallister, the premier of Manitoba, said that his province is reluctantly working to meet the federal government’s schedule.

“That doesn’t mean I like it,” he said. “I’m going to continue to express my concerns about the rapidity of this change.”

But Bill Blair, the former police chief of Toronto and a Liberal member of Parliament tasked by Mr. Trudeau with overseeing the marijuana issue, said that the government will stick with its plan. He dismissed suggestions that the process was rushed, noting that the federal government had been discussing the issue with provinces for two years.

“I don’t minimize the complexity of the work ahead,” Mr. Blair said on Friday. “But by establishing a date for implementation, it’s focused the process.” Further delay, he added, “just facilitates vast windfalls of profit to criminal enterprises.”

Of the three provinces that have released broad outlines, the plans put forth by Ontario and Alberta, although sketchy, treat marijuana much like alcohol.

In Alberta, marijuana will be available in licensed, privately owned shops. Ontario, which has a population of 13.6 million spanning two time zones, will set up 150 government-owned stores. The buying ages will be 18 in Alberta, 19 in Ontario. (Ontario introduced legislation for its new system this past week, but many important details will come later.)

How the provinces and the federal government will divide the tax revenue is still unclear. Governments do not want a repeat of their experience with cigarettes, in which high taxes intended to discourage smoking created a large black market.

Many police forces are among the groups calling for a delay. While a new law will allow the police to use saliva tests to identify marijuana-impaired drivers, what will qualify as impairment has yet to be defined. Little equipment to conduct the tests is now in the field, and few officers have been trained in its use.

“Are we going to be ready?” asked Mario Harel, the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the head of the force in Gatineau, Quebec. “We don’t think so. We’re dealing with a lot of situations so we’re going to be doing our best to be as ready as possible.”

While some Canadians are questioning the accuracy of salvia tests, Robert Mann, a scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health who studies cannabis use, said the tests have proved valid in other countries, although he acknowledged that marijuana’s active ingredient was not as easily measured as alcohol.

His larger concern, he said, is changing public opinion about whether it is safe to drive under the influence of marijuana.

“There’s quite a common perception that you can drive safely under the influence of cannabis,” Dr. Mann said, adding that this view is based in part on now-refuted research from about 20 years ago. “It took quite a while for people’s attitudes about drinking and driving to change.”

The authorities have also faced black-market sales in stores after Mr. Trudeau’s legalization announcement. Cities and provinces have taken different approaches to the black-market shops. In Vancouver, where they are most numerous, officials try to keep control through business licenses. In other areas, particularly Quebec, the police have moved swiftly to close them down.

Mr. Trudeau’s government has repeatedly said that the stores are illegal and will not be a part of the new recreational market.

Brendan Kennedy, the president of Tilray, a licensed medical marijuana producer, said the experience of American states with legalization suggested that the stores will quickly wither away in the face of a legal alternative — provided that “there is adequate supply and adequate locations of legal products.”

Mr. Harel, the police chief, is less certain the black market will vanish anytime soon after legalization.

He anticipates that the illegal market will aggressively promote food laced with marijuana, one of many products that will not immediately be allowed under the new system. In his view, the success of the legal system will rest on swiftly and aggressively shutting down the black market.

“We figure it’s an $8 billion-a-year economy,” he said of illegal marijuana sales. Legalization, he added, will change the dynamics of the black market. “But we don’t think it will fade away.”","Ready or Not, Recreational Marijuana Use Is Coming to Canada",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/canada/canada-marijuana-legal-justin-trudeau.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

BEIJING — A mere month after China put in force a law threatening up to 15 days of detention for disrespecting its national anthem, lawmakers have decided that the punishment was far from enough — by almost three years.

The swift change to the law was made with none of the fierce public debate about free speech and patriotic duty that erupted in the United States after football players knelt in dissent when “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played. Such discussion would be nearly unthinkable in China, where the party squashes dissent and most people would object to such protests during the anthem, called “March of the Volunteers”

The lawmakers took the step even though there seem to be few, if any, cases of people protesting in China by reworking the national anthem. But the move reflects the deepening demands for patriotic devotion that have been encouraged by Xi Jinping, the president and party leader who has made the “Chinese Dream” his signature political theme.

NEW DELHI — I remember so well the first time I visited New York. I was 13, and though I had been to America once before, New York had deliberately been kept from me. The name alone conjured an adult world of glamour and excitement, the mythic New York of the 1980s: Andy Warhol and Studio 54. “It’s not a place for children,” my mother said firmly.

And my God, was she right! Within moments of our arrival in Manhattan, the gay pride parade started. It was not then the tame, corporate affair it is now. It was a bacchanal. There were not one, but two parades, and we were swept up — myself, my mother and her friend, a longtime New Yorker — in the unofficial one heading down Fifth Avenue. It was a roistering river of humanity, half in leather, half nude. Unruly regiments, hair blue, pink and green, went past, covered in glitter, tattoos and fairy dust.

For a sheltered teenager from India, who had never so much as seen an exposed breast in real life, let alone a set of pierced genitals, it was all deeply shocking, and deeply exhilarating. It was 1994. The AIDS epidemic raged and gay rights were a distant dream; the parade was full of the spirit of revolution.

I did not know at the time that I would later return to the city for the very same freedoms that were being fought for in the street that day. What I do know is that the Delhi prude in me died that June afternoon. I watched my mother’s friend, a tall statuesque woman, stride casually into a restroom. When a big, burly man tried to point out that it was the men’s toilet, she said, “So? This is New York!”

It’s hard not to think of that time now. Most of the eight people killed in the terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday were foreigners visiting New York. One group, especially — five friends from Argentina celebrating the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation — had been planning their trip for years. They were part of a great unorganized commonwealth of people, out in the world, whose imagination New York has captured. It is heartbreaking to think that those for whom the dream of New York is most alluring should be the victims of so vivid a nightmare.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

Tricky Clues

61A: If you are knowledgeable about poetry, KEATS might have been a gimme. I had John DONNE at first, but I know enough about cooking to know that a “Stir-fry vessel” is not a WOD, it’s a WOK.

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Thanks for dropping by, Mr. Kaskel.

(The style seems especially popular among women in their 20s and 30s — trumping the received wisdom that one should flaunt one’s body before it is marked by the supposed scourges of childbearing or menopause.) It can also sometimes seem like an elitist project of sociocultural self-positioning: By embracing the covered-up look, you declare yourself part of a particular psychographic tribe, one whose members don’t just dress for other women, but for a particular subset of other women — those who get it, who are sophisticated enough to understand that opting out of conventional beauty standards makes for its own kind of conceptual, better-than-thou fashion. It also, however, has the feel of a real dare. Observing this version of feminist signaling, which conflates the rebel, haphazard spirit of a Bloomsbury Group-like smockishness with traces of early ’90s grunge and a dash of post-bellum Sunday best, we might begin to ask ourselves: What happens when women start dressing in ways that are less than conventionally flattering? Why are they doing it? And what does it look like when fashion choices that might have been linked to female oppression perform in the service of liberation?

HISTORICALLY, CONSERVATIVE dressing is most frequently associated with religious adherence, which makes the most recent, trendier iteration of the phenomenon especially surprising — considering the kind of woman who is newly sheathing herself in long, baggy silhouettes is often the type of liberal nonbeliever who’d be the first to eschew any traditional strictures on her choices, sartorial or otherwise. Orthodox Jews follow the laws of tzniut (literally “modesty” in Hebrew), according to which the body of a woman — and her hair, too, if she’s married — should be substantively covered; observant Muslim women often wear a version of the hijab and loose-fitting, figure-obscuring clothing in public settings; and women in traditional Christian communities, from Amish to Mennonite, wear long dresses and, sometimes, some form of head covering. But whether one believes it’s a marker of outdated patriarchal coercion or a choice to be made by the devout woman herself, what seems clear is that this kind of dressing has until recently been seen as miles away from what a modern secular woman would want to wear.

This contradiction might be best embodied in the story of the lifestyle magazine Kinfolk — a publication that led the charge in advancing the kind of woodsy-hipster design-and-fashion aesthetic that has grown popular in America’s most liberal enclaves, from Silver Lake to Fort Greene, but that also has its roots in the Mormon upbringing of its founders, who established it in 2011 while attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. The humble, homespun spirit usually associated with retiring, self-enclosed communities of believers has been imported, not unlike the covered-up dressing trend, to an arena that feels largely alien to it, but that embraces its tenets — the handcrafted, the natural, the rustic — at least inasmuch as they can be marketed as a kind of soothing artisanal salve to the alienations of late-capitalist life.

SPEAKING TO some nonreligious women who tend to dress modestly, however, goes a way toward clarifying the style’s utility and function, as well as some of its inherent ambiguities. Thirty-two-year-old Hannah Hoffman, who runs her own eponymous gallery in Los Angeles, says she prefers figure-enshrouding outfits, mostly from Céline, to any other look. This is a matter of being both mobile and versatile — with her low heels and wide-cut pants, Hoffman told me, she can always jump up to grab an artwork or walk clients through her space — but the roots of her choices go deeper. “Everyone who’s involved on the commercial side of the art world is transacting on desire, for an object but also for an experience,” she said. “So you have to walk a very particular line in order to not dilute it, or misrepresent it, so people won’t get confused about what you’re selling them.” As a young woman helming her own business, this is a line that Hoffman feels she has to be careful not to cross, and she told me that rather than a more conventionally feminine aura, she prefers to project a “rigor and intellectual thoughtfulness” with her clothing choices. Commenting on the body-conscious silhouette prevalent among assistant-level gallery girls when she was starting in the art world in the mid-2000s, Hoffman noted how the power of a certain breed of male gallery owner had often seemed to her to be transacted through exactly such specters of young female sexuality, “and that’s not something you want to do.” Still, sometimes she wonders why she is the one who has to police the boundaries of appropriateness: Why is it, she said, that “if you wear a short skirt and a collector hits on you, it’s your fault?”

There is something dispiriting (though perhaps not surprising, considering, for one, who America elected for president) about the ongoing need to consider such questions — after at least three waves of feminism have asserted a woman’s right to self-determination over her own body, and, by extension, her clothing choices. Haven’t we realized by now that women not only shouldn’t be held responsible for men’s misreading of their cues, but that, moreover, they might come to see their bodies and sexuality as a source of power to be reveled in rather than guarded? (Certainly, another recent leaning in fashion — that toward body positivity and acceptance — has been championing exposing rather than obscuring bodies of all sizes.)

Still, Hoffman’s perspective is familiar and understandable: Being a woman, one needs to frequently assess others’ expectations over and against one’s own. As the 21-year-old actress, writer and editor Tavi Gevinson told me, the relative modesty — or lack thereof — of her clothing choices reflects more than her own individual preferences. If she’s going on an audition, she won’t dress in what she called “a frumpy art teacher look” (a look, as she joked during our conversation, that could also be called “Brooklyn mom” or “European baby”). Rather, “I would dress in something that makes my figure look nice, because people are stupid, and most of the time when they say, ‘We want her to come in again,’ what they really mean is ‘Wear something more conventionally attractive.’ ” In the publishing world, however, when Gevinson wants to be taken more seriously, as a thinker rather than a body, a dowdier look is helpful, so she can seem, she said, “as if I’ve somehow matured past a quote unquote juvenile desire to be perceived as a woman.” The formula, then, is flipped, but not in a way that’s necessarily more freeing.

THE STATE OF wanting to be looked at is often mingled with self-consciousness about that very desire. I’ve always thought that one of the reasons the “Little House on the Prairie” books continue to be popular with tween girls, many decades after they were first published, is that their presentation of the difficulties inherent to a girl’s maturation into womanhood are mediated through the cushioning presence of yards of calico, wool and muslin. As a 10-year-old, excited but terrified at the prospect of my own encroaching puberty, reading the passages in “Little Town on the Prairie” (1941) detailing, say, Mary Ingalls’s going-away-to-college outfit, with its “gored skirt of brown cashmere,” and “overskirt ... of brown-and-blue plaid” not to mention its confusingly named “flounced train” and “pleated flounce” (were those one and the same?) acted as a balm, a calming litany; covered-up fashion, it seemed, could protect you from the grenade that your body was slowly but surely becoming.

Keeping this potential explosiveness to oneself, however, could also be understood as a sign of strength. As 32-year-old Aminatou Sow, a digital strategist and the co-host of the popular podcast “Call Your Girlfriend,” told me, “if you let women dress for themselves, we’d all be wearing muumuus and caftans.” Sow, who grew up Muslim in Guinea and Nigeria before moving to Europe and then the States, cited the comfort factor of these silhouettes (“anything that looks like a sack is my jam”), but also the sense of inner confidence that they foster, one that she first recognized in the women she grew up among in West Africa. “It’s part of my cultural heritage. ... I don’t need to show my shoulders, I don’t need to show my back. I know what I’m carrying underneath this thing,” she said. “I really disagree with women who think walking around naked is liberation. I’m like, ‘I’m sorry, too may people get to enjoy this for it to be liberation,’ ” she added, only half in jest. Instead, she cites figures like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who, first as actresses and street-style sensations and later as designers of the Row, made dressing in long, hobo-ish layers chic. “It was really jarring, and men didn’t like it,” Sow recalled to me. “But there was something disgusting and liberating about it. These were girls who didn’t care how anyone else was supposed to be dressing. It was the rejection of body politics.”

Navigating the world in a woman’s body remains a fraught proposition in the most quotidian and granular of ways. And a woman with her body de-emphasized, with her conventional calling card scrapped — what a puzzle she is! I recall a couple of years ago walking in downtown Manhattan and spotting the writer Sheila Heti across the street. It was late fall, and as far as I can recall, Heti, whom I’ve never met, was wearing a knee-length nubby coat over a long skirt and some practical lace-up shoes, all in varying shades of gray and brown. In all the more typical ways, she was looking maybe a little drab, maybe a little dowdy. And yet, there was something about her air that was enviable. There she was, walking along, her hair in a ponytail, carrying a book and swinging it at her side, as if without a care in the world. She seemed completely at home — and completely herself — in her essentially concealed body.","Modest Dressing, as a Virtue",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/t-magazine/modest-fashion-clothes.html

Col. Jeffrey R. Nance, the sentencing judge, acknowledged the import of Trump’s toxic statements, but despite the protests of Sergeant Bergdahl’s lawyers, Colonel Nance felt that he could remain unbiased and refused to dismiss Sergeant Bergdahl’s case.

Sergeant Bergdahl and future troops would have benefited from a swift condemnation of Mr. Trump’s de facto attempts at judge-tampering. Sergeant Bergdahl’s sentence is under final review by military authorities, including the Army Court of Criminal Appeals, and on Friday, the president continued to try to exert influence, calling the sentence, as it stands, a “total disgrace to our country and our military.”

Sergeant Bergdahl will soon receive his dishonorable discharge. He will be a civilian with significant physical disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder and a very high risk of suicide. Of the six types of discharge, dishonorable is the most punishing. When he is discharged, Sergeant Bergdahl will be denied almost all reintegration benefits — including comprehensive medical — and he will also not be recognized as a veteran by the federal government. He will come back wounded to family and friends who love him, without the expert medical care of a country that must balance its responsibility to punish him and to heal him.

The trajectory of Sergeant Bergdahl’s career speaks to tragic and avoidable flaws in the military mental health care system. Sergeant Bergdahl suffers from schizotypal personality disorder, and it was only after a mental health-related discharge from the Coast Guard that the Army enlisted him on a medical waiver. If his illness had been treated before his crimes, he could have been eligible for an honorable discharge with benefits. The available military record shows that when Sergeant Bergdahl left his place of duty, he was an exemplary, idealistic young soldier who lived with mental illness, not a traitor.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s offenses put the lives of fellow soldiers at risk. At his court-martial, prosecutors highlighted several profound and permanent injuries to troops during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, but Army investigators have stated that none were killed during attempts to find him.

Sergeant Bergdahl has expressed profound remorse and admitted that he “made a horrible mistake” when he left his post. In his skewed logic, he believed that he “was trying to help,” and it was never his intention “for anyone to be hurt.”

There is still a chance for the military to review and reduce the sentence, but if they choose to uphold it, Sergeant Bergdahl deserves the immediate intervention of civilian-led authorities who have the power to use clemency to grant a less severe discharge. By definition, clemency is an act of mercy. It would not absolve Sergeant Bergdahl of guilt, but both the secretary of the Army and the Army Board for Correction of Military Records have the authority to use it to give him a less severe discharge that preserves the benefits that he needs to heal and to lead a long life.

Clemency is rare, but if Sergeant Bergdahl’s voluminous public record is a guide, I believe that he could present a strong case. Authorities must consider mitigating factors, including his in-service conduct, wounds he received in action, his mental health, and whether he met normal military accession standards.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s military service cannot be reduced to his crimes. I would argue that his profound and unexpected contribution to the military truly began the day he was captured.

Although Sergeant Bergdahl had left his post and put others in danger, he fought, resisted, collected a “gold mine” of intelligence on the enemy and — at great risk to his life — tried to escape multiple times, including a daring attempt in which he eluded the Taliban for eight and a half days. In time, his exemplary service to our country as a prisoner of war will direct and inspire the survival of other P.O.W.s.

If necessary, members of Congress should send a bipartisan letter to the secretary of the Army in support of a less severe discharge for Sergeant Bergdahl that ensures medical benefits. Moreover, this year, Congress must pass a bill that ensures medical care and disability benefits for all former prisoners of war, regardless of discharge status.

Sergeant Bergdahl’s permanently injured, would-be rescuers are selfless and brave. But we must remember that — regardless of Sergeant Bergdahl’s tragic and unnecessary circumstances of capture — it was the enemies of America who tortured him and tried to kill those who sought to rescue him.

The Playlist: The Return of the Real Boy Band and 10 More New Songs

Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, N.E.R.D. snaps back to life, Bruce Springsteen contributes a song to a film about veterans coping with PTSD, and Feist honors Leonard Cohen.

Prettymuch, ‘Open Arms’

Kudos to whatever musicologist-historian is masterminding the rise of the new boy band Prettymuch. Maybe it’s Simon Cowell, who signed the group. Or maybe its ILYA, the Max Martin associate who produced (and contributed writing to) this song, the group’s third. Whoever it is, that person is savvily backdooring the sound and attitude of 1990s male R&B singing groups into modern pop. “Would You Mind,” the first Prettymuch single, contained some subtle nods to Bell Biv DeVoe’s “Poison” and Boyz II Men’s “Motownphilly.” And “Open Arms” has some strategic references to Shai’s “If I Ever Fall in Love.” Shuttling between pure a cappella and a spare, sharp beat, the group performs what feels like a deconstruction of that classic, emphasizing taut five-part harmonies doled out in tight bursts. The singing is mature, the attitude is poised, the eyes are on history. JON CARAMANICA

N.E.R.D and Rihanna, ‘Lemon’

Beginning in the early 2000s, N.E.R.D — Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the production duo the Neptunes) and Shae Haley — created inventive and pugnacious punk-funk born from hip-hop DNA. “Lemon” is its first single since its last album, in 2010 (not counting some songs for “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water”). It features a beat that throbs and tinkles, Mr. Williams barking and jabbing as if in a boxing ring, and also Rihanna, rapping with tremendous attitude. “Lemon” also appears to mark the beginning of a full-fledged return of N.E.R.D (which stands for No One Ever Really Dies) which, in addition to releasing this song, is performing its first concert in years this weekend at ComplexCon in Long Beach, Calif. J.C.

Stella Donnelly, ‘Boys Will Be Boys’

A delicate waltz by the Australian songwriter Stella Donnelly carries a bitter reproach to blaming the victims of sexual assault. “Why was she all alone/Wearing her shirt that low?” she sings, and then her voice rises and roughens. “They said boys will be boys/Deaf to the word no.” She released the song earlier this year on an EP, “ Thrush Metal,” but the video clip appears right in time to reinforce the #MeToo movement. JON PARELES

Willow, ‘Oh No!!!!’

On her 17th birthday, Oct. 31, Willow Smith released her second album, “The 1st,” produced and written almost entirely on her own. It’s a daring, accomplished, stripped-down album a world away from any R&B expectations. The songs are far closer to the bare-bones settings and emotional volatility of early PJ Harvey, along with some of the metaphysical musings of late-1960s psych-folk. “Oh No!!!!” is one of its tormented love songs, wondering, “Why can’t I control it?” and arguing with itself over a clattering beat and dissonant guitar, an unresolved flare-up of romantic anxiety. J.P.

Bruce Springsteen, ‘Freedom Cadence’

A chant long used by marching soldiers, and updated with each new war, “Freedom Cadence,” supplied the words and melody of Bruce Springsteen’s song for the closing credits of “Thank You for Your Service,” a film about Iraq veterans coping with PTSD. “Freedom is won/through the blood of someone’s son,” he sings. It’s a lo-fi production, with piano, harmonium, banjo and a somber, simple drumbeat in the murky mix alongside the voice of Mr. Springsteen, alone and then joined by others including Adam Schumann, the soldier whose story underlies the film. It trudges onward, elegiac and determined. J.P.

Brian Blade and the Fellowship Band, ‘Within Everything’

With Brian Blade’s Fellowship Band, which has been together in one form or another for 20 years, the jazz combo becomes a kind of traveling backyard communion. In this music — Southern and ungothic, slow and almost hymnal — you hear dreams passed around between companions, atrophied memories held together in communal trust. On “Body and Shadow” — the Fellowship’s fourth album, out next week — Mr. Blade, a renowned drummer, lets his knack for ground-opening syncopations take a back seat; his compatriots forgo the kind of high-flown soloing that he’s so good at conjuring. Instead, coming to the fore is a rich shadow play of harmonies and earth tones. Together, Dave Devine’s guitar, Chris Thomas’s bass, Melvin Butler’s tenor saxophone and (on tracks other than this) Myron Walden’s bass clarinet make a sound like damp wood underfoot, welcoming your step on a trail you’ve long known. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Sam Smith, ‘Burning’ (Live From the Hackney Round Chapel)

Admire the patience of Sam Smith ’s bassist and backup singers in this live rendition of “Burning,” a despondent hymn of lost love tinged with nicotine addiction. Despite the tremulous purity of his voice, he claims to be smoking “oh, more than 20 a day” since the breakup, and as he yearns for a reunion, he offers, “Wish we could smoke again just for a day.” Reinforcing his loneliness, he’s accompanied for nearly the entire song only by piano chords; the others don’t join him until three minutes into the song, for one chorus, and then they’re silent again. J.P.

Feist, ‘Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye’

In a quiet tribute from one Canadian songwriter to another, Feist sings Leonard Cohen’s fond and profound farewell to a lover, “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye,” with quiet longing. Her version is both close to and distant from his; an acoustic guitar is the only instrument, while her layered voices portray her close attention to the song’s shifting moods. J.P.

Tee Grizzley, ‘Win’

The most striking aspect of Tee Grizzley’s breakout single, “First Day Out,” was its breathlessness. He raps with something more than urgency — it’s more like insistence. That song, an unexpected hit last year, felt like a barreling train that refused to slow down. On “Win,” his best song since, he hasn’t let up a bit, success be damned: “Without me my family wouldn’t have food/Anybody going ‘gainst me gotta lose.” Even though Tee Grizzley moves bullishly, what enlivens his verses are the quick flashes of mordant wit: “The Mustang used to always run out of gas/now I’m in that Wraith, touch the paint and it’s a body bag.” J.C.

Cam, ‘Diane’

The good old country cheating song gets even more twisted in “Diane”: an apology by a deceived lover, who knows she didn’t see any “gold wedding band,” to her lover’s wife. “I promise I didn’t know he was your man,” she sings. It’s not a lament: it’s a gallop, quick-strummed and belted. “All of those nights that he’s given to me/I wish I could give them back to you,” Cam offers, in a kind of adulterous humblebrag, over an arrangement that’s closer to the E Street Band than to Loretta Lynn. J.P.

Empyrean Atlas, ‘Echolocation’

Depending on the tune, the interwoven triple-guitar gamesmanship of Empyrean Atlas can run in few different directions: toward the mathy post-punk of Horse Lords or Battles, toward warmly anesthetic ambience (say, Pink Floyd meets Bradford Cox), or toward West African high life. On “Echolocation,” the clangy, lapping repetitions feel most in line with that last influence. The quintet’s movements are coiled and contained, but pulsing with small, ecstatic fibrillations.

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

Dr. William E. Boden, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine, called the results “unbelievable.”

Dr. David Maron, a cardiologist at Stanford University, praised the new study as “very well conducted” but said that it left some questions unanswered. The participants had a profound blockage but only in one artery, he noted, and they were assessed after just six weeks.

For the study, Dr. Justin E. Davies, a cardiologist at Imperial College London, and his colleagues recruited 200 patients with a profoundly blocked coronary artery and chest pain severe enough to limit physical activity, common reasons for inserting a stent.

All were treated for six weeks with drugs to reduce the risk of a heart attack, like aspirin, a statin and a blood pressure drug, as well as medications that relieve chest pain by slowing the heart or opening blood vessels.

Then the subjects had a procedure: a real or fake insertion of a stent. This is one of the few studies in cardiology in which a sham procedure was given to controls who were then compared to patients receiving the actual treatment.

In both groups, doctors threaded a catheter through the groin or wrist of the patient and, with X-ray guidance, up to the blocked artery. Once the catheter reached the blockage, the doctor inserted a stent or, if the patient was getting the sham procedure, simply pulled the catheter out.

Neither the patients nor the researchers assessing them afterward knew who had received a stent. Following the procedure, both groups of patients took powerful drugs to prevent blood clots.

The stents did what they were supposed to do in patients who received them. Blood flow through the previously blocked artery was greatly improved.

When the researchers tested the patients six weeks later, both groups said they had less chest pain, and they did better than before on treadmill tests.

But there was no real difference between the patients, the researchers found. Those who got the sham procedure did just as well as those who got stents.

Cardiologists said one reason might be that atherosclerosis affects many blood vessels, and stenting only the largest blockage may not make much difference in a patient’s discomfort. Those who report feeling better may only be experiencing a placebo effect from the procedure.

“All cardiology guidelines should be revised,” Dr. David L. Brown of Washington University School of Medicine and Dr. Rita F. Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in an editorial published with the new study.

Clinical guidelines in the United States say stenting is appropriate for patients with a blocked artery and chest pain who have tried optimal medical therapy, meaning medications like those given to the study patients.

But those guidelines were based on studies in which patients simply said they felt better after having stents inserted.

“It was impressive how negative it was,” Dr. Redberg said of the new study. Since the procedure carries some risks, including death, stents should be used only for people who are having heart attacks, she added.

Stents came into wide use in the 1990s and became the treatment of choice because they were less invasive than bypass surgery. But there have long been questions about their effectiveness.

A large, federally funded study with Dr. Maron as a co-principal investigator, which does not have an untreated control group, is now underway to determine whether medications can be just as effective as stenting or coronary bypass in preventing heart attacks.

In 2007, another large study led by Dr. Boden — also without an untreated control group — found stents did not prevent heart attacks or deaths from heart disease.

The explanation, researchers said, was that atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease. A few arteries might be blocked today, and then reopened with stents. But tomorrow a blockage might arise in another artery and cause a heart attack.

Relieving chest pain, though, seemed a different goal to many cardiologists. After all, the heart is a muscle, and if a muscle is starved for blood, it aches.

Many patients have coronary arteries that are 80 to 90 percent blocked. Surely opening those vessels should make the patients feel better.

The idea that stenting relieves chest pain is so ingrained that some experts said they expect most doctors will continue with stenting, reasoning that the new research is just one study.

Even Dr. Davies hesitated to say patients like those he tested should not get stents. “Some don’t want drugs or can’t take them,” he said.

Stenting is so accepted that American cardiologists said they were amazed ethics boards agreed to a study with a sham control group.

But in the United Kingdom, said Dr. Davies, getting approval for the study was not so difficult. Neither was it difficult to find patients.

“There are many people who are open to research, and if you tell them you are exploring a question, people agree,” he said. Nonetheless, it took him three and a half years to find the subjects for his study.

Ethics boards at many American hospitals probably would resist, since giving such patients fake procedures “flies in the face of guidelines,” Dr. Boden said.

Placebo effects can be surprisingly powerful, said Dr. Neal Dickert, Jr., a cardiologist and ethicist at Emory University.

A few years ago, researchers — at the insistence of the Food and Drug Administration — did a study to test an invasive procedure to treat high blood pressure. The control group got a sham procedure.

The method was becoming popular in Europe, but the study found that blood pressure dropped just as much in those who had the fake treatment.

Dr. Dickert said he hoped the new stent study will show cardiologists that they need to do more studies with sham procedures.

“This may turn out to be an important moment,” he said.

But getting them underway in the United States may not be easy. Ethics boards at hospitals and universities are likely to resist, as are patients.

“It’s not just up to us,” said Dr. David Goff, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Still, the results of the new research have at least one heart specialist rethinking his practice.

Dr. Nallamothu got an advance look at the new paper on Tuesday. Coincidentally, he had a patient, Jim Stevens, 54, a lawyer in Troy, Mich., scheduled to receive a stent that day.

Mr. Stevens had a blocked artery, but the new report gave Dr. Nallamothu second thoughts. “I took him off the table,” he said.

He explained to Mr. Stevens and his wife that he did not need a stent. “I was surprised,” Mr. Stevens said.

That inspired the title of the book — which will be published Nov. 14 by HarperCollins — as a quote that seemed to carry a double meaning.

“At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Mr. Updegrove, the author of several books on the presidency, said in an interview. “But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia.”

In discussing Mr. Trump, the elder president was blunter. “I don’t like him,” Mr. Bush said in May 2016. “I don’t know much about him, but I know he’s a blowhard. And I’m not too excited about him being a leader.” Rather than being motivated by public service, Mr. Bush said Mr. Trump seemed to be driven by “a certain ego.”

The younger Mr. Bush was more circumspect, but also clearly disapproving. The Bushes felt stung by Mr. Trump’s ground-burning attacks that helped destroy the campaign of Jeb Bush, the son and brother of the presidents.

“You can either exploit the anger, incite it,” George W. Bush told Mr. Updegrove, “or you can come up with ideas to deal with it.” Jeb, he said, came up with solutions, “but it didn’t fit with the mood.”

“If you’re angry with the powers that be,” he added, “you’re angry with the so-called establishment, and there’s nothing more established than having a father and brother that have been president.”

When Mr. Trump declared that “I’m my own adviser,” Mr. Bush thought he did not understand the presidency. He also lamented Mr. Trump’s lack of humility. “As you know from looking at my family, it is a certain heritage, that’s what they expect, and we’re not seeing that” in Mr. Trump.

The release of the book comes weeks after the younger Mr. Bush delivered a speech seen as a rebuke of Mr. Trump’s approach to the presidency and the world.

Addressing a conference in New York, Mr. Bush decried what he called the “nativism” of today’s policies and the “casual cruelty” of today’s politics. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bush said that “bigotry seems emboldened” and “our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.”

Mr. Updegrove, the former director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum and now the founding chief executive of the National Medal of Honor Museum, got to know both Bushes in recent years and persuaded them to talk with him for a book on their relationship, a subject that they had been allergic to while their political careers were still active.

The two men disputed Shakespearean assumptions about father-son rivalries and insisted they remained close throughout the younger Mr. Bush’s presidency, despite suspicions about a rift over the Iraq war. But George W. Bush’s parents were clearly disturbed by the influence of Vice President Dick Cheney and neoconservative advisers.

The elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Updegrove reported, counseled his son to consider “shaking up the ticket” in 2004, meaning to replace Mr. Cheney as his running mate — just as the younger Mr. Bush suggested to his father about Vice President Dan Quayle in 1992. Like his father, the son disregarded the advice.

Barbara Bush told Mr. Updegrove that she believed Mr. Cheney changed because of his health troubles, including a heart attack followed by a stent operation shortly after the 2000 election. “I do think he was different,” she said. “I think his heart operation made a difference. I always liked him, but I didn’t like him so much for a while because I thought he hurt George. I wasn’t that fond of him. I think he pushed things a little too far right.”

The younger Mr. Bush resented the implication that anyone was steering him. “The fact that there was any doubt in anyone’s mind about who the president was blows my mind,” he said. He added that Mr. Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his defense secretary, “didn’t make one fucking decision.”

But he insisted Mr. Cheney served him well and said that the vice president’s sometimes dark reputation was inevitable. “I understand the way the system works,” he said. “Somebody has to be the bad guy.”",Both Bush Presidents Worry Trump Is Blowing Up the G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/politics/bush-president-book-trump.html

That’s no longer theoretical: Scientists have now documented a record number of “nuisance flooding” events during high tides. In 2014, nearly half of residents in Hampton Roads, Va., could not get out of their neighborhoods at least once because of tidal flooding.

Meanwhile, as the oceans have warmed, disruptions in United States fisheries, long predicted, are now underway. In 2012, record ocean temperatures caused lobster catches in Maine to peak a month earlier than usual — and the distribution chain was unprepared.

A focus on air quality

While much of the discussion of climate change looks at the role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in warming the planet, the draft report puts a renewed emphasis on the impacts of other atmospheric pollutants like ozone and smoke, which can cause respiratory problems and lead to premature death.

The draft notes with “high confidence” that climate change will increase ozone levels, as rising temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation affect local weather conditions. But the increases will not be uniform; by near the end of the century the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast.

The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.

Adaptation, adaptation, adaptation

Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. Unless, that is, communities take steps to prepare beforehand.

The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That’s slowly changing, the new draft finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.

But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming.

Beyond borders

The United States military has long taken climate change seriously, both for its potential impacts on troops and infrastructure around the world and for its potential to cause political instability in other countries.

The draft report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military. Climate change is already affecting American companies’ overseas operations and supply chains, it says, and as these impacts worsen it will take a toll on trade and the economy.

Global warming and natural disasters are also affecting development in less affluent countries. That, the draft says, puts additional burdens on the United States for humanitarian assistance and disaster aid.

It’s all tied together

The draft report suggests a different approach to assessing the effects of climate change, by considering how various impacts — on food supplies, water and electricity generation, for example — interact with each other.

“It is not possible to understand the full extent of climate-related impacts in the United States without considering these interactions,” the report says.

It gives several examples, including recent droughts in California and elsewhere that, in combination with population changes, affects demand for water and energy. The draft also cites Hurricane Sandy, five years ago, which caused cascading impacts on interconnected systems in the New York area, some of which had not been anticipated. Flooding of subway and highway tunnels, for example, made it more difficult to repair the electrical system, which suffered widespread damage.",What the Climate Report Says About the Impact of Global Warming,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/climate/climate-change-impacts.html

Young bats may not be so different.

Wild fruit bats, living in crowded roosts, are exposed to calls from hundreds of fellow bats from birth. Most often these calls are made in response to unsolicited physical contact, and essentially amount to a crabby “move out of my way.” In a study published Wednesday in PLOS Biology, a team of Israeli researchers found that bat pups match their vocalizations to the group sounds they are immersed in, even if this “dialect” differs from that of their mothers.

Human babies and toddlers pick up the utterances around them effortlessly. The ability, called vocal learning, is considered critical for our spoken language.

But vocal learning has rarely been proven to exist in animals other than humans or songbirds, said Yossi Yovel, a neuroecologist at Tel Aviv University who led the study with graduate students Yosef Prat and Lindsay Azoulay.

In nonhuman mammals, much of the evidence for vocal learning “comes from animals that imitate human speech or other artificial sounds,” such as a zoo elephant emulating the Korean spoken by his keepers, Mr. Prat said. What he and his colleagues wanted to know was how an animal learns the sounds of its own species.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them.

The law was championed by Republicans, who argued that it was crucial to public safety and a rebuff to an overreaching city government in Charlotte, and attracted some Democratic support.

Critics organized a staggering backlash to a measure they called intolerant, anachronistic and contrary to generations of political moderation in North Carolina. Some of the nation’s most influential corporations openly attacked the law; the N.C.A.A. said it would stop hosting championship events in this sports-crazed state; and the Justice Department, under President Barack Obama, brought what could have become a momentous civil rights lawsuit.

About a year after the law took effect, with the potential economic costs projected to run into the billions of dollars, officials struck a deal that transgender rights groups attacked as a “fake repeal” that did not strip away the intent of the measure.

The national outrage ebbed anyway, business groups and convention planners appeared mostly satisfied, and the N.C.A.A. relented.

But, in a signal of how North Carolina has so far been unable to outrun the law’s legacy, political tensions flared again last month when Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, proposed a settlement in related litigation. As part of the deal, Mr. Cooper agreed to declare that “transgender people are not prevented from the use of public facilities in accordance with their gender identity.”

The General Assembly’s leading Republicans, who either declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests, swiftly condemned the proposal as “a stunt” that proved that Mr. Cooper “acted in bad faith and lied about wanting to end the focus on H.B. 2.” (A federal judge in Winston-Salem is considering the proposed settlement.)

Indeed, Republicans contend that any lingering discussion about the law and its repercussions is driven only by transgender rights activists, their elected allies and the news media.

“There is no escape because there are certain interest groups that want to keep bringing it up, and the media loves it, too,” said Pat McCrory, the Republican former governor whose support for H.B. 2 contributed to his defeat last November, when Donald J. Trump easily carried North Carolina.

“Most of us, including me, would just as soon move on,” Mr. McCrory added.

Mr. Cooper, who said in March that the repeal legislation “cannot be the only step,” defended his decisions and said, “They set the fire, and I’m working to put it out.”

“I think most North Carolinians believe we are moving in the right direction, but many of them know we still have more work to do,” said Mr. Cooper, whose actions last month were timed for the day before the deadline for proposals for Amazon’s second headquarters. “But I believe that North Carolina is a welcoming place and a great state to do business. We have taken enough important steps to signal to the world that we’re open for business, and it’s pretty clear that businesses are responding in a positive way.”

Strategists on both sides of the debate agree that voters have tired of talk about H.B. 2, but there is no consensus on how much the law will influence next year’s elections.

“I find it highly unlikely that you will find the national money trying to make North Carolina a cultural battleground state at the legislative level,” said Art Pope, a conservative financier who served in Mr. McCrory’s administration.

A poll conducted by Elon University in April found that about two-thirds of North Carolina’s registered voters thought the state’s reputation had worsened in the year since the law’s approval. Issues like the economy and education now appear most crucial to winning over state voters, but surveys suggest that residents remain irritated over H.B. 2 and the issues that surround it.

“I think the volume has been turned down,” Mr. Hirschy of Equality North Carolina said. “The fervor is still there in our community, and if you ask our opponents, their fervor is still there.”

Perhaps so, to the possible political benefit of both sides. An influential group of religious conservatives recently produced an advertisement complaining that a candidate for mayor of Charlotte “endorsed a radical, national L.G.B.T. agenda allowing men in women’s locker rooms and bathrooms.” The election is Tuesday.

But for many of the state’s transgender residents, estimated at nearly 45,000 by a research institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, H.B. 2’s repercussions do not play out on television screens. They are reflected, transgender people said, in quick decisions about whether to have a second cup of coffee and in choices about how much to share about themselves in conversation.

“Before, whether or not you identified yourself as being transgender to someone was based on whether or not you perceived them as an ally or someone who would be O.K. with it,” said Candis Cox, an activist who is a transgender woman. “Now, what we have is a climate in which you really have a lot of trepidation about trusting people because we have now seen that people can seem to have all of the support in the world for you but have ulterior motives.”

And there is a measured sense that the fury of the H.B. 2 debate could someday be rekindled. On this matter, at least, there is some agreement.

“What we’re seeing is a kind of holding of the breath,” Ms. Cox said. “That’s where we’re at right now because we were dealt this awful blow, and it’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. We don’t know where we are. The people who supported H.B. 2 — the citizens, the politicians — we know that they’re still there.”",An Embattled North Carolina Seeks to Outrun a Law’s Bitter Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/north-carolina-transgender-law.html

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache, a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

As a Mexican woman exploring life beyond the border, she will continue through her poems, she said, to “ask the hard questions, and expect no answers, or several, as playfully and passionately as possible.”","Seeking a Voice, via a Bilingual M.F.A., in Writing and in Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/education/edlife/bilingual-mfa-writing.html

With only a few days before Election Day, and hundreds of thousands of dollars left in campaign war chests, voters are likely to see more television advertisements from Mayor Bill de Blasio, the Democratic incumbent, and his Republican challenger, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis.

Ms. Malliotakis released two new ads this week: one, “I Love New York City,” released a day after a terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan, presented an upbeat vision of her candidacy; the other, released on Friday, contained a frontal attack on Mr. de Blasio and his record, and was called, “Can We Afford Four More Years of Mayor de Blasio?”

Spoiler: Her answer is no.

PRODUCER BrabenderCox

THE SCRIPT “Four years. That’s all it took Bill de Blasio to wreck our quality of life. And now we’re hurting. More homeless today than any time since the Great Depression. Shameful. Housing prices and property taxes so high, people struggling. Our subway system is a disaster: 70,000 delays every single month. And now de Blasio has been caught knee deep in a corruption scandal. Four more years of Bill de Blasio? No way.”

ON SCREEN The first image is of a glittering Manhattan at night, superimposed with a scowling image of the mayor’s face, as the script is read in a growl-like imitation of Don LaFontaine. A series of apparently homeless men and women appear next, including a young woman with a sign reading “Homeless Hungry Pregnant,” while archival footage of men in Depression-era clothing appears superimposed.

Next, the camera flies over a community of single-family homes before focusing in on couples of different races who appear to be worrying over bills. After that, we see a couple of rats on the subway tracks and a woman who looks like a frustrated commuter. It ends with an image of City Hall followed by one of Downtown Manhattan, clouds gathering above and the same scowling mayor superimposed on top.

ACCURACY The ad argues, in broad strokes, that quality of life has worsened in several ways, first by correctly noting that homelessness has hit record levels during Mr. de Blasio’s tenure.

Video

“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.

Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.

While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).

In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.

You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)

The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.

That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail.

A coastal alliance, Mr. Inslee added, especially when cities such as Seattle and Portland, Ore., and throughout California are booming economically, would help make the case to a national audience that addressing climate change through energy policy is good for business and job creation.

“The more we can have uniformity in a carbon pricing system or regulatory system, the better,” he said.

Both parties see Democrats as favored to win the district, which voted heavily for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Republicans held the area’s State Senate seat largely because of the personal popularity of an incumbent lawmaker, Andy Hill, who died of lung cancer last fall.

Despite their dominance at the federal level and in most state capitals, West Coast Republicans have been driven to the point of extinction as the party’s standing has plummeted in prosperous cities and suburbs, from San Diego to Seattle. Their candidate in the State Senate race, Jinyoung Lee Englund, a polished former political operative, has strained to set herself apart from the national party, declaring that she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 and pleading with voters to embrace divided government in Olympia.

Ms. Englund, 33, has campaigned explicitly against the “blue wall” scenario, warning that voters should not let Washington “go the way of California” and other one-party states. She expressed deep skepticism of Mr. Inslee’s climate proposals and suggested Democrats were mainly focused on trying to raise general revenue by another name. Republican groups have aired commercials saying that “Seattle liberals” could wreak havoc on the state’s finances if Democrats are allowed to govern unchecked.

“You don’t want to go the way of Oregon,” Ms. Englund said in an interview. “Washingtonians are more independent.”

Ms. Englund rebuked Democrats for what she characterized as using the state government as a partisan bludgeon. “I think that’s wrong,” she said. “The role of a state senator is not to go and lambaste what’s happening nationally.”

But the 45th District, a diverse suburban patchwork that stretches across the high-tech haven of Redmond and into more rural territory beyond — north and east of Bellevue — is emblematic of the territory that has lurched away from the Republican Party over the last year, recoiling from Mr. Trump’s brand of hard nationalism. Manka Dhingra, the Democratic candidate, has led in the polls by a comfortable but not overwhelming margin.

Ms. Dhingra, 43, a gregarious career prosecutor, has pledged support for an array of Democratic wish-list policies — though in a nod to the district’s moderate history, her campaign literature promises “independent leadership.” She has endorsed a carbon tax and applauded the state’s insistent litigation against the White House. Ms. Dhingra said in an interview that state government should take comprehensive action to check “what’s coming out of Washington, D.C.”

“Frankly, I think all states are going to have to do that,” Ms. Dhingra said. “We have to make sure immigrants feel safe. We have to make sure women’s health care is protected.”

Republican leaders in the state concede the national backdrop has made a tough race even harder. Rob McKenna, a former state attorney general who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Inslee in 2012, said an upset is possible but called the “Trump factor” a drag on Ms. Englund.

Mr. McKenna cautioned that even a Democratic victory should not be overinterpreted as a political turning point. A setback for Republicans, he said, would not change the fundamental character of the state, which he described as more politically competitive and fiscally conservative than its coastal neighbors.

“This is a state that is still, more or less, 50-50,” Mr. McKenna said, predicting of Democrats: “They’ll have difficulties, because they’ll be reluctant to risk their majorities in the House and the Senate.”

Other local leaders are less sure, holding up the Seattle area as an illustrative example of an upwardly mobile metropolitan area shifting to the left. If Republicans have staked their message, in large part, on suburban distrust of the big city, the region is increasingly knitted together by a thriving tech economy at companies like Amazon and Microsoft, and an expanding rapid transit rail network that is tying people closer to Seattle.

Dow Constantine, the King County executive and a Democrat, said that the once very real political divisions of the region — Democratic-leaning Seattle on the West Side of Lake Washington, Republican-leaning enclaves to the east — have been shattered by demographic change, too, especially as the immigrants who came to work in tech jobs encouraged others in the countries they left to follow them.

“The comical attempts to demonize Seattle in the 45th District race, I think, will be shown to have been a poor strategy,” Mr. Constantine said.

The area’s shifting identity has been on vivid display in this election: As Ms. Dhingra went door to door on Wednesday in Duvall, a growing outer suburb built across rolling farmlands, some voters sounded eager to repudiate Republicans. Patty Andrus, a retired special education teacher, described Ms. Dhingra’s campaign as a corrective to Mr. Trump’s election.

With a Democratic takeover in Washington State, she said, “I would stand up taller.”

Even some Republican-leaning voters who back Ms. Englund say they are uneasy about Mr. Trump. “She seems sensible and levelheaded,” Ed Whitehead, the retired owner of a printing company, said of Ms. Englund after she stopped at his door in Sammamish.

Mr. Whitehead, who said he voted for Mr. Trump, said these days he is “not so sure” about the president.

Still, amid their exuberance, Democrats concede it could take time to assemble substantial policy achievements. Should they win, Democrats would be governing with the slimmest possible majority and with just one short legislative session before the next election in 2018. And like Democrats in other parts of the nation, they are divided. In 2013, two Democratic state senators crossed the aisle to caucus with the Republicans, creating a coalition majority, and wounds still linger from the 2016 presidential election, when Senator Bernie Sanders won in the Democratic caucuses but then lost to Hillary Clinton in the primary election.

Ms. Dhingra suggested that the session might become mainly a chance for Democrats to prove themselves responsible, rather than as a lunge toward California-like status. The Democratic caucus, she noted, is not homogeneous: “You have rural-area Democrats who have different priorities.”

Mr. Inslee, too, said Democrats should temper their expectations, even as he made plain his excitement about governing with a freer hand.

“There’s diversity of views in all caucuses, and so nothing’s guaranteed in life,” Mr. Inslee said. “But what this does is, it takes the shackles off the doors.”","Poised for West Coast Dominance, Democrats Eye Grand Agenda",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/us/washington-state-west-politics-democrats.html

Tensions over the migrants have grown since the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea agreed in April to close the site by Oct. 31.

On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.

Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled.

“It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.”

By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.

One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.

“Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.”

By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.

Who is responsible?

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.

Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.

Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.

“I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.

In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.”

What will happen to the detainees?

Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.

They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.

American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia.

If those options do not work out, there is another possibility: Russell Crowe, the Australian actor, offered on Twitter Wednesday to provide housing and jobs for six of the men.
