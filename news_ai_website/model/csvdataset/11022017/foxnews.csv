Depending on the exact location you visit, you might be able to sample the “S’more” sandwich, which is a grilled doughnut with graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow mascarpone. Or why not try the “Strawberry Lemonade,” with fresh strawberries, lemon mascarpone, and mozzarella sandwiched between a grilled doughnut?

The country's state media also said that the ""gangster-like U.S. imperialists"" are seeking to ignite a nuclear war.

B-1B bombers based in Guam were escorted by two South Korean F-16 fighter jets during the drills Thursday at a field near the South's eastern coast. The drills simulated attacks on land targets, but didn't involve live weapons, a South Korean military official said.

North Korea's response to the exercises comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently warned that the threat of nuclear missile attack by North Korea is accelerating.



""North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbors and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" he said in October, adding that U.S.-South Korean military and diplomatic collaboration thus has taken on ""a new urgency.""

""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" Mattis said.

Mattis made his remarks in Seoul alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo. He pledged that the U.S. would repel any strike, adding that North Korea is overmatched by the firepower and cohesiveness of the decades-old U.S.-South Korean alliance.

However, he also said that diplomacy is still the preferred way to deal with the North.

Prior to Mattis' comments, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said North Korea’s threat of nuclear war is now at an “unprecedented” level.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words that has only escalated over the past few months. Trump has nicknamed Kim “Rocket Man;” the North Korean leader has called Trump “deranged.”

The U.S. and its allies are on alert since North Korea tested intercontinental missiles in the Pacific near Japan and Guam, a highly strategic U.S. territory. Pyongyang conducted its longest-ever ballistic missile test flight last month.

And North Korea has previously warned other countries that participating in military actions with the U.S. could result in retaliation, especially as a “nuclear war may break any moment.”

“Unless the hostile policy and the nuclear threat of the U.S. is thoroughly eradicated, we will never put our nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets on the negotiation table under any circumstance,” North Korea ambassador Kim In Ryong reportedly told a United Nations disarmament committee.

Since Kim took over North Korea in 2011, it has rapidly expanded and tested its missile arsenal with weapons capable of striking the U.S. mainland. His end goal, he has reportedly said, is to ""establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options” for the North.

Read on for a brief look at how North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has grown throughout the regimes in the past century.

Kim Il Sung, leader from 1948-1994

Kim Il Sung can be credited with founding North Korea and propelling the nation’s nuclear program forward — but he did not live to see his country conduct its first nuclear test.

It was under the first Kim that North Korea began to build up its nuclear reactors. And it was under his leadership that the nation began the Korean War — surely a catalyst that led the leader to believe his nation needed nuclear weapons, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Fox News in an interview.

TRUMP’S COMMENTS ON NORTH KOREA, FROM ‘FIRE AND FURY’ TO BLAMING CHINA

“The seeds of nuclear aspirations were sown in the Korean War,” Lee said.

The Korean War pitted North Korea and its ally China — two nations that did not have nuclear capabilities at the time — against a nuclear-armed U.S., making it “clear to the first Kim that nuclear weapons are very powerful, a powerful deterrent,” Lee said.

Kim Jong Il, leader from 1994-2011

When the second leader of the Kim dynasty died in 2011, Kim Jong Il was remembered as the “dictator who turned North Korea into a nuclear state,” in his New York Times obituary.

And it’s Kim Jong Il that really “gets the credit of taking the country down the nuclear path,"" Lee said.

In the beginning of his reign — he was North Korea’s supreme leader from 1994 to 2011 — North Korea denied that it had a nuclear weapons program.

JAPAN WARNS NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR THREAT AT ‘UNPRECEDENTED, CRITICAL’ LEVEL

However, in 2003, Pyongyang announced that North Korea was withdrawing from the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which barred the nation from making nuclear weapons.

By 2005, North Korea confirmed that it had its own nuclear weapons. It tested its first nuclear device in 2006.

Kim Jong Un, leader from 2011-present

Kim Jong Un is credited with accelerating North Korea’s push for nuclear weapons, and under the Obama administration, many of the world’s attitudes toward the East Asian nation’s nuclear capabilities became less blasé than in the past, Lee said.

And Kim Jong Un recently crossed a major threshold for his country this summer — the ability to credibly threaten the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.

NORTH KOREA CELEBRATES NUCLEAR TESTS

North Korea last month successfully tested its longest-ever flight of a ballistic missile. The intermediate-range weapon traveled 3,700 miles and passed over Japan before it landed in the Pacific. Earlier this month, the country also tested its most powerful nuclear test to date.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned the test and said it caused “millions of Japanese” to “duck and cover.” Mattis also said the U.S. and Japan are ready for potential future missile threats.

After the missile test, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is nearing “equilibrium” with the U.S. in terms of its military force.

The increasingly frequent and aggressive tests have added to outside fears that North Korea is closer than ever to building a military arsenal that could viably target the mainland of the U.S. or its allies in Asia.

Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” in his speech to the U.N. last month and said the dictator is on a “suicide mission for himself and for his regime.”

“The United States has great strength and patience,” Trump said. “But if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”

And keep in mind that every year the GOP holds Congress and White House there will be another tax cut.","House Republicans have unveiled tax reform and reduction legislation that is also an amazingly powerful job creation bill.

After eight years of the slowest “recovery” in modern American history, we are now poised to create millions of jobs and move from our Obama-era 2 percent economic growth rate to our historic average of 3 percent growth and beyond. President Reagan’s growth rates were over 4 percent. We will match and likely surpass that.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who is chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, focused on designing tax reform that put economic growth first and foremost.

Every decision was focused on “what creates the most jobs and income increases for Americans” and “how do we make this permanent,” so we do not have a repeat of the 2012 disappearing tax cuts, when the Bush-era tax cuts expired.

What would the GOP plan do if it becomes law?

It would double the standard deduction from $12,000 for a married couple to $24,000. This makes the claim by Democrats that this legislation raises taxes on middle-income Americans look foolish. Heck, even the Washington Post “fact checker” called out the Democrats for faking the numbers to suggest this is not a tax cut for the vast majority of Americans, in a story headlined: “Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families.”

The tax bill would also cut rates for all Americans. The new rates would be 0 percent, 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Yes, the top rate would still be the same as what we have now (all the others would be reduced), but it wouldn’t kick in until an income of $1 million for a couple.

The death tax would be abolished. First, it would be reduced by doubling the exempt amount of your life savings not taxed for the next six years. Then the death tax would die in 2024. If even a small piece of the death tax survived the knife, it would live to grow back to hit millions of Americans.

The alternative minimum tax would be abolished. That was imposed in 1969 to hit 115 people and now hits several million.

Business taxes that are now at 35 percent for American companies – one of the highest rates in the world – would fall to 20 percent immediately. China is at 25 percent. Canada is at 15 percent. Britain at 18 percent. We are not now competitive in the world economy due to our high business tax. This bill would change that.

Manufacturing would rebound because the tax bill would allow businesses to expense all new business investment in the first year, rather than over a decade or more. That drops the cost of new investment in job-creating, income-enhancing technology.

Lower taxes. Simpler. Pro-growth. Pro-jobs.

The next step is to move the legislation through the House Ways and Means Committee, which should happen quickly because the members were part of writing the bill, and then through the full House.

The Senate, which would need to join the House in passing the legislation for it to go to President Trump to be signed into law, has been involved in designing this bill from the start. As has the White House. That is why the House-Senate conference should be easier and shorter than usual and President Trump’s signature should be assured.

The president called the tax legislation “a great bill” when it was unveiled Thursday and said his administration is “working to give the American people a giant tax cut for Christmas.”

Yes, this is a tax cut bill. It is most importantly a job-creation, income-increasing bill.

It is also a powerful political move that will guarantee the GOP holds the House of Representatives and wins four or five additional Senate seats.

And keep in mind that every year the GOP holds Congress and White House there will be another tax cut. Four tax cuts in the next four years. So this bill is just a start.

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

They weren’t and I got very, very sick… My implants ruptured and disintegrated in my chest.
By 1994, McDonough decided to remove the implants that she felt were contributing to her physical decline.
“I got so sick over the course of time, not knowing what was wrong with me,” recalled McDonough.
And I was in so much pain… I decided I would have my implants removed.”At age 35, McDonough was diagnosed with lupus, an inflammatory disease.","Mary McDonough receives emails almost every day from people, and it’s not just because she once starred as the pretty, wholesome Erin Walton in one of TV’s most beloved families — these strangers are asking for help.

The reason? They want her advice on plastic surgery.

The former child star, who wanted to give her career a boost after appearing on “The Waltons” from 1971 until 1981, went under the knife at age 24. It was a decision she would later regret.

The 56-year-old star previously chronicled her personal journey in the 2012 memoir “Lessons from the Mountain.”

“I had breast implants trying to fit in and be part of the ‘Dallas’ era,” McDonough told Fox News. “I made that choice because I was told they were safe and would last a lifetime. They weren’t and I got very, very sick… My implants ruptured and disintegrated in my chest. I was sick for 10 years and no one knew what was wrong with me.”

After the surgery, McDonough’s health began to deteriorate. Not only was she faced with chronic muscle pain, but her famous red mane was falling out. McDonough felt like she was constantly succumbing to the flu and was unable to hold her only daughter Sydnee.

By 1994, McDonough decided to remove the implants that she felt were contributing to her physical decline.

“I got so sick over the course of time, not knowing what was wrong with me,” recalled McDonough. “It was a very difficult decision for me to have [breast implants] in the first place because I felt like I needed to do it for my career. And so, I didn’t want to have another surgery to have them removed… But I was so sick, I could not risk my baby daughter. I could not feed her. And I was in so much pain… I decided I would have my implants removed.”

At age 35, McDonough was diagnosed with lupus, an inflammatory disease. She believes the implants were to blame for her unbearable health woes over the years.

“Once I had my implants removed, I started to get better,” said McDonough. “My lupus is in remission. I still deal with fibromyalgia and arthritis… But, I’m... healthier. I’m way healthier than I was in my 30s… The further I get from those implants, the better I get.”

McDonough has since found a new purpose as an activist for women’s body image issues. Her goal isn’t to discourage others from getting plastic surgery but to empower them with knowledge about the potential risks and how to cope.

“I’ve never been anti-implants,” said McDonough. “What I’ve lobbied for is to have it be safe… I also want to educate people on the dangers and what women should look out for… Some things have changed. You are supposed to have them replaced every six to seven years. But how many people can afford to do that?

""And some people lose their health insurance because they have breast implants. So there’s a lot of issues and I always work to get the information out to people. To try to get people to make an educated choice. If they want to do it, know what you’re getting into.”

Many fans can identify with McDonough, who once faced pressure in Hollywood to look a certain way while growing up in front of cameras.

“There was pressure from the wardrobe department [on ‘The Waltons’] about [whether] I can fit into my clothes from last year or had I gained more weight,” she claimed. “And I was just a kid! I was a growing girl and you had these old clothes that we wore for years. We never had a fancy wardrobe, and so when you’re becoming a teenager, your body has to change.”

McDonough, who was growing up in front of America, struggled to accept the discouraging words.

“I didn’t deal with it well at all,” she admitted. “I took it personally and I had always strived to be so perfect. I was always trying to be the perfect girl. The perfect weight. I was literally trying to fit into all of it.

""And I took it personally and it hurt my feelings and I reacted by doing starvation diets… And not being very good to myself. And my focus became about the external parts of me instead of the inside of who I was and what I had to offer, which is what I had to learn later in life.”

McDonough never shared her personal struggles with her cast-mates.

“It’s funny, Richard Thomas told me after he read my book, ‘I had no idea you were going through this. Why didn’t you say something?’” she said. “But I think I was so set on trying to be the perfect girl that to me, it was just a part of what I was supposed to do. And look, it wasn’t like I was the only one in the show. There was a focus on what the others should look like as well. I just took it more personally and internalized it.”

But these days, McDonough, who currently resides in Colorado, is feeling good about herself.

And she still stays in touch with her TV family.

“We’re all very loyal and true to each other,” she explained. “I see other shows where a cast member dies and the other cast mates completely throw them under the bus. We would never do that. We love each other too much… We’ve lost cast members and we miss them. We would never dishonor their memory.”",'Waltons' actress Mary McDonough struggled after getting breast implants,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/01/waltons-actress-mary-mcdonough-struggled-after-getting-breast-implants.html

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Turn the lights down. If you’ve got absolutely no time to get ready for guests, you can try this last-ditch technique: Turn the lights down low, or close the blinds.

The Democratic group Latino Victory Fund removed the controversial ad, which showed a pickup truck driver chasing down children of color on Tuesday, Oct. 31.

“We knew our ad would ruffle feathers. We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don’t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time,” said Cristobal J. Alex, president of the LVF, in a statement on Twitter Tuesday evening.

“Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.”

The statement was released just hours after investigators said the suspected driver, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, plowed a rented pickup truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan. The incident, being treated as a terror attack, left at least eight dead and at least 11 others injured.

The ad was released on Monday and was expected to run through Election Day.

Gillespie denounced the ad Tuesday morning in an interview with “Fox & Friends.”

“This attack is not just an attack on my supporters, it’s an attack on all Virginians. The fact is, whether you disagree with people or not, in Virginia, we respect civil discourse and this is a new low in politics here. It’s a sad day,” Gillespie said.

In another encounter, Rubin is accused of beating a woman’s “breasts so badly that her right implant flipped,” the lawsuit stated. The suit alleges the woman was paid $20,000 by Rubin to repair the damage.

The New York Post report also said Rubin had the women sign non-disclosure agreements. Rubin collaborated with two female fixers and a lawyer who sought to “cover up” his “sexual misconduct and criminal abuse of women and to serve as a cover for his wide-ranging human trafficking scheme,” Balestriere added.

According to MSHopeForACure, Rubin received an MBA in 1982 from Harvard. His profile – which was removed from the website Friday morning – also said Rubin enjoys Texas Hold ‘em Poker, swimming, yoga and Soul Cycle.

Trump tweeted from Air Force One, as he headed off on a 13-day tour of Asian nations.
“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump tweeted early Friday.
""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right,"" Trump tweeted.
Trump tweeted.","President Trump opened up on Democrats with both Twitter barrels from high in the sky Friday, exploiting fractures in the rival party after top operative Donna Brazile revealed insiders plotted to steal last year's presidential primary from Bernie Sanders.

""Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!"" Trump tweeted from Air Force One, as he headed off on a 13-day tour of Asian nations.

It was part of a mid-morning Twitter barrage in which Trump called for his own Justice Department to probe a range of scandals involving the Democratic Party and his vanquished 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.

“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump tweeted early Friday. “New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus…”

In excerpts released Thursday from an upcoming book, Brazile, a longtime party stalwart and Clinton confidante, confirmed longstanding suspicions that the Democratic National Committee she once headed worked with Clinton to ensure she won the party's presidential primary over Sanders, the Vermont senator who built a huge following with his blend of Democrat politics and socialism.

""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right,"" Trump tweeted.

Brazile's explosive charge has sent shockwaves through the party.

“I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton’s team had rigged the nomination process, as a cache of emails stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested,” Brazile wrote in a book excerpt first published in Politico Magazine. “By Sept. 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.”

The proof, according to Brazile, was a joint fundraising agreement document between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary for America. It had been signed in August 2015, four months after Clinton announced her candidacy and a year before she officially secured the nomination over Sanders.

“The agreement –signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC and Robby Mook, with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile wrote. “Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decision on all the other staff.”

DONNA BRAZILE: I FOUND 'PROOF' THE DNC RIGGED THE NOMINATION FOR HILLARY CLINTON

Even before Friday morning's tweetstorm, Trump reacted to the allegations against Clinton on Thursday night on “The Ingraham Angle.”

“It’s illegal, number one, and it’s really unfair to Bernie Sanders,” Trump said. “I’m not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out. Many of those people voted for me because of trade because I agreed with him on trade…But that was, I thought that was terrible.”

""Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.,"" Trump tweeted again. 'Pocahontas,' when used by the president, is typically in reference to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

In an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN Thursday, Warren, D-Mass., was asked whether she believed the DNC was rigged, to which the senator simply responded, ""Yes.""

But on Friday, Trump took the opportunity to add the Brazile bombshell to a list of allegations and situations that he wants his Justice Department to investigate, including her “deleted E-mails” and “the Server,” pointing back to the months-long Clinton email investigation.

Trump also referred to “Uranium,” alluding to the controversial Obama-era Uranium One deal. The 2010 deal concerns the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S. Clinton, at the time, was secretary of state.

TRUMP CALLS DNC PRIMARY-RIGGING 'ILLEGAL,' SLAMS 'FAKE' DOSSIER IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

Trump also referred to “Podesta,” though it is unclear if he was referring to Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, or his brother, Clinton’s longtime confidante and 2016 campaign manager John Podesta.

This week, Tony Podesta stepped down from his lobbying firm, which was co-founded with his brother John, in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe expanding to question Podesta’s Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) filings, and whether he was in violation of that law.

A spokesperson for Podesta told Fox News that they were compliant with their FARA filings and were “fully” cooperating with Mueller’s team.

The president tweeted again, moments later, underscoring the need for a federal probe.

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

Court papers filed Friday say about $1.65 million would go upfront to the widow and daughter of Jason Simcakoski, of Stevens Point, Wis., who was 35 when he died in 2014 at the Tomah VA facility. Another $659,000 would go into annuities for Simcakoski's widow, Heather, and their daughter, Anaya. The rest would go to attorney fees and expenses.



The Wisconsin State Journal reported Saturday that a federal judge will hold a hearing Wednesday on whether to approve the settlement.



Simcakoski's death led to the firing of the Tomah VA's chief of staff, Dr. David Houlihan, who agreed this past January to surrender his medical license permanently. The former head of the center, Mario DeSanctis, was fired in 2015 but fought his dismissal and eventually was allowed to resign, USA Today reported earlier this month. He and his lawyer were paid $163,000, it said.



An inspector general's report in 2015 found that Tomah VA doctors commonly overprescribed opioid painkillers, earning the facility the nickname ""Candy Land.""



Simcakoski, who was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2002, had been treated from 2006 to 2014 for a variety of conditions. He was admitted to the Tomah VA's acute psychiatric unit on Aug. 10, 2014, then transferred to a short stay unit.



On the morning of Aug. 30, 2014, he was so sedated he could barely speak, his family alleged in the lawsuit. He was found unresponsive that afternoon. He died after life-saving attempts were made, although they weren't started for about 10 minutes after he was found.



An autopsy determined that Simcakoski died from mixed drug toxicity. The inspector general found that doctors who prescribed his medications failed to talk with him about the risks, and noted delays in the start of CPR and the lack of medication at the Tomah VA to reverse drug overdoses.

But is it actually Facebook that’s making us unhappy?
Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.
The “social media is making your miserable” experiments can’t quantify how much other things might make you miserable as well.
Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.","Is social media making us miserable? Study after study seems to confirm the increasingly common grumbling you hear — that the more time we spend on the platforms, the worse we feel about our lives.

The latest, by Holly Shakya from the University of California and Nicholas Christakis from Yale University, actually quantifies our misery. They found that there was as much as an 8 percent drop in personal happiness after using Facebook.

But is it actually Facebook that’s making us unhappy? There are a couple major flaws in this argument.

The first, and perhaps more obvious one, is that Facebook and other social-media platforms like Twitter or Instagram are reflections of our input. They don’t generate content to show us without our participation. We choose what we see.

Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.

On Facebook, we generally friend people we know “in real life.” Those people then show us what they had for dinner, post pictures of their kids and pets, share their political opinions and their selfies from vacation.

If that makes you feel unhappy, Facebook gives you a range of options. If seeing magical sunsets from your friend’s trip to Barbados induces rage, it lets you click “Hide Post-See fewer posts like this.”

If your friend has become a political automaton in the wake of an election but you hope they’ll eventually mellow, you can choose the “Pause friend for 30 days” option.

If you’re struggling to get pregnant, or recently got divorced, and your friend’s pictures of snuggling with her husband or kids upsets you, you can pick “Unfollow friend.” That’s the “mute” option on Facebook.

Your friend won’t know they’ve been silenced and you won’t be unfriending them. You can always unmute if circumstances change.

In fact, Facebook is the social network that most lets you tailor your experience to get what you want out of it. Of course your friends will annoy you on Facebook, as they might in real life, but only on Facebook do you have the ability to shush them for a little while or forever.

But that gets at what Facebook can’t do: Screen your daily real-life interactions.

In short, it’s not Facebook, it’s you. The “social media is making your miserable” experiments can’t quantify how much other things might make you miserable as well.

They’re not with you on the subway when you read an op-ed that makes you fume. They don’t see your eye-roll when you catch up with a friend over coffee and you end up listening to a half-hour infomercial on all the great things happening in your friend’s life.

Social media, and Facebook in particular, don’t invent things for you to get mad about, they only amplify what is already pissing you off.

And that leads us to the other flaw in these Facebook-makes-you-unhappy studies: People are already angrier than they used to be, creating a chicken-and-egg conundrum. If you poll angry people, it’s likely the interactions that boil their broth will have a lot of overlap with their daily routine.

That daily routine, by the way, includes lots of things that constitute an improvement over the daily lives of previous generations. Even though life expectancy has increased and quality of life continues to improve across the world, we’re angrier and sadder than ever before.

A 2015 study by Ryne Sherman, Sonja Lyubomirsky and Jean M. Twenge in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that while contentment used to come with age, our older people are no longer happy.

We can’t blame that on Facebook.

In a piece for Quartz last April, economist Allison Schrager posited that our expectations are too high.

Schrager writes, “Research by British neuroscientists argues that happiness requires more than things simply going well; people also must get more than they expect. So even if we have more than ever before—good health, leisure time, consumer goods—we have even grander expectations.”

That’s where the change needs to start. If social media is making you feel like you should be in a bikini on a yacht instead of under the fluorescent lights at work, hunched over your computer, it might not be the worst idea to give it a break. Filter your expectations and you might find you need to filter your interactions a lot less.

The letter to Meredith Kercher was published in WestsideSeattle.com on the tenth anniversary of her friend’s brutal death. It recounted the experiences she had with Kercher while the two were living together in Perugia, Italy.

“When I look back on my memories of Meredith, what I find are beautiful, banal moments we shared in the weeks we lived side-by-side,” Knox wrote.

Knox recounted the times she and Kercher would carry groceries back to their apartment, drink espressos and watch television.

“And I remember the last time I saw her, ten years ago today, slinging her purse over her shoulder and waving goodbye to me on her way out to meet up with her British friends,” Knox wrote.

Knox’s letter then took a dark turn when she mentioned her friend’s brutal murder.

ITALY’S HIGHEST COURT ACQUITS AMANDA KNOX OF KILLING ROOMMATE

“My memories of Meredith are buried beneath the horrific autopsy photos and crime scene footage I saw, the slurs I was called, the death threats I received (and still receive), the false accusations I fought, the years of wrongful imprisonment I endured, the multiple trials and slanderous headlines that juxtaposed our names and faces, unfairly interlocking her death with my identity,” Knox wrote.

On Nov. 2, 2007 Kercher, 21, was found murdered in the apartment she shared with Knox and two other students. Her throat was slashed and she had been sexually assaulted.

Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were arrested a few days later along with Rude Guede, an Ivory Coast native raised in Perugia. Guede was convicted of murder in a separate trial and is serving a 16-year sentence.

Knox, dubbed Foxy Knoxy by the international media, and Sollecito were convicted, acquitted, and convicted in three different highly publicized trials. Knox was found guilty in 2009 but acquitted and freed in 2011 after spending nearly four years in prison.

Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle following the acquittal but was then tried and convicted in absentia and ordered a new appeals trial in 2014. In 2015, Italy’s highest court acquitted Knox of murder, ending the drawn-out legal saga.

AMANDA KNOX’S EX-BOYFRIEND SUING JUDGES AND JURY OVER WRONGFUL CONVICTION

Knox noted in her tribute that some people believe she “has no right to mourn Meredith.”

“They believe that I had something to do with her murder – I didn't – or that Meredith has been forgotten in the wake of my own struggle for justice – she hasn't,” Knox said.

Knox concluded that Kercher’s murder changed her life because “innocent people suffer.”

“We are all driven to do something about it—to speak out against unrepentant killers or incompetent and cruel prosecutors—even though no one can ever give Meredith back her life, or me the years of life I lost to wrongful imprisonment,” Knox wrote.

“I hate it that my memories of her are buried beneath the years of suffering Raffaele and I endured in the wake of her murder. And it’s depressing to know that mourning her comes at the price of being criticized for anything I say or don’t say today. But most depressing of all is that Meredith isn’t here, when she deserves to be. She is painfully missed by everyone who loved her. I miss her, and I’m grateful for the memories of our time together,” Knox concluded.

After all, there is a legitimate role within our government for the empowerment of local, faith-based solutions.
There is no doubt that President Trump feels strongly about ending the opioid epidemic.
We know that President Trump is – rightly – critical of the swamp, and that he doesn’t shy away from upsetting his opponents on the left.
When it comes to the opioid crisis, he should partner with those on higher, drier land: states, communities, and those helping their brothers and sisters rise above despair through faith.","The opioid crisis is characterized by despair – for those caught in the grip of addiction, for their loved ones, and for those who want to solve what President Trump has now officially deemed a public health emergency.

For many Americans, an effective antidote to despair is faith and community. It’s a shame that President Trump’s announcement last week on the opioid crisis did not include this essential component.

After all, there is a legitimate role within our government for the empowerment of local, faith-based solutions. As the leader of a culturally divided and spiritually struggling nation, the president should acknowledge and leverage the power and importance of community and faith-based solutions for addicts and others in despair.

After President Trump’s passionate and personal speech last week, Fox News Host Dana Perino remembered the way her former boss, President George W. Bush, described his own commitment to local, faith-based solutions. “He used to say that government cannot heal a heart,” Perino recalled.

Indeed, the White House Faith-Based & Community Initiative, established by President Bush in 2001, successfully channeled federal funds to the organizations that were most effective in the nation’s social service network.

President Bush knew that faith-based groups and institutions are frequently best positioned to help Americans in need. His administration enabled those groups to compete for federal dollars on an even playing field. This change in the way the federal government addressed social challenges enabled more hearts to be healed.

There is no doubt that President Trump feels strongly about ending the opioid epidemic. His compassion for those affected is apparent, and his own experience as the brother of an alcoholic brings a deeply personal element to his dedication.

The president would do well to bring that personal element more deeply into his list of opioid crisis solutions by involving those who can impact the lives of individuals when it comes to addiction.

Federal initiatives for the development of non-addictive pain medication or the regulation of certain types of pharmaceuticals are interesting tactics, but none get to the heart of the matter in the way that only community and faith-based programs – and, frankly, a higher power – are able to do.

Put another way: Is Washington going to heal the hearts of the opioid crisis? Can the swamp adequately address an epidemic wrapped in despair?

These questions remain to be answered, but I do know this: The federal government often does its best work when it returns power and resources where they belong – to states, localities, communities and neighborhoods.

In a perfect world, the money would never go to Washington in the first place, but its return to a place closer to the people can be appreciated by anyone – including the president – who believes the federal government has grown too large, too powerful, too arrogant and too distant from the people it is supposed to serve.

President Bush’s faith-based emphasis made many non-believers uncomfortable. He endured cries about the separation of church and state in order to leverage the unique ability of local and faith-based programs to help those in need. I believe he did the right thing and that his initiatives were an admirable acknowledgement that Washington can’t solve every problem.

We know that President Trump is – rightly – critical of the swamp, and that he doesn’t shy away from upsetting his opponents on the left. When it comes to the opioid crisis, he should partner with those on higher, drier land: states, communities, and those helping their brothers and sisters rise above despair through faith.",Trump should partner with the faith community to tackle the opioid crisis,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/03/trump-should-partner-with-faith-community-to-tackle-opioid-crisis.html

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly.

KayLee and Kenlie Henderson were shot dead in their sleep in rural Payne Springs, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, Fox 4 Dallas reported Thursday. KayLee was 7; Kenlie, 5. Their mother, Sarah Henderson, 29, was charged with capital murder.

Around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jake Henderson reported that he was worried his wife was suicidal and requested the assistance of emergency medical services. He then called back to say everything was fine. A deputy went to the home to make sure and did not find any cause for alarm, the station reported.

“Her husband had told EMS that she felt like people were out to get her and that’s pretty much all the information that we’ve got at this time,” Henderson County Sheriff Botie Hillhouse told the station. “Deputies spoke to them. Everything appeared to be fine. There [were] no signs of violence. Everybody said they were okay. Nobody was suicidal.”

Three hours later around 2:30 a.m. Thursday the husband reported that he woke up and realized his wife had shot the children.

Hillhouse told the station Friday that Sarah Henderson also tried to shoot her husband.

“The pistol misfired and that’s when he was able to take the pistol away from her and call law enforcement,” the sheriff said.

He said Sarah Henderson had been planning the shooting for at least two weeks and that the motive was still under investigation.

The sheriff told WFAA-TV that Sarah Henderson said little after the shooting.

“The only thing she told us was that she had smoked some marijuana early in the evening,” Hillhouse said. “She was very blunt. We just don’t have any answers as to why.”

A family member told the station Sarah Henderson had been acting erratically in the last couple of weeks.

Texas child welfare workers interviewed her in 2010 which would have been the year KayLee was born, the station reported.

Neighbors heard Sarah Henderson yelling at her kids all the time, Fox 4 reported.

“We could hear her yelling and cussing at the girls,” Jaylne Palmer told the station. “Terrible language. ‘Get you’re blah blah blah in here.’”

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor.

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

“We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans,"" the statement read. ""We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.”

Which is why the sooner the Mueller investigation comes to an end the better.","Monday was not a good day for President Trump, but it was an even worse day for Hillary Clinton.

Indictments handed down by Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and close associate Rick Gates with a slew of white collar crimes, including failure to register as a foreign agent, tax evasion and money laundering, an embarrassment to the president. But, some have described the indictments as weak, since they focus on Manafort making false FARA filings, or not registering as a foreign agent, a charge brought by the government only six times since 1966, and which resulted in only one conviction. Enforcement of the FARA law is generally not rigorous.

More important, there was no mention of Russia, or of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Hillary needs Mueller to connect those dots.

In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.

Also released Monday was news that a Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos pled guilty Oct. 5 to lying to federal agents. Papadopoulos was brought aboard the campaign as an expert on Greece, but promoted various unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting between Donald Trump and Putin. None of his efforts bore fruit; emails suggest he was rebuffed by senior members of the campaign on several occasions.

Nonetheless, his plea is viewed as potentially damaging to the Trump camp, since language in the indictment suggests he may have acted as a cooperating witness; in other words, he may have been persuaded in recent months to wear a wire. As someone pretty far down the food chain, it is unclear what information he might provide.

None of this will satisfy Secretary Clinton’s desire to blame Vladimir Putin for her astonishing loss to an untutored and underfinanced Donald Trump.

She has written extensively about the suspicious regard that Trump voiced for the Kremlin leader during the election, and of the numerous points of contact between members of the Trump entourage and suspected Russian operatives.

In Hillary’s world, she campaigned admirably and had the better message; it was Moscow that did her in.

That narrative took a hit in recent days as proof emerged that the Clinton campaign itself had indirectly paid Russian sources millions of dollars for salacious and discredited material on Donald Trump. The Clintonistas and the DNC hired Fusion GPS to assemble the notorious Trump dossier, which was created by former British spy Christopher Steele with the apparent help of Kremlin-linked informants.

It also came to light recently that the Obama White House was aware of a wide-ranging FBI investigation into Russian efforts to secure uranium reserves in the U.S., involving bribery and racketeering that took place during the early years of the Obama administration.

During the same period, Russian interests mysteriously donated millions to a Canadian affiliate of the Clinton Foundation, which Hillary failed to report, and a Moscow bank with ties to Putin also paid Bill Clinton half a million dollars for a speech. In 2010 she, along with the heads of other agencies represented on the CFIUS panel, green-lighted the sale of Uranium One to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, against the recommendation of national security advisors.

Americans are left to wonder…was it Trump that colluded with Russia, or was it Hillary? Did Putin pick sides, or was he out mainly to destabilize our body politic? If it was the latter, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.

The investigation into Russian meddling has become a political football, with Democrats using allegations of collusion to discredit Trump’s extraordinary win. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Mark Warner – they are all-in on the Trump-Russia meme, and notably silent on the recent developments noted above.

Meanwhile, the tens of millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump are angry that his victory has been met with steadfast resistance and obstruction.

Democrats (and some Republicans) have thrown up endless roadblocks, among other things delaying the staffing of vital government posts and hindering efforts to fix our collapsing health care system.

Trump supporters question the integrity of the FBI, which apparently also paid Fusion GPS, the impartiality of the Mueller investigation and have long since tuned out the biased liberal media.

None of this is good for our country. Which is why the sooner the Mueller investigation comes to an end the better. Despite all the sturm und drang about Russian collusion and the dire warnings of Trump incompetence or worse, Americans are the most upbeat they have been in decades, the stock market is soaring and the economy is showing every sign of accelerating.

This good news appalls Democrats, who still lack a coherent message that can compete with a strengthening economy. A rising tide tends to lift all boats and drown out the left’s politics of envy; what else do they have?

Hillary, in particular, has only excuses. She will continue to hope for proof positive that Donald Trump’s victory was not a victory for putting America first, for strengthening our military, for reestablishing the rule of law and tightening our borders, for rolling back regulations of businesses and making our tax code simpler and fairer. She needs Robert Mueller to prove Trump’s win illegitimate, and the handiwork of Russia.

Hillary and her fellow Democrats want the suffocating cloud of suspicion to linger, and, given the enormous resources that Mueller has assembled, they will probably get their wish.",Liz Peek: Hillary Clinton desperately needs Mueller to prove Russian collusion,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/liz-peek-hillary-clinton-desperately-needs-mueller-to-prove-russian-collusion.html

Toward this end, many of the direct bank bailouts by the Federal Reserve went to foreign banks.
On the Federal Reserve, Powell has been a “good soldier.” He never voted against the wishes of either Bernanke or Yellen.
He vigorously opposed legislation proposed by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, and his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to audit the Federal Reserve.
He is widely perceived to represent the interests of Wall Street and of those with Democratic leanings in the Trump administration.","By nominating Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve, President Trump is elevating a nominal Republican but also an Obama administration appointee to the chairmanship of our nation’s central bank. Many consider the chairmanship to be the second-most powerful position in the U.S. government.

This is not the first time something similar has happened. In 2006 President George W. Bush appointed Ben Bernanke, also a nominal Republican at the time, who on leaving the Federal Reserve registered as a Democrat.

No wonder that Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and John Kerry of Massachusetts publicly rejoiced when Bernanke was appointed. They correctly surmised that he was closer to them philosophically than to President Bush.

Democrats should be equally pleased about the Powell nomination. This puts someone in charge of the Federal Reserve who is more aligned philosophically with Schumer than with President Trump.

Ironically, it was mistaken judgments by Bush appointee Bernanke that brought on the Crash of 2008, which then ruined the economic record of the Bush presidency. Bernanke helped blow up the housing bubble with loose monetary policy and as late as 2007 refused to acknowledge any threats from the mortgage sector.

The trigger for the Crash was the chairman’s stubborn refusal to reconsider the imposition of “mark to market” accounting on U.S. banks. This form of accounting reflects the current market value of assets and liabilities. Steve Forbes accurately identified “mark to market” regulations as “mark to make believe.” They were guaranteed to make the entire banking system insolvent.

When Bernanke finally relented and announced the termination of “mark to market” the stock market bottomed only a few days later and thereafter soared as more easy money was poured in. These policies, cheered on by the Democrats, represented true trickle-down economics. They helped those already rich, not the poor or the middle class.

During the Crash, Bernanke devised a novel monetary policy that was remarkably unsupported either by economic evidence or theory. Federal Reserve economists acknowledged that they could not model it. The stated purpose was to protect Main Street, although it was obvious that Wall Street and not Main Street was being bailed out. What was not so obvious was that the real intention was to rescue a tottering federal government debt system.

It is illegal for the federal government to sell its debt directly to the Federal Reserve. This prohibition has been circumvented by the device of first selling the debt to Wall Street, which then resells it to the Federal Reserve. The latter buys the debt with newly created money, so in effect the government has simply created new money and used it to finance itself.

The system is so complicated that few people, even in Congress, understand how it works. Bernanke feared that the federal government would have too few buyers for its debt if Wall Street firms went under, so he moved to save them and at the same time guarantee a steady supply of buyers of U.S. Treasury debt.

Some of Bernanke’s steps in 2009, in particular the buying of mortgages, violated the plain language of the Federal Reserve Act, but Congress obliged with legislative fixes after the fact. Bernanke was also trying to reassure foreign central banks, which were also buying U.S. bonds from Wall Street. Toward this end, many of the direct bank bailouts by the Federal Reserve went to foreign banks.

Current Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen was a close ally and acolyte of Bernanke. She continued and protected the system that he had built, in particular by refusing to sell government and government-guaranteed bonds purchased during the Crash, even after the economy was gaining ground. This was further evidence that the Federal Reserve’s actions had not been about the economy, but rather about shoring up the shaky government debt market.

Jerome Powell joined the Federal Reserve in 2012. Before that, he was a Wall Streeter even when based in Washington, and a prominent environmentalist. In his early career he was a protégé of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who served under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Brady persuaded the first President Bush to make a deal with Democrats to raise taxes, despite the president’s “read my lips” pledge not to do so. This bad advice is generally thought to have led to President Bush’s loss in his re-election bid.

On the Federal Reserve, Powell has been a “good soldier.” He never voted against the wishes of either Bernanke or Yellen. He vigorously opposed legislation proposed by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, and his son, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., to audit the Federal Reserve.

The Paul legislation would have penetrated some of the secrecy of the Federal Reserve, which finances itself “off-budget” with newly created money, notwithstanding the Constitution’s requirement that government spending be approved by Congress.

Powell can be relied on to oppose any reform of the Federal Reserve or any reconsideration of the Bernanke system, despite the dismal record of the U.S. economy since the Crash. Powell was reportedly favored by current Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who earlier worked for Goldman Sachs and liberal financier and donor George Soros.

Mnuchin made campaign contributions to President Obama, Hillary Clinton and even Kamala Harris, who is now a Democratic senator from California. He is widely perceived to represent the interests of Wall Street and of those with Democratic leanings in the Trump administration.",Federal Reserve nominee Jerome Powell is philosophically closer to Schumer than Trump.

Dr. Joel Myers, the founder and chairman of AccuWeather, said next week's forecast could spread lingering radiation and threaten nearby countries with contamination from the Hermit Kingdom’s Sept. 3 nuke test.

“As winds pick up out of the northwest over the next few days, it is possible that any radiation that leaks from the site [where the nuclear test took place] could be carried and dispersed across the Sea of Japan and even to the Japanese islands,” Myers said.

The AccuWeather chairman said he believed the rogue regime purposely tested nuclear weapons on days when the wind was moderate.

""One might speculate that North Korea conducted these nuclear tests purposefully on days with light wind conditions, so that any resulting radiation leakage would remain within its borders and would go undetected internationally,” Myers said.

""We know from other news reports that there has been an accident at the nuclear test site, and the situation that North Korea may have anticipated with radiation being contained within North Korea has changed,” Myers said.

Japanese TV reported the nuclear site, Punggye-ri, had destabilized following Pyongyang's most recent test, and the site’s tunnels reportedly collapsed on Oct. 10 killing hundreds of people.

North Korea denied the report.

Upon achieving the above goals, illegal immigrants on an approved list with no criminal history would be granted amnesty.","Proponents of amnesty for illegal immigrants point to President Reagan as an iconic conservative leader who supported a path to legal status for such individuals in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. If it was good enough for President Reagan, they say, it should be good enough for today’s Republican Party.

What these armchair historians often fail to say, however, is that President Reagan’s support for amnesty was part of a compromise that his congressional counterparts reneged on. In exchange for amnesty, Congress was supposed to fund and enforce the other half of the deal to make it unlawful to hire or recruit individuals illegally residing in the U.S. The compromise would have required employers to attest to their employees’ immigration status.

However, no successive Congress since the Reagan years – regardless of which party held the majority – has ever lived up its side of the bargain. Democrats fear uproar from immigrants’ rights groups and organized labor. Republicans fear angering employers who count on cheap immigrant labor to fill low-paying, low-skill jobs.

While Republican leaders today might emulate President Reagan’s willingness to compromise in the interest of halting the flow of illegal immigration, they would be wise to also learn from his experience. Were President Reagan around to advise Republicans today, he might remind them of the old adage: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”

While it’s possible that President Reagan might still support a compromise today that includes a path to lawful status for immigrants here illegally, it’s a certainty that he would withhold that opportunity until Congress actually acts to dramatically reduce or eliminate the flow of illegal immigration into the U.S.

A “Reaganesque” immigration reform package for today’s world would blend a willingness to compromise with an application of the lessons learned from 1986. It would prioritize border security before granting amnesty or a path to citizenship.

Ronald Reagan was a fan of big, bipartisan, blue-ribbon commissions formed to tackle particularly tough issues outside the realm of congressional compromise. Fox example, a signature piece of legislation signed by President Reagan that saved Social Security in 1983 was the direct result of the recommendations of his National Commission on Social Security Reform.

Such commissions were useful because they took hot potatoes out of the hands of Congress and put them into the hands of a bipartisan group created with the sole aim of finding common ground.

Creating an immigration commission would be a way for President Trump to reach across the aisle to ensure that whatever agreement is made on immigration is bipartisan and earns enough support to avoid a Senate filibuster.

As a student of the Reagan presidency who lived through the immigration debates on Capitol Hill during the Reagan years – and speaking for myself, not the Reagan Foundation – I’ve come to believe that a Reaganesque deal on immigration today could be structured around a provision that no amnesty or path to citizenship would be granted until such a blue-ribbon commission certifies that:

The border wall President Trump wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico is at least 75 percent complete.

The flow of illegal entries by immigrants into the U.S. has reached a specified minimum, reflecting a historic low.

At least 75 percent of U.S. employers have adopted an E-Verify type approach to dissuade future illegal immigration.

Upon achieving the above goals, illegal immigrants on an approved list with no criminal history would be granted amnesty.

How many immigrants here illegally would make it onto approved list and who would get on it?

A compromise plan might offer amnesty and an eventual pathway to citizenship for 3.2 million undocumented immigrants – the same number granted the privilege under President Reagan’s reforms in 1986.

If 3.2 million was appropriate for Reagan, it should be sellable today. Democrats will want to raise that number substantially. Republicans can determine how hard to hold the line to establish a solid bipartisan consensus.

A blue ribbon commission might have better ideas. But no doubt it could be tasked with prioritizing qualifications – such as military service, “Dreamer” status, special work skills, or something else – for inclusion in the number of immigrants accepted.

Once the commission certifies to Congress that the border wall is complete, those granted amnesty could legally apply for citizenship. All of those who reside in the U.S. illegally and do not apply for inclusion under the plan or who are not admitted under the cap for amnesty would need to self-deport by a certain date. They should be given enough time to arrange their affairs and safely and expeditiously return to their country of origin.

Ronald Reagan embodied the idea of a “compassionate conservative” before it was a popular term. As he said in a 1984 debate: “I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though some time back they may have entered illegally.” But he also knew the importance of enforcement and of learning from one’s mistakes.

Though he might support a path to legal status for today’s illegal immigrants, it’s difficult to imagine that President Reagan would repeat the mistakes of the 1986 immigration deal. Today’s Republican leaders who would follow in his footsteps should pursue a plan that puts enforcement first.",Don't get fooled again: Trump and Congress can learn from Reagan and reform our immigration system,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/03/dont-get-fooled-again-trump-and-congress-can-learn-from-reagan-and-reform-our-immigration-system.html

As CNET reports, the theft took place outside an Apple Store in Stonestown, San Francisco. A UPS truck containing 313 iPhone X handsets was broken into by theives who proceeded to unload the phones into a white Dodge van before driving off. The police have the description and serial number of every single stolen iPhone, with their total value thought to be over $370,000. They also have a photo og the theft in process taken by a janitor.

The theft is suspicious for a couple of reasons. The UPS truck had its cargo area locked while parked outside the Stonestown Galleria mall, yet the thieves had no problem gaining access. They also either got very lucky or knew exactly which UPS truck to target to grab the very expensive iPhones. I doubt it was luck.

Apple says there will be no problems with supplying the iPhone X to customers who planned to pick one up from the Stonestown Apple Store. That's surprising considering how constrained stock is thought to be. But maybe this is a sign stock levels are actually much better than we expected.

With the serial number of each stolen phone known, it should be possible to track them all down eventually. Unfortunately, the thieves will have likely sold them on and disappeared with the cash long before that happens.

Chronic Lyme disease is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and there’s no evidence that treating it—usually with long courses of IV antibiotics— helps alleviate symptoms.
Multiple chemical sensitivityLots of chemicals have been proven to be harmful to your health, like tobacco smoke and asbestos.","Imagine having recurrent physical symptoms that cause you discomfort, pain, and distress—then being told by the medical establishment that what you see and feel do not add up to a legitimate disease or syndrome.

That's the experience of countless people convinced they are suffering from a real illness—such as singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who believes she has Morgellons disease, a questionable condition that makes people feel “fibers” or other objects poking out of their skin. With the recent release of the new book, Reckless Daughter: A Portrait of Joni Mitchell, her mysterious illness is once again in the spotlight.

You don’t have to look hard to find other accounts of Morgellons or similar illnesses that often get the side eye from doctors. But you do have to look hard for any medical or scientific evidence that these and other conditions truly exist. As a result, many sufferers are left with few options for treatment of real symptoms that can’t be explained. Here are 7 of these baffling conditions, and the cases for and against them.

Morgellons disease

The symptoms Mitchell described to the LA Times in 2010 sound agonizing: “Fibers in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm: They cannot be forensically identified as animal, vegetable, or mineral. Morgellons is a slow, unpredictable killer—a terrorist disease: It will blow up one of your organs, leaving you in bed for a year.”

But when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tried to determine what causes such symptoms in the approximately four out of every 100,000 people who experience them, researchers were stumped. “No common underlying medical condition or infectious source was identified, similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation,"" study authors concluded in 2012.

CAN HOLDING IN A SNEEZE KILL YOU?

Indeed, Morgellons is often chocked up to delusions: Perhaps sufferers are actually dealing with a mental illness that conjures up feelings of being infected by parasites, called delusional parasitosis, which might account for the creepy-crawly sensations that people say they experience with Morgellons.

Chronic Lyme disease

This term is sometimes used to describe patients who have lingering symptoms of actual Lyme disease, something that occurs in up to 20 percent of Lyme cases. However, some doctors diagnose patients with something dubbed chronic Lyme disease when they were never infected with this tick-borne illness in the first place, yet they have unexplained Lyme–like symptoms including joint pain, fatigue, and muscle aches.

Chronic Lyme disease is not an accepted medical diagnosis, and there’s no evidence that treating it—usually with long courses of IV antibiotics— helps alleviate symptoms. The doctors who offer such treatments ""don’t typically follow the most commonly recommended treatments and the evidence-based guidelines,” Christina Nelson, MD, medical epidemiologist for the CDC told Health previously. “Most general practitioners and infectious disease physicians would not provide this type of care.”

Adrenal fatigue

Exhaustion, body aches, trouble sleeping, and undereye bags have lately been attributed to adrenal fatigue, but there’s no evidence that’s a thing. First described in 1998, the illness supposedly is based around the idea that the adrenal glands—which produce hormones that control metabolism and fight stress and are situated near the kidneys—stop working properly when the body is overtaxed by stress or illness.

Still, there’s no actual proof that taxing the body wears out the adrenal glands, and blaming symptoms on adrenal fatigue could delay treatment for what’s really wrong. ""Symptoms of fatigue, body aches, trouble sleeping, indigestion, and nervousness are nonspecific and could be due to a variety of other diseases, including sleep disorders, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and thyroid disease,"" Marilyn Tan, MD, an endocrinologist with Stanford Health Care and clinical assistant professor of medicine at Stanford School of Medicine told Health previously. ""To attribute all symptoms to a single diagnosis of 'adrenal fatigue' risks missing the detection of other treatable underlying diseases.""

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity

Sometimes jokingly referred to by skeptics as ""Wi-Fi allergies,"" EHS is supposedly triggered after a person is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, which comes from computers, cell phones, and other electronics. It's associated with fatigue, nausea, and heart palpitations. While the symptoms themselves are legit, there’s little evidence they’re actually caused by, say, sleeping in the same room as a Wi-Fi router. “Some research suggests that the physical complaints may be caused by fear and anxiety about having this condition—not the actual radiation,” Health’s medical editor Roshini Raj, MD, wrote previously.

Wind turbine syndrome

People thought to have wind turbine syndrome experience a range of general symptoms, like dizziness, nausea, trouble sleeping or breathing, and headaches. The one common denominator, sufferers insist, is that these health issues started when they began living near wind turbines—the large windmill-like contraptions that convert wind into energy and emit low-frequency sound waves.

FDA WARNS ON 'POT CURES CANCER' CLAIMS

First identified by pediatrician Nina Pierpont, WTS has gained the support of a handful of doctors who contribute opinions and anecdotal accounts of the syndrome to Dr. Pierpont’s website. So far, however, lab studies of those low-frequency noises, called infrasound, have been inconclusive. Dr. Pierpont has conducted just one study on the topic, which was small, done over the phone, and did not undergo peer review, Popular Science reported in October 2013.

Multiple chemical sensitivity

Lots of chemicals have been proven to be harmful to your health, like tobacco smoke and asbestos. And recent research suggests that exposure to certain everyday chemicals can increase your cancer risk later in life. But people who believe they have MCS say low levels of chemicals found in detergent, soap, ink, and other products has triggered chronic fatigue, memory problems, headaches, and rashes, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Often, these symptoms occur after a more severe but short-term chemical exposure, like a chemical spill.

“Multiple chemical sensitivity is under debate in the medical community at this time,” according to Johns Hopkins. “Some healthcare providers question whether it exists. Others acknowledge it as a medical disorder triggered by exposures to chemicals in the environment.”

Wilson’s syndrome

Also called Wilson’s temperature syndrome, this condition is supposedly a mild form of hypothyroidism, triggering a variety of symptoms attributed to thyroid dysfunction, such as a low body temperature. But when people who believe they have Wilson's undergo thyroid testing, their thyroid hormone levels are normal.

A doctor named E. Denis Wilson named this syndrome after himself and says it can be treated with a special thyroid hormone preparation. But the American Thyroid Association is not convinced. “The American Thyroid Association has found no scientific evidence supporting the existence of 'Wilson’s syndrome,'"" according to a statement. “The theory proposed to explain this condition is at odds with established facts about thyroid hormone.""

Sajak had fun Wednesday joking around with reporters and on social media as the Houston Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 to win their first World Series.

The game show host said even when the stakes are high, he doesn’t feel the pressure.

""I'm not a nervous type, but then again no one is throwing a 100-mile-per-hour fastball at me, so it makes it easy,” he said laughing.

Sajak is on the small screen every night, but “Wheel of Fortune” is pre-taped. He said he doesn’t know how top-notch baseball players keep their cool.

""I don't know how these guys do it,” he told Fox News at batting practice ahead of Game 7. “I don't know how they perform at this high-level while the whole baseball world is watching.”

It’s Sajak’s job to be enthusiastic as contestants spin the wheel to win big prizes, but the 70-year-old still gets excited about a great game, even when he is off the clock.

""I'm not a kid and this is the first Game 7 in this stadium in my lifetime,"" he said at Dodger’s Stadium. ""So it's very special to me and there may not be another one.”

After the game, Sajak joked around on Twitter about the Dodger’s tough loss.

Parton addressed the allegations against her longtime publicist on Twitter late Thursday.

""I've worked with Kirt Webster for many years and he has done a wonderful job. I am hoping that the accusations are not true,"" she tweeted.

A rep for Kid Rock told Fox News the singer was no longer working with Webster days after a former client accused Webster of drugging and sexually assaulting him -- a claim Webster denies.

The rocker, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, told us in a statement he takes accusations of sexual assault and mistreatment of others ""dead seriously.""

""I never witnessed or heard about any of this outside that he was probably gay, which I could care less about.

""I hope to god this s--t he is being accused of is not true as he has been nothing but a good friend to me. But if it comes to light that it is, I will be the first to cut the head off the snake.""

He added, ""I believe sexual harassment is like cancer. We all know someone affected by it and it has to stop.""

Charlie Daniels told Fox News he had fired Webster.

""""I know absolutely nothing about Kirt Webster's personal life and am not by any means qualified to comment on it. All of our ties with Webster and Associates have been severed and I will have no further comment on the situation,"" he said.

A source close to Travis also told Fox News the country legend had dropped Webster.

Fox News was told Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

While several artists have quietly fired Webster, they have not released statements.

Former client Austin Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of abuse at the hands of Webster and a former intern told us Webster propositioned him for sex while at work.

As President Donald Trump set off on his first official visit to Asia, including regional summits to be attended by Myanmar, both the House and Senate introduced legislation to prohibit U.S. military assistance to the Southeast Asian nation. The bills also seek financial and visa restrictions on military and other security force officials implicated in human rights abuses.

Nearly 60 activist groups, including Human Rights Watch, chimed in Friday, supporting targeted sanctions against military officials they say perpetrated crimes against humanity in the crackdown that has burned hundreds of Rohingya villages and forced more than 600,000 refugees to flee to Bangladesh since late August.

""Refugees have provided first-hand accounts of unfathomable brutality: soldiers burning infants alive, gang-raping women, shooting villagers fleeing their homes - violations that research by non-governmental organizations has found to be widespread and systematic,"" the groups said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

The State Department has already imposed additional restrictions on existing, low-level military ties, and says it is considering sanctions. Tillerson, who is set to visit Myanmar on Nov. 15, is also considering a recommendation from officials to declare that ""ethnic cleansing"" has taken place — an allegation endorsed by senior U.N. officials but denied by Myanmar authorities.

While it remains uncertain whether the U.S. legislation, introduced in both houses of Congress on Thursday, will become law, it reflects a dramatic, bipartisan shift in sentiment in Washington within a year. Widespread support for easing restrictions to reward the Myanmar military for loosening its five-decade grip on power has been replaced by growing appetite to slap back sanctions.

""It's time to re-impose targeted sanctions against the senior military officials responsible for this brutality to send a clear message: This violence must stop, perpetrators must be held accountable, and there must be meaningful civilian control over Burma's military and security forces."" said Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, top-ranking Democrat in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, said it ""would hold accountable the senior military officials responsible for the slaughter and displacement of innocent men, women and children in Burma, and make clear that the United States will not stand for these atrocities.""

Both bills further call for a re-imposition of a ban on the lucrative trade in jade and rubies that was among the last restrictions lifted by the Obama administration last year after elections installed a civilian government, albeit one with little control over the military.

For years teams and athletes dreaded appearing on the magazine's cover, for fear that a winning streak would snap or a spurt of superior play would halt.

But now, three years after a Sports Illustrated cover predicted that Houston would win the World Series in 2017, it has actually happened. The Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 on Wednesday night -- and put to rest a curse that has plagued athletes for decades.

And the 2014 cover boy, George Springer, was named the Series' most valuable player.

Back when the 2014 cover appeared, Springer was only 24 and just making inroads into the organization. He struck out three times on the day the cover was released -- and Houston won just 70 games that season.

But on Wednesday night, Houston and Springer were celebrating a championship.

The curse dates to 1954 when Sports Illustrated put Milwaukee Braves star Eddie Matthews on its first-ever cover, the Houston Chronicle reported. Soon after the cover was released, the Braves’ nine-game winning streak ended and Matthews broke his hand.

Since then, the cover had become a figment in sports culture. Over the last two years, the New York Mets, Kevin Durant and even the Dodgers have felt the effect of the SI jinx.

The Dodgers were on the cover of the Aug. 22 edition of Sports Illustrated with the words “Best. Team. Ever?” across Justin Turner and Yasiel Puig.

The Dodgers won a league-leading 105 games this season, but could not get past Houston.","Astros, George Springer appear to end Sports Illustrated cover jinx",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/11/02/astros-george-springer-appear-to-end-sports-illustrated-cover-jinx.html

But there is plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign had catastrophically bad judgment in choosing its most senior and junior advisers — and that Russia’s spy network sought to exploit that weakness.","Editor's note: The following column first appeared in The Washington Post.

The indictment of Paul Manafort and his longtime business partner Rick Gates should have come as no surprise to anyone. Indeed, it was precisely because of news reports in the summer of 2016 on some of the same matters contained in the federal grand jury’s indictment — charges of illicit cash payments to Manafort by the party of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych and Manafort’s assistance with undisclosed foreign lobbying — that Manafort was fired from Donald Trump’s campaign (though somehow Gates managed to stay on).

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s court filing tells a sordid tale of influence-peddling on behalf of Yanukovych, Vladi­mir Putin’s man in Kiev. But while Monday’s revelations were in no way an indictment of Trump-Russia collusion, they were a searing indictment of Trump’s judgment in bringing Manafort into his campaign in the first place.

My first job in Washington, in 1989, was at Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, long before Manafort began working for Yanukovych. Trump was a client then and has known Manafort for decades. Did it not occur to Trump that, given Manafort’s recent client roster, this was probably not the person he wanted running his presidential campaign — or that hiring him might come back to haunt Trump as president one day? How was being a pro-Putin lobbyist not disqualifying for Trump?

For his part, Manafort is a victim of his own hubris. He would probably not be in legal jeopardy today if he had not raised his head and become the public face of the Trump campaign. In Washington, you can line your pockets with work for Putin-backed clients, or you can be a public figure leading a presidential campaign, but you can’t do both. Manafort reportedly tried. According to the indictment, he was engaged in money laundering of his Ukraine payments during his time on the Trump campaign and afterward.

Similarly, the court’s “statement of the offense” on George Papadopoulos for providing false statements to the FBI contains no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion but shows bad judgment on the part of Trump’s campaign for bringing Papadopoulos aboard. Papadopoulos was such a junior foreign policy figure that his announcement as a member of Trump’s foreign policy team in March 2016 was met with this mocking Post headline: “One of Trump’s foreign policy advisers is a 2009 college grad who lists Model UN as a credential.”

The statement goes into great detail about Papadopoulos’s efforts to court a Kremlin-connected professor, a “niece” of Putin (who was not actually his niece) and a “Russian [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] connection.” But Mueller’s court filing also shows that those contacts produced little. Papadopoulos was unable to set up the meeting between Trump and Putin in Moscow that the Russians desperately wanted. (A footnote in the plea deal quotes an email between campaign officials that said, “We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.”) When it became clear the Putin meeting would not happen, Papadopoulos tried to pitch himself to travel to Moscow to represent the campaign, which also never happened. In other words, Papadopoulos was a peripheral figure whose failing efforts to impress the campaign with his Russian contacts seem to have come to naught.

Still, why bring him on in the first place? We know that in early 2016 Trump was having trouble attracting talented foreign policy advisers, but this was ridiculous. A presidential front-runner doesn’t bring people onto his foreign policy advisory team who still consider “U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations” to be résumé-worthy. This was a guy who would have a hard time landing a job as a legislative assistant on Capitol Hill, and suddenly, he’s conducting back-door diplomacy with Russian officials and doing interviews with the Russian press in the name of the Trump campaign? What could go wrong?

Much has been made of the professor telling Papadopoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton and thousands of “emails of Clinton.” But the document does not indicate that anyone at the Trump campaign took Papadopoulos up on this. Moreover, WikiLeaks did not release “emails of Clinton” but Democratic National Committee emails — so it’s not clear that the professor’s offer was any more truthful than his introduction to Putin’s “niece.” Because Papadopoulos has been a government informant since his arrest in July, perhaps there is more to come on this front. But as former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy points out, the statement of offense seems to be more exculpatory than incriminating for Trump: If the Russians were offering Clinton emails through Papadopoulos, “that would mean Trump and his campaign had nothing to do with the acquisition of the emails” and thus had not committed a crime. Accepting “dirt” from Russian sources would have been unsavory if it happened. But that’s arguably less unsavory than the Clinton campaign payingfor dirt on Trump from Russian sources.

In other words, there’s still no more public evidence of criminal collusion with Russia than there was before charges were brought. But there is plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign had catastrophically bad judgment in choosing its most senior and junior advisers — and that Russia’s spy network sought to exploit that weakness.","Marc Thiessen: The Manafort, Gates indictments aren't proof of Trump-Russia collusion -- just bad judgment",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/02/marc-thiessen-manafort-gates-indictments-arent-proof-trump-russia-collusion-just-bad-judgment.html

WHAT TWITTER'S 280-CHARACTER LIMIT COULD MEAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND US POLITICS

Matt Tait, a senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert Strauss Center, outlined some of the potential mayhem that a rogue employee could cause via Trump’s Twitter account.

“What if someone had hijacked the President's Twitter and issued policies for DHS or DOD that the department wasn't aware it had to implement?,” he tweeted.

“What if the Twitter employee had tweeted about some ongoing terror case and jeopardized it?,” he wrote, in another tweet.

TRUMP MAKE FIRST TWEETS AS PRESIDENT

“What if the Twitter employee tweeted a video of him assaulting a media organization or a political opponent? Imagine the damage to the dignity of the office,” Tait tweeted.

Tait also suggested that the rogue employee could face charges under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). “Going to be boring and say the Twitter employee who deleted Trump for 11 minutes should get an attorney and get ready for CFAA charges,” he tweeted.

Technologies such as artifical intelligence are being touted as a way for companies to gain visibility into their employees working practices. Questions will also inevitably be asked about Twitter’s employee vetting processes.

TRUMP'S TWITTER: COULD HACKERS WREAK HAVOC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?

Twitter says that it is conducting a “full internal review” into the deactivation of the President’s Twitter account. When contacted by Fox News, Twitter declined to comment beyond its initial tweets.

The President himself addressed the situation early Friday. “My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact,” he tweeted.

Trump, who has more than 41 million followers on Twitter, turned his @realDonaldTrump account into a powerful political weapon during his run to the White House. Experts, however, have warned that hackers could potentially use the same account to wreak havoc.

They all want what Seattle has: Amazon. The online retail giant confirming 238 cities from across North America submitted proposals to host its second headquarters. In the U.S. only seven states don't have cities in the running and the suitors are willing to spend millions to help Amazon feel at home.

Seattle's economy did get a boost from Amazon, more than $30 billion worth for the city's economy, just from the company's investments in the city, billions more from spinoff businesses and 40,000 jobs. The Bellingham Herald noting the city's unemployment rate is below the national average.

But keeping up with the growth is an issue, the city approving hundreds of millions of dollars in transportation and utility improvements. And the nation's fastest growing city is also one of the most expensive places to live. Rents in King County up 65 percent since 2009, though the rising renting has been an issue nationwide.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

RELATED: Grow Them Under a Canopy for Shade

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr. John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week’s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.

On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests. Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.

“Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players' disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,” Wells said. ""I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.”

Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.

The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells’ decision.

“We will not allow Mr. Wells' decision and subsequent media appearances to distract our players and organization from continuing to honor and support our military and veterans,"" the statement read. ""We, as an organization, have decided to move on from this sad and divisive discourse and focus our attention on supporting our military and veterans.”

According to the BBC, nasi lemak, which means “fatty rice” in Malay, is “coconut milk-infused rice accompanied by various ingredients — the standard ones are a fried egg, cucumber slices, tiny fried anchovies, peanuts, and a hefty dollop of sambal, or spice paste.” It’s typically wrapped in banana leaves and often eaten for breakfast.

The gown, however, required much more preparation than the dish: Designed by Malaysian designer Brian Khoo, the dress reportedly took more than 400 hours to complete. Khoo used hand-embroidered rhinestones to represent grains of rice, red rhinestones for the spicy sambal, and a pair of ""wings"" that represent banana leaves. The outfit also includes added embellishments representing peanuts, cucumbers and a fried egg, The Malay Mail Online reports.

Organizers describe it as a ""feast for the eyes and the senses, mmm!"" according to the BBC.

James added that she ""loves nasi lemak"" and eats it ""all the time,” according to Channel news Asia. “It represents me and my country.""

More than eight years after Bergdahl walked off his base in Afghanistan -- and unwittingly into the clutches of the Taliban -- Bergdahl walked out of a North Carolina courtroom a free man Friday. Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to endangering his comrades, was fined, reduced in rank to E1 and dishonorably discharged -- but he received no prison time.

Trump, aboard Air Force One en route to meetings in Asia, tweeted his disapproval of the sentence.

""The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,"" Trump wrote.

As part of the sentence, Bergdahl will forfeit his pay of $1000 per month for ten months.

Bergdahl was shaking and appeared emotional as the verdict was quickly read.

Prosecutors had requested a 14-year prison term following a week of emotional testimony from the survivors who were wounded during missions to find Bergdahl after he left the base in June 2009. Bergdahl's defense team has asked for no prison time.

Bergdahl faced up to life in prison for desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Wearing a blue dress uniform, Bergdahl appeared tense during the short morning session. He clenched his jaw as if grinding his teeth, then grimaced and looked at the floor when he walked out of the courtroom.

In closing arguments, defense attorneys argued that Bergdahl already had suffered enough confinement during five years of brutal captivity by Taliban allies. They asked the judge for a dishonorable discharge and no prison time. Their argument for leniency also cited harsh campaign-trail criticism by Donald Trump and Bergdahl's mental disorders.

Capt. Nina Banks, a defense attorney, said it wouldn't be justice to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban ""only to place him in a cell"" now.

""Sgt. Bergdahl has been punished enough,"" Banks added. ""Sgt. Bergdahl paid a bitter price for the choices that he made.""

During the multiday sentencing hearing, Bergdahl himself testified that he was sorry for the wounds suffered by searchers. He also described brutal beatings by his captors, illness brought on by squalid conditions and maddening periods of isolation, most of it in a cramped cage.

A psychiatrist testified that Bergdahl's decision to leave his post was influenced by a schizophrenia-like condition called schizotypal personality disorder that made it hard to understand consequences of his actions, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder brought on partly by a difficult childhood.

Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 14 years in prison, citing serious wounds to service members who looked for Bergdahl.

""Sgt. Bergdahl does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices,"" said Maj. Justin Oshana, a prosecutor. Contrasting Bergdahl to the wounded searchers, he added, ""The difference is, all the suffering stems from his choice.""

Oshana also cited Bergdahl's own words to argue against the idea that his thinking was clouded. On a courtroom monitor he displayed quotes from an initial investigation after Bergdahl returned to the U.S. Bergdahl, who has said he walked off to draw attention to problems with his unit, described to an investigating officer how he envisioned the missing-soldier alert unfolding.

Bergdahl had said that the call goes ""all the way up to Army command, it goes to Air Force, it goes to Marines. ... It goes to every high point and everybody finds out about it.""

Bergdahl pleaded guilty Oct. 16. The judge has wide discretion on sentencing because he didn't strike a deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment. A bad conduct or dishonorable discharge would deprive Bergdahl of most or all his veterans' benefits.

The 31-year-old soldier from Hailey, Idaho, was brought home by President Barack Obama in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Obama said at the time that the U.S. does not leave its service members on the battlefield.

Republicans roundly criticized Obama, and Trump went further while campaigning for president, repeatedly calling Bergdahl a traitor who deserved death.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.","A University of Alabama law student and Marine Corps second lieutenant is on a mission to memorialize a fallen American war hero.

Lt. Steven Arango was attending Bates College in Maine, when he read a New York Times article that inspired him.

The article profiled Captain George Whitney, 38, a Bates College alumnus and a C.I.A paramilitary officer who was killed in December in Afghanistan.

“After I read about him, I knew right away that Bates needed to honor him,” Arango said to ConnectingVets.com.

Whitney excelled both academically and athletically at Bates College; he graduated cum laude after playing football as the starting fullback. After college, Whitney joined the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, serving in Anbar, Iraq. He then joined the C.I.A, but was killed in action during an operation in Afghanistan.

Whitney, along with two others, was awarded stars from the C.I.A for dying in the line of duty.

“He epitomized selfless service and gave his life in protection of our country,” Arango said. “Simply put, he’s a hero.”

Inspired by Whitney’s heroism, Arango petitioned Bates College to honor his legacy.

Arango decided that a sculpted bust would be the perfect tribute to Whitney, and contracted the help of retired USMC Colonel and Alabama artist Lee Busby.

Also a University of Alabama graduate, Busby sculpts Alabamians who have been killed in Iraq of Afghanistan.

""I'm no Michelangelo, but I know the world that these people operate in, and I know what they went through,” Busby told Southern Living. “And, I do have some ability to sculpt. So, that's what I want to do.""

Now, Busby is nearly halfway done with the bust of Whitney and is ready to sculpt the finishing touches.

“We are flying Caryn Whitney into Tuscaloosa to put the final touches on the bust,” Arango said. “We want to make sure the likeness is exactly of her son.”

Busby expects to complete the sculpture by December, which then will be used for pouring — the process used to make a bronze bust.

Arango is funding this project completely alone, and hopes that Bates College can provide space for the memorial.

“I just want Captain Whitney to be honored,” Arango said. “For the next 100, 200 years with Bates students walking next to him and seeing him? I promise you Bates will turn out even better students than they are now.”

Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

First, we need to identify terrorists as enemy combatants. They should be thoroughly interrogated and a new law should be developed so that captured terrorists are not able to benefit from Miranda rights.

As a matter of national security, we need to know who our enemies are and what threats they may pose. This overrides the legitimate principles for defending the innocent in traditional criminal cases.

The Supreme Court has ruled that people who are arrested and questioned by police must be advised of their Miranda rights in order for police to use their statements as evidence. The minimal Miranda warning that police must read to an arrested person before questioning states: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense.”

As a matter of national security, we need to know who our enemies are and what threats they may pose. This overrides the legitimate principles for defending the innocent in traditional criminal cases.

Take, for example, Tuesday’s attack in New York City. Eight people were killed. Twelve people were wounded – and we know who did it. We should have a system in place that enables us to aggressively push to find out what the terrorist knows, who he relates to, and what else we must do immediately to prevent future attacks.

Second, while today's focus is on immigration, we have a disturbingly large number of home-grown American citizens being radicalized. We must develop a new legal framework for dealing with local and imported terrorists alike.

Third, we must find out how people are radicalized in America and cut off these sources of radicalization. This might include, when necessary, monitoring and closing radical mosques that encourage violence. This means police need to be able to proactively monitor potential terrorists, recruiters, and propagandists. Prior to Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City had one of the finest counterterrorism efforts of any city in the world.

This is going to be a long war with radical Islamic Supremacists. Closing the immigration lottery system immediately is an important step, but we will need to do far more than this in order to be truly safe.","Newt Gingrich: Get smart -- Scrap the diversity lottery, be honest about terrorists",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/03/newt-gingrich-get-smart-scrap-diversity-lottery-be-honest-about-terrorists.html

Folks can deal with flesh-eating zombies and demon-possessed children. But accusations of cultural appropriation? Well, that’s a whole different story.

Let’s be honest – nobody wants to tangle with a bunch of perpetually-offended liberals who were triggered by a white guy wearing a sombrero. Most folks would rather climb into a storm drain and take their chances with a deranged circus clown.

Two Disney costumes are causing quite a bit of “cultural appropriation and white privilege” controversy this year – Moana, the Polynesian character, and Elsa, from “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices…about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” wrote Sachi Feris on the Raising Race Conscious Children blog.

In their estimation dressing up like a Polynesian is akin to wearing black face – or calling a white Southerner a “Cracker.”

The blog also posted a guide urging white parents to use Halloween as an opportunity to “dismantle white supremacy.”

“White parents who want to dismantle White supremacy have a special burden to check their entitlement on Halloween – and make sure that their children’s costume choices are not reinforcing a culture of racism,” the bloggers warned.

In other words, no Colin Kaepernick costumes, kids.

“White people have been dressing up in costumes ‘in good fun’ with little regard to whom they might be offending,” the bloggers wrote.

I think they might be talking about you folks who dressed up as President Trump’s border wall.

The Raising Race Conscious Children bloggers also want moms and dads to use Halloween as an educational opportunity. It’s not just about candy corn and orange marshmallow circus peanuts.

“Halloween is an opportunity to have a conversation with your child about race, power and privilege,” they wrote.

I must confess - it is indeed a burden for us pale faces -- celebrating Halloween without culturally appropriating.

But this year- I may have stumbled upon the foolproof costume. I've decided to dress up in a button down Oxford shirt, with khakis and penny loafers. If anybody asks -- I'm a Cracker.

Houston started the game off fast, scoring all of its five runs in the first two innings off Dodgers starter Yu Darvish. The early run support was all the Astros needed.

World Series MVP George Springer led the evening off with a double and before you could blink your eyes, Houston was up 2-0. Springer then came up in the third inning and socked a two-run home run. It was his fifth home run of the World Series, tying a mark set by Reggie Jackson and Chase Utley.

""We're coming home a champion, Houston,"" Springer said.

It was the first World Series title for a franchise that started in 1962 as the Houston Colt .45s of the National League. The team became the Astros a few years later when it moved into the Astrodome, and then joined the American League in 2013.

Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. did not allow a run, but was yanked before the third inning after loading the bases. Manager A.J. Hinch brought in Brad Peacock to close the opportunity to the Dodgers had to try and get back some runs.

Peacock was part of a swath of relievers Hinch used in the ballgame to shut the door. He ended with four innings of Charlie Morton, who was credited with the win.

“We held down a really tough lineup,"" Morton said. ""For my teammates, for the city of Houston, it's just unbelievable.""

Built on the skills of homegrown All-Stars Carlos Correa, Dallas Keuchel and more, and boosted by a late-season trade for Detroit Tigers ace starter Justin Verlander, general manager Jeff Luhnow completed the ascent that some predicted.

Famously now, there was the Sports Illustrated cover in 2014 — after Houston had lost more than 100 games for three straight years — that proclaimed: ""Your 2017 World Series Champs."" It featured a picture of Springer in a bright Astros jersey.

Houston won 101 times this year to take the AL West, then won Games 6 and 7 at home in the AL Championship Series. The Astros joined the 1985 Royals as the only clubs to win a pair of Game 7s in the same year.

For the Dodgers, the 2017 World Series was the franchise’s first appearance since 1988. They led the majors with a $240 million payroll, but it did not pay off for part-owner Magic Johnson or manager Dave Roberts.

L.A. ace Clayton Kershaw, who was shellacked in Game 5, was brought in to relieve Darvish and pitched decently. He provided four shutout innings for Los Angeles.

After Springer lined a leadoff double, Alex Bregman hit a bouncer that first baseman Cody Bellinger threw past Darvish for an error, allowing a run to score. Bregman aggressively stole third and scored on Altuve's grounder, and it was 2-0 after eight pitches.

A double by Marwin Gonzalez helped set up perhaps McCullers' biggest contribution, a slow grounder for his first pro RBI. Springer followed with a no-doubt, two-run drive into the left-center field bleachers.

That was the Series-most 25th homer in a Major League Baseball season that set a record for home runs. It was easily enough for the Astros to offset pinch-hitter Andre Ethier's RBI single in the Los Angeles sixth.

Only once have the Dodgers clinched a crown at home, that coming in 1963 when Sandy Koufax outpitched Yankees star Whitey Ford to finish a sweep. They've never won Game 7 of the Fall Classic at their own park, dating more than a century ago to their days in Brooklyn.

The Astros' title was also the first World Series championship for a club from Texas. The Texas Rangers, based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area since 1972, are still looking for their first World Series title.

A series of anti-government, leftist rallies set to descend on major cities nationwide Saturday is drawing the attention of local officials, who, like the organizers themselves, fear the events could be hijacked by violent masked anarchists.

The left-wing ""Refuse Fascism"" group is using Nov. 4 as its kickoff for demonstrations in nearly two dozen U.S. cities, protests it says will continue ""day after day and night after night ─ not stopping ─ until our DEMAND is met.""

The ""DEMAND"" is the removal of President Trump and Vice President Pence.

The gatherings are being described as a kind of ""Antifa apocalypse"" on right-wing media, according to The Washington Post. Several sites are expressing particular alarm about the loosely-defined left-leaning group, which preaches a version of ferocious anti-government chaos that often uses ""domestic terrorist violence,"" according to a recent FBI report.

Among the 20 cities where rallies are set to occur are Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle.

The anarchist group, whose name comes from term ""anti-fascist,"" made news earlier this week for allegedly harassing a female reporter at Columbia University and for seven arrests at California State University, Fullerton, amid reports of head-punching and pepper-spraying.

“You cannot try to ‘wait things out’,” a Refuse Fascism call to action reads. “Those who lived through Nazi Germany and sat on the sidelines, looking on as Hitler demonized, criminalized, and eventually rounded up one group after another, became shameful collaborators with monstrous crimes.”

Tapping into movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Women’s March, Refuse Fascism said it hopes to protest non-stop, 24/7 “until this regime is driven from power.”

The organization is engaged with a broad coalition of groups, including the Revolutionary Communist Party — but says they are committed to a nonviolence stance.

Zee told The Washington Post his organization does “uphold the legal right to self-defense,” but that they ""don’t initiate violence"" and they ""oppose violence.""

Previous instances of antifa violence have, however, been justified as ""self-defense.""

""Fascism cannot be defeated by speech,"" Darmouth Prof. Mark Bray said in August.

Some of Refuse Fascism's literature and visuals are also drawing scrutiny for their use of violent images.

Refuse Fascism ATL's poster asks Atlanta demonstrators to bring “pots and pans” with an image of a pole poked through Trump’s severed head, drawn as a pig's with flies buzzing around it.

Chicago’s invite includes an image of a rope pulling down a Trump statue, which is already cut in half.

“Show this damn Trump and Pence regime that they do not rule over us,” one organizer said in a video posted on Facebook. “Let us stand together, come together, and fight this regime on November fourth.”

“’This Nightmare Must End’ captures how millions of people feel right now…where you may face persecution or even death,” said Andy Zee, a member of the advisory board of Refuse Fascism, according to the Revolutionary Communist website.

Zee called for a “ferocious struggle” because “normal forms of petition (like protest as usual) DO NOT APPLY with Trump.” Recently, several members shut down a Los Angeles highway with “Nov. 4 It Begins” signs in a show of “non-violent civil disobedience.”

Zee cites the pamphlet ""The Coming Civil War,"" by Bob Avakian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party and architect of the new synthesis of communism, to point out why the group demands “the whole regime must go.”

Avakian brands Pence the political leader of “Christian fascism,” a “fascism wrapped in the Bible taken literally and the American flag, saturated with racism, misogyny, and xenophobia,” which he compares to the “kind of Islamic fundamentalism that is tearing up the Mideast.”

Zee also says news organizations such as CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post “must go all out” to “hound the enemy: the regime, Congress, administrators from agencies such as ICE, the Border Patrol, and more.”

President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

First, we need to identify terrorists as enemy combatants. They should be thoroughly interrogated and a new law should be developed so that captured terrorists are not able to benefit from Miranda rights.","Newt Gingrich: Get Smart -- Scrap The Diversity Lottery, Be Honest About Terrorists",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/newt-gingrich-get-smart-scrap-diversity-lottery-be-honest-about-terrorists

That was back in 1992 and the former child star is all grown up – and in love.

People Magazine reported Wednesday the 34-year-old, who represents a fertility doctor in Orange County, Calif. married financial advisor Matthew Greiner at the US Grant Hotel in San Diego.

“We are overjoyed to finally become husband and wife,” said DeLoach. “It’s an amazing feeling when you are marrying your best friend. We can’t wait to start our lives together and one day have our own little bumble bees to add to the hive.”

The couple, who’ve been together for nearly three years, met online.

“All it took was one glance and an amazing first date and we fell in love instantly,” she said.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

According to the National Interagency Fire Center, from Jan. 1 through Oct. 6, 2017 there were 50, 283 wildfires in the United States– up from 46,618 last year. Acres lost numbered about 3.7 million more than 2016 as well, with 8.5 million acres of forestland going up in smoke. It’s not just a problem in the US–wildfire numbers are going up worldwide, and it’s only going to get worse.

“As air temperatures continue to increase over time, there will be more days during which wildfires can be ignited and burn, so there will be more fires,” Research Forester David L. Peterson told Fox News. “More extreme temperatures will allow some fires to burn more intensely and spread faster, making them more difficult to suppress.”

Now, U.K.–based startup BioCarbon Engineering hopes to reverse some of the damage with drone technology. Reportedly, their drones can plant up to 100,000 trees in one day.

SILICON VALLEY HISTORY LOST: ARCHIVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT BELONGED TO HP FOUNDERS DESTROYED IN WILDFIRE

“The current state-of-the-art is the hand–planting of saplings,” former NASA engineer and BioCarbon CEO Lauren Fletcher said. “The goal of our technology is to make the current planters more effective at what they do.”

According to Fletcher, his drones can plant trees 60 times faster than hand-planting. First, a group of drones perform a 3D aerial survey of the land for topography and soil quality data. After a seeding pattern is planned, the drones are loaded with seed pods. These pods are pressurized canisters that burst upon impact and are filled with germinated seeds soaked in a nutrient–rich gel. The drones then set out over the mapped terrain, hovering up to 6 feet and firing their pods (about ten per minute) into the ground. The seedlings are then monitored for growth.

“We have designed our system so that two pilots will run multiple drones simultaneously, allowing for a daily planting rate of 100,000 trees per day,” Fletcher told Fox News. “Just 60 teams will allow us to plant 1 billion trees a year, with the potential to scale to 10's of billions of trees every year.”

DRONES CAPTURES CAPSIZING BOAT AND FLORIDA TEEN'S DARING RESCUE

Another advantage drones have over human planters is that they’re able to plant in difficult-to-reach areas, such as mountainsides or mangroves.

BioCarbon is currently looking to have its drones replanting forests in the U.S. by April 2018 at the latest, just in time for the spring planting season. The startup hopes to replant in areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina as well as out west where forests have been decimated by bark beetle infestations and wildfires.

“The next phase for us is to continue to work in larger scale and to upgrade the designs to make them more automated so that we can start distributing this technology to those people who are already planting trees,” Fletcher said. “The key to success is empowering governments and local communities with this emerging technology.”

DRONES FLYING OVER CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HURT FIREFIGHING EFFORTS, OFFICIALS SAY

Drones, however, can pose challenges in emergency situations if their operators are not part of the emergency recovery effort. For example, drones capturing footage of the recent California wildfires were hindering firefighters’ efforts, according to officials.

The technology, however, can be a great asset if it is in the right hands. Drones are being used to help ground crews monitor wildfire activity, and firefighters in New York have also used drones for fire monitoring. With technology advancing quickly, who knows what the future holds? For example, a prototype drone that will harness foam to fight fires recently went on display in Dubai.

“Whether it’s seeding or firefighting or wildlife management or insect/disease scouting, the large land areas that must be managed means that drones will play an ever greater role in such forestry operations,” Dr. Daniel Schmoldt, an expert on high-tech applications in natural resources, told Fox News. “As autonomy-enabling technologies advance, flight times increase, and government regulations fully enable drone deployment, especially smart and autonomous ones, drones will be a game-changer for forest and environmental management.”",Forests lost in wildfires could be replanted by drones,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/03/forests-lost-in-wildfires-could-be-replanted-by-drones.html

In both contests, Republicans and Democrats have recently hit each other over immigration-related issues, including sanctuary cities, where local policies protect illegal immigrants from federal deportation.

In Virginia, the race between Republican nominee Ed Gillespie and Democratic nominee Ralph Northam has gotten particularly nasty in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of running ads that are out of line.

Earlier this week, a liberal group called the Latino Victory Fund released a television ad showing immigrant and minority children in Virginia being chased down the road by a man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker.

The group eventually took the ad down after the terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed when a man intentionally mowed them down in a truck.

“Virginians respect and appreciate civil discourse, but the Latino Victory Fund’s ad was far out of bounds of the civility Virginians expect and deserve,” Gillespie campaign manager Chris Leavitt said.

Meanwhile, Democrats have protested ads from Gillespie accusing Northam of voting for bills that would lead to sanctuary cities and a threat increase from the MS-13 gang.

Northam’s campaign has accused Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, of being a “mini-Trump” whose ads “demonize” immigrants.

WHITE HOUSE SLAMS DEMOCRATIC AD IN VIRGINIA WHERE MAN IN TRUCK CHASES MINORITY CHILDREN

“From his toxic ads to his embrace of Trumpcare, Ed Gillespie has transformed himself into Virginia’s very own mini-Trump,” Northam spokesman David Turner said.

As Gillespie has embraced illegal immigration as a campaign issue, President Trump has tweeted his support for Gillespie in the race.

“Ralph Northam, who is running for Governor of Virginia, is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities,” the president tweeted last month. “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Yet in New Jersey, Trump has not spoken out in support of Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is running against Democratic nominee Phil Murphy.

Guadagno has spent the campaign railing against sanctuary cities, releasing an ad drawing attention to Murphy’s debate comments in support of New Jersey being a “sanctuary state” and telling the story of an illegal immigrant who was convicted of killing several students in 2007.

“Murphy doesn’t have our backs,” the ad’s narrator says. Referencing criminal illegal immigrants, the narrator continues: “He has theirs.”

Like Northam in Virginia, Murphy has responded by accusing Guadagno of taking a page from Trump with her emphasis on the issue.

“Kim Guadagno should be ashamed of herself for the way she’s politicizing the deaths of three children and painting a community with the broad brush of a murderer, a tactic she must have gleaned from President Trump,” Murphy said in response to the ad. “To say the least, these are not New Jersey’s values.”

In both states, the candidates are battling to succeed two well-known governors, Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey and Democrat Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.

Heading into Tuesday’s vote, Democrats have the advantage, according to recent polling. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Northam leading Gillespie by 3 points in Virginia; in New Jersey, the polling average has Murphy ahead of Guadagno by 15 points.","Virginia, New Jersey gubernatorial candidates spar over sanctuary cities as contests near finish line",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/03/virginia-new-jersey-gubernatorial-candidates-spar-over-sanctuary-cities-as-contests-near-finish-line.html

Gaetz was referring to Mueller’s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia’s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company, Uranium One, that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe.

MUELLER FACING NEW REPUBLICAN PRESSURE TO RESIGN IN RUSSIA PROBE

Gaetz also pointed to the FBI informant, whose gag order was lifted by the Justice Department last week, and is now able to provide information to Congress, free of the FBI’s nondisclosure agreement he signed when Mueller served as director.

“Although federal agents possessed this information in 2010, the Department of Justice continued investigating this “matter” for over four years. The FBI, led at the time by Robert Mueller, required the confidential witness to sign a non-disclosure agreement. When the witness attempted to contact Congress and federal courts about the bribery and corruption he saw, he was threatened with legal action,” Gaetz said in a statement. “By silencing him, Obama’s Justice Department and Mueller’s FBI knowingly kept Congress in the dark about Russia’s significant and illegal involvement with American uranium companies.”

Gaetz said that due to these “deeply troubling” events, Mueller’s “impartiality is hopelessly compromised.”



“He must step down immediately,” Gaetz said Friday.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has also called for Mueller’s resignation.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called for an independent special counsel to investigate the Obama-era Uranium One deal.

There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.

The proposed resolution comes just days after Mueller’s team announced the first charges in their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials in the 2016 presidential election.

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts by a federal grand jury as part of the probe. Both pleaded not guilty. And Former Trump foreign policy campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos entered a guilty plea on Monday after admittedly making false statements to the FBI.","GOP Reps.

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

RELATED: Get an Exhaust Fan for the Bathroom

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava were standing with the USS Ashland's commanding officer and others high on the bridgeway when the ship arrived at White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, five days after it picked up the women and their two dogs from their boat, 900 miles southeast of Japan.

Appel and Fuiava had left Honolulu on May 3 aboard Appel's 50-foot vessel the Sea Nymph for what was supposed to be an 18-day trip to Tahiti.

Storms flooded the engine and damaged the mast and sails so badly, they couldn't generate enough wind power to stay on course. They drifted aimlessly and sent unanswered distress calls for 98 consecutive days.

They were thousands of miles in the wrong direction when a Taiwanese fishing vessel found them. Towing the sailboat damaged it further, but Appel swam to the Taiwanese vessel to make a mayday call.

They'd run out of food for the dogs, and the woman began sharing their own, leaving their food supply 90 percent depleted by the time they were rescued.

The USS Ashland on Wednesday picked up the women, plus the dogs Zeus and Valentine, all four looking remarkably fit for having been lost at sea for nearly six months.

Appel told reporters on Friday that they were beginning to believe they were completely out of luck when they saw the U.S. Navy ship chugging toward them.

""When I saw the gray ship on the horizon, I was just shaking,"" she said then. ""I was ready to cry, I was so happy. I knew we were going to live.""

Although Appel has been sailing the Hawaiian islands for 10 years and spent two years preparing for this voyage, she acknowledged she and Fuiava, a novice sailor, may not have prepared as well as they could have.

Appel credited their survival in part to the veteran sailors in Hawaii who had warned them to prepare well for their journey.

Brazile admitted that Hillary Clinton's campaign gained significant control over the Democratic National Committee's finances and strategy in exchange for helping the party wipe out 2012 presidential campaign debt. In laymen’s terms, Brazile explains how the party rigged the primary for Clinton to defeat Bernie Sanders through shady financial deals – which would typically be major news.

An excerpt from her new book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” was published by Politico at 5 a.m. ET on Thursday morning – over 12 hours before the big three networks air their newscasts.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren even appeared on CNN at roughly 4:40 p.m. ET to discuss the scandal but ABC’s “World News Tonight,” CBS’s “Evening News” and “NBC Nightly News” skipped it completely. These programs start at 6:30 p.m. ET.

On Thursday, after CNN and Fox News both covered the Brazile claims, CBS opened with details on the deadly ambush in Niger, while NBC and ABC both opened with the proposed tax cut.

The winner of the 2016 presidential race took notice.

“The Donna Brazile story is astonishing. The media loves to tell stories of Republican discord. Here's the woman who was the interim head of the DNC saying Bernie Sanders got screwed by the party and Team Clinton. No matter how much the media wants to hide that, it's a huge issue and will impact future elections,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

Brazile took over as interim party chairperson in July 2016 when the DNC was plagued by email scandals and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. was ousted on the eve of the party’s 2016 convention. Brazile, who resigned from her role as a CNN contributor after she was accused of leaking questions to Clinton ahead of a CNN Town Hall event, doesn’t exactly have the nicest things to say about her DNC predecessor in the book.

“Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party -- she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was,” Brazile wrote. “Obama left the party $24 million in debt—$15 million in bank debt and more than $8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign—and had been paying that off very slowly.”

Gainor said Brazile’s revelation “might explain why Sanders has been absent during the close Virginia gubernatorial campaign,” but “journalists don't want to tell you that either.”

On Nov. 1, Forbes reports, Papa John’s CEO and public face John Schnatter told investors that the NFL’s “poor leadership” through the “take a knee” controversy has lost the chain $70 million. Schnatter added that the tension between the racially charged protests and the football league “is polarizing the customer, polarizing the country.”

As the media and public alike have erupted in debate over Schnatter’s remarks, frozen pizza retailer DiGiorno evidently couldn’t resist chiming in.

Posting an “Us vs. Them” note on Twitter, complete with two emojis depicting positive and negative growth sales charts, DiGiorno presumably hinted that its own sales, unlike Papa John's, weren't suffering. Later that day, the company also tweeted another message reading, “Better Pizza. Better Sales,” in an apparent dig at the Papa John's motto.

With over 77,000 likes and 13,000 comments pouring in between the two posts, the frozen pizza retailer clearly struck a nerve.

To escalate matters, another pizza chain threw itself into the fray. On Nov. 2, Greg Creed, CEO of Pizza Hut’s parent company Yum Brands, told investors that the NFL protests have not affected their net dough. “We’re not seeing an impact on any of that on our business,” he said, according to Business Insider.

Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals' demise.","What killed off the Neanderthals? It's a big debate, and now a study says that no matter what the answer, they were doomed anyway.

Our close evolutionary cousins enjoyed a long run in Europe and Asia, but they disappeared about 40,000 years ago after modern humans showed up from Africa.

The search for an explanation has produced many theories including climate change, epidemics, or inability to compete with the modern humans, who may have had some mental or cultural edge.

The new study isn't intended to argue against those factors, but just to show that they're not needed to explain the extinction, says Oren Kolodny of Stanford University.

He and colleague Marcus Feldman present their approach in a paper released Tuesday by the journal Nature Communications.

They based their conclusion on a computer simulation that represented small bands of Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe and Asia. These local populations were randomly chosen to go extinct, and then be replaced by another randomly chosen population, with no regard for whether it represented the same species.

Neither species was assumed to have any inherent advantage, but there was one crucial difference: Unlike the Neanderthals, the modern humans were supplemented by reinforcements coming in from Africa. It wasn't a huge wave, but rather ""a tiny, tiny trickle of small bands,"" Kolodny said.

Still, that was enough to tip the balance against the Neanderthals. They generally went extinct when the simulation was run more than a million times under a variety of assumptions.

If survival was a game of chance, ""it was rigged by the fact that there's recurring migration,"" Kolodny said. ""The game was doomed to end with the Neanderthals losing.""

Kolodny said the evidence that such migrations actually occurred is suggestive rather than conclusive. Such migrations would not be expected to leave much of an archaeological trace, he said.

Experts in human origins said the paper could help scientists pin down the various factors that led to the Neanderthals' demise. It fits in with other recent attempts to explain the extinction without assuming behavioral differences between Neanderthals and our ancestors, said Wil Roebroeks of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. The notion of such differences is largely disproven, he said.

Katerina Harvati of the University of Tuebingen in Germany said while the new work could be useful in solving the extinction mystery, it doesn't address the question of why modern humans dispersed from Africa into Europe and Asia. It's important to figure out what was behind that, she said in an email.",Slow flow of human immigration may have doomed Neanderthals,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/11/01/slow-flow-human-immigration-may-have-doomed-neanderthals.html

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.","Officially retired, Army Capt. Gary “Mike” Rose was never in Laos at the height of the Vietnam War.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

She walked over to Marilyn Monroe.
“So when it happened, it was a shock and a total surprise… It’s like winning a lottery ticket… It’s too much of a long shot.”In fact, Chakiris didn’t think the romantic drama would have been a hit.","George Chakiris is still recognized by fans as headstrong rival Bernardo in 1961’s Oscar-winning musical “West Side Story,” but by then he had already worked with Hollywood’s most famous actress twice.

At age 19, Chakiris danced alongside Marilyn Monroe in the sex symbol’s signature number “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” for 1953’s “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.”

They reunited again in 1954 for another musical, “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” The 83-year-old actor and dancer still has fond memories of working with the blonde bombshell, who had a completely different persona when cameras weren’t rolling.

“She was so intensely concentrated on her work,” Chakiris told Fox News. “She was very quiet. She didn’t speak with anyone, not to be rude, but she was just so concentrated on her work.

""Whenever they cut [a scene] for any reason, she didn’t go to the mirror or her dressing room. She went right back to her starting position and was ready to shoot the number again or that portion of it… She was just so strikingly beautiful. She had such fair skin.”

Monroe, who wasn’t a superstar yet when filming began for “Gentleman Prefer Blondes,” relied on renowned choreographer Jack Cole to help her move like a titilating screen siren. However, things became awkward when her acting coach Natasha Lytess got involved — and that was often, Chakiris said.

“I remember one time… Jack Cole was facing Marilyn and behind him, also facing Marilyn was Natasha Lytess,” recalled Chakiris. “But he didn’t know Natasha was behind him. And I guess he was giving Marilyn some kind direction and Natasha was very slowly shaking her head. It looked like, ‘Pay no attention to what he’s telling you, I’ll tell you later.' But Marilyn Monroe was wonderfully polite to the both of them.”

And Chakiris would had his own unexpected encounter with Monroe at a cast party for “There’s No Business Like Show Business” just a year later.

“The girl who was my partner in a couple of the dance numbers said, ‘Why don’t I go over there and ask her to give you a kiss on the cheek?’” said Chakiris. “I said, ‘No! No! No!’ Well, she did it anyway! She walked over to Marilyn Monroe. She pointed in my direction and asked her. Marilyn listened to the request and very nicely, she said, ‘But I don’t know him.’ I love that because I think it says something about her.”

Over the years, Monroe would later garner an infamous reputation for her behavior on set. The actress would reportedly show up hours later for work or sometimes not at all.

She would supposedly flub her lines so much that multiple takes were required. There were also reported tearful meltdowns and those unexpected moments when an insecure Monroe would hide in her dressing room. But Chakiris never witnessed any of that. Instead, he saw an actress who dressed casually, was ready to work and eager to impress.

“I know there are those other stories, of course,” explained Chakiris. “But the thing that I noticed was her courtesy, how wonderfully quiet she was, how her main concern was her work… I really admired that… She never made a big, loud entrance.

""I always thought that in spite of what anybody said about her in any way, shape or form, I always felt [that] in her heart she was kind. There was a sweetness to her… I respect who she was and what she was trying to do… When you see her in a movie, any movie she’s in, your eyes always go to her… She’s so gifted, I think. She’s musically gifted.”

While Monroe never won an Oscar for any of her films, Chakiris did in 1962 for “West Side Story.” At age 27, he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor — out beating Montgomery Clift, George C. Scott, Peter Falk and Jackie Gleason. Chakiris was in disbelief when Shirley Jones said his name.

“You sort of hope you’ll hear your name, but you totally do not expect to hear your name,” said Chakiris. “So when it happened, it was a shock and a total surprise… It’s like winning a lottery ticket… It’s too much of a long shot.”

In fact, Chakiris didn’t think the romantic drama would have been a hit.

“I remember at one point, there was a break in filming and I was standing out in the alleyway by the soundstage,” he explained. “There were a few other men from the production team. I overheard them say…’Well, we’re not sure that we will have a commercial success, but we think we might have an artistic success.’

""Everybody felt strongly about the film because we loved what we were doing and we felt like were working on something that was truly wonderful. We were so committed to what we were doing.”

Chakiris still stays in touch with his former cast-mates. Rita Moreno, who played Anita, not only accompanied Chakiris for the Oscars, but the fellow Academy Award-winner would later choose him to be the godfather of her daughter.

“It sounds corny to say, but we’re like a family,” he said. “That experience for all of us really created a bond… The ‘West Side Story’ experience, it really is a family. There’s a closeness that has continued.”

Today, Chakiris still stays busy pursuing his other passion — designing jewelry. He described it as “a small business,” but one that continues to grow.

“That was never my intention,” he said. “But it was just great making things with your hand. It’s just a gratifying thing to do. I really love it. I didn’t call an agent for an acting job at all. Now I was just doing something else, not as a career change. I just was doing something new that I really loved doing. It ended up taking all my time. I really enjoyed that.”",Marilyn Monroe co-star George Chakiris spills on working with the blonde bombshell,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/03/marilyn-monroe-co-star-george-chakiris-spills-on-working-with-blonde-bombshell.html

Bergdahl had pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. A judge spared him jail time and dishonorably discharged him. He faced up to life in prison for his charges; prosecutors wanted a 14-year punishment.

He will also have to pay a $1,000 fine every month for 10 months.

Bergdahl was shaking and appeared emotional as the verdict was read.

“He’s certainly glad this is over,” Bergdahl’s attorney, Eugene Fidell, told reporters after the sentencing.

Fidell also said he will appeal the decision. Beacuse of President Trump's comments about the case, Fidell said he still believes the case should be dismissed.

Bergdahl’s story left the nation debating for years about whether he is a hero or traitor, as well as the importance of the long-held American commitment not to leave troops behind. Former President Barack Obama defended swapping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl’s release in 2014 while Trump said Bergdahl should “face the death penalty.”

Why was Bergdahl on trial?

Then 23, Bergdahl went missing from his remote infantry station near the Pakistan border in June 2009. His disappearance launched a massive search operation.

Bergdahl was quickly captured by the Taliban after leaving his post. The U.S. tracked him for several years before successfully negotiating his release in 2014.

The U.S. does not ""leave our men or women in uniform behind,"" Obama said, regardless of how Bergdahl came to be captured.

Bergdahl has said that he left his post and intended to alert people about problems he perceived within his unit. Investigators said Bergdahl suffered from schizotypal personality disorder when he left his station.

The Army charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy in 2015.

What could have happened?

Bergdahl faced up to five years in prison on the desertion charge. But he could also have been sentenced to life in prison for the misbehavior charge.

Bergdahl elected to be tried by a judge, not a panel of military officers, in August.

What has Trump said?

Trump has been a vocal critic of Bergdahl and the Obama administration’s decision to exchange five prisoners in Guantanamo Bay for his release in May 2014.

BERGDAHL HAD PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER WHEN HE LEFT POST, DOCUMENTS SAY

""We're tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who's a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,"" Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in 2015.

On Twitter, Trump has also said Bergdahl should face the death penalty and repeatedly referred to him as a “traitor.”

Trump’s past comments almost derailed the case against Bergdahl as a judge had to decide if they would prevent him from having a fair trial.

Ultimately, Army Col. Jeffery Nance ruled that he would only consider Trump’s comments as a mitigating factor in Bergdahl’s sentencing – not an aggravating factor.

What happened during the trial?

Bergdahl unexpectedly testified during his sentencing hearing and emotionally apologized to his fellow service members who had been injured as they attempted to rescue him.

""I would like everyone who searched for me to know it was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen,"" he said. ""My words alone can't take away their pain.""

The wife of National Guard Master Sgt. Mark Allen – who is confined to a wheelchair and unable to speak after being shot in the head while searching for Bergdahl – also gave an emotional testimony.

Shannon Allen said her husband is unable to play with their children and “can’t even hold hands anymore.”

“He’s not able to reach out for her or talk to her,” Shannon Allen said of her daughter, who was just an infant when her husband was injured. “He’s never had the chance to really play with her or help coach her sports or ask about her day.”

Richter said FLDS members won't cower no matter what happens at the ballot box.","In a place where political contests are virtually unknown, the campaign signs offer the latest hint that a polygamous group is losing its grip on this remote red rock community straddling the Utah-Arizona border.

""For Hildale mayor vote Donia,"" reads one sign featuring Donia Jessop, a candidate pictured with a contemporary hairstyle and a red business suit.

The signs hanging from fences and walls are unusual because elections here have long been decided behind the scenes by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that has made its home among the rocks for more than a century and hand-picked men to run unopposed.

Just five years ago, Jessop was a member of the group also known as the FLDS. She wore the sect's traditional prairie dresses and her hair in a conservative up-do. Now she is among a swelling number of former members who have returned to buy foreclosed homes, open businesses and try to turn Hildale into a place that resembles a typical Western town, not a cloistered religious community.

The competitive elections scheduled for Tuesday could deal a crushing blow to traditionalists if the 367 registered voters elect Jessop and the non-FLDS candidates for two city council seats. It would be another in a series of recent changes to shake up Hildale and its sister city, Colorado City, Arizona, which have a combined population of nearly 7,800.

The government-ordered evictions of sect families from nearly 150 homes forced many members to seek refuge in trailers around town or in different cities across the West. The town governments and the police are being watched closely by court-appointed monitors after a jury found them guilty of civil rights violations. And a food-stamp fraud case led 10 people to plead guilty and exacerbated a leadership void.

Jessop and other former sect members hail the changes as long-overdue progress that will help the community break free from the reign of sect leader Warren Jeffs, who is serving life in prison in Texas for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.

""The things that were happening in the church were so destructive. And now that destruction can stop, and we can start to rebuild,"" Jessop said. ""This city is completely at a standstill until we change the city government.""

But FLDS members believe the town they built is being destroyed. Norma Richter, a 50-year-old mother of 13 kids, said the changes overtaking the town feel like ""a cultural cleansing,"" echoing a common refrain among church members and sympathizers.

At the heart of the split is Jeffs, who has been jailed in Utah or Texas continually since 2006.

His followers consider him a prophet and believe he was the victim of religious persecution based on fabricated allegations. Former sect members and outsiders consider him a dangerous man who tore apart families and committed sex crimes.

Jeffs is ""a very sick man"" who controls the people through ""fear of not making it to the highest celestial kingdom of glory,"" Jessop said. She notes that it was he and other leaders who set the evictions in motion more than a decade ago when they opted not to challenge in court allegations of mismanagement of the church trust, leading Utah and Arizona governments to take it over.

His supporters are steadfast in their beliefs. Jeffs is ""still is the only man on this earth that can receive revelation from heavenly father for the people,"" FLDS member Lori Barlow said. ""That's a pretty important link to me.""

Authorities say Jeffs still sends some guidance from prison, but Richter says followers have not heard his voice for years and that it's unclear who is in charge of the church locally.

One of Jeffs' brothers, Lyle Jeffs, ran the day-to-day operations until last year, when he was arrested in the food-stamp case. He fled home confinement while awaiting trial and was captured in South Dakota after a year on the run. He faces up to five years in prison.

Amid the leadership void, and with so few people left in town, followers no longer meet for regular worship services, Richter said. Marriages that are arranged by the religion's prophet are on hold until Jeffs returns, Richter said.

Members of the FLDS believe the evictions were accelerated this year to clean out voter rolls and rig the elections to usher in the outside candidates. The evictions stem from an order by a Utah state judge who became fed up with people not paying $100-a-month occupancy fees.

Sect members refused to pay the fees because they believe the money was being used by attorneys overseeing the church trust to take legal action against the FLDS. They also believe the trust should still belong to them.

Across town, many large houses with enough room for plural families stand empty as a community board in charge of the trust works out redistribution of the evicted homes. Others are in disrepair, a result of an edict from Jeffs in the early 2000s, when he ordered a halt to all construction in the Utah-Arizona community to focus on building a compound in Texas.

After seeing so many of her fellow church members evicted, Barlow and her husband want to buy a home but fear they won't find anything suitable in other towns in the region for their five kids and 14 cows.

""Everything I ever needed was here,"" Barlow said. ""The very idea that I'm looking to buy a house somewhere else is shocking to me.""

When authorities recently served an eviction notice at the sect's meetinghouse, Barlow and Richter hugged and cried as they recalled the building's history and all the funerals and services held inside. The trust leaders made a deal to stave off eviction, but it served as more evidence of the sect's waning power.

Other signs of the sect's dwindling presence abound. Public elementary and high schools that reopened several years ago are now bustling with some 500 kids, despite most FLDS families home-schooling their children.

Women and girls in prairie dresses used to be seen all around town — pumping gas, riding horses and chatting. Now they are harder to find. Several new businesses are opening, including a brewery and hotels.

Incumbent Mayor Philip Barlow, a member of the FLDS and lifelong Hildale resident, said people are coping with change by ""doing what they have to do."" He acknowledges that having a challenger is new but says he will accept whatever the voters decide.

Jessop wants to make the town an accepting place for everyone. She said she would love to rekindle fond memories of growing up there with her two mothers and 25 siblings.

""I would love to see families reunited,"" she said. ""I want them to stay. ... They are my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, cousins, uncles. They are my people.""

Jessop left the FLDS four years ago with her husband and 10 kids over unrest about how Jeffs was running the group. She and her husband later brought a ""sister wife"" into the family, and the two women now raise their children and run the family business together.

When she returned, Jessop bought one of the foreclosed houses and reopened a corner gas station as a convenience store. If elected, she would be the town's first female mayor.

Richter said FLDS members won't cower no matter what happens at the ballot box.

""We have a very good man as a leader, but we follow a religion,"" she said. ""They have not conquered us. They can take everything, but they can't conquer our spirit.""",Polygamous group is slowly losing its power in remote town,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/03/power-polygamous-group-wanes-in-tiny-town-among-red-rocks.html

Vice President of the United States Mike Pence spoke with Brian Kilmeade about the latest on the New York City terrorist attack and why the Trump administration has not labeled terrorist Sayfullo Saipov an enemy combatant. Plus, VP Pence explained how the tax reform plan being unveiled today will reduce taxes for all Americans and stated President Trump has been clear about his red line on the corporate tax rate being lowered to 20%.

Listen here for the full interview:

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: And, joining us right now it's our privilege to bring the vice president of the United States. If there's somebody more respect on our Capital Hill or by the president I don't know who it is. Mr. Vice President, welcome back.

MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Brian, it's great to be on the program and congratulations on your book. I can't wait to get through it.

KILMEADE: Thank you very much and I'll definitely get it to you if you're allowed - I can never know what the rules are with politicians. If I can actually send it to you or not. I don't want to get you in trouble.

PENCE: Don't worry, I'll get one on my own. I've read a biography in the past of Andrew Jackson but I'm really looking forward to reading yours.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much. Mr. Vice President, I tell you I know you're as strong on terror as anyone when you were in Congress let alone now. Have we - have your policy now mirroring President Obama's policy of going through the legal system instead of putting him through the military system?

PENCE: Look, well first off let me - let me say as the president has said that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in New York City. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear to support the efforts of the New York City Police Department to follow through on the investigation.

And, we're going to hold this assailant responsible and if there are any more involved we're going to hold them to the very strictest account. This was a barbaric act of terrorism and it will not stand. And, it is in a very real sense, Brian, we believe, of indication of aggressive posture President Trump has taken in taking the fight to ISIS on their soil on our terms.

As you reported very well on this radio program and on the airwaves of Fox and Friends as we speak thanks to U.S. Armed Forces and our allies ISIS is on the run. We have overtaken the so-called capital of their caliphate Raqqa. There's more fighting to be done but Tuesday was a grim reminder --

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: ... that our enemies are still - are still afoot. They're still inspiring violence that threatens our people and I can assure you President Trump and our entire administration, our Armed Forces will not rest, we will not relent until we destroy ISIS at its sore so it can no longer inspire or make possible these kinds of acts of violence.

KILMEADE: But, Mr. Vice President, he said -

PENCE: I would say that very clearly. But so there's nothing - I got to tell you there's nothing about President Trump's policies that mirror the last administration. I mean, ISIS came to life, was literally conjured out of the - out of the desert policies of the last administration -

KILMEADE: But they brought the battle here, Mr. Vice President and we're not treated like that.

PENCE: Well, they did.

KILMEADE: He's a - he say's he's a soldier of the caliphate. As Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""Why are we treating him like a criminal?"" Here is Ed Davis. He said the way the Boston bombers were treated he said this is the call he got after they got the Zarnia brother. The other one was dead. Cut 24.

ED DAVIS: There's a clause in the Patriot Act that takes the process out of the civilian courts into a military style process. So, in the case of (inaudible) I got a call from the United States Attorney who ordered me to give orders to my officers not to read the suspect their rights.

And, they brought a special team in of intelligence and military personnel because they thought that this may be an ongoing plot. So, there is - there is a possibility of doing that in the law.

KILMEADE: Why didn't we do that? This guy - yes go ahead.

PENCE: Well, Brian, the president made it clear that he was open to sending this assailant, this terrorist to Guantanamo. In fact I think he - the president tweeted this morning that he would have loved to send the New York terrorist to Guantanamo but the process takes longer and justice delayed is justice denied.

KILMEADE: But we Mirandize him. He's got a lawyer. Why did we -

PENCE: We want to see - we want to see - and the president has made it clear he believe this is a case where death penalty is warranted, I agree with that in the strongest possible terms. I mean running down innocent civilians, killing eight, injuring more than 11. This was a barbaric terrorist attack and we want to bring this person - we want to bring this person to justice as swiftly as possible. And, that's what informed the president's decision.

KILMEADE: Right. It's just that I want to question more (ph).

PENCE: I really want to take issue, Brian. I mean the truth is as I began to say moments ago, literally the precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq created the vacuum in which ISIS was created -

KILMEADE: Oh, I hear you.

PENCE: Literally overran more than half of Iraq. President Trump came into office and he said we are going to destroy ISIS, we're going to - we're going to allow our military to take the action there, take the fight to terrorists and if anything this vicious terrorist attack in New York is simply a confirmation that in President Trump we have the right leadership.

KILMEADE: Right.

PENCE: We have the right commander-in-chief who's taking the fight to the enemy.

KILMEADE: I just hope - I hope next time we get them, we don't Mirandized him. We hold onto him until our interrogators are - feel as though they understand what - who he's talked to and what he's capable of. I don't think, as much as I respect New York, I don't think they know everything he knows.

And, they - now has a lawyer and he's smiling with an ISIS flag and he's going to start using our legal system. Even though I know he's going to get convicted and maybe killed, I want to know what he knows and I'm not convinced we can do that now. Are you?

PENCE: Well, let me be - let me be - let me be very clear with all of your millions of listeners around the country, we are going to get to the bottom of this terrorist action, who inspired him, who worked with him. There are - there is an aggressive investigation underway. I was briefed again on it this morning.

I was at the CIA yesterday. As I said, your listeners should be confident. We are bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear in support of New York law enforcement. We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to hold him to the strictest and swiftest account and justice.

And, we're going to find if there were any others involved and I can't really speak at this moment about that, if there were any other involved, we will hold them to the strictest account. We're going to bring justice to these people. That's how we protect the American people.

KILMEADE: I want to talk about tax reform, I know you do, too. You're going to - later on you're going to be with Governor Scott in Florida but I also know that you have a - the House is finally ready to unveil tax reform. Can you let our listeners know what we - the takeaways?

PENCE: Well, it's been more than a generation since we've - we've passed the kind of tax cuts and tax reform to really liven the American economy. I mean, john F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan did it, and what really begins today in the House of Representatives, and we believe will - will be completed before the end of this year is going to be a historic tax cut that's going to building on the momentum that we already see in this economy, Brian, it really is remarkable. After eight years, of less than 2 percent economic growth, we just posted the second quarter in a row of over 3 percent growth because of the policies President Trump's been advancing in terms of rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy.

But this tax cut plan, will reduce taxes on individuals, it'll simplify the tax code and it'll lower business taxes in America like the business I'm visiting in Florida, to make it possible for American companies to compete with companies around the world. It is - it is remarkable to think that in the most powerful economy on earth, we have one of the highest business tax rates on the planet.

President Trump is committed to change that, bringing middle class tax relief to working families to simplify the tax code, and the great news for the America people is that all starts today with the introduction of the House tax cut bill.

KILMEADE: Some specifics, if I can. The 20 percent the president spoke about, is that a red line, and is it true that you're considering a phase in of it, a gradual decrease?

PENCE: Well, I think the president - I think the president's made it very clear to members of Congress that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent is absolutely imperative. That puts us in a competitive position, the president - we were talking about going to 15 percent early on, the president made it clear we'll do 20, that's it.

So, people - people, I think, understand hoe firmly the president is committed to that. But the other part of this, don't forget, I grew up in a small business family. My family was in the gas station business, Brian, and - and my family, like - like literally millions of business around the country - my - my folks filed their taxes as individuals, that was business income. And we're going to make sure that we also lower the taxes on people that are reporting large incomes that are business income, we're going to lower that to 25 percent.

I mean, if you look back at 1980's, the majority of jobs that were created, the last time we - we passed historic tax relief, were created in small business America. I'm just saying (ph), 20 percent on big corporations, so called, C-corporations, but we're going to go to 25 percent on - on so called past through small businesses. And - and the combination of this, we - we think - we think the combination of this, it's going to be hard to calculate how - how much the American economy is - is - is going to rally around the tax cuts that we're going to fight to get on the president's desk before Christmas.

KILMEADE: Right, and I know you've got to run, you've got to do another interview, but I understand, Steve Scalise told us today, that it's going - the top bracket is going to stay at 39.5 percent. Would you actually say that too?

PENCE: Well, we'll - I know the House of representatives is going to be unveiling heir plan today, President Trump has made it clear that he wants to focus this tax relief on middle class Americans and on job creators and businesses across this country. And we think that what House Republicans unveil today is a great start in that direction, we're grateful for the leadership of Speaker Ryan, of Chairman Kevin Brady and all those that have been working tirelessly with the administration. The Senate will be moving very quickly on their version of the bill and in the weeks ahead, we're literally going to fight everyday to give the American people the kind of tax cuts and tax reform that will make the American economy great again.

KILMEADE: Mr. Vice President, thanks so much for putting us on your schedule, always appreciate it and you say they're going to get it done before the year's end, that will make a lot of people happy. Thanks so much.

President Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday, revealing his thoughts on this week’s terror attack in New York City and the campaign actions of the Democratic National Committee.

Trump also responded to recent revelations that the DNC — along with the Clinton campaign — funded the now-infamous “opposition research” dossier released last January. The president called the findings “absolutely inconceivable.”

“That dossier, which is totally fake and made up it’s like a novel … is a disgrace and it should not have been allowed to be used and then I hear the kind of money they spent,” Trump said, referring to reports Democrats paid as much as $9 million on it. “I think it’s a disgrace that a thing like that can take place.”","'Ingraham Angle' Exclusive: Trump Calls DNC Primary-Rigging 'Illegal,' Slams 'Fake' Dossier",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/ingraham-angle-exclusive-trump-calls-dnc-primary-rigging-illegal-slams-fake-dossier#commenting

When the first daughter arrived in Japan on Thursday, she was greeted by dozens of black suit-wearing female bodyguards from Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department.

“Women have to work more than twice as much to compete against men, but she has led her father’s business successfully while raising kids,” one women told The Japan Times in January.

With all the attention being lavished on Ivanka – at least four television stations in Japan live-broadcast her arrival at Tokyo’s airport – the security team is there for more than just looks. During a training drill for the media earlier this week, the security team quickly pounced on a woman who broke free from a crowd near the Imperial Palace Gardens in central Tokyo in a mock attempt to bring a present to a certain “VIP.”

Ivanka is in Japan to speak at the World Assembly for Women conference in Tokyo in advance of her father's arrival Sunday.

Speaking Friday, Ivanka addressed her trademark issues of female entrepreneurship and women’s economic advancement, while also praising Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ‘Womenomics’ agenda that aims to get more women in the workplace.

The U.S. president's daughter also addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women in Hollywood and other industries in the United States.

""All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,"" she said. ""This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.”

While the policies of President Trump – who left Friday on his own trip to Asia – have made Ivanka’s fashion line one of the most negatively perceived brands in the U.S. (a recent YouGov survey ranked it one of the bottom 10 brands in the U.S. by consumer perception out of 1,600 companies), there is a much different perception of her in Japan, China and other Asian nations.

Sales of her fashion line have skyrocketed in Japan and China over the last year and dozens of Chinese businesses have filed for trademarks to use Ivanka’s name to sell everything from wallpaper to alcohol.

“Honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Trump told reporters minutes before heading out on a 13-day trip to Asia.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. On Monday, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his dealings with Russians reportedly offering “dirt” on Clinton.

The White House has repeatedly sought to turn the attention of the probe, which is looking into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, to Clinton and her campaign.

Earlier Friday, Trump said the American public ""deserves"" a federal investigation of Clinton and the DNC over a joint fundraising agreement they signed in August 2015.

Trump's accusations follow publication by Politico of an excerpt from former acting DNC Chair Donna Brazile's upcoming book. Brazile alleges she found ""proof"" that the 2016 Democratic primary was rigged in Clinton's favor. Brazile writes that she believes no laws were violated, but that a fundraising agreement ""looked unethical.""

The president tweeted, over a 3 1/2-hour span Friday:

--""Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..""

--""New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...""

--""People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!""

--""The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!""

--""Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept."" (He meant Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., whom he has disparaged as ""Pocahontas"" because she has mentioned having American Indian heritage.)

--""Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!""

--""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.""

-- “The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!”

Late Thursday, Trump tweeted without evidence that he believed Democrats had acted ""illegally.""

The fundraising agreement Brazile wrote about, which was signed in August 2015 during the primary process, allegedly gave the Clinton campaign oversight of some DNC decisions. Months later, Clinton's chief challenger, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, signed his own agreement with the party.

Previous research suggested the T-Rex was more of a sensitive lover than you might think.","The Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the scariest killers in the history of Planet Earth.

But its fearsome image was undermined a little by the ridiculousness of its puny arms, which were among the smallest of all dinosaurs when considered proportionally against the size of its body.

Now one scientists has claimed the tiny arms were actually ""vicious weapons"" equipped with four-inch claws which would have allowed it to eviscerate its unfortunate prey.

Steven Stanley, a palaeontologist working at the University of Hawaii, gave a presentation to The Geological Society of America last week in which he claimed nature equipped the monster with ""formidable weaponry"".

The research flies in the face of previous suggestions that the T-Rex was a lover as well as a fighter, which used its little arms to clasp its partner close during sex.

“Its short, strong forelimbs and large claws would have permitted T-Rex, whether mounted on a victim’s back or grasping it with its jaws, to inflict four gashes a metre or more long and several centimetres deep within a few seconds,” said Stanley, according to New Scientist.

“And it could have repeated this multiple times in rapid succession.”

Other scientists have cast doubt on these claims, with Jakob Vinther, a paleobiologist from the University of Bristol, suggesting Stanley's argument was ""illogical"".

The T-Rex's stubby extremities were just three feet long, meaning it would have needed to get extremely close to its victims if it wanted to rend them limb from limb.

And the arms really were used for lovemaking, the claws would hardly have made the encounter very comfortable.

Previous research suggested the T-Rex was more of a sensitive lover than you might think.

The terrifying meat-eater, which stood 20 feet tall and had jaws bristling with serrated teeth up to nine inches long, was believed to have had a snout as sensitive to touch as human fingertips.

A team of researchers suggested two rexy beasts would rub their noses together during foreplay, before getting down to the monstrous act of physical love.

[It] impacts their emotional well-being.”For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash.
And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Remember to also …

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Keep a copy of your inventory offsite. Use a safe-deposit box or an online cloud-based storage system to keep your home inventory and all supporting documents secure.",How to create a home inventory to be organized and prepared for emergencies,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/how-to-create-home-inventory-to-be-organized-and-prepared-for-emergencies.html

Bowe Bergdahl has become a factor in the soldier's sentencing as a military judge weighs the president's impact on public perception of military justice.

Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, the judge deciding Bergdahl's punishment for walking off his post, heard defense arguments Monday that Trump recently reaffirmed his scathing criticism and is preventing a fair sentencing hearing.

While campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a ""traitor"" who deserved harsh punishment such as being shot. Nance previously ruled those comments were ""disturbing"" but didn't amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump became commander in chief.

But last week Trump addressed his past comments when asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn't say anything more about the case, ""but I think people have heard my comments in the past."" That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views now that he commands the military.

Prosecutors argued Trump's comments didn't reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter.

Nance said he was having a ""hard time"" with prosecutors' interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider.

Nance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: ""I shouldn't comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.""

Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison after pleading guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Nance allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump's comments, and responded that he would be fair.

""I don't have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,"" Nance said.

Former Army lawyer Eric Carpenter said the judge has to worry not only about whether Trump has directly influenced the case, but also what the public thinks under a military justice concept called apparent unlawful command influence. Nance's remarks Monday should resolve the question of whether Trump directly swayed the court, but the judge could still make concessions to the defense to address these concerns, Carpenter said.

""It gives you a clue that he's concerned about public appearance, and he can grant pretty significant remedies just to preserve the public's faith in the system,"" said Carpenter, who teaches law at Florida International University.

Carpenter doubts the judge would dismiss the case outright, but said Nance could limit Bergdahl's punishment because of Trump.

The White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be ""resolved on its own facts."" White House representatives didn't respond to an email seeking comment Monday.

Bergahl's sentencing, set to begin Monday, has been delayed until Wednesday because one of the defense attorneys wasn't available until then, the judge said.

Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected.

Nance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him.

Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured soon after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times before President Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

After all, there is a legitimate role within our government for the empowerment of local, faith-based solutions.
There is no doubt that President Trump feels strongly about ending the opioid epidemic.
We know that President Trump is – rightly – critical of the swamp, and that he doesn’t shy away from upsetting his opponents on the left.
When it comes to the opioid crisis, he should partner with those on higher, drier land: states, communities, and those helping their brothers and sisters rise above despair through faith.","The opioid crisis is characterized by despair – for those caught in the grip of addiction, for their loved ones, and for those who want to solve what President Trump has now officially deemed a public health emergency.

For many Americans, an effective antidote to despair is faith and community. It’s a shame that President Trump’s announcement last week on the opioid crisis did not include this essential component.

After all, there is a legitimate role within our government for the empowerment of local, faith-based solutions. As the leader of a culturally divided and spiritually struggling nation, the president should acknowledge and leverage the power and importance of community and faith-based solutions for addicts and others in despair.

After President Trump’s passionate and personal speech last week, Fox News Host Dana Perino remembered the way her former boss, President George W. Bush, described his own commitment to local, faith-based solutions. “He used to say that government cannot heal a heart,” Perino recalled.

Indeed, the White House Faith-Based & Community Initiative, established by President Bush in 2001, successfully channeled federal funds to the organizations that were most effective in the nation’s social service network.

President Bush knew that faith-based groups and institutions are frequently best positioned to help Americans in need. His administration enabled those groups to compete for federal dollars on an even playing field. This change in the way the federal government addressed social challenges enabled more hearts to be healed.

There is no doubt that President Trump feels strongly about ending the opioid epidemic. His compassion for those affected is apparent, and his own experience as the brother of an alcoholic brings a deeply personal element to his dedication.

The president would do well to bring that personal element more deeply into his list of opioid crisis solutions by involving those who can impact the lives of individuals when it comes to addiction.

Federal initiatives for the development of non-addictive pain medication or the regulation of certain types of pharmaceuticals are interesting tactics, but none get to the heart of the matter in the way that only community and faith-based programs – and, frankly, a higher power – are able to do.

Put another way: Is Washington going to heal the hearts of the opioid crisis? Can the swamp adequately address an epidemic wrapped in despair?

These questions remain to be answered, but I do know this: The federal government often does its best work when it returns power and resources where they belong – to states, localities, communities and neighborhoods.

In a perfect world, the money would never go to Washington in the first place, but its return to a place closer to the people can be appreciated by anyone – including the president – who believes the federal government has grown too large, too powerful, too arrogant and too distant from the people it is supposed to serve.

President Bush’s faith-based emphasis made many non-believers uncomfortable. He endured cries about the separation of church and state in order to leverage the unique ability of local and faith-based programs to help those in need. I believe he did the right thing and that his initiatives were an admirable acknowledgement that Washington can’t solve every problem.

We know that President Trump is – rightly – critical of the swamp, and that he doesn’t shy away from upsetting his opponents on the left.

It was Palm Sunday, April 4, 2004. The U.S. military calls it ""Black Sunday."" A small platoon of soldiers with the 1st Cavalry Division out of Fort Hood, Texas, was ambushed in the Baghdad suburb of Sadr City. The soldiers, many of them young and inexperienced, were on a peacekeeping mission and weren't expected to face heavy combat. And while concerned about the Iraq deployment, their families back home also hadn't anticipated their loved ones would find themselves in mortal danger.

Based on the New York Times bestseller by ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz, the eight part mini-series tells the story of the ambush and the three heroic rescue missions launched to save the platoon. It also focuses on the home front, as wives and mothers waited anxiously for word and drew support from one another.

Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the companies behind ""House of Cards,"" claim they had no reports of any widespread misconduct.
""On Tuesday, in collaboration with MRC, we suspended production, knowing that Kevin Spacey wasn’t scheduled to work until Wednesday.
Netflix is not aware of any other incidents involving Kevin Spacey on-set,” the company said.
Other members of the production crew told the outlet that they witnessed Spacey be inappropriate with many younger male members of the staff.","The allegations against “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey continue to mount as eight crew members reportedly have come forward to detail allegations of sexual harassment and groping on the set of the popular Netflix drama.

On Thursday, CNN reported that eight people close to the production of the series, which shoots just outside of Baltimore, Maryland, have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct from the 58-year-old star that made working on the set an alleged nightmare.

All eight accusers have chosen to remain anonymous, but claim that the behavior was very well known on set and that it created a difficult work environment. Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the companies behind ""House of Cards,"" claim they had no reports of any widespread misconduct.

“When the allegations broke about Kevin Spacey on Sunday night, in conjunction with MRC, we sent a representative to set on Monday morning,"" Netflix told Fox News in a statement.

""Netflix was just made aware of one incident, five years ago, that we were informed was resolved swiftly,"" it continued. ""On Tuesday, in collaboration with MRC, we suspended production, knowing that Kevin Spacey wasn’t scheduled to work until Wednesday. Netflix is not aware of any other incidents involving Kevin Spacey on-set,” the company said.

“We continue to collaborate with MRC and other production partners to maintain a safe and respectful working environment. We will continue to work with MRC during this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the production, and have nothing further to share at this time.”

The report cites a production assistant who details that he had to drive Spacey to set one day and the two-time Academy Award-winning actor reached into his pants in a nonconsensual manner. He said he didn’t disclose the details of what happened next for fear of being identified, but said that when they got to the set, he was asked to help bring things to the actor’s trailer.

The production assistant then alleges that Spacey cornered him, blocked his ability to exit and made “inappropriate contact” with him.

The incident allegedly happened months after the same production assistant had complained that Spacey was harassing him. His supervisor’s solution was to make sure they never were alone. The harassment stopped, making him feel comfortable enough to drive Spacey on the day in question.

Other members of the production crew told the outlet that they witnessed Spacey be inappropriate with many younger male members of the staff. It was typically done out in the open, in full view of others.

They allege that most on set were aware of Spacey’s behavior, and that it was well-known among the crew. However, Netflix and MRC maintain they were not made aware of any serial behavior on the part of Spacey.

“We are deeply troubled to learn about these new allegations that are being made to the press concerning Kevin Spacey’s interaction with members of the crew of ‘House of Cards,'"" MRC said in a statement provided to Fox News.

""As the producer of the show, creating and maintaining a safe working environment for our cast and crew has always been our top priority. We have consistently reinforced the importance of employees reporting any incident without fear of retaliation and we have investigated and taken appropriate actions following any complaints,"" MRC said.

""For example, during our first year of production in 2012, someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey. Immediate action was taken following our review of the situation and we are confident the issue was resolved promptly to the satisfaction of all involved,"" the statement reads.

""Mr. Spacey willingly participated in a training process and since that time MRC has not been made aware of any other complaints involving Mr. Spacey.”

MRC also noted that, in the wake of the new allegations it has set up an anonymous hotline where crisis counselors and sexual harassment advisors will help any crew members that come forward with complaints about anyone on the set.

The allegations come days after actor Anthony Rapp revealed to Buzzfeed News that Spacey had made a sexual advance on him when he was 14, and Spacey was 26. Since then, several other men have come forward with similar stories about the star, prompting Netflix to suspend production on season six of “House of Cards.” Meanwhile, Spacey has announced that he will seek an undisclosed treatment during the hiatus.

Additionally, Deadline reports that the talent agency that's repped Spacey for eight years, CAA, has dropped him.

“I think it’s important for us to try to make the workplace and beyond not only comfortable and right and fair and appropriate, but productive as well,” he said. “I think a lot of what we’re dealing with within this issue is hurting our business. It’s making it less productive.”

In light of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, as well as director James Toback and actors Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Spacey, Baldwin admitted to hearing about the misconduct previously.

“I knew of certain things, that there were rumors of things happening to people, but I didn’t necessarily know the scope, when you hear the hundreds and hundreds of women who are complaining about this,” Baldwin said. “It’s been a very eye-opening experience for me personally.

Why? SpeedKore built this tastefully modified 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 302 with Downey Jr.'s guidance along the way.

The company took to this week's 2017 SEMA show to debut the classic muscle car, and it says the actor provided insight and helped move the process along through the entire build. The exterior design remains faithful to the original design with a set of HRE wheels the most notable update, but underneath, things are very modern.

SpeedKore fitted carbon fiber body panels in place for the hood, fenders, bumpers, deck lid, deep chin spoiler, quarter extensions, and valence to keep the Boss' weight to a minimum. Additionally, there's a Detroit Speed aluminum frame and suspension which modernize the Mustang and also help with its equally modern powertrain.

Under the hood sits a Ford Performance Aluminator 5.0-liter V-8 with a Stage 2 Ford Performance/Roush supercharger. The undisclosed horsepower is then routed to the rear wheels via a Bowler T56 transmission and 9-inch Ford rear differential.

Inside, SpeedKore worked its magic, too. Custom touches such as brown leather, a one-off steering wheel, and Vintage Air air conditioning system reside inside. It all comes together with contrasting materials on the seats, panels, and dashboard.

Mexican drug cartels are behind increases in the cost of avocados exported to the U.S., shaking down avocado farmers who are reeling from years of weak harvests, the country's attorney general said.

Mexican newspaper Reforma reported this week greedy organized crime cells obtained agriculture ministry records of avocado producers in the early 1990s and have used the data to track down farmers. They force them to pay a percentage of their earnings or risk kidnapping or death.

“This was a system of intelligence that involved reviewing records from the agriculture ministry to know who the farmers with ample avocado production were, where their orchards were located, and how much they reported their sales by export,” the attorney general’s report said.

It continued: “The avocado producers were imposed a quota and those that resisted, or the families of those, were kidnapped or murdered as pressure until they ceded.”

According to Reforma, the whole scheme was started by the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel and Los Cuinis – a criminal group led by Abigael Gonzalez Valencia. The group was once called the richest cartel in Mexico, and the avocado scheme was seen as an alternative form of income to trafficking.

Eventually other drug cartels, such as the Knights Templar and the Michoacana Family began, copying the strategy, Reforma reported.

“The avocado producers were imposed a quota and those that resisted, or the families of those, were kidnapped or murdered as pressure until they ceded.” - Mexican attorney general report

The practice quickly became profitable for cartels, who charged upwards of $100 per hectare and 10 cents per pounds of avocado sold, Being Latino reported. The farmers had to sell their produce at a higher price to make ends meet.

The increased consumption of avocado in the United States over the past five years has been a boon for the industry.

Americans ate 1.9 billion avocados last year, up 57 percent from five years ago, according to the Hass Avocado Board, an industry trade group.

Mexico supplies approximately 82 percent of the avocados eaten north of border, with domestic producers in California making up the rest, Bloomberg reported.

The USDA reported that Mexican avocado exports have gone up 400 percent since 2005, resulting in more than $2.2 billion in profits last year.

The average price of avocados in September rose to $1.56, up from 89 cents at the beginning of the year.","Mexican cartels extorting avocado producers raises price of guacamole, report says",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/03/mexican-cartels-extorting-avocado-producers-raises-price-guacamole-report-says.html

The '80s star said the man who attacked him when he was 14 years old is named Jon Grissom, an actor who had bit parts in some of Feldman's films including ""License to Drive"" (1988) and ""Dream a Little Dream"" (1989). He is listed as John Grissom in his IMDB account. His full name is Cloyd Jon Grissom.

Prior to the singer's revelation on the talk show, Feldman wrote about the alleged pedophile in his 2014 autobiography, ""Coreyography: A Memoir,"" identifying Grissom by a false name, Ron Crimson, as advised by his lawyers at the time.

However, Grissom, who has been suspected by some on social media for several years, addressed speculation that he was Feldman's predator.

Grissom presently lives in Mexico. He is 55 years old and is a convicted sex offender with his conviction dating back to 2003.

Feldman warned Hollywood pedophiles issuing a message, ""Now is your time. Be a man for the first time and come forward yourself. Turn yourself in. Let it be known... If you do not we’re coming for you.""

The 46-year-old told Dr. Oz he informed the Santa Barbara Police Department in 1993 the names of attackers in Hollywood.

Kelly Hoover, public information officer for Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, told Fox News, ""We are aware of the statements that Mr. Feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. Our records do not indicate that he named any suspects. If he has any information regarding a crime or crimes that occurred, we encourage him to contact our office or his local law enforcement agency.""

Feldman instead called the Los Angeles Police Department while on Dr. Oz with the intention of naming alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. The call was not allowed to be recorded for confidentiality reasons, but the actor claimed he would cooperate with any investigations going foward.

Feldman and Grissom did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Following the Dr. Oz appearance, some social media users falsely identified a man sharing the name John Grissom as Feldman's alleged predator. He wrote on Facebook about the identity confusion.

Brazile admitted that Hillary Clinton's campaign gained significant control over the Democratic National Committee's finances and strategy in exchange for helping the party wipe out 2012 presidential campaign debt. In laymen’s terms, Brazile explains how the party rigged the primary for Clinton to defeat Bernie Sanders through shady financial deals – which would typically be major news.

An excerpt from her new book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” was published by Politico at 5 a.m. ET on Thursday morning – over 12 hours before the big three networks air their newscasts.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren even appeared on CNN at roughly 4:40 p.m. ET to discuss the scandal but ABC’s “World News Tonight,” CBS’s “Evening News” and “NBC Nightly News” skipped it completely. These programs start at 6:30 p.m. ET.

On Thursday, after CNN and Fox News both covered the Brazile claims, CBS opened with details on the deadly ambush in Niger, while NBC and ABC both opened with the proposed tax cut.

The winner of the 2016 presidential race took notice.

“The Donna Brazile story is astonishing. The media loves to tell stories of Republican discord. Here's the woman who was the interim head of the DNC saying Bernie Sanders got screwed by the party and Team Clinton. No matter how much the media wants to hide that, it's a huge issue and will impact future elections,” Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.

Brazile took over as interim party chairperson in July 2016 when the DNC was plagued by email scandals and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. was ousted on the eve of the party’s 2016 convention. Brazile, who resigned from her role as a CNN contributor after she was accused of leaking questions to Clinton ahead of a CNN Town Hall event, doesn’t exactly have the nicest things to say about her DNC predecessor in the book.

“Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party -- she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was,” Brazile wrote. “Obama left the party $24 million in debt—$15 million in bank debt and more than $8 million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign—and had been paying that off very slowly.”

8 p.m.

A Somali security official says a suspected U.S. airstrike has targeted a base run by Islamic State group-affiliated fighters in Somalia's northern state of Puntland.

The official told The Associated Press that at least six missiles struck in Buqa, a remote mountainous village roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Qandala town, late Thursday.

The official says the airstrike may have targeted top leaders of the group, which is a growing presence in the Horn of Africa nation and has been fighting security forces. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Qandala Mayor Jama Mohamed confirms the airstrike, which he said sent terrified villagers fleeing.

While the iPhone discrete calling is a good idea, it may add to the confusion.","An iPhone 8 Plus I’m testing has called 911 by accident a few times. It’s annoying, but it turns out this new iOS “feature” could save lives. Experts say discrete calling is a sign of things to come in making 911 calls work a little better and a little safer, especially in a tense situation.

Apple introduced the feature in iOS 11 recently, and on the new iPhone 8.

It’s still a work in progress, however.

iPHONE X HITS STORES, APPLE NEARS $1 TRILLION MARKET CAP

The “feature” lets you call 911 by pressing the power button and either volume button at the same time. For example, if you’ve been kidnapped or you’re in a hostage situation, you can press the two buttons without having to open the dialer and press 9-1-1.

It does not like cup-holders, though. Placing the wider iPhone 8 Plus in the holder -- which is what many people do when they drive -- has triggered a 911 call at least five times.

To test the theory, I used the iPhone 8 Plus in the cup holders of a Dodge Durango and a smaller VW Tiguan, but the buttons activated by accident in both cars.

IPHONE X REVIEW ROUNDUP: SHOULD YOU BUY?

Fortunately, there’s a way to disable discrete calling in the iPhone settings. And, you can activate a countdown and a siren that plays before you actually place the call. Just head to the Emergency SOS section and enable the features you want to use.

Apple iPhone expert Konstantin Makarov, the Chief Operating Officer at IGotOffer.com, a marketplace for selling gadgets, says the alarm sound is both good and bad. It can prevent 911 calling mistakes, but also means you can’t make the call discreetly.

“If you do accidentally call 911, don't hang up,” Makarov said. “Stay on the line and let 911 operators know that it was an accidental call. If you hang up, they may think it is an emergency and track the location of the call to send help or call back to verify the emergency.”

MORE THAN 300 IPHONE Xs STOLEN FROM DELIVERY TRUCK, POLICE SAY

911 calls can be costly in some states. In California, making repeated 911 calls by accident can cost about $200 each infraction, he says. In Michigan, charges are much higher if anyone is injured while responding to the 911 call -- there can be a $50,000 fine, he says.

Tech expert and analyst Rob Enderle says discreet calling and other 911-related features are helpful, especially since you can place the call even when the phone is in your pocket or purse. He questioned whether Apple has advertised this feature enough. And, making the calls by mistake is a bigger problem than most people realize.

“About 40 percent of the calls to 911 are mistakes made from cellphones,” he said. “That’s around four million calls a year and at $8,000 each.” Fortunately, he says, most fees are waived.

APPLE FACE ID: TECH PROFESSIONALS UNSURE ABOUT SECURITY BENEFITS, RESEARCH SAYS

Security expert Henderson Cooper says 911 calling does have other issues. One is coverage. He says it is frustrating for those in an a life-threatening situation, even after all of these years and with technology improving at such a rapid pace, that you can still hear a recording.

The network has announced the premiere date of “Gunpowder,” starring Kit Harington.

In partnership with BBC One, HBO will debut the three-part thriller based on the events in the 17th century that led to Guy Fawkes Day. In addition to starring, Harington will co-executive produce the show.

The reason the star is taking such a commanding role in this project is simple: it’s a family thing.

The star is a descendant of Robert Catesby, the central figure of the series and mastermind behind the infamously foiled gunpowder plot. He’s also who the Jon Snow actor will be playing.

“We are delighted to offer a platform for a project that is so close to Kit Harington’s heart,” Kary Antholis, president of HBO Miniseries and CINEMAX Programming said in a statement. “Kit’s passion for and belief in ‘Gunpowder’ are evident in every frame of the miniseries.”

Catesby was a driving force behind the 1605 plot in London to kill James I. The series will depict a time when Catholics were persecuted by Protestant England. Catesby’s refusal to abandon his religion brings him “to the edge of financial, social and psychological ruin” as he navigates a shadow game involving spies and a government dedicated to hunting him, his family and priests down to torture and kill them.

For example, drones capturing footage of the recent California wildfires were hindering firefighters’ efforts, according to officials.
Drones are being used to help ground crews monitor wildfire activity, and firefighters in New York have also used drones for fire monitoring.","U.S. wildfires have left a trail of devastation behind them in recent months. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, from Jan. 1 through Oct. 6, 2017 there were 50, 283 wildfires in the United States– up from 46,618 last year. Acres lost numbered about 3.7 million more than 2016 as well, with 8.5 million acres of forestland going up in smoke. It’s not just a problem in the US–wildfire numbers are going up worldwide, and it’s only going to get worse.

“As air temperatures continue to increase over time, there will be more days during which wildfires can be ignited and burn, so there will be more fires,” Research Forester David L. Peterson told Fox News. “More extreme temperatures will allow some fires to burn more intensely and spread faster, making them more difficult to suppress.”

Now, U.K.–based startup BioCarbon Engineering hopes to reverse some of the damage with drone technology. Reportedly, their drones can plant up to 100,000 trees in one day.

SILICON VALLEY HISTORY LOST: ARCHIVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT BELONGED TO HP FOUNDERS DESTROYED IN WILDFIRE

“The current state-of-the-art is the hand–planting of saplings,” former NASA engineer and BioCarbon CEO Lauren Fletcher said. “The goal of our technology is to make the current planters more effective at what they do.”

According to Fletcher, his drones can plant trees 60 times faster than hand-planting. First, a group of drones perform a 3D aerial survey of the land for topography and soil quality data. After a seeding pattern is planned, the drones are loaded with seed pods. These pods are pressurized canisters that burst upon impact and are filled with germinated seeds soaked in a nutrient–rich gel. The drones then set out over the mapped terrain, hovering up to 6 feet and firing their pods (about ten per minute) into the ground. The seedlings are then monitored for growth.

“We have designed our system so that two pilots will run multiple drones simultaneously, allowing for a daily planting rate of 100,000 trees per day,” Fletcher told Fox News. “Just 60 teams will allow us to plant 1 billion trees a year, with the potential to scale to 10's of billions of trees every year.”

DRONES CAPTURES CAPSIZING BOAT AND FLORIDA TEEN'S DARING RESCUE

Another advantage drones have over human planters is that they’re able to plant in difficult-to-reach areas, such as mountainsides or mangroves.

BioCarbon is currently looking to have its drones replanting forests in the U.S. by April 2018 at the latest, just in time for the spring planting season. The startup hopes to replant in areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina as well as out west where forests have been decimated by bark beetle infestations and wildfires.

“The next phase for us is to continue to work in larger scale and to upgrade the designs to make them more automated so that we can start distributing this technology to those people who are already planting trees,” Fletcher said. “The key to success is empowering governments and local communities with this emerging technology.”

DRONES FLYING OVER CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HURT FIREFIGHING EFFORTS, OFFICIALS SAY

Drones, however, can pose challenges in emergency situations if their operators are not part of the emergency recovery effort. For example, drones capturing footage of the recent California wildfires were hindering firefighters’ efforts, according to officials.

The technology, however, can be a great asset if it is in the right hands. Drones are being used to help ground crews monitor wildfire activity, and firefighters in New York have also used drones for fire monitoring. With technology advancing quickly, who knows what the future holds? For example, a prototype drone that will harness foam to fight fires recently went on display in Dubai.

“Whether it’s seeding or firefighting or wildlife management or insect/disease scouting, the large land areas that must be managed means that drones will play an ever greater role in such forestry operations,” Dr. Daniel Schmoldt, an expert on high-tech applications in natural resources, told Fox News. “As autonomy-enabling technologies advance, flight times increase, and government regulations fully enable drone deployment, especially smart and autonomous ones, drones will be a game-changer for forest and environmental management.”",Forests lost in wildfires could be replanted by drones,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/11/03/forests-lost-in-wildfires-could-be-replanted-by-drones.html

As President Donald Trump set off on his first official visit to Asia, including regional summits to be attended by Myanmar, both the House and Senate introduced legislation to prohibit U.S. military assistance to the Southeast Asian nation. The bills also seek financial and visa restrictions on military and other security force officials implicated in human rights abuses.

Nearly 60 activist groups, including Human Rights Watch, chimed in Friday, supporting targeted sanctions against military officials they say perpetrated crimes against humanity in the crackdown that has burned hundreds of Rohingya villages and forced more than 600,000 refugees to flee to Bangladesh since late August.

""Refugees have provided first-hand accounts of unfathomable brutality: soldiers burning infants alive, gang-raping women, shooting villagers fleeing their homes - violations that research by non-governmental organizations has found to be widespread and systematic,"" the groups said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

The State Department has already imposed additional restrictions on existing, low-level military ties, and says it is considering sanctions. Tillerson, who is set to visit Myanmar on Nov. 15, is also considering a recommendation from officials to declare that ""ethnic cleansing"" has taken place — an allegation endorsed by senior U.N. officials but denied by Myanmar authorities.

While it remains uncertain whether the U.S. legislation, introduced in both houses of Congress on Thursday, will become law, it reflects a dramatic, bipartisan shift in sentiment in Washington within a year. Widespread support for easing restrictions to reward the Myanmar military for loosening its five-decade grip on power has been replaced by growing appetite to slap back sanctions.

""It's time to re-impose targeted sanctions against the senior military officials responsible for this brutality to send a clear message: This violence must stop, perpetrators must be held accountable, and there must be meaningful civilian control over Burma's military and security forces."" said Rep.

Bowe Bergdahl will likely continue Tuesday as the deserter's defense team questions officials who treated and debriefed the soldier following his brutal five years of captivity by Taliban allies.

The defense presentation began Monday in North Carolina with Bergdahl himself describing his experience in enemy hands. And that served as a dramatic counterpoint to the emotional testimony of the final prosecution witness, Shannon Allen, whose husband is unable to speak and needs help with everyday tasks after being shot in the head while searching for Bergdahl in Afghanistan.

Georgia National Guard Master Sgt. Mark Allen's daughter is now 9 years old, and ""he's never had the chance to really play with her,"" she said.

Bergdahl, who faces up to life in prison for endangering his comrades after pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, told the judge he didn't mean to cause harm when he walked off his post in 2009.

He spoke for two hours, apologizing to those wounded searching for him, and describing his captivity and the challenges he still faces with daily life.

Asked by a defense attorney what the worst part was, he said it wasn't the beatings: ""The worst was the constant, just the constant deterioration of everything. The constant pain from my body falling apart. The constant screams from my mind,"" he said, haltingly.

""It was the years of waiting to see whether or not the next time someone opens the door if that would be the person coming to execute you.""

He described brutal conditions, including beatings with copper wire and unending bouts of gastrointestinal problems brought on by squalid conditions. He was kept in a cage for four out of the five years after several escape attempts, his muscles atrophying to the point he could barely stand or walk.

Bergdahl said he still has nightmares that make it hard to sleep more than five hours. He checks his door at least three times to make sure it's secure each night and sleeps with a flashlight nearby. He wakes up sometimes not remembering that he's back in the U.S., he said, and has daytime flashbacks to captivity arising from unpredictable triggers.

Because Bergdahl's words in court were an unsworn statement, prosecutors won't be given the chance to cross-examine him.

The 31-year-old soldier from Hailey, Idaho, was brought home by President Barack Obama in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

Earlier Monday, the judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, ruled that Donald Trump's scathing criticism of Bergdahl — made first as a candidate and reaffirmed as commander-in-chief — won't prevent the soldier from receiving a fair sentence. Nance also said that a reasonable member of the public would not have doubts about the fairness of military justice because of Trump's comments.

He rejected a defense request to rule that it would be unfair to give Bergdahl any prison time. The judge did say, however, that he would consider Trump's comments as a mitigating factor, not an aggravating factor, in the sentencing. Other mitigating and aggravating factors that he could consider include Bergdahl's mental health and serious wounds to service members who searched for him.

The hearing is expected to last several more days. Defense attorneys told the judge that one of the next witnesses they plan to call is an official who debriefed Bergdahl from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which works with captive service members. The official testified in 2015 that Bergdahl was ""skin over bones"" and had been subjected to worse conditions than any American prisoner of war since the Vietnam War.

“Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” de la Huerta told the outlet.
The investigation into Weinstein is ongoing and no charges have been filed against him so far.","Actress Paz de la Huerta is the latest person to come forward with allegations that she was raped by Harvey Weinstein. However, what separates her from the almost 60 other women who have come forward is the fact that the NYPD may be able to bring up charges against the disgraced Hollywood mogul in her case.

The former “Boardwalk Empire” star claims Weinstein raped her on two occasions in 2010 in New York City. Because this happened after 2006, it falls within the statute of limitations for the NYPD to both investigate and, potentially, prosecute. Through a representative, Weinstein has routinely denied any and all claims of non-consensual sex.

“A senior sex crimes prosecutor is assigned to this investigation, and the Office has been working with our partners in the NYPD since the new allegations came to light,"" a statement provided to CBS News from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office read. ""As this is an active investigation, we will not be commenting further.""

As previously reported, the NYPD, LAPD and police in London have all opened investigations into the allegations against Harvey Weinstein following two exposes into his misconduct as well as a litany of women coming forward with claims of harassment and assault.

Speaking to Vanity Fair, de la Huerta detailed her experience with Weinstein when she was 26. He allegedly offered her a ride home and, upon arriving, insisted he come inside.

“Immediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,” de la Huerta told the outlet. “Then he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid... It wasn’t consensual... It happened very quickly... He stuck himself inside me... When he was done he said he’d be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.”

In December of the same year, she alleges that Weinstein showed up at the lobby of her apartment building. She was reportedly intoxicated at the time but was frightened by Weinstein, who she says had been calling her despite her requests for him to stop. She says that, although she said protested, she found herself in her apartment with Weinstein, who allegedly raped her a second time. When it was over, she recalls thinking that Weinstein knew he’d done something bad. He reportedly offered to put her in a play, but she never heard from him again.

Fox example, a signature piece of legislation signed by President Reagan that saved Social Security in 1983 was the direct result of the recommendations of his National Commission on Social Security Reform.
At least 75 percent of U.S. employers have adopted an E-Verify type approach to dissuade future illegal immigration.
Upon achieving the above goals, illegal immigrants on an approved list with no criminal history would be granted amnesty.","Proponents of amnesty for illegal immigrants point to President Reagan as an iconic conservative leader who supported a path to legal status for such individuals in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. If it was good enough for President Reagan, they say, it should be good enough for today’s Republican Party.

What these armchair historians often fail to say, however, is that President Reagan’s support for amnesty was part of a compromise that his congressional counterparts reneged on. In exchange for amnesty, Congress was supposed to fund and enforce the other half of the deal to make it unlawful to hire or recruit individuals illegally residing in the U.S. The compromise would have required employers to attest to their employees’ immigration status.

However, no successive Congress since the Reagan years – regardless of which party held the majority – has ever lived up its side of the bargain. Democrats fear uproar from immigrants’ rights groups and organized labor. Republicans fear angering employers who count on cheap immigrant labor to fill low-paying, low-skill jobs.

While Republican leaders today might emulate President Reagan’s willingness to compromise in the interest of halting the flow of illegal immigration, they would be wise to also learn from his experience. Were President Reagan around to advise Republicans today, he might remind them of the old adage: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”

While it’s possible that President Reagan might still support a compromise today that includes a path to lawful status for immigrants here illegally, it’s a certainty that he would withhold that opportunity until Congress actually acts to dramatically reduce or eliminate the flow of illegal immigration into the U.S.

A “Reaganesque” immigration reform package for today’s world would blend a willingness to compromise with an application of the lessons learned from 1986. It would prioritize border security before granting amnesty or a path to citizenship.

Ronald Reagan was a fan of big, bipartisan, blue-ribbon commissions formed to tackle particularly tough issues outside the realm of congressional compromise. Fox example, a signature piece of legislation signed by President Reagan that saved Social Security in 1983 was the direct result of the recommendations of his National Commission on Social Security Reform.

Such commissions were useful because they took hot potatoes out of the hands of Congress and put them into the hands of a bipartisan group created with the sole aim of finding common ground.

Creating an immigration commission would be a way for President Trump to reach across the aisle to ensure that whatever agreement is made on immigration is bipartisan and earns enough support to avoid a Senate filibuster.

As a student of the Reagan presidency who lived through the immigration debates on Capitol Hill during the Reagan years – and speaking for myself, not the Reagan Foundation – I’ve come to believe that a Reaganesque deal on immigration today could be structured around a provision that no amnesty or path to citizenship would be granted until such a blue-ribbon commission certifies that:

The border wall President Trump wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico is at least 75 percent complete.

The flow of illegal entries by immigrants into the U.S. has reached a specified minimum, reflecting a historic low.

At least 75 percent of U.S. employers have adopted an E-Verify type approach to dissuade future illegal immigration.

Upon achieving the above goals, illegal immigrants on an approved list with no criminal history would be granted amnesty.

How many immigrants here illegally would make it onto approved list and who would get on it?

A compromise plan might offer amnesty and an eventual pathway to citizenship for 3.2 million undocumented immigrants – the same number granted the privilege under President Reagan’s reforms in 1986.

If 3.2 million was appropriate for Reagan, it should be sellable today. Democrats will want to raise that number substantially. Republicans can determine how hard to hold the line to establish a solid bipartisan consensus.

A blue ribbon commission might have better ideas. But no doubt it could be tasked with prioritizing qualifications – such as military service, “Dreamer” status, special work skills, or something else – for inclusion in the number of immigrants accepted.

Once the commission certifies to Congress that the border wall is complete, those granted amnesty could legally apply for citizenship. All of those who reside in the U.S. illegally and do not apply for inclusion under the plan or who are not admitted under the cap for amnesty would need to self-deport by a certain date. They should be given enough time to arrange their affairs and safely and expeditiously return to their country of origin.

Ronald Reagan embodied the idea of a “compassionate conservative” before it was a popular term. As he said in a 1984 debate: “I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though some time back they may have entered illegally.” But he also knew the importance of enforcement and of learning from one’s mistakes.

Though he might support a path to legal status for today’s illegal immigrants, it’s difficult to imagine that President Reagan would repeat the mistakes of the 1986 immigration deal. Today’s Republican leaders who would follow in his footsteps should pursue a plan that puts enforcement first.",Don't get fooled again: Trump and Congress can learn from Reagan and reform our immigration system,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/03/dont-get-fooled-again-trump-and-congress-can-learn-from-reagan-and-reform-our-immigration-system.html

“The president’s trip will focus on three goals,” National Security Adviser H.R.","President Trump embarked on a 13-day trip Friday, with the first stop in Hawaii, ahead of his visit to five major Asian countries in his longest overseas trip to date amid the escalating North Korea threat.

The president and first lady departed the White House Friday morning, stopping to chat with reporters on their way to Air Force One.

“We are about to begin a long trip,” Trump said, noting that the White House had extended the trip, and added an extra day in the Philippines. “We have a big conference, a second conference. And I think we’re going to have great success.”

Trump said that he would be talking about “trade,” and the threat of North Korea.

“We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot people and countries and we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

According to administration officials, the president’s trip will be the longest trip to Asia by a president since 1991, when President George H.W. Bush was in office.

The president's trip comes amid the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.

Trump said again Friday before boarding Air Force One that there was ""no collusion.""

Minutes after take-off, the president tweeted details of his trip.

""Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor. Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines. Will never let you down!"" Trump said.

The president’s first stop, before heading overseas, is in Hawaii, where he will meet with U.S. Pacific Command, and visit Pearl Harbor and the Pearl Harbor memorial.

By Sunday, the president will be in Japan, where he is slated to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for meetings. As they did at Mar-A-Lago, Trump and Abe will play a round of golf at a country club in Japan—this time, joined by the world’s No. 4 golfer, Hideki Matsuyama.

Trump’s visit in Japan, according to the White House, will include meetings with service members and bilateral meetings.

The president is also expected to meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime.

Trump and Abe spoke earlier this week, and “affirmed the important of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” and “maintaining close coordination” between the United States and Japan, and with the international community “to maximize pressure on North Korea.”

The president’s next stop will be South Korea, where he will have a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump will meet with service members, and also is slated for a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul.

A senior administration official told reporters during a White House background briefing this week that there was not enough time in the president’s schedule to accommodate a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, which has separated North Korea and South Korea for 64 years.

Instead of the DMZ, Trump will visit military base Camp Humphreys, which is set 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership.

The president’s trip to South Korea comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea.

Trump said in his United Nations speech in September that he would “totally destroy” the rogue nation, if necessary. He also has continually dubbed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “little Rocket Man.”

Trump’s next stop is China, an important visit that will draw much attention amid the president’s expected requests for Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump is expected to ask Xi, whom he hosted at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year, to impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with North Korea, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime, Reuters reported. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea.

“Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!” Trump tweeted last month.

Trump’s next stop is Vietnam, where he will take part in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) events, according to the White House.

Trump will go to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi for an official visit and bilateral engagements with President Tran Dai Quang and other senior Vietnamese leaders.

The final stop for Trump is the Philippines. The president was only slated to be in the Philippines for one day, but on Friday announced an additional day.

Trump is set for a bilateral meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of human rights abuses, including killing suspected drug dealers. The White House has said that Trump could raise concerns with the program, though Duterte and Trump shared a “warm rapport” during a phone conversation.

While in the Philippines, the president will also attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 50th anniversary dinner. ASEAN consists of ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Trump will celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and participate in bilateral meetings with Duterte and other leaders.

“The president’s trip will focus on three goals,” National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters at the White House press briefing Thursday. “First, strengthening international resolve to denuclearize North Korea. Second, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

McMaster added that the president would “reiterate the plain fact” that North Korea is a “threat to the entire world,” also promising that Trump would continue to call on “all responsible nations” to isolate the North Korean regime “economically and politically.”

In his UC Berkeley water polo shirt, cargo shorts and sneakers, the 21-year-old history major seems like any other undergrad rushing to class or sipping coffee in the plaza.

But Chow is not like most of his fellow students. He’s part of a small minority of seemingly marginalized students at one of the largest universities in the U.S. He’s a conservative.

“I came here to conduct my own social experiment,” Chow told Fox News. “The idea was to see if there was any way of convincing people or having a dialogue with really radical people. It has not been as successful as I wanted it to be.”

While UC Berkeley does not keep statistics on its students’ political leanings, the school has long been known as one of the country’s centers for liberal and progressive thought, and now – following a slew of high-profile, violent protests against conservative speakers on campus – Chow and other like-minded students say that life has become more difficult for anyone whose politics lean toward the right.

“It’s certainly not easy,” Steven Hayward, a conservative commentator and resident scholar at UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, told Fox News. “There are not many conservative students -- and those that are conservative are, many times, afraid to speak for fear of being mocked or trolled by their fellow students.”

Chow and other conservatives on campus say that while harassment by fellow students isn’t new – they’ve been yelled at, sent hate mail, had their signs stolen when tabling and even spat upon – the animosity aimed in their direction has ratcheted up over the last year.

In February, 150 leftist black-clad protesters rampaged through Berkeley’s campus, where they caused $100,000 worth of damage, beat students and forced the University of California to cancel a planned speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

“There were over 100 Antifa members on campus causing trouble,” Rudraveer Reddy, a conservative sophomore at UC Berkeley and a member of the Berkeley College Republicans (BCRS) and the Berkeley Patriot website, told Fox News. “My friend was there and he was beaten by Antifa and the police did nothing.”

Since then, violence by Antifa, a far-left group whose name means “anti-fascist,” has continued on Berkeley’s campus and throughout the college town, with controversial conservative writer Ann Coulter canceling a speech at the school in April after the Young America’s Foundation pulled its support for the event amid threats of violence.

In August, a group of around 100 hooded members of Antifa stormed what had been a largely peaceful rally for free speech in the town of Berkeley and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group that had canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco to avoid potential violence.

Along with actual acts of violence, Berkeley’s contingent of conservative students have also had to deal with less direct threats.

Graffiti has appeared in restrooms and on school signs that read “Kill the BCRS” and “Behead the BCRS,” while the Berkeley Antifa Twitter account tweeted out the names of some BCR members and alleged that the members were meeting at a local bar with Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and right-wing activist Kyle “Based Stickman” Chapman. BCR members and students in the conservative Young America’s Foundation have said Antifa members have stalked them while they hung posters around campus.

“Conservatives in Berkeley are routinely targeted, harassed, and stalked,” BCR External Vice President Naweed Tahmas said in an email to the Daily Californian, the campus newspaper. “It has become socially acceptable in Berkeley to physically beat someone for being a conservative.”

Officials at UC Berkeley have vehemently denied that they condone any threats or violence directed at conservatives and said they have diligently worked to protect their students while also protecting free speech.

“We’re not going to play games when it comes to the safety of our guests and the members of the campus community,” Dan Mogulof, a UC Berkeley spokesman, told Fox News.

The university last month shelled out $600,000 in security for an on-campus appearance from conservative pundit and former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro. Further, it is estimated that UC Berkeley spent close to $1 million on security ahead of the planned “Free Speech Week” hosted by the conservative Berkeley Patriot group and Yiannopoulos.

While administration members said they are doing all they can to protect and defend free speech, the Berkeley College Republicans targeted by Antifa don’t feel the same way.

“The university’s response has been pathetic, at best,” Matt Ronnau, a BCR member, told Fox News.

“Free Speech Week” was canceled at the last minute amid a dearth of speakers and problems with the organizers, but the event galvanized both conservatives in Berkeley and those opposed to them.

It also highlighted a divide among the school’s conservatives that some blame for the ramping up in the harassment aimed at the group.

Chow, who has been a member of BCR for two years, said the organization’s new leadership is taking the group in a different direction – now it focuses on bringing in provocative speakers with far-right views and creating pet projects like the Berkeley Patriot. He said the group now seems more interested in sparking controversy than making positive changes.

“They are all about creating outlandish remarks and trying to pull off these outlandish events,” Chow said, “… there is hypocrisy on both sides.”",Conservative students at UC Berkeley face everything from insults to threats of violence,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/12/conservative-students-at-uc-berkeley-face-everything-from-insults-to-threats-violence.html

In the age of shorter and shorter attention spans, those in their teens and 20s who cannot sit through a Marx Brothers movie, much less a baseball game, are missing out.
However, one could say a good baseball game is like a good song.
I remember around 2002 my dad took my little sister and me to a Mets game at Shea.
Babe Ruth put it in fewer words: “The only real game in the world, I think, is baseball.”","As the Astros and Dodgers moved into extra innings in game two of the World Series last week, fans seemed to light up and lean forward in their seats, as if tenth innings were the reason they watched games.

Even this Mets fan, originally torn about whom to root for in the 2017 Fall Classic, sat on the edge of my seat in disbelief as Houston clawed its way to a win against Los Angeles.

Game two – a game ESPN described as “so completely insane and ridiculous that you wouldn't believe what happened if you didn't watch it” – was a cocktail of suspense and excitement that reminded fans why they follow baseball … biting our nails as the 11-inning back-and-forth unfolded – with the Astros tying it up in the ninth, two Dodgers homeruns answered to tie it up again in the tenth, and the Astros finally managing to squeeze out a 7-6 win in the eleventh.

Game five was another mindblower, with the Astros winning 13-12 after an exhausting 10-inning home run bonanza that winning pitcher Joe Musgrove called “the craziest game of my life.”

The sweetness of these wins, however, was missed by many young people who have written off learning the rules of such a “boring” game.

One could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.

Many young Americans were raised on football, soccer, or basketball, noble sports no doubt, but somewhere along the line they found themselves incapable of sitting through America’s pastime.

In the age of shorter and shorter attention spans, those in their teens and 20s who cannot sit through a Marx Brothers movie, much less a baseball game, are missing out.

Baseball is poetry.

The suspenseful quiet that takes up a large part of the game leaves room for the players’ human quirks to steal the spotlight, fascinating fans as every movement tugs on the fate of the game.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Mark Fidrych, for instance, talked to himself on the mound in the 1970s, sparking the lore that he was really talking to the ball. Another pitching legend, Gaylord Perry, twitched before pitches on purpose, driving batters up the wall.

The New York Mets were home to some of baseball’s greatest characters, leading Manager Casey Stengel to say that his beloved (but losing) “Amazins” “are a much improved ball club; now we lose in extra innings!”

The rules of baseball also set the groundwork for artful suspense. In game seven of the World Series, the ninth inning, with two out, bases loaded, two strikes on the batter, the batting team losing by no less than three runs, the losing team can still win the entire championship on a single pitch.

No other game has anything like that.

It was that sort of scenario that made famed Mets coach Yogi Berra warn, “It ain’t over till it’s over.”

True, some modern changes threaten the game. Even during the span of this writer’s childhood, games at Shea Stadium, Citifield, and the old Yankee Stadium got louder with more distractions and sideshows in case fans were getting bored. Some of the extras, like team mascots (Mr. Met!) and the kiss-cam are a blast, but the game itself was always the most exciting part.

Diehard fans of other sports like football, basketball, hockey or soccer, may object to baseball being exciting. There is none of the standing around, looking at the grass and kicking the dirt that goes on in baseball in those other pasttimes.

However, one could say a good baseball game is like a good song. Punctuating the rhythm of the game are crescendos of excitement, which are only sweetened by the quieter parts.

I remember around 2002 my dad took my little sister and me to a Mets game at Shea. My sister, around seven at the time, announced on the way there that she would catch a foul ball in her cap, showing us from the car back seat how she would hold her cap up.

“That would be nice, pet lamb,” my dad said.

“No, I know I am!” she told him.

She caught a ball - in her cap - that day.

A little kid can sit for hours holding a cap up in hopes of taking a piece of the game home. Surely the rest of us bored grown-ups can take some time to appreciate a game that has it all, from grit to art.

Webster is denying the allegations, saying he had a consensual relationship with the singer. On Wednesday morning, Webster PR announced on its website the company was no longer in business, but a rep later told Fox News the company will continue operating under a new name.

Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, said he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

“He wanted for there to be fireworks in my career, but first there had to be fireworks between he and I,” Rick told Fox News of his former publicist.

“He sexually assaulted me repeatedly, he drugged and sexually violated me, he offered me publicity opportunities and magazine columns in exchange for sexual acts. He paid me to keep my mouth shut,” Rick wrote on his GoFundMe page and on Facebook. He is crowdfunding $15,000 for his legal fees.

Harvey Weinstein scandal: What you need to know

The 30-year-old told us Webster demanded he strip naked in order to prepare for a photo shoot with Playgirl magazine. Rick said Webster performed oral sex on him.

He added, “[If] I stopped going with the flow, he would make sure no one would ever hear my name.”

Webster’s PR firm told Fox News he had a relationship with Rick but it was consensual.

“As a single adult, Mr. Webster has had multiple relationships over the course of his professional life, all of which have been consensual. This includes a brief relationship with Mr. Rick. It saddens Mr. Webster that nine years later, after Mr. Rick’s music career has been stagnant, Mr. Rick has taken the opportunistic approach of mischaracterizing that relationship and posting untrue allegations.”

Rick told us he “knew it was time to escape” when he woke up the night after an Easter party in Webster’s bed and had no recollection of the night before.

“I knew that whatever was left of my dignity, I had to get out of there. I felt like I might not survive,” he recalled. He said Webster continued to contact him via social media up until this past June.

Rick insisted on sharing his story amid others coming forward with their own stories of sexual abuse and harassment. In recent weeks, more than 90 women have accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of misconduct.

Webster moved to Nashville at age 20 and opened his PR firm without a college degree or previous experience in the industry. He said in a 2014 interview that he operates by “not taking 'no' as an answer,” which he believes has made him a “power publicist.”

He has since directed his company's business to his Senior Vice President Jeremy Westby.

Copyright © Eric Metaxas, 2017.","Editor's note: The following is an excerpt from Eric Metaxas' new book, ""MARTIN LUTHER: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World.""

One of the greatest challenges in telling the story of Martin Luther is distancing him from the endless fables, myths, and tall tales told about him in the last five centuries.

During his lifetime, Luther’s celebrity grew at such a pace that the momentum of it could not be slowed even by his death. In fact, the magma of his celebrity soon cooled into hagiographic stone, such that much of what the world has come to “know” about him is fiction. The most well-known ”facts“ of his life illustrate the point.

First, he was born into a family of peasants, the poor son of a miner who was raised in a home humble and cramped; second, his hardscrabble upbringing was a brutal one in which his dour working-class father buffeted him so viciously that it warped his psyche, causing him to see God the Father as a similarly glowering and sadistic figure to be placated and assuaged in endlessly humiliating religious contortions—or to be avoided entirely.

Third, it was a literal bolt of fire from the heavens that caused the jumpy twenty-one-year-old suddenly to blurt out a binding vow—one he had never previously considered but that in his abject fear he indeed spoke—and then felt duty bound to honor the rest of his born days, thus leading him to become a monk.

Fourth, it was on a trip to Rome that he was so shocked at the blasphemous devilry of that vile city that he decided he must destroy the soft and decadent Italian church and remake it in his own uncompromising and upright German image.

Fifth, he began this lifelong project by angrily and defiantly hammering his damning accusations against Rome onto the very door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, thus putting the quivering pope on notice that his deeds had been weighed in the balance and found wanting.

Sixth, after his great stand at the Diet of Worms—where he said, “Here I stand. I can do no other!”—he fled to the Wartburg, where in his overflowing umbrage he took on the devil personally and at least once punctuated his fury by hurling a pot of ink at the fiend who dared to trespass his quarters. Indeed, anyone who doubts this need only go to the Wartburg to see the swart blots themselves, still staining the wall of his cell these five centuries later.

Seventh, the nun he married escaped from her nunnery by hiding inside a large barrel that had only just been emptied of herring. In fact, all of the twelve nuns hid in filthy herring barrels secured to the wagon that hurtled them away to freedom.

These important details have been recounted innumerable times and are being confidently recounted this minute, told in tours of Luther sites around Germany in many languages, being written and read in otherwise excellent books about Luther, and posted in online articles and blogs. But not a single one of these seven things is true. They are each sloppy glosses on the actual facts and have over time congealed and finally ossified into the marmoreal narrative that has existed for half a millennium.

Parson Weems’s pious legends of Washington chopping down cherry trees and casting silver dollars across the wide Potomac persisted for about 150 years, but these false details about Luther have persisted for more than three times as long.

Their cultural roots are therefore that much deeper. It is my hope that ""Martin Luther"" will do its humble part in uprooting them.

Womer was taking photos with her dear horses Dutch, a sorrel gelding, and Cricket, a paint mare, when Cricket started smiling for the camera.

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.

“We had an experience back in 2016 where we had a bride come down in a carriage and they were going to walk it down the aisle,” he recalls. “As soon as one of the horses got close to the people, somebody had their back turned to it and then turned around and scared it, so it took off and actually flipped the carriage.”

“Her fashion is great.”Another woman and former U.S. Senate staffer Mieko Nakabayashi, told the site that Ivanka’s “kind of celebrity” resonates with the Japanese people.

“That is something that Japanese women want, but have a hard time doing in a still male-dominated society.”","If Japan’s media coverage of Ivanka Trump’s arrival in Tokyo is any indication, the country seems to be slightly obsessed with the first daughter’s high-ranking position and “great” sense of style.

Trump’s arrival at the Narita International Airport on Thursday evening was covered by four television stations and treated as “major news,” according to the New York Times. The same went for her subsequent dinner plans at a swanky Tokyo restaurant.

The city’s metropolitan police, too, have assigned Trump an all-female “riot squad” to protect her from overzealous admirers during the visit — and it’s the same security measure they plan to extend to first lady Melania Trump when she and President Donald Trump arrive in Japan on Nov. 5.

“Many people think she’s like a princess,” said Lully Miura, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, in a statement to the Washington Post. “She’s well educated, beautiful, sophisticated and rich. And it’s very surprising to Japanese women that she can also talk about things that are important to society.”

The DailyMail added that Japan views Ivanka as ""a fashion icon"" who will attract onlookers during her stay.

On Friday, Ivanka spoke at the World Assembly for Women Conference at Tokyo’s Prince Hotel, which reportedly held a lottery for attendees.

The event was not as well attended as one might expect considering her popularity — Trump delivered an 18-minute speech to a partially-empty auditorium — but White House spokesman Josh Raffel said the hotel’s strict security measures kept people from getting to their seats. (A Washington Post reporter in attendance denies this was the case.) Nevertheless, the women who heard Trump’s speech seemed to view her as a role model.

“She is a beautiful female leader,” Rena Hayakawa, a 21-year-old college student, told the Times. “Her fashion is great.”

Another woman and former U.S. Senate staffer Mieko Nakabayashi, told the site that Ivanka’s “kind of celebrity” resonates with the Japanese people.

However, it’s unclear if Ivanka’s father is looked at as favorably. In a January article in the Independent, titled “Why Japan loves Ivanka Trump,” an Ivanka-admiring blogger — who reportedly writes about the first daughter’s fashion and lifestyle for the Japan Times — hinted that not everybody is as enamored of Donald.

NEW YORK — September 18, 2017 – FOX News Channel (FNC) has named Laura Ingraham as the host of The Ingraham Angle, a new live primetime program to debut on October 30th, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for the network. Ahead of Ingraham’s debut, Hannity, hosted by Sean Hannity, will move to the 9PM/ET hour, the ensemble program The Five will return to the 5PM/ET timeslot, while the 10PM/ET hour will be helmed by rotating hosts during the interim period. Each of these changes will take effect on September 25th.

Martha, Tucker and Sean have proven that they understand the pulse of America across the political and the cultural spectrum. I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation. The program will also highlight the importance of faith in our nation and reveal stories that showcase the American spirit.

Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 and most recently served as a contributor, providing political analysis and commentary to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming. She will continue hosting her radio program, The Laura Ingraham Show, where she is the most-listened-to woman in political talk radio on hundreds of stations nationwide. Two years ago, Ingraham also founded LifeZette, a political and cultural website, and will continue to serve as editor, although without a day-to-day operational role.

A graduate of Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia School of Law, Ingraham previously served as a litigator and Supreme Court law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. She is also the author of the New York Times bestsellers “The Hillary Trap,” “Shut Up & Sing,” “Power to the People,” and “The Obama Diaries,” among others.

The teenager, whose name has not been released, was a student at the Kaifukan School in Habikino City, Japan. According to local media, the school has a policy that all students must have black hair to attend.

GRANDMA OUTRAGED AT SCHOOL CALLING 11-YEAR-OLD'S DRESS 'DISTRACTING'

Unfortunately, the 18-year-old had naturally brown hair. The suit says that the student’s mom reached out to the school before her enrollment, informing them of her daughter’s lighter hair color. Though she ensured her daughter’s hair color was natural – some schools in Japan force lighter-haired students to prove their hair color by carrying photos of them as children – the school still forced her to dye her hair black to conform to the rules.

Now the teen is saying that the hair dye, which they forced her to do as often as every four days, left burns and rashes to her scalp.

“The dyeing damaged the health of the scalp and hair,” the plaintiff claims. “[Natural] physical features were negated and mental anguish resulted.”

The family is suing the Osaka Prefectural Government for 2.2 million yen (about $19,300) in damages she incurred from the hair dyeing and abuse.

This comes after they tried to file a complaint with the school once the incidents occurred. The complaint was dismissed and the student did not return to school beginning September 2016.

Masahiko Takahashi, the head of the school, declined to comment on the open case, but he did confirm that the school has strict rules about hair and dress code. He also said the school has a ban on bleached or lightened hair, but would not confirm if dyeing the hair black is allowed.

The Asahi Shimbun newspaper writes that the schools force the students to have dark hair to “protect” them from being berated by school officials, since light hair is seen as abnormal in Japan.","Student sues government after school forced her to dye her hair black, she claims",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/11/01/student-sues-government-after-school-forced-her-to-dye-her-hair-black-claims.html

Randy Travis quietly announced he signed with new representation the same day his longtime publicist Kirt Webster was accused of sexual assault by a former client.

According to a press release on 117 Publicity's website on October 27, Travis signed with the firm to be his exclusive representation.

That is the same day former country singer Austin Cody Rick accused Webster of ""sexually assault[ing] me repeatedly"" in a public Facebook post.

Webster, who worked for years as the publicist to Dolly Parton, Charlie Daniels and Kenny Rogers, is denying the allegations, saying he had a consensual relationship with Rick. But on Wednesday afternoon, Webster PR announced on its website the company was no longer in business. A rep later told Fox News the company will continue operating under a new name.

In addition to bottles of urine, court documents say the couple found “containers containing remnants of partially eaten food, construction debris and other garbage” within the walls of their new residence at the luxury 1200 Avenue at Port Imperial building, including partially eaten Chinese food orders and cupcake wrappers.

Tara Batista, of Tampa, blamed a pedicure for the serious infection that sent her to the hospital for a week and will impact her wedding.

“It’s been a total nightmare,” Batista told news station WFTS.

She claims she noticed signs that her pedicure had gone awry while at Nail Image salon in Tampa.

“It was painful,” Batista said. “I told her at one point that she was inflicting pain.”

Hours after leaving, she said she started to feel pain shooting up her legs.

Batista decided to go to the emergency room the next day when she could no longer could stand on her left foot.

“Next thing I know, they tell me I’m going into surgery,” she told WFTS. “The infection had spread to my bone.”

Doctors said she had developed a deep abscess from an infection on her left big toe, according to WFTS.

“For the infection to come on in less than 24 hours to that severity — something’s not right,” she told the station.

Batista was discharged from the hospital, but said she is now under the care of a home health nurse.

She was instructed to use an IV line for medication for the next six weeks, including during her wedding.

“This is not what I envisioned for my wedding,” Batista said.

“The unifying thread is sort of the broad politics of Donald Trump, the ethno-centric nationalism. He did not react this way when a white person shot dozens of people in Las Vegas… We need to give this guy the death penalty,” Eli Stokols told MSNBC host Nicole Wallace.

Wallace didn’t mention that the Las Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, is already dead.

Trump took to Twitter to condemn Saipov after he killed eight people on Tuesday in lower Manhattan in what is being described as a terror attack. Saipov reportedly wanted to fly an ISIS flag in his hospital room and ""wanted to kill as many people as he could,"" according to a federal criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

“NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room,” Trump tweeted. “He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!”

While both attacks are tragic and horrifying, Stokols attempted to paint Trump as someone who is harder on an ISIS-affiliated terrorist than a deranged white man who gunned down fellow Americans. Paddock opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas last month, killing 58 people and injuring over 500 more, in what is the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.

The problem for Stokols is that Paddock was killed by suicide as police closed in on his Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino hotel room. Since he’s dead, he’s obviously not a candidate for the death penalty – making the MSNBC correspondent’s point essentially meaningless.

Trump did refer to Paddock “demented” and a “very sick individual,” so it’s not like the President spoke kindly about him. He simply didn’t call for the death penalty… because you can’t kill someone who is already dead.

The Gateway Pundit called Stokols “moronic,” while the Media Research Center said the Wall Street Journal needs to “needs to better police the people that it has in important positions… if it wants people to take its journalism seriously.”

Stokols issued the following comment to Fox News: “I am aware the Vegas shooter is already dead; and I did not mean to sound critical of President Trump for failing to call for the death penalty in that case. I understand how ridiculous that sounds. I was making a broader point about the president’s responses to Las Vegas, where he did not push for a policy change, and Charlottesville, where he did not call for the death penalty after a driver crashed into a crowd, in comparison to his more emotionally charged rhetoric following the terrorist attack this week — calling to end the visa lottery, labeling the driver an ‘animal’ and urging for the death penalty.

That trapped pressure can be the reason that holding in a sneeze can be dangerous, he said.
The pressure of holding in a sneeze can also cause you to pop a small blood vessel in your eye, nose, or eardrum, but that’s very rare, said Tylor.
It’s also extremely rare, but holding in a sneeze can cause the rupture of aneurysm, a condition where part of your artery wall weakens, causing a bulge.","It’s always the worst time when that urge to sneeze hits—a quiet movie theater, an elevator packed with people, or right before you lean in you kiss your date goodnight.

There are just some times when you don’t want to spray snot all over the place. So is it safe to hold in a sneeze? We checked in with experts to find out what’s exactly behind your sneezing, and what can happen to your body if you try to snuffle one.

Why do we sneeze in the first place?

Sneezing is a complex physiological reflex. It occurs when you breathe in an irritating substance or particle, which passes through your nostrils into the lining of your nose.

This triggers a release of histamine, irritating the nerve cells in your nasal lining that travels from your trigeminal nerve—which provides sensation to your face—to your brain, explained Dale Amanda Tylor, M.D., M.P.H., otolaryngologist at ENT Associates of Santa Barbara. (Nasal congestion or allergies can spark the release of histamine, too.)

FDA WARNS ON 'POT CURES CANCER' CLAIMS

When your brain gets the signal, it activates your throat muscles, and tells your lungs to release a powerful burst of air through your windpipe, she says. This release of air occurs to push out the particles that are irritating your nose.

""Sneezes are so powerful that [your snot can] travel the dimensions of a room and land up to 6 to 8 meters away,"" said Erich Voigt, M.D., clinical associate professor in the department of otolaryngology at NYU Langone Health.

What happens if you hold in a sneeze?

All that pressure has to go somewhere.

“If you keep the mouth or nose closed, the generated pressure will back up into your head (sinuses), nasal cavity, or down the throat back into the chest,"" said Voigt. ""Suppressing the sneeze by holding the nose or mouth leads to a noticeable increase in pressure, about 5 to 24 times of that during a normal sneeze.”

Still, snuffling a sneeze is so quick, so that rise in pressure is over fast. That means it can’t be harmful, right? Well, not exactly.

""It’s kind of like saying that when Floyd Mayweather punches you, his glove is in contact with your face for only a fraction of a second,” said Ahmad R. Sedaghat, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor in the department of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. “But because the force/pressure during that fraction of second is so high, it can do real damage.”

What are the health effects of holding in a sneeze?

That trapped pressure can be the reason that holding in a sneeze can be dangerous, he said.

For one, your ears can be at risk. When you hold in a sneeze, air and pressure can travel up your Eustachian tubes—small passageways linking your throat to your middle ear—and cause your eardrum to rupture.

BOY'S CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS LEAD TO TUMOR DIAGNOSIS

""In the more severe case, instead of the air rupturing the ear drum, it leads to rupture of the delicate structures of the inner ear causing permanent hearing loss,"" Sedaghat said.

The pressure of holding in a sneeze can also cause you to pop a small blood vessel in your eye, nose, or eardrum, but that’s very rare, said Tylor.

It’s also extremely rare, but holding in a sneeze can cause the rupture of aneurysm, a condition where part of your artery wall weakens, causing a bulge.

“With an aneurysm, a weak part of [a blood vessel in the brain] could rupture at any time, or never rupture at all—but a sudden change in intracranial pressure could cause it to rupture,” said Tylor. “That would probably less common than getting struck by lightning.”

And before you freak out, the people most at risk of the serious injuries generally have health conditions that leave them more susceptible, like abnormal blood vessels, or have had recent sinus, vascular, or brain surgery, or a head, neck or chest injury of some kind, said Voigt.

Bottom line: Should you hold in your sneeze?

Let them rip: The function of the sneeze is to allow a release of pressure. If you hold it in, not only are you not allowing your body to do its job—clear out those nasal irritants—but you’re also putting your body at risk by containing that pressure.

Still, if there is a time when you really don’t want to sneeze, you can try to stimulate your other sensory nerves, which can help block your sneeze reflex, said Tylor. By blocking it at that step, you wouldn’t be trapping any pressure.

HOSPITAL, FAMILY TO DISCUSS TODDLER'S STALLED KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AMID PROTESTS

""You can sometimes prevent it by blowing the nose, or pressing on the region of the lip just below the nose, or rubbing the nose,"" she said.

And if you do sneeze, make sure you follow proper sneezing etiquette when it comes to spreading germs.

""Covering with a hand, which most of us were taught as kids, is now considered outdated advice,"" said Tylor. ""The name of the game now is sneeze into your elbow (which you don't use to touch things like doorknobs or tablet screens or keyboards) or to sneeze into a tissue and then wash your hands right after.""

It's not that this method diminishes your spray of saliva and mucus, but since you don't touch a lot with your elbow, you're essentially protecting others from viral or bacterial particles in your sneeze.

The FDA issued warning letters to four companies that sell products containing cannabidiol (CBD) and claim the ingredient can treat or cure cancer, according to an FDA statement released Nov. 1. CBD is a compound found in marijuana, but unlike another compound in the plant called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD doesn't cause psychoactive effects.

CBD is sold in products such as oil drops, teas, capsules, syrups and lotions, the FDA says.

The four companies — Green Roads Health, Natural Alchemist, That's Natural! Marketing & Consulting, and Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises LLC — sold, in total, more than 25 different types of products with unsubstantiated medical claims, according to the FDA.

Here are some of the claims made by the companies: The product ""combats tumor and cancer cells."" ""CBD makes cancer cells commit 'suicide' without killing other cells.""

And ""Non-psychoactive cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol) may be effective in treating tumors from cancer — including breast cancer.""

The FDA said in the statement that these products have not been proven to be safe or effective and that making unsubstantiated claims is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

""Substances that contain components of marijuana will be treated like any other products that make unproven claims to shrink cancer tumors,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in the statement. The FDA doesn't allow companies to market products ""with baseless claims,"" Gottlieb said.

""There are a growing number of effective therapies for many cancers,"" he added. ""When people are allowed to illegally market products that deliver no established benefit, they may steer patients away from products that have proven anti-tumor effects that could extend lives.""

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Jeff Flake last week took to the Senate floor to proclaim that since he would not be “complicit or silent” in the Trump presidency, he will not seek re-election. The first-term Arizona senator bemoaned that as a “traditional Republican,” he had a “narrower and narrow path” to office in this Trump world.

The speech earned Mr. Flake all the plaudits you’d expect, from all the usual suspects. Conservative Never Trumpers and the media “resistance” believe the president is destroying the Republican Party, the country, democracy and the universe—in that order. Those who join in their daily denouncements of Mr. Trump receive standing ovations. Those who don’t are falsely accused, to quote Mr. Flake in his speech, of “complete and unquestioning loyalty” and duly excommunicated from “moral” conservative society.

Yes, Mr. Trump is a wrecking ball; and yes, conservatives have a right and a duty to worry about the damage he may do to the Republican Party and its principles. Where the Never Trumpers err is in insisting that the only response is full-on resistance, shaming and utter denunciation. Not only is that approach simplistic, it is a proven loser.

Mr. Flake is a case in point. Among elected officials, he is rivaled perhaps only by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as loudest Never Trumper. The senator doesn’t like the president’s views on trade or immigration (join the club). But like Mr. Kasich, he has rarely bothered to spell out specific areas where he disagreed with Mr. Trump, or to note the significant points of agreement (deregulation, judges, etc.). His is a blanket condemnation. In Mr. Flake’s new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” he compares Mr. Trump’s politics to a “late-night infomercial.”

This sweeping reproof was a sign to Trump supporters in Arizona that Mr. Flake either didn’t know or didn’t care why they support this president. So they wrote him off—much as he wrote off Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake was never going to get Democratic support, and once he alienated half of his state’s Republican voters, of course his path to re-election was narrow. Mr. Flake blew himself out of office, and he is now in a much poorer position to make any difference in the shape of Washington policies or the future of his party.",A Tale of Two Republicans,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/tale-two-republicans#commenting

White wrote in a note to investors.

He raised his Apple price target to $235 a share, which implies a market cap over $1 trillion, when taking into account Apple's 5.1 billion shares outstanding.

Apple said it expects fiscal first-quarter revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion, due in large part to pent-up demand surrounding the iPhone X.

Shares were up more than 3 percent to $174.46 in early Friday trading and are up more than 40 percent year to date.

Demand is ""off the charts""

Customer demand for the iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") has been exceptional, with Apple telling media it is ""off the charts."" On the company's conference call, Cook expanded upon that sentiment.

Cook said that the Apple Store in Sydney, Australia had ""several hundred people"" waiting outside to get the iPhone X and he also received ""similar reports from across that region.""

The iPhone X, which went on pre-sale on Oct. 27, starts at $999. Prior to the announcement, there was significant speculation that the high-end iPhone X would start at a cost of $1,000 or more.

It has a 5.8-inch super retina display and Face ID facial recognition technology, which can be used to unlock the phone and for Apple Pay. ""Face ID learns your face. It learns who you are,"" Apple's vice president of marketing, Phil Schiller, said when introducing the iPhone X in September.

IT LOOKS LIKE APPLE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SKY-HIGH PRICE OF THE IPHONE X

Not everyone is happy though

Though consumer interest in the device is high, Apple has not been able to catch up to demand - at least not yet.

""The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it,"" Cook said, when asked by an analyst when iPhone X supply would meet demand. ""And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible.""

A look on Apple's website shows iPhone X ship dates between 3 and 4 weeks for both the 64GB and 256GB models.

Sources have told Fox News that some iPhone X orders, which were originally scheduled to be shipped between December 5 and 11 have since been told they will be shipped between the 1st and the 8th.

Other sources have told Fox News they have received emails showing the order has already shipped, a sign that Apple is working to get as many iPhone X units in consumers hands as it can.

And when Webster, the firm’s CEO, started taking an interest in him, Andersen said he thought it was because of his work ethic.

Andersen alleged Webster would speak openly about a number of sexually graphic topics, like owning a 24-carat gold sex toy. He also said Webster often told sexually explicit stories about his employees.

Andersen alleges that Webster once asked him to come into a hot tub, naked. That prompted Andersen to alert the Webster company human resources office — several times.

“[My complaint] didn’t go anywhere,” Andersen said. “To get out of Kirt Webster’s grasp once he brings you in, it's hard to get away from him… He’s a predator.”

Andersen said he told his family about the ongoing harassment. A family member spoke to Fox News who recalled hearing about Webster’s alleged behavior in detail at the time, back when Andersen was 26.

Andersen’s claims came a day after former singer Austin C. Rick, who performed under the name Austin Cody, told Fox News he suffered months of “terrible, terrible” abuse at the hands of Webster.

Through his company, Webster denied the allegations in a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying he engaged in a consensual relationship with Rick. Fox News was told on Wednesday afternoon Webster will take ""some time away from the business to focus on combating the egregious and untrue allegations made against him.""

The company announced Wednesday it will continue operating under the name Westby PR with former Webster PR Vice President Jeremy Westby as CEO. However, Westby told Fox News on Thursday that Webster is not involved in Westby PR in any capacity.

When reached by email about Andersen’s allegation, a rep for Webster said she had no additional information at this time.

Rick and Andersen’s stories are two of “many,” according to five former employees who spoke to Fox News this week. They detailed instances where they say Webster showed them porn, made lewd gestures in the office and mocked clients during staff meetings.

A former employee previously known to Fox News, who wished to remain anonymous, said Webster touched him inappropriately on “multiple occasions” adding there are “so many” stories similar to his.

“There’s no telling how many there are,” he said. “There [is] sexual harassment running rampant through that place as long as I’ve known.” A close friend told Fox News the former employee discussed Webster’s behavior in detail many times with him.

A former female employee told Fox News Webster once grabbed her hair and “humped” her in front of fellow staff members. She called the behavior “typical,” and said her former boss would “caress me” on multiple occasions. She also alleged Webster made comments about her vagina in front of clients. Her roommate at the time told Fox News the former employee told her they discussed Webster’s behavior at length, and the roommate met Webster several times and witnessed his “lewd behavior.”

Another female former employee told us Webster was “verbally abusive” and told her he was going to “cut my [clitoris].’”

“He scares you. He makes you think you’ll never work in country music again,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time told Fox News he often urged her to leave Webster after hearing about her then-boss’ behavior.

A fourth former employee told Fox News he was hired after graduating from college, and was asked to bring things to Webster at his home, where he encountered his then-boss watching porn.

“One time he was just sitting in a towel on his couch watching porn. He invited me into his hot tub, and when I told him I didn’t have a swimsuit, he implied I could come in naked.”

A fifth former employee told Fox News working for Webster was “the worst experience"" of his life.

“Everybody in Nashville knows Kirt Webster and knows he's a horrible person,” he said.

Reviews on the site Glassdoor, a platform for people to anonymously share information about companies, mimic the sentiments former Webster employees shared with Fox News.

“[Webster] runs his business using fear, intimidation, and harassment,” one reviewer from October 15 wrote. “I am not exaggerating in my accusation of Webster PR as a hostile work environment where employees are subject to sexual harassment, sudden and inappropriate anger outbursts.”

Representatives for Webster himself, or for the company, did not respond to numerous requests for comment.","Country music's top publicist accused of propositioning intern for sex, showing employees porn",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/02/country-musics-top-publicist-accused-propositioning-intern-for-sex.html

More than eight years after Bergdahl walked off his base in Afghanistan -- and unwittingly into the clutches of the Taliban -- Bergdahl walked out of a North Carolina courtroom a free man Friday. Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to endangering his comrades, was fined, reduced in rank to E1 and dishonorably discharged -- but he received no prison time.

Trump, aboard Air Force One en route to meetings in Asia, tweeted his disapproval of the sentence.

""The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,"" Trump wrote.

As part of the sentence, Bergdahl will forfeit his pay of $1000 per month for ten months.

Bergdahl was shaking and appeared emotional as the verdict was quickly read.

Prosecutors had requested a 14-year prison term following a week of emotional testimony from the survivors who were wounded during missions to find Bergdahl after he left the base in June 2009. Bergdahl's defense team has asked for no prison time.

Bergdahl faced up to life in prison for desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Wearing a blue dress uniform, Bergdahl appeared tense during the short morning session. He clenched his jaw as if grinding his teeth, then grimaced and looked at the floor when he walked out of the courtroom.

In closing arguments, defense attorneys argued that Bergdahl already had suffered enough confinement during five years of brutal captivity by Taliban allies. They asked the judge for a dishonorable discharge and no prison time. Their argument for leniency also cited harsh campaign-trail criticism by Donald Trump and Bergdahl's mental disorders.

Capt. Nina Banks, a defense attorney, said it wouldn't be justice to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban ""only to place him in a cell"" now.

""Sgt. Bergdahl has been punished enough,"" Banks added. ""Sgt. Bergdahl paid a bitter price for the choices that he made.""

During the multiday sentencing hearing, Bergdahl himself testified that he was sorry for the wounds suffered by searchers. He also described brutal beatings by his captors, illness brought on by squalid conditions and maddening periods of isolation, most of it in a cramped cage.

A psychiatrist testified that Bergdahl's decision to leave his post was influenced by a schizophrenia-like condition called schizotypal personality disorder that made it hard to understand consequences of his actions, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder brought on partly by a difficult childhood.

Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 14 years in prison, citing serious wounds to service members who looked for Bergdahl.

""Sgt. Bergdahl does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices,"" said Maj. Justin Oshana, a prosecutor. Contrasting Bergdahl to the wounded searchers, he added, ""The difference is, all the suffering stems from his choice.""

Oshana also cited Bergdahl's own words to argue against the idea that his thinking was clouded. On a courtroom monitor he displayed quotes from an initial investigation after Bergdahl returned to the U.S. Bergdahl, who has said he walked off to draw attention to problems with his unit, described to an investigating officer how he envisioned the missing-soldier alert unfolding.

Bergdahl had said that the call goes ""all the way up to Army command, it goes to Air Force, it goes to Marines. ... It goes to every high point and everybody finds out about it.""

Bergdahl pleaded guilty Oct. 16. The judge has wide discretion on sentencing because he didn't strike a deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment. A bad conduct or dishonorable discharge would deprive Bergdahl of most or all his veterans' benefits.

The 31-year-old soldier from Hailey, Idaho, was brought home by President Barack Obama in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Obama said at the time that the U.S. does not leave its service members on the battlefield.

Republicans roundly criticized Obama, and Trump went further while campaigning for president, repeatedly calling Bergdahl a traitor who deserved death.

The actress said she dropped Guillod as a manager immediately.

Barth claimed Guillod made sexual advances toward her on previous occasions and only went to the noted dinner because actress Felisha Terrell was going.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

Self-harm, such as self-poisoning or self-injury, is the strongest risk factor for subsequent suicide, and suicide is the second most common cause of death before age 25 worldwide, the study team notes in the journal The BMJ.

""We found an increase in self-harm among girls aged 13-16 years of age not seen in any other age groups amongst girls or any of the age range we investigated among boys,"" lead author Catharine Morgan told Reuters Health in an email.

""We are unable to say for certain why this rise was observed. It may be a combination of an increase in girls actually reporting the self-harm or it may be a reflection of an increase in psychological distress among girls of this age group,"" said Morgan, a researcher at the University of Manchester.

Regardless of the reasons for this rise, we hope the study improves the awareness of the potentially growing problem of psychological distress in all young people, she added.

BEE STINGER GETS STUCK IN TEEN'S THROAT

""We hope parents, grandparents, teachers and healthcare providers through the study may be more mindful of self-harm and the mental wellbeing among young people,"" Morgan said.

There is little current data on how common self-harm is, the study team writes. One 2012 study in Australia found that 8 percent of adolescents under age 20 reported having harmed themselves at some time, they note.

To assess the more recent prevalence of self-harm and whether kids are receiving adequate treatment for psychological distress, Morgan and her colleagues analyzed UK electronic health records covering 647 general medical practices. Children and teens ages 10 to 19 who had harmed themselves between 2001 and 2014 were included in the study.

Almost 17,000 kids and teens had harmed themselves at least once, and about 73 percent were girls. Just over 84 percent of the incidents were drug overdoses and about 12 percent were self-cutting episodes. Between 2 percent and 3 percent poisoned themselves, and the remaining 1 percent of incidents involved hanging, suffocation, jumping and scalding.

Roughly one in five of these kids harmed themselves again sometime during the year after their first episode, researchers found.

During the study period, annual reports of self-harm rose among both boys and girls, but the increase was greatest, at 68 percent, among young girls. In 2011, about 46 of every 10,000 girls ages 13-16 reported self-harm, but by 2014, that figure was 77 per 10,000 girls.

Overall, annual rates of self-harm were 37.4 per 10,000 girls and 12.3 per 10,000 boys.

The research team also found high rates of depression and anxiety disorders among the kids who self-harmed. About one-third of the girls and one-quarter of the boys were diagnosed with depression, for example.

Less than half of the kids reporting self-harm received referrals to mental health services, however. And teens who lived in the most economically deprived neighborhoods were 23 percent less likely than others to be referred for mental health care, the authors note.

When researchers compared a subset of 8,000 kids who had harmed themselves with more than 170,000 similar children who hadn't harmed themselves, they found that kids who had self-harmed were nine times more likely to later die from unnatural causes including suicide and drug or alcohol poisoning.

""Self-harm behavior is complex and resources for children, parents, and teachers are constantly being updated,"" Morgan said, adding that parents should know there is help out there and expert advice as to how best to approach the problem.

""The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has an excellent website that talks about reasons why young people may self-harm, how to spot the warning signs including the physical and emotional signs of self-harm,"" she noted. (http://bit.ly/211tWtK)

“The reds, oranges and yellows in the fall and the incredible colors in the spring are a staple of what comes to mind when people think about Tennessee or visit here,” said Kevin Triplett, the commissioner of the state’s Department of Tourist Development, in a press release.

“But to realize, through red/green deficiencies and other forms of colorblindness, there potentially are more than 13 million people in our country alone who cannot fully appreciate the beauty our state has to offer, we wanted to do something about that,"" he added.



“The colorblind-less viewfinders,” as they’re called, were unveiled on Nov. 1, and they’re reportedly equipped with special lenses for “alleviating red-green color-deficiencies.”

Judging by a short video the department posted to YouTube, the technology appears to work incredibly well, too.

MUSICIAN SEES COLOR FOR FIRST TIME WITH SPECIAL GLASSES

Jim Nichols, who reveals in the video above that he suffers from a more extreme version of colorblindness than most, was overcome with emotion after looking through the viewfinder.

“I’m glad to have seen it. I just wish I had seen this all my life,” Nichols said through tears. “Kinda like what I would imagine the difference between here and heaven.”

Another colorblind traveler said he finally understood what all the foliage-based fuss was about.

“I mean, I really feel like now I know why people come from miles and states around just to see this,” he said.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

“Cohen has always looked up to police officers. He is so sweet and has always had the biggest heart,” said Cohen’s mother, Mandy Brooks Chastain. “He loves superheroes and thinks of police officers as real life superheroes.”

And while it’s tough to get a 3-year-old to sit still for five minutes, little Cohen was so moved by the event that he stood at attention, on a stool, for two hours.

“He made us so proud,” his mother said.

Cohen’s mother wasn’t the only one impressed by Cohen’s actions. The Floyd County Sherriff’s Office, where Hearne started her career, noticed little Cohen’s adorable salute and wanted to reward him for his dedication.

On Tuesday, the officers presented the 3-year-old with an electric toy police car, complete with flashing red and blue lights and a personalized “Deputy Cohen” sticker on the front. They also gave the family a framed photo of Cohen saluting at the procession.

Cohen excitedly drove his new toy and recited the pledge of allegiance, rousing applause and “good jobs!” from the officers.

“We wanted to bless Cohen for his selfless act of support and love,” The Floyd County Sherriff’s office wrote in a Facebook post. “But, once again, we were blessed by him beyond measure. God bless you abundantly and keep you safe Cohen!”

Carla de Vries, from Norwalk, California asks the Nazi leader for an autograph before she quickly pecked him at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

The Nazi leader was keen to watch the event, sitting next to General August von Mackensen, after German Jewish athletes had been banned form participating.

Cara, who had travelled through Europe trying to take a photo of Hitler at a close range, was desperate to get close to the leader so she asked for his autograph.

After she managed to burst through lines of Schutzstaffel police guards, she manages to land a smacker on his cheek - on her second attempt.

Hitler is captured humorously tried to evade her advances as he willingly signs his autograph before she is pushed away by a laughing General Mackensen.

The 20,000 strong crowd at the Berlin Olympics allegedly burst into applause as she returned to her seat.

Carla – who was married to a Dairy farm owner called George – later said: “Why, I simply embraced him [Hitler] because he appeared so friendly and gracious.

“I don't know why I did it. Certainly I hadn't planned such a thing. It's just that I'm a woman of impulses, I guess.

“It happened when I went down to take Hitler's picture with my small movie camera.

Hitler was leaning forward, smiling, and he seemed so friendly that I just stepped up and asked for his autograph, which he wrote on my swimming ticket. He kept on smiling and so I kissed him.""

After the incident, Hitler was furious about the incident for their failure to halt the woman.

Several of Hitler’s Schutzstaffel guards were dismissed in disgrace whilst several more were demoted in rank.

“And I sure don’t need therapy but stating my opinion and defending my friend Jeremy.","While Hollywood big shots like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and many more are having allegations of sexual harassment and assault dropped on them, model and actress Joanna Krupa claimed many accusers are just trying to make money.

The Blast caught up with the former “Real Housewives” star on the streets of Los Angeles Wednesday and asked about the ongoing conversation about sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. When the conversation turned to the recent allegations against her friend, Jeremy Piven, Krupa sounded off on what she believes to be a rush to take advantage of the situation.

“I love Jeremy Piven, like I’ve known Jeremy Piven for a very long time,” she told a crowd of paparazzi. “He’s like the nicest f---ing guy I’ve ever met.”

As previously reported, Piven has been accused by reality star Ariane Bellamar of sexual harassment while working on the HBO series ""Entourage.” Krupa, however, says that she’s never experienced any negative behavior from the 52-year-old actor.

“I think people are taking advantage of the whole situation with Weinstein, and they’re trying to make a living or they’re trying to get famous,” Krupa said. “Jeremy never did anything wrong to me. He’s always been an amazing friend to me, so I support him.”

The star went on to say that she knew about Weinstein more than 10 years ago, but doesn’t have any issues with him. However, she says she hoped that the conversation would lead to an environment where people get jobs in showbusiness based on talent alone.

Since the interview, Krupa has reacted publicly to someone on Twitter who posted a Page Six article about it and criticized her reaction.

“Clearly, YOU! @joannakrupa are the one that needs therapy. Women are taking advantage of Weinstein scandal,” a user wrote.

“Maybe read the whole thing before making stupid comments.

The stunning revelation by longtime operative Donna Brazile that the Hillary Clinton campaign secretly took control — literal control — of the Democratic National Committee a year before Hillary became the party’s nominee is the talk of American politics.

As it should be.

Brazile’s piece in Politico describes her shock at the discovery of formal legal paperwork between the two entities when she took the reins at the DNC in August 2016. Brazile had been tapped for the job when DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. Leaked e-mails had shown how Schultz had been putting her finger on the scale to help Clinton while the insurgent Bernie Sanders campaign was making a serious bid to seize the party nomination away from New York’s favorite carpetbagger.



Her account features ridiculous and unbelievable melodramatics — she says she “gasped” when she found out the truth and that she “lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music” to calm her before she called Bernie Sanders to deliver the awful news.

But silly though Brazile’s prose is, her account is vitally important not only for all those who want to understand how American politics works but also for the future of Brazile’s beloved party.

First, it raises key questions about what was happening as Hillary Clinton faced a time of trial in the middle of 2015. Her reputation was taking hits as her evasions and denials and untruths about what had happened to the private e-mail server she had set up illegitimately in 2009 seemed to mushroom on a daily basis.

As this was happening, she found herself with only two semi-serious challengers for the nomination — Sanders and former Maryland Gov.

President Donald Trump gave a wide-ranging interview on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” Thursday, revealing his thoughts on this week’s terror attack in New York City and the campaign actions of the Democratic National Committee.

Trump responded to claims from former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile alleging that the committee rigged last year’s Democratic presidential primary between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders.

“It's illegal, number one, and it's really unfair to Bernie Sanders,” Trump said of the Vermont senator. “I’m not a Bernie Sanders fan, although I must say I got a lot of his votes when he was thrown out.

“That dossier, which is totally fake and made up it’s like a novel … is a disgrace and it should not have been allowed to be used and then I hear the kind of money they spent,” Trump said, referring to reports Democrats paid as much as $9 million on it. “I think it’s a disgrace that a thing like that can take place.”","'Ingraham Angle' Exclusive: Trump Calls DNC Primary-Rigging 'Illegal,' Slams 'Fake' Dossier",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/ingraham-angle-exclusive-trump-calls-dnc-primary-rigging-illegal-slams-fake-dossier

When the first daughter arrived in Japan on Thursday, she was greeted by dozens of black suit-wearing female bodyguards from Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department.

“Women have to work more than twice as much to compete against men, but she has led her father’s business successfully while raising kids,” one women told The Japan Times in January.

With all the attention being lavished on Ivanka – at least four television stations in Japan live-broadcast her arrival at Tokyo’s airport – the security team is there for more than just looks. During a training drill for the media earlier this week, the security team quickly pounced on a woman who broke free from a crowd near the Imperial Palace Gardens in central Tokyo in a mock attempt to bring a present to a certain “VIP.”

Ivanka is in Japan to speak at the World Assembly for Women conference in Tokyo in advance of her father's arrival Sunday.

An unforgettable last night in Tokyo! Thank you Prime Minister Abe for the warm hospitality and the belated birthday wishes 🎂 A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Nov 3, 2017 at 6:15am PDT

Speaking Friday, Ivanka addressed her trademark issues of female entrepreneurship and women’s economic advancement, while also praising Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ‘Womenomics’ agenda that aims to get more women in the workplace.

The U.S. president's daughter also addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women in Hollywood and other industries in the United States.

""All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,"" she said. ""This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.”

While the policies of President Trump – who left Friday on his own trip to Asia – have made Ivanka’s fashion line one of the most negatively perceived brands in the U.S. (a recent YouGov survey ranked it one of the bottom 10 brands in the U.S. by consumer perception out of 1,600 companies), there is a much different perception of her in Japan, China and other Asian nations.

Sales of her fashion line have skyrocketed in Japan and China over the last year and dozens of Chinese businesses have filed for trademarks to use Ivanka’s name to sell everything from wallpaper to alcohol.

Dr. Joel Myers, the founder and chairman of AccuWeather, said next week's forecast could spread lingering radiation and threaten nearby countries with contamination from the Hermit Kingdom’s Sept. 3 nuke test.

“As winds pick up out of the northwest over the next few days, it is possible that any radiation that leaks from the site [where the nuclear test took place] could be carried and dispersed across the Sea of Japan and even to the Japanese islands,” Myers said.

The AccuWeather chairman said he believed the rogue regime purposely tested nuclear weapons on days when the wind was moderate.

""One might speculate that North Korea conducted these nuclear tests purposefully on days with light wind conditions, so that any resulting radiation leakage would remain within its borders and would go undetected internationally,” Myers said.

Myers noted, however, that North Korea’s luck may have run out.

""We know from other news reports that there has been an accident at the nuclear test site, and the situation that North Korea may have anticipated with radiation being contained within North Korea has changed,” Myers said.

Japanese TV reported the nuclear site, Punggye-ri, had destabilized following Pyongyang's most recent test, and the site’s tunnels reportedly collapsed on Oct. 10 killing hundreds of people.

North Korea denied the report.

AccuWeather reported North Korean soldiers and families were exposed to radiation following the tunnel’s collapse.

Myers said the radiation could travel to the Japanese island of Hokkaido and far-northern Honshu -- and possibly farther south by the weekend.

A week after the Sept. 3 nuke test, South Korea's nuclear safety agency said it found traces of xenon gas, a radionuclide, in the environment, Yonhap News Agency reported.

Meanwhile, South Korean officials reported detecting “active movement” at a Pyongyang missile research facility that indicated Kim Jong Un’s regime may be planning a new missile test, Yonhap News Agency reported. Punggye-ri test site’s tunnel 3 was also reportedly ready to conduct another nuclear test despite reports questioning its stability.

Manafort and a longtime business partner, Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty to all 12 counts against them. Manafort is under house arrest after posting an outrageously high bond of $10 million. Gates’ bond was set at $5 million. George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign, has pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI about his foreign contacts with several top Russian officials.

Predictably, the major media are celebrating this as the beginning of the end of the nascent Trump presidency. Within hours of the announced indictments, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof rushed into print with a column titled “Will Manafort Sing? If so, it may mark the beginning of the end of this presidency.”

Look for more of this wishful thinking that the establishment, the Democrats and all of the mainstream media have been hoping for since Trump won the election.

What Manafort stands accused of has nothing to do with the 2016 election, or with Russian “collusion.” No one, so far, has produced any evidence the Russians affected the election’s outcome. This is all about overturning the results and keeping “the swamp” full for those who live in it and reject change.

Real collusion might be in the significant share of U.S. uranium sold to the Russians during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state (she signed off on the deal), followed by a $500,000 fee paid to her husband for a speech in Moscow and the millions of dollars that subsequently flowed into the Clinton Foundation from uranium investors.

Special counsel Robert Mueller and Congress should investigate that Russian connection, along with the role of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign (and the earlier Republican role) in creating an anti-Trump dossier that has been shown to be a fraud and yet was used to justify the appointment of Mueller. If the reason for Mueller’s appointment is fraudulent, how can it be said that his investigation, which includes staff attorneys who made donations to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, is not tainted?

Among the many problems with this investigation is that it has no legal, subject or monetary limits. If Mueller and his associates are unable to prove collusion with the Russians, one can count on them coming up with something else. Far-left members of Congress, such as Maxine Waters, D-Calif., openly state that their objective is to “take out” the president, and they don’t mean to lunch.

There is also the matter of leaks from the grand jury. Not surprisingly, the details of the indictments matched the leak to CNN. Unless that network employs mind readers and engages in paranormal activity, those leaks are felonies and the leakers should be prosecuted.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are firing up investigations of their own, including long-overdue looks into various questionable and possibly illegal activities by the Clintons. Congress is the proper avenue for such investigations, not special counsels, who can “go rogue” if they wish.

These seemingly endless accusations and investigations are what so much of the country hates about Washington, the “D.C.” that increasingly seems to stand for “dysfunctional city.”

No matter which party controls government, the other party does all it can, by whatever means, to undermine those elected. This behavior solves no problems. It is only about grabbing and holding onto power.

Given the many moving parts in the Mueller probe and the loss of focus on the primary reason for it, the government may have a difficult time proving its case in court. But with unlimited funds and a staff of lawyers who have Democratic affiliations, you can bet they will try to make more than a ham sandwich out of it.","Cal Thomas: Trump, Mueller and Manafort -- Get ready for more magical thinking",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/02/cal-thomas-trump-mueller-and-manafort-get-ready-for-more-magical-thinking.html

Around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jake Henderson reported that he was worried his wife was suicidal and requested the assistance of emergency medical services.

Everything appeared to be fine. There [were] no signs of violence. Everybody said they were okay. Nobody was suicidal.”

Three hours later around 2:30 a.m. Thursday the husband reported that he woke up and realized his wife had shot the children.

Hillhouse told the station Friday that Sarah Henderson also tried to shoot her husband.

“The pistol misfired and that’s when he was able to take the pistol away from her and call law enforcement,” the sheriff said.

He said Sarah Henderson had been planning the shooting for at least two weeks and that the motive was still under investigation.

The sheriff told WFAA-TV that Sarah Henderson said little after the shooting.

“The only thing she told us was that she had smoked some marijuana early in the evening,” Hillhouse said. “She was very blunt. We just don’t have any answers as to why.”

A family member told the station Sarah Henderson had been acting erratically in the last couple of weeks.

Texas child welfare workers interviewed her in 2010 which would have been the year KayLee was born, the station reported.

Neighbors heard Sarah Henderson yelling at her kids all the time, Fox 4 reported.

Photos of a two-door Rubicon model with the roof removed reveal a new roll cage design that includes a fold-down windshield that leaves the A-pillars in place, which makes it easier to open and close than the current version. The doors still come off, too.

Technical details have not yet been revealed, but there will be a variety of roof options on both two-door and four-door models, and three engines: a 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo, 3.6-liter gasoline V6 and likely a 3.0-liter six-cylinder turbodiesel.

The Wrangler remains a body-on-frame truck with front and rear solid axles. A manual transmission and manually-operated 4x4 system will be offered, and can be seen in the Rubicon photos, but an electronic full time all-wheel-drive system is expected to be on the options list for the less hardcore off road models.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



Jeff Flake last week took to the Senate floor to proclaim that since he would not be “complicit or silent” in the Trump presidency, he will not seek re-election. The first-term Arizona senator bemoaned that as a “traditional Republican,” he had a “narrower and narrow path” to office in this Trump world.

The speech earned Mr. Flake all the plaudits you’d expect, from all the usual suspects. Conservative Never Trumpers and the media “resistance” believe the president is destroying the Republican Party, the country, democracy and the universe—in that order. Those who join in their daily denouncements of Mr. Trump receive standing ovations. Those who don’t are falsely accused, to quote Mr. Flake in his speech, of “complete and unquestioning loyalty” and duly excommunicated from “moral” conservative society.

Yes, Mr. Trump is a wrecking ball; and yes, conservatives have a right and a duty to worry about the damage he may do to the Republican Party and its principles. Where the Never Trumpers err is in insisting that the only response is full-on resistance, shaming and utter denunciation. Not only is that approach simplistic, it is a proven loser.

Mr. Flake is a case in point. Among elected officials, he is rivaled perhaps only by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as loudest Never Trumper. The senator doesn’t like the president’s views on trade or immigration (join the club). But like Mr. Kasich, he has rarely bothered to spell out specific areas where he disagreed with Mr. Trump, or to note the significant points of agreement (deregulation, judges, etc.). His is a blanket condemnation. In Mr. Flake’s new book, “Conscience of a Conservative,” he compares Mr. Trump’s politics to a “late-night infomercial.”

This sweeping reproof was a sign to Trump supporters in Arizona that Mr. Flake either didn’t know or didn’t care why they support this president. So they wrote him off—much as he wrote off Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake was never going to get Democratic support, and once he alienated half of his state’s Republican voters, of course his path to re-election was narrow. Mr. Flake blew himself out of office, and he is now in a much poorer position to make any difference in the shape of Washington policies or the future of his party.",A Tale of Two Republicans,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/tale-two-republicans

“Honestly, they should be looking at the Democrats,” Trump told reporters minutes before heading out on a 13-day trip to Asia.

The president’s comments followed a morning tweetstorm in which he repeatedly criticized political rival Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

“Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!” Trump wrote. “It’s the real story on collusion.”

Asked if he would fire Sessions if the DOJ doesn’t free up agents to investigate the DNC, Trump responded “I don’t know.”

“A lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me,” he added.

Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. On Monday, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates were indicted on 12 counts including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agent Registration (FARA) statements, false statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts.

Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his dealings with Russians reportedly offering “dirt” on Clinton.

The White House has repeatedly sought to turn the attention of the probe, which is looking into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, to Clinton and her campaign.

Earlier Friday, Trump said the American public ""deserves"" a federal investigation of Clinton and the DNC over a joint fundraising agreement they signed in August 2015.

Trump's accusations follow publication by Politico of an excerpt from former acting DNC Chair Donna Brazile's upcoming book. Brazile alleges she found ""proof"" that the 2016 Democratic primary was rigged in Clinton's favor. Brazile writes that she believes no laws were violated, but that a fundraising agreement ""looked unethical.""

The president tweeted, over a 3 1/2-hour span Friday:

--""Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..""

--""New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...""

--""People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!""

--""The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!""

--""Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept."" (He meant Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., whom he has disparaged as ""Pocahontas"" because she has mentioned having American Indian heritage.)

--""Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!""

--""I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.""

-- “The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!”

Late Thursday, Trump tweeted without evidence that he believed Democrats had acted ""illegally.""

The fundraising agreement Brazile wrote about, which was signed in August 2015 during the primary process, allegedly gave the Clinton campaign oversight of some DNC decisions. Months later, Clinton's chief challenger, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, signed his own agreement with the party.

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

Mexican newspaper Reforma reported this week greedy organized crime cells obtained agriculture ministry records of avocado producers in the early 1990s and have used the data to track down farmers. They force them to pay a percentage of their earnings or risk kidnapping or death.

“This was a system of intelligence that involved reviewing records from the agriculture ministry to know who the farmers with ample avocado production were, where their orchards were located, and how much they reported their sales by export,” the attorney general’s report said.

It continued: “The avocado producers were imposed a quota and those that resisted, or the families of those, were kidnapped or murdered as pressure until they ceded.”

According to Reforma, the whole scheme was started by the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel and Los Cuinis – a criminal group led by Abigael Gonzalez Valencia. The group was once called the richest cartel in Mexico, and the avocado scheme was seen as an alternative form of income to trafficking.

Eventually other drug cartels, such as the Knights Templar and the Michoacana Family began, copying the strategy, Reforma reported.

“The avocado producers were imposed a quota and those that resisted, or the families of those, were kidnapped or murdered as pressure until they ceded.” - Mexican attorney general report

The practice quickly became profitable for cartels, who charged upwards of $100 per hectare and 10 cents per pounds of avocado sold, Being Latino reported. The farmers had to sell their produce at a higher price to make ends meet.

The increased consumption of avocado in the United States over the past five years has been a boon for the industry.

Americans ate 1.9 billion avocados last year, up 57 percent from five years ago, according to the Hass Avocado Board, an industry trade group.

Mexico supplies approximately 82 percent of the avocados eaten north of border, with domestic producers in California making up the rest, Bloomberg reported.

The USDA reported that Mexican avocado exports have gone up 400 percent since 2005, resulting in more than $2.2 billion in profits last year.

Researchers made the discovery after determining the sex of 95 woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) whose remains were found across different parts of Siberia. In all, 66 of the specimens (69 percent) were male, while just 29 (31 percent) were female, they found.

The woolly mammoth lifestyle may be the cause of this skewed sex ratio. Inexperienced male mammoths were more likely to travel alone, away from the herd, so perhaps it's no surprise that these males were more likely to stumble into danger and die as a result, the researchers said.

But there is an upside to these pachyderms' untimely deaths: Being buried in a natural trap — such as a bog, crevice or lake — tended to preserve their remains for thousands of years, allowing researchers to discover and study them.

""Most bones, tusks and teeth from mammoths and other ice age animals haven't survived,"" study researcher Love Dalén, a professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said in a statement. ""It is highly likely that the remains that are found in Siberia these days have been preserved because they have been buried, and thus protected from weathering.""

The discovery is part of a larger, long-term project researchers are undertaking to study the genomes of woolly mammoth populations. Some of the analyses required knowing the sex of the mammoths, and the results were unexpected, the researchers said.

""We were very surprised because there was no reason to expect a sex bias in the fossil record,"" lead study researcher Patrícia Pečnerová, a doctoral student of bioinformatics and genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said in the statement. ""Since the ratio of females to males was likely balanced at birth, we had to consider explanations that involved better preservation of male remains.""

The findings suggest that, like modern elephants, woolly mammoths had matriarchal hierarchies. As such, mammoth herds of young and female mammoths were likely led by an experienced adult female, the researchers said. Male mammoths, also like modern elephants, likely lived in bachelor groups or spent time alone, engaging in risky behavior, they said.

""Without the benefit of living in a herd led by an experienced female, male mammoths may have had a higher risk of dying in natural traps,"" Dalén said.

This discovery — that seven of every 10 mammoths found in natural traps were male — sheds light on the socioecology and behavior of these extinct animals, the researchers said. It's also a reminder that uncovered specimens don't necessarily represent a random sample of a species, they noted.

The study was published online today (Nov. 2) in the journal Current Biology.

The president and first lady departed the White House Friday morning, stopping to chat with reporters on their way to Air Force One.

“We are about to begin a long trip,” Trump said, noting that the White House had extended the trip, and added an extra day in the Philippines. “We have a big conference, a second conference. And I think we’re going to have great success.”

Trump said that he would be talking about “trade,” and the threat of North Korea.

“We’ll be enlisting the help of a lot people and countries and we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “But I think we’re going to have a very successful trip. There is a lot of good will.”

According to administration officials, the president’s trip will be the longest trip to Asia by a president since 1991, when President George H.W. Bush was in office.

The president's trip comes amid the first charges in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.

Trump said again Friday before boarding Air Force One that there was ""no collusion.""

Minutes after take-off, the president tweeted details of his trip.

""Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor. Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines. Will never let you down!"" Trump said.

The president’s first stop, before heading overseas, is in Hawaii, where he will meet with U.S. Pacific Command, and visit Pearl Harbor and the Pearl Harbor memorial.

By Sunday, the president will be in Japan, where he is slated to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for meetings. As they did at Mar-A-Lago, Trump and Abe will play a round of golf at a country club in Japan—this time, joined by the world’s No. 4 golfer, Hideki Matsuyama.

Trump’s visit in Japan, according to the White House, will include meetings with service members and bilateral meetings.

The president is also expected to meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s rogue regime.

Trump and Abe spoke earlier this week, and “affirmed the important of promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” and “maintaining close coordination” between the United States and Japan, and with the international community “to maximize pressure on North Korea.”

The president’s next stop will be South Korea, where he will have a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Trump will meet with service members, and also is slated for a speech at the National Assembly in Seoul.

A senior administration official told reporters during a White House background briefing this week that there was not enough time in the president’s schedule to accommodate a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, which has separated North Korea and South Korea for 64 years.

Instead of the DMZ, Trump will visit military base Camp Humphreys, which is set 40 miles south of Seoul, to highlight the U.S.-South Korean partnership.

The president’s trip to South Korea comes amid escalating tensions and rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea.

Trump said in his United Nations speech in September that he would “totally destroy” the rogue nation, if necessary. He also has continually dubbed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “little Rocket Man.”

Trump’s next stop is China, an important visit that will draw much attention amid the president’s expected requests for Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump is expected to ask Xi, whom he hosted at Mar-A-Lago earlier this year, to impose limits on oil exports and coal imports with North Korea, as well as broader limits on financial transactions with the regime, Reuters reported. China is responsible for more than 90 percent of all trade with North Korea.

“Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!” Trump tweeted last month.

Trump’s next stop is Vietnam, where he will take part in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) events, according to the White House.

Trump will go to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi for an official visit and bilateral engagements with President Tran Dai Quang and other senior Vietnamese leaders.

The final stop for Trump is the Philippines. The president was only slated to be in the Philippines for one day, but on Friday announced an additional day.

Trump is set for a bilateral meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of human rights abuses, including killing suspected drug dealers. The White House has said that Trump could raise concerns with the program, though Duterte and Trump shared a “warm rapport” during a phone conversation.

While in the Philippines, the president will also attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 50th anniversary dinner. ASEAN consists of ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Trump will celebrate the 40th anniversary of U.S.-ASEAN relations at the U.S.-ASEAN Summit and participate in bilateral meetings with Duterte and other leaders.

“The president’s trip will focus on three goals,” National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters at the White House press briefing Thursday. “First, strengthening international resolve to denuclearize North Korea. Second, promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Third, advance American prosperity through fair and reciprocal trade and economic practices.”

McMaster added that the president would “reiterate the plain fact” that North Korea is a “threat to the entire world,” also promising that Trump would continue to call on “all responsible nations” to isolate the North Korean regime “economically and politically.”

While the iPhone discrete calling is a good idea, it may add to the confusion.","An iPhone 8 Plus I’m testing has called 911 by accident a few times. It’s annoying, but it turns out this new iOS “feature” could save lives. Experts say discrete calling is a sign of things to come in making 911 calls work a little better and a little safer, especially in a tense situation.

Apple introduced the feature in iOS 11 recently, and on the new iPhone 8.

It’s still a work in progress, however.

iPHONE X HITS STORES, APPLE NEARS $1 TRILLION MARKET CAP

The “feature” lets you call 911 by pressing the power button and either volume button at the same time. For example, if you’ve been kidnapped or you’re in a hostage situation, you can press the two buttons without having to open the dialer and press 9-1-1.

It does not like cup-holders, though. Placing the wider iPhone 8 Plus in the holder -- which is what many people do when they drive -- has triggered a 911 call at least five times.

To test the theory, I used the iPhone 8 Plus in the cup holders of a Dodge Durango and a smaller VW Tiguan, but the buttons activated by accident in both cars.

IPHONE X REVIEW ROUNDUP: SHOULD YOU BUY?

Fortunately, there’s a way to disable discrete calling in the iPhone settings. And, you can activate a countdown and a siren that plays before you actually place the call. Just head to the Emergency SOS section and enable the features you want to use.

Apple iPhone expert Konstantin Makarov, the Chief Operating Officer at IGotOffer.com, a marketplace for selling gadgets, says the alarm sound is both good and bad. It can prevent 911 calling mistakes, but also means you can’t make the call discreetly.

“If you do accidentally call 911, don't hang up,” Makarov said. “Stay on the line and let 911 operators know that it was an accidental call. If you hang up, they may think it is an emergency and track the location of the call to send help or call back to verify the emergency.”

MORE THAN 300 IPHONE Xs STOLEN FROM DELIVERY TRUCK, POLICE SAY

911 calls can be costly in some states. In California, making repeated 911 calls by accident can cost about $200 each infraction, he says. In Michigan, charges are much higher if anyone is injured while responding to the 911 call -- there can be a $50,000 fine, he says.

Tech expert and analyst Rob Enderle says discreet calling and other 911-related features are helpful, especially since you can place the call even when the phone is in your pocket or purse. He questioned whether Apple has advertised this feature enough. And, making the calls by mistake is a bigger problem than most people realize.

“About 40 percent of the calls to 911 are mistakes made from cellphones,” he said. “That’s around four million calls a year and at $8,000 each.” Fortunately, he says, most fees are waived.

APPLE FACE ID: TECH PROFESSIONALS UNSURE ABOUT SECURITY BENEFITS, RESEARCH SAYS

Security expert Henderson Cooper says 911 calling does have other issues. One is coverage. He says it is frustrating for those in an a life-threatening situation, even after all of these years and with technology improving at such a rapid pace, that you can still hear a recording.

I told them I'm no actor and these people are getting on here saying I molested this actor name corey feldman.","Corey Feldman revealed the name of one his sexual predators to Dr. Oz on Thursday.

The '80s star said the man who attacked him when he was 14 years old is named Jon Grissom, an actor who had bit parts in some of Feldman's films including ""License to Drive"" (1988) and ""Dream a Little Dream"" (1989). He is listed as John Grissom in his IMDB account. His full name is Cloyd Jon Grissom.

Prior to the singer's revelation on the talk show, Feldman wrote about the alleged pedophile in his 2014 autobiography, ""Coreyography: A Memoir,"" identifying Grissom by a false name, Ron Crimson, as advised by his lawyers at the time.

However, Grissom, who has been suspected by some on social media for several years, addressed speculation that he was Feldman's predator.

Grissom presently lives in Mexico. He is 55 years old and is a convicted sex offender with his conviction dating back to 2003.

Feldman warned Hollywood pedophiles issuing a message, ""Now is your time. Be a man for the first time and come forward yourself. Turn yourself in. Let it be known... If you do not we’re coming for you.""

The 46-year-old told Dr. Oz he informed the Santa Barbara Police Department in 1993 the names of attackers in Hollywood.

Kelly Hoover, public information officer for Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office, told Fox News, ""We are aware of the statements that Mr. Feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. Our records do not indicate that he named any suspects. If he has any information regarding a crime or crimes that occurred, we encourage him to contact our office or his local law enforcement agency.""

Feldman instead called the Los Angeles Police Department while on Dr. Oz with the intention of naming alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. The call was not allowed to be recorded for confidentiality reasons, but the actor claimed he would cooperate with any investigations going foward.

Feldman and Grissom did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Following the Dr. Oz appearance, some social media users falsely identified a man sharing the name John Grissom as Feldman's alleged predator. He wrote on Facebook about the identity confusion.

""This message is to all my friends. I want you all to know Google got my picture up with my name and underneath of that they got actor.

The program awards about 50,000 green cards every year to immigrants chosen at random from among millions of applicants. Congress created it in 1990 to encourage immigration from countries that traditionally have sent small numbers of people to the United States. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) drafted the language creating the program when he was a member of the House of Representatives.

The Diversity Visa Lottery Program has been in the crosshairs before. The so-called Gang of Eight amnesty bill in 2013 would have eliminated it as part of a broader package. The Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, this year to switch to a merit-based immigration system, also would eliminate the program.

President Donald Trump argued for its elimination in a he released last month as part of any deal to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants brought to America as children.

Trump blasted the program on Twitter on Wednesday after reports that Sayfullo Saipov, accused of killing eight people and injuring 15 by driving a pickup truck down a bike path in Lower Manhattan, came to the United States from his native Uzbekistan in 2010 through the diversity lottery.

""The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,"" he tweeted.

Schumer, the Senate minority leader, responded on the Senate floor by knocking Trump for trying to cut off federal funds to New York City and other so-called ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions that do not fully cooperate with immigration authorities.

""Instead of dividing, instead of politicizing, do something real, Mr. President,"" he said. ""Restore these funds. Now.""

Citizens of Uzbekistan have been among the greatest beneficiaries of the lottery program. Statistics from the State Department indicate that 3,356 people from the former Soviet republic received visas through the program the year Saipov came in 2010. In fiscal year 2016, 2,378 Uzbeks won the lottery, making Uzbekistan the fifth highest of any country.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in 2011 placed Uzbekistan on a list of ""specially designated countries that have shown a tendency to promote, produce or protect terrorist organizations or their members."" Three other countries on that list -- Egypt, Iran and Sudan -- ranked in the top seven nations with the most diversity lottery winners in fiscal year 2016.

""Clearly, there is a terrorism vulnerability angle for this program that is greater than other programs,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Krikorian noted that the diversity lottery accounts for a disproportionate share of immigrants from several countries on the list. The program makes up about 5 percent of all immigration but 58 percent of migrants from Uzbekistan and Algeria came from the program in fiscal year 2015, he said. It was 26 percent of immigration from Turkey and 27 percent form Sudan.

Krikorian pointed to numerous reports of people using fake documents to enter through the diversity lottery.

""The lottery is even more susceptible to fraud than other immigration programs,"" he said.

Chris Chmielenski, director of content and activism at NumbersUSA, said terrorism is only one concern.

""It is broader than that,"" he said. ""We're talking about a world power, and we simply have a random lottery ... It's simply ridiculous.""

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), one of the sponsors of the RAISE Act, renewed calls on Wednesday for its passage.

""I hope we can include this area of common ground as we work to fix our broken immigration system and strengthen our national security,"" he said in a statement.

The program requires applicants to have a high school degree or equivalent and must submit to a background check, but other than that, Chmielenski said, there are few strings attached. He said there is no consideration given to whether the lottery winners will bring skills or education that could improve the United States.

""It doesn't serve the national interest,"" he said. ""It doesn't help the economy. It doesn't help workers at all.""

Chmielenski noted that a commission headed by Barbara Jordan, a former Democratic congresswoman from Texas, called in the 1990s for scrapping the program. He said NumbersUSA also has polled on the issue.

""It has very little support amongst the American people, especially among voters,"" he said.

But Democratic politicians tend to opposed eliminating the program unless it is tied to a broad amnesty.

""This is not an issue that is resolved in a tweet or my interview with you right now right now,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Wednesday. ""This is part of comprehensive immigration reform.""

Krikorian said the program has its roots in efforts by Democratic members of Congress to protect illegal immigrants from Ireland who did not qualify for the 1986 amnesty passed by Congress. He said the Congressional Black Caucus has fought to protect it because its members see it has a way to promote more immigration from Africa.

""The whole concept is repellant,"" he said. ""This program was created for identity-politics reasons and now persists for different identity-politics reasons.""",'Diversity' Visa Program to Blame for NYC Terror Attack,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/01/diversity-visa-program-to-blame-for-nyc-terror-attack.html

Scullin, who served as a pallbearer at the woman's funeral, was arraigned Friday on charges including aggravated murder and tampering with evidence.

Around 800,000 people die a year from suicide, according to the World Health Organization. It’s currently the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. among people between the ages of 15 and 24.

But a new study is using brain scans and AI to show how someone experiencing suicidal thoughts thinks differently about life and death. The results were published in Nature Human Behavior.

“What is central to this new study is that we can tell whether someone is considering suicide by the way that they are thinking about the death-related topics,” Marcel Just, the study’s co-lead author, told CMU.edu.

Researchers looked at 34 participants, 17 of whom were experiencing suicidal thoughts. Each person underwent brain imaging with an MRI machine while being shown a series of words that were related to different emotions. Ten words had a positive emotional relation, such as “carefree,” 10 were negative, like “trouble,” and 10 were related to suicide, including “desperate” and “hopeless.”

Based on the participants that were already considered suicidal, the researchers were able to map five regions of the brain and six words that could identify someone as suicidal. Next they devised an algorithm to spot the same thing.

The algorithm correctly identified 15 of the 17 suicidal patients and 16 of the 17 members in the control group.

Researchers then applied the algorithm to the group of participants experiencing suicidal thoughts – half had previously attempted suicide and half had not. The algorithm correctly identified 94 percent of the participants who had attempted suicide.

“Further testing of this approach in a larger sample will determine its ability to predict future suicidal behavior,” said David Brent, co-head author of the study. “And could give clinicians in the future a way to identify, monitor and perhaps intervene with the altered and often distorted thinking that so often characterizes seriously suicidal individuals.”

As a result, founder and big cheese John Schnatter sacked the NFL’s ""poor leadership"" and said “the NFL has hurt us.'” He took his popular pizzas and his saucy attitude and went home, pulling his ads associated with the NFL for now.

Schnatter lost $70 million, which Forbes described as “Papa John Loses Dough,” after his company’s stock took a dive over bad sales numbers this week. The CEO refused to take a knee (take a knead?) and instead blamed the NFL anthem protests. Schnatter blasted NFL leadership for letting the protests continue and for “not resolving the current debacle.”

Debacle was being kind. It better describes the Cleveland Browns, who are merely winless (0-8 but who’s counting?). Unmitigated disaster might be more accurate. The NFL has lost fan support, jeopardized advertisers and spent the season getting blitzed by the media.

Papa John’s and Schnatter were both roasted when he dared to speak out. The left-wing site The Root said: “Papa John’s Sheds White Tears Over Lagging Pizza Sales, Blames NFL Protests.”

Formerly suspended ESPN SportsCenter host Jemele Hill mocked Schnatter on Twitter, writing: “Sorry racial injustice couldn’t be ended as easily as adding an extra topping and a side of ranch.”

Sporting News dumped some extra hots on the story, trying to link Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to the Papa John’s move. “Was Cowboys' Jerry Jones behind Papa John's NFL protest complaint?,” it asked.

SI served up even more conspiracy in the piece, noting: “Jones, according to Pro Football Talk, is a significant Papa John's franchise owner with more than 100 stores as of 2014.”

Pizza Hut has even responded, claiming that its sales have not been impacted. Business Insider did note that there is a difference between pizzas and pizza chains. “Papa John's is the official pizza of the NFL.

In both contests, Republicans and Democrats have recently hit each other over immigration-related issues, including sanctuary cities, where local policies protect illegal immigrants from federal deportation.

In Virginia, the race between Republican nominee Ed Gillespie and Democratic nominee Ralph Northam has gotten particularly nasty in recent weeks, with each side accusing the other of running ads that are out of line.

Earlier this week, a liberal group called the Latino Victory Fund released a television ad showing immigrant and minority children in Virginia being chased down the road by a man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie bumper sticker.

The group eventually took the ad down after the terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed when a man intentionally mowed them down in a truck.

“Virginians respect and appreciate civil discourse, but the Latino Victory Fund’s ad was far out of bounds of the civility Virginians expect and deserve,” Gillespie campaign manager Chris Leavitt said.

Meanwhile, Democrats have protested ads from Gillespie accusing Northam of voting for bills that would lead to sanctuary cities and a threat increase from the MS-13 gang.

Northam’s campaign has accused Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, of being a “mini-Trump” whose ads “demonize” immigrants.

WHITE HOUSE SLAMS DEMOCRATIC AD IN VIRGINIA WHERE MAN IN TRUCK CHASES MINORITY CHILDREN

“From his toxic ads to his embrace of Trumpcare, Ed Gillespie has transformed himself into Virginia’s very own mini-Trump,” Northam spokesman David Turner said.

As Gillespie has embraced illegal immigration as a campaign issue, President Trump has tweeted his support for Gillespie in the race.

“Ralph Northam, who is running for Governor of Virginia, is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities,” the president tweeted last month. “Vote Ed Gillespie!”

Yet in New Jersey, Trump has not spoken out in support of Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is running against Democratic nominee Phil Murphy.

Guadagno has spent the campaign railing against sanctuary cities, releasing an ad drawing attention to Murphy’s debate comments in support of New Jersey being a “sanctuary state” and telling the story of an illegal immigrant who was convicted of killing several students in 2007.

“Murphy doesn’t have our backs,” the ad’s narrator says. Referencing criminal illegal immigrants, the narrator continues: “He has theirs.”

Like Northam in Virginia, Murphy has responded by accusing Guadagno of taking a page from Trump with her emphasis on the issue.

“Kim Guadagno should be ashamed of herself for the way she’s politicizing the deaths of three children and painting a community with the broad brush of a murderer, a tactic she must have gleaned from President Trump,” Murphy said in response to the ad. “To say the least, these are not New Jersey’s values.”

In both states, the candidates are battling to succeed two well-known governors, Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey and Democrat Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.

Heading into Tuesday’s vote, Democrats have the advantage, according to recent polling. The Real Clear Politics polling average has Northam leading Gillespie by 3 points in Virginia; in New Jersey, the polling average has Murphy ahead of Guadagno by 15 points.","Virginia, New Jersey gubernatorial candidates spar over sanctuary cities as contests near finish line",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/03/virginia-new-jersey-gubernatorial-candidates-spar-over-sanctuary-cities-as-contests-near-finish-line.html

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?","Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.

Taking care of your car or truck’s transmission is important for its long-term health. But all too often, car owners misunderstand the basic maintenance that’s needed to keep a gearbox running smoothly. Consumer Reports’ chief mechanic, John Ibbotson, explains what you need to know.

Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The simple answer is “yes.” But service intervals for new vehicles can exceed 100,000 miles before this needs to be done.

That makes this seemingly clear-cut advice something of a conundrum for car owners. Those who don’t hold on to a new vehicle for very long may never have to have the transmission fluid changed.

On the other hand, factoring in that service is good advice for any owner who plans to keep a vehicle for an extended period of time—or for someone who has bought a used car with high mileage.

The time and cost involved vary from car to car. According to Repair Pal, a CR partner, getting this work done on a 2010 Camry in Rochester, N.Y., should cost $163 to $242.

Whatever the price might be, it’s necessary work. Getting the fluid replaced is certainly going to cost you less than replacing a transmission that’s been left in the lurch by skimping on service requirements. Failing to properly maintain your car’s transmission could leave you stranded and with a big repair bill.

Simple online tools can be invaluable when it comes to knowing whether your car or truck has been subject to any recalls. Other than regular service, your transmission might be due for some important repairs—or have an extended warranty—because of a past recall. (Go to the CR Car Recall Tracker.)

How Often Do I Need to Have My Transmission Fluid Changed?

The best advice is to know your car and the manufacturer’s recommended service intervals.

It’s worth noting that intervals for changing transmission fluid vary widely. For some cars and trucks, it can range from as little as 30,000 miles to more than 100,000 miles. Some new vehicles, especially those fitted with automatic gearboxes, have transmissions that are almost sealed shut, with fluid that’s meant to last the lifetime of the car.

Remember that unlike engine oil, transmission fluid should never burn off. And a tell-tale sign of a transmission leak will be a puddle of red liquid on the ground, usually underneath the middle or front of the car.

Should I Have My Mechanic Flush My Transmission Fluid?

First, it’s helpful to understand the role transmission fluid plays in a car’s operation. Transmission fluid helps keep mechanical components cool and lubricated, whether it’s an automatic or manual gearbox. Over time, the transmission’s interior components wear down and tiny particles contaminate the fluid. This could potentially lead to damage.

Getting rid of this dirty fluid makes sense, right? If it’s called for in the service manual, go ahead and let your mechanic do the job.

“This shouldn’t be a frequent occurrence, since a gearbox in good working order would not have metal shavings polluting the fluid over a short period of time,"" Ibbotson says. ""If that’s the case, it’s likely a sign of a bigger and more complicated problem.”

“There is also a distinction between simply draining and refilling a transmission versus power-flushing the system,” he adds. “In a high-mileage car, power-flushing the transmission fluid can dislodge sludge and other particles, leading to clogs even after the clean fluid has been added.”

Again, the best advice is to research your vehicle and know exactly when a transmission drain (or flush) is recommended. Doing either option too often is a waste of time and money.

Does My Manual Transmission Need Fluid, Too?

Yes, even a manual needs transmission fluid. The type of fluid can vary from car to car, however. Some manuals require conventional engine oil and others function best with automatic transmission fluid. So make sure you’re putting in the fluid that’s specified for your car. Failing to do so can rapidly affect its performance and the gearbox’s longevity.

Car owners with a continuously variable transmission (CVTs) will also want to pay special attention to the needs of their vehicle. Unlike a traditional automatic that has a set number of gears, a CVT often relies on a belt or pulley system to operate an infinite number of gear ratios. Make sure you use a CVT-specific fluid or you’ll risk big headaches (and repair bills) down the road.

How Do I Know Whether My Transmission Fluid Needs to Be Changed?

Checking transmission fluid isn’t always easy. In many cases, it’s necessary to have a mechanic put your car on a lift for examination. Some cars do have a transmission dipstick or reservoir in the engine bay, so check under the hood first.

Even though fluid levels might look fine, it could be harder to discern whether there are pollutants or small metal particles in the fluid. “If your car is in for routine maintenance, ask your mechanic to check the transmission fluid,” Ibbotson says.

Separating transmission maintenance from breakdowns is trickier. In a malfunctioning automatic, gearshifts might become more abrupt and occur at awkward intervals. For a car with a manual gearbox, the feel and action of the gear lever could become stiffer and more balky in regular daily operation. These types of problems probably indicate an issue with the gearbox itself. If you experience any of them, let your mechanic know right away.

Is Changing the Transmission Fluid an Easy DIY Job?

It can be a complicated and messy task for the average car owner. “Accessing the transmission requires ramps, jackstands, or a lift,” Ibbotson says. “Even then, getting to the fill plug can require a higher degree of patience and dexterity than what’s required for a typical change of engine oil.”

Many modern cars—the ones with fluid guaranteed for the life of the vehicle—have transmissions that are basically sealed tight, making them all but impossible to work on for the average DIY’er.

However, the cast members weren’t always on good terms. The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that back in 1980 Somers asked for a pay hike from $30,000 an episode to $150,000, which was equal to what Ritter was receiving.

However, ABC offered a $5,000 hike instead. The network and the then-34-year-old actress battled it out and consequently the network fired her.

The stunning revelation by longtime operative Donna Brazile that the Hillary Clinton campaign secretly took control — literal control — of the Democratic National Committee a year before Hillary became the party’s nominee is the talk of American politics.

As it should be.

Brazile’s piece in Politico describes her shock at the discovery of formal legal paperwork between the two entities when she took the reins at the DNC in August 2016. Brazile had been tapped for the job when DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign. Leaked e-mails had shown how Schultz had been putting her finger on the scale to help Clinton while the insurgent Bernie Sanders campaign was making a serious bid to seize the party nomination away from New York’s favorite carpetbagger.



Her account features ridiculous and unbelievable melodramatics — she says she “gasped” when she found out the truth and that she “lit a candle in my living room and put on some gospel music” to calm her before she called Bernie Sanders to deliver the awful news.

But silly though Brazile’s prose is, her account is vitally important not only for all those who want to understand how American politics works but also for the future of Brazile’s beloved party.

First, it raises key questions about what was happening as Hillary Clinton faced a time of trial in the middle of 2015. Her reputation was taking hits as her evasions and denials and untruths about what had happened to the private e-mail server she had set up illegitimately in 2009 seemed to mushroom on a daily basis.

As this was happening, she found herself with only two semi-serious challengers for the nomination — Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.",Did Hillary's Rigging at the DNC Push Biden Out of the Race?,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/03/did-hillarys-rigging-dnc-push-biden-out-race

Maxwell, 26, was arrested Saturday in Scottsdale, Ariz. after officers received a call about a person with a gun. The MLB player is accused of aiming a handgun at a female delivery driver’s head as he opened the door of his residence, The Mercury News reported.

Maxwell reportedly lowered his gun and took the food, according to court documents obtained by ABC15.

The woman called police after she left his home and retreated to her car.

Officers reported Maxwell appeared to be intoxicated and wrote a “strong odor of intoxicating liquor emanated from his breath” when they arrived to the MLB player’s home, court documents stated. The officers also said Maxwell raised his voice when he was speaking, “was verbally aggressive, used excessive profanities and made anti-police statements,” ABC15 reported.

Maxwell denied aiming his gun at the woman, but said he pulled the handgun from his pants. He told officers he canceled his order. The restaurant told police Maxwell did not cancel his order.

Maxwell was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.

Maxwell was held in Maricopa County jail but posted the $10,000 bail. His court appearance was slated for Nov. 6, NBC Bay Area reported.

The Oakland Athletics released a statement regarding Maxwell’s arrest

""We were disappointed to learn of the allegations. We take this situation and ongoing investigation seriously,"" the A's said in a statement. ""We are gathering information from the proper authorities and do not have further comment at this time.""

WAITER: MLB CATCHER BRUCE MAXWELL MADE UP STORY ABOUT SERVICE REFUSAL OVER ANTHEM PROTEST

Maxwell, 26, hit .237 with three home runs and 22 RBIs in 76 games this season. He was projected to be Oakland's starting catcher next year.

Last week, Maxwell claimed during a visit to his hometown of Huntsville, Ala., that he was refused service at a restaurant because he knelt during the national anthem before a game in Oakland, Calif.

But a waiter told Fox News that Maxwell was “outright lying,” about what happened.

“I didn’t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,” waiter Matt Henry said.

The Scottsdale Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

On Wednesday, the 100-year-old veteran got his recognition and finally his money, too.

Almeda received the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin also announced at a Capitol ceremony that Almeda was getting a check, 72 years after the war ended.

Shulkin's announcement drew gasps from some of the hundreds in attendance at the Gold Medal ceremony, which House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., acknowledged was ""long, long overdue.""

Almeda, dressed in his military cap, told the crowd he was glad to be able to accept the medal, noting that ""many have passed away waiting for 75 years for this time to come.""

Almeda said he and other Filipino veterans have long ""felt unrecognized for fighting for our country,"" adding, ""I wondered why"" since he and his fellow soldiers had brought ""victory during a long war in the Philippines.""

The gold medal signified that his service — and that of thousands of other Filipino veterans — is recognized, Almeda said, calling himself a warrior who ""will never quit.""

Almeda was a 24-year-old teacher when he joined the Philippine Commonwealth Army in 1941. After the war, he resumed his career as a teacher and was granted U.S. citizenship in the 1990s. In 2003, he began receiving medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs under a law aimed at Filipino veterans.

But Almeda, now 100 and living outside Washington, has been fighting for nearly a decade to receive a $15,000 lump-sum payment promised to Filipino veterans under the 2009 economic stimulus law.

Almeda was among more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers who served alongside U.S. soldiers in World War II, including more than 57,000 who died. After the war ended, President Harry S. Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans.

Only recently have the veterans won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the gold medal.

Ryan said the Capitol ceremony was more than ""a feel-good story of delayed recognition. We are here to immortalize the legacy of great liberators, who have paved the way for generations to follow.""

The ceremony — and the gold medals — should ""serve to ensure that those who fought for freedom are never forgotten, and always remembered,"" Ryan said.

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said Filipino veterans enlisted for World War II ""knowing full well that the enemy could discover who they were and retaliate against their families.""

Even after their service ""was practically erased from American records ... these veterans never gave up,"" Hirono said. ""They organized and fought for what they had earned.""

In 1990, Congress awarded U.S. citizenship to thousands of Filipino veterans and later extended VA benefits to them. The 2009 stimulus law authorized the lump-sum payments, although in some cases missing or poor records blocked the payments from being made.

""After bravely serving our country, it is frankly shameful that these veterans had to fight so hard for what they were promised,"" Hirono said.

Today, only 18,000 Filipino veterans are still alive.

""We are living in tumultuous times, and we have many disagreements,"" Hirono said, ""but we agree that it is our responsibility as public servants and Americans to honor each veteran in the same way they honored our country.""",Filipino WWII veterans awarded Congressional Gold Medal,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/25/filipino-wwii-veterans-awarded-congressional-gold-medal.html

More than eight years after Bergdahl walked off his base in Afghanistan -- and unwittingly into the clutches of the Taliban -- Bergdahl walked out of a North Carolina courtroom a free man Friday. Bergdahl, who pleaded guilty to endangering his comrades, was fined, reduced in rank to E1 and dishonorably discharged -- but he received no prison time.

Trump, aboard Air Force One en route to meetings in Asia, tweeted his disapproval of the sentence.

""The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military,"" Trump wrote.

As part of the sentence, Bergdahl will forfeit his pay of $1000 per month for ten months.

Bergdahl was shaking and appeared emotional as the verdict was quickly read.

Prosecutors had requested a 14-year prison term following a week of emotional testimony from the survivors who were wounded during missions to find Bergdahl after he left the base in June 2009. Bergdahl's defense team has asked for no prison time.

Bergdahl faced up to life in prison for desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Wearing a blue dress uniform, Bergdahl appeared tense during the short morning session. He clenched his jaw as if grinding his teeth, then grimaced and looked at the floor when he walked out of the courtroom.

In closing arguments, defense attorneys argued that Bergdahl already had suffered enough confinement during five years of brutal captivity by Taliban allies. They asked the judge for a dishonorable discharge and no prison time. Their argument for leniency also cited harsh campaign-trail criticism by Donald Trump and Bergdahl's mental disorders.

Capt. Nina Banks, a defense attorney, said it wouldn't be justice to rescue Bergdahl from the Taliban ""only to place him in a cell"" now.

""Sgt. Bergdahl has been punished enough,"" Banks added. ""Sgt. Bergdahl paid a bitter price for the choices that he made.""

During the multiday sentencing hearing, Bergdahl himself testified that he was sorry for the wounds suffered by searchers. He also described brutal beatings by his captors, illness brought on by squalid conditions and maddening periods of isolation, most of it in a cramped cage.

A psychiatrist testified that Bergdahl's decision to leave his post was influenced by a schizophrenia-like condition called schizotypal personality disorder that made it hard to understand consequences of his actions, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder brought on partly by a difficult childhood.

Prosecutors asked for a sentence of 14 years in prison, citing serious wounds to service members who looked for Bergdahl.

""Sgt. Bergdahl does not have a monopoly on suffering as a result of his choices,"" said Maj. Justin Oshana, a prosecutor. Contrasting Bergdahl to the wounded searchers, he added, ""The difference is, all the suffering stems from his choice.""

Oshana also cited Bergdahl's own words to argue against the idea that his thinking was clouded. On a courtroom monitor he displayed quotes from an initial investigation after Bergdahl returned to the U.S. Bergdahl, who has said he walked off to draw attention to problems with his unit, described to an investigating officer how he envisioned the missing-soldier alert unfolding.

Bergdahl had said that the call goes ""all the way up to Army command, it goes to Air Force, it goes to Marines. ... It goes to every high point and everybody finds out about it.""

Bergdahl pleaded guilty Oct. 16. The judge has wide discretion on sentencing because he didn't strike a deal with prosecutors to limit his punishment. A bad conduct or dishonorable discharge would deprive Bergdahl of most or all his veterans' benefits.

The 31-year-old soldier from Hailey, Idaho, was brought home by President Barack Obama in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Obama said at the time that the U.S. does not leave its service members on the battlefield.

Republicans roundly criticized Obama, and Trump went further while campaigning for president, repeatedly calling Bergdahl a traitor who deserved death.

Closing the immigration lottery system immediately is an important step, but we will need to do far more than this in order to be truly safe.","President Trump is right: We should end the diversity lottery for immigration. It is an absurd system for randomly selecting who should come to the United States. The lottery system should instead be replaced with a merit-based system that actively seeks people who will help grow the American economy.

Instead of continuing liberal, politically correct immigration rules that emphasize what the left calls “diversity,” we need a system that focuses on an individual’s merit, work and achievement. What a person can contribute to America should be more important when making immigration decisions than whether he or she fits some political science mantra of diversity.

However, in light of the terrorist attacks in New York, Orlando, San Bernardino, Boston and elsewhere, closing the lottery loophole isn’t enough. We need to take far more decisive steps in improving and securing our immigration system.

First, we need to identify terrorists as enemy combatants. They should be thoroughly interrogated and a new law should be developed so that captured terrorists are not able to benefit from Miranda rights.

As a matter of national security, we need to know who our enemies are and what threats they may pose. This overrides the legitimate principles for defending the innocent in traditional criminal cases.

The Supreme Court has ruled that people who are arrested and questioned by police must be advised of their Miranda rights in order for police to use their statements as evidence. The minimal Miranda warning that police must read to an arrested person before questioning states: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense.”

As a matter of national security, we need to know who our enemies are and what threats they may pose. This overrides the legitimate principles for defending the innocent in traditional criminal cases.

Take, for example, Tuesday’s attack in New York City. Eight people were killed. Twelve people were wounded – and we know who did it. We should have a system in place that enables us to aggressively push to find out what the terrorist knows, who he relates to, and what else we must do immediately to prevent future attacks.

Second, while today's focus is on immigration, we have a disturbingly large number of home-grown American citizens being radicalized. We must develop a new legal framework for dealing with local and imported terrorists alike.

Third, we must find out how people are radicalized in America and cut off these sources of radicalization. This might include, when necessary, monitoring and closing radical mosques that encourage violence. This means police need to be able to proactively monitor potential terrorists, recruiters, and propagandists. Prior to Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City had one of the finest counterterrorism efforts of any city in the world.

This is going to be a long war with radical Islamic Supremacists. Closing the immigration lottery system immediately is an important step, but we will need to do far more than this in order to be truly safe.","Newt Gingrich: Get smart -- Scrap the diversity lottery, be honest about terrorists",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/03/newt-gingrich-get-smart-scrap-diversity-lottery-be-honest-about-terrorists.html

Through thick and thin and a switch to Chinese ownership, it hasn’t left its wagon-loving fans in the lurch, even as other brands have come and gone from the segment to find comfort in the sales reports for their SUVs.

Its latest is the V90, and it’s Volvo’s largest and most luxurious wagon yet. Based on the sleek S90 sedan, the V90 can be filled with all of the premium trim and semi-autonomous gadgetry offered in the sedan. Really, the only difference between the two is their tail ends.

That is, unless you opt for the V90 Cross Country, the jacked-up and ruggedized V90 that will account for the vast majority of the wagon’s sales. Because it’s sort of an SUV. In fact, if you want the regular V90, you have to custom order it. Dealers are stocking their lots with a steady stream of V90 CCs.

They have all-wheel-drive, and you can get them with a 250 hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder or Volvo’s unique and remarkable 2.0-liter supercharged and turbocharged four-cylinder, which delivers 316 hp along with a 30 mpg highway fuel economy rating.

The starting price is $53,295, but expect to see many V90 CCs equipped with pricey options like the $4,500 luxury package with its buttery Nappa leather-upholstered massaging seats, and the $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins audio system, which sounds as ridiculously good as its price sounds ridiculous.

The V90 CC does come standard with Volvo’s Pilot Assist, a feature that uses a radar and a camera to self-steer the car in its lane on the highway without rear-ending the vehicle in front. It’s one of the best systems of its kind, and it works well even if the lines on the road aren’t freshly-painted.

Pilot Assist won’t let you take your hands off the wheel for more than about 15 seconds, but you get the impression that it could. The twistiest roads will eventually trip it up, but I didn’t need to make any inputs along a winding 50-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey, except to change lanes and exit.

Pilot Assist isn’t meant for off-road, but the V90 CC very much is. With 8.3 inches of ground clearance, it rides about two inches higher off the ground than the street-smart version of the V90, which puts it well into crossover country and endows it with a pretty capable rough-road ride without ruining its comfort and handling on pavement.

VOLVO S90 W/PILOT ASSIST TEST DRIVE:

Tall sidewall all-season tires and a $1,200 self-leveling rear air suspension get the CC over big bumps and through deep divots without much pain. I wouldn’t suggest chasing Jeeps onto the rocks with it, but an off-road mode locks it in four-wheel-drive and engages hill descent control under 25 mph to help manage reasonably challenging terrain.

An available 360-degree camera is useful when navigating tight trails, but you’ll want to turn off all the parking sensors that go with it if you’re among the trees. They make a lot of beeps. (So many beeps.)

This won’t be an issue for most V90 CC owners, who will likely be using them more on snowy streets than fire roads. Either way, its snazzy, Scandinavian interior is so nice, you’ll want to do your best not to track in any mess. Especially if you opt for the white carpet. Do so at your own risk.

Since the V90 CC shuns the classic boxy Volvo wagon design, its trunk isn’t as voluminous as it could be, but the space back there is deep and features a power cargo cover to go along with its power tailgate — because if you can afford one of these cars, you’ve probably gotten soft.

In fact, if you have enough money for a V90 CC, you could buy the larger, even higher-riding three-row XC90 SUV and end up with change to spare. So why wouldn’t you?

Most cross-shoppers will. The XC90 is one of Volvo’s top sellers. But the V90 CC does have a few practical advantages, including a low roof for loading bikes and antiques, better fuel economy and more car-like handling. And above all, it’s a station wagon. Some Volvo customers wouldn’t drive anything else.

Davis, who played the first female president on ABC’s “Commander in Chief,” stressed the importance of women taking on political roles.

“If we saw more women on screen holding political office, it would be easier for women to retain political office in real life,” she said.

Davis, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1989 for her role in “The Accidental Tourist” and who delighted moviegoers with her iconic feminist role in “Thelma & Louise,” called for changes in the roles of women in entertainment and society.

“Here is one theory of change that is very powerful and could have an immediate impact… that underrepresentation of women on screen in Hollywood can be changed overnight,” she said.

“The next TV show someone creates… the next [children’s] show that someone creates… it can be instead of two out of six female characters, make them half.

“Media itself can be the cure for the problem that it has created. In other words, we can create the future through what people see.”

Davis, 61, said the media can also change perceptions of how women are treated.

“Right now, it is showing us as virtually second-class citizens. We can turn all of that around,” said the mother of three.

“Let art lead the way in presenting an inclusive and intersectional content, and the real world will be inspired by that, and it’s a simple and easy fix.”

Davis, who founded the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media in 2004 in her ongoing effort to make Hollywood less sexist, said men and women, working together, can overcome biases against women.

“All of us, men and women, can become conscious of our implicit bias against women and work very proactively to overcome it,” she said. “It helps to realize the powerful impact…popular culture had on creating it.

“Men and women — we all were trained unconsciously to think of women not as important…. We have to improve what is going on immediately, and then we can receive the benefits of actual fair representation.”

Her speech comes after weeks of bombshell sexually accusations have plauged some of Hollywood's biggest stars. This week, Dustin Hoffman was accused of groping a film assistant when she was 17 in 1985. Also this week, Jeremy Piven was accused of grabbing an actress' breasts on the set of ""Entourage"" and Kevin Spacey was accused of making sexual advances on two men when they were 14 years old and Spacey was in his 20s. One many accused the star of attempted rape and Spacey has said he is seeking treatment.

The barrage of accusations has prompted many A-list female stars to speak out about the issues women in Hollywood face.

According to her father Jared Smith, Blair’s love for the skies was born in the wake of her parent’s divorce. Twice yearly, Jared flies into Atlanta to pick up Blair and her sister before traveling to Washington, D.C. for week-long visits at his home.

After just two trips, Blair declared that she wanted to be a pilot, so she could fly to her see dad whenever she wanted, Jared told The Points Guy in an Oct. 30 interview.

Receiving a pilot’s uniform for her birthday, Blair began sporting the outfit every time she flew. Jared added that the family would always travel with Southwest Airlines, given their open seating policy. Taken with sweet Blair’s sheer enthusiasm, flight crews began recognizing the girl and treating her as a V.I.P. client.

As evidenced in photos shared by both her father and the airline, Blair has sat in plane cockpits, visited the airlines’ Dallas headquarters, and even gotten wings for her lapel.

Blair and her dad also made it their mission to keep a lookout for female aviators, ever since the 6-year-old told her dad she ""might not make it as a pilot"" after noticing how few female pilots there were on her flights.

Naturally, Blair was ecstatic to finally meet a female pilot over the summer.

Further, Jared is simply appreciative of Southwest’s generosity in fostering his daughter’s love for the high skies.

“I got the impression that something like this hasn’t happened very often for kids of non-employees. A common assumption was that I was a pilot and/or worked for Southwest. When I told people I was neither, they were very impressed that the company did something that cool for Blair,” he told The Points Guy.","Aspiring pilot, 6, dresses in captain's uniform every time she flies",https://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/11/02/aspiring-pilot-6-dresses-in-captains-uniform-every-time-flies.html

Sessions' attendance at the meeting was revealed in court documents released Monday by special prosecutor Robert Mueller. The documents seem to show George Papadopoulos was the adviser who offered to set up the meeting. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this week to lying to federal investigators.

Sessions has been quiet on his involvement at the session, despite being asked about it multiple times during several appearances on Capitol Hill.

A source familiar with the meeting told Fox News that it “seems clear that the people who remember the conversation believed that Papadopoulos was proposing a prospective idea of using his ‘Russian contacts’ to try to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin, which was immediately rejected by then-Senator Sessions.”

The source added, “At the time, of course, Papadopoulos was some 29-year old that nobody had ever heard of and who struck people in the room as someone who didn’t have a lot of credibility. As far as Sessions seemed to be concerned, when he shut down this idea of Papadopoulos engaging with Russia, that was the end of it and he moved the meeting along to other issues.""

The same documents that disclosed the meeting show Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contact with Russians during the 2016 campaign.

Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.
And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us.

I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts.","Loving big is a way of life around our house. Everyone is welcome. Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

There was no evidence Ostrem had ever worked for Walmart, spokesman Ragan Dickens said.","A Colorado man suspected of fatally shooting three people inside a suburban Denver Walmart is due to make his first court appearance Friday.

Scott Ostrem, 47, appears in Adams County District Court to hear what charges he is facing. He is not required to enter a plea at the advisement hearing.

Police say Ostrem is suspected of walking into the Walmart in Thornton, a large blue-collar suburb about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Denver, and fatally shooting two men and a woman late Wednesday.

He fled from the scene and was arrested early Thursday after a brief car chase near his apartment, which is located about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the store.

A Walmart spokesman said Friday that company officials had yet to determine when the store will reopen.

Police have released very little information about Ostrem, who abruptly left his job hours before the attack. Neighbors described him as loner who often seemed angry. A supervisor at a roofing company where Ostrem worked before abruptly walking off the job hours before the attack described him as a quiet and talented worker

Killed were Pamela Marques, 52, of Denver; Carlos Moreno, 66, of Thornton; and Victor Vasquez, 26, of Denver.

None were Walmart employees, and all were Hispanic.

Ostrem is white. Police offered no possible motive for the shooting other than to say there was nothing to suggest it was related to terrorism.

Residents of the Samuel Park Apartments building where Ostrem lived described him as a rude man who kept to himself.

""He didn't seem to have anybody,"" said Teresa Muniz, one of his neighbors. ""Being angry all the time. That's what he seemed like, always angry.""

""We didn't even know his name 'til today,"" she said.

Muniz said most of the building's tenants talk to each other, but Ostrem never returned her greetings and swore at people for leaving laundry in communal machines. She also said she sometimes saw Ostrem carrying a shotgun or a bow and set of arrows to and from the building, which faces the back side of a liquor store, a dollar store and a cellphone store.

A Facebook profile that appears to belong to Ostrem lists only one friend, a woman who is from Thornton and who has since moved to Florida.

Little else is publicly known about Ostrem, who police say nonchalantly walked into the Walmart and opened fire, sending dozens of shoppers and workers fleeing in a panic from the busy store.

The morning of the shooting, he left his work station without any explanation and never came back, said David Heidt, his boss at B&M Roofing.

Heidt said Ostrem worked in the company's metal fabrication shop for the last three years without any problems, and he was a good and quiet worker who was skilled at his craft of making metal flashing for roofs.

""We're all bewildered as to where we are now,"" Heidt said.

Ostrem recently ran into financial problems.

In September 2015, Ostrem filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and listed his income for the previous year as $47,028. He estimated that he owed more than $85,000 including credit card debt.

Ostrem had worked for another roofing company in Denver until 2014, said Sandra Runyon, an administrative assistant at Tecta America Colorado Commercial Roofing.

There was no evidence Ostrem had ever worked for Walmart, spokesman Ragan Dickens said.

Ostrem had minor run-ins with police dating back to the 1990s, including a December 1999 charge of resisting arrest in Denver that was dismissed the following year.

He bounced from job to job and has been tied to at least 11 street addresses, including six apartments, in the Denver metro area since 1991.

Now, it seems like a declaration has been made that will directly impact the future of the stars' “Fast and the Furious” franchise.

On Wednesday, the star posted a photo of himself, Johnson and series helmer Vin Diesel on Instagram. In the image’s caption, he issued an ultimatum to no one in particular saying that he won’t appear in the ninth installment of the franchise if the former wrestler signs on.

“Hello world.......... hello loyal fans and loved ones from OUR fast universe........ I’m sorry to announce that if Dewayne [sic] is in Fast9 there will no more Roman Peirce [sic] - You mess with family and my daughters survival I mess with yours.........” the star wrote.

As previously reported Gibson called out his co-star on Instagram when it was announced that the release date for the next movie would be pushed back to, in Gibson's eyes, accommodate a fast-tracked spinoff starring Johnson’s Lucas Hobbs character and Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw. However, it’s worth noting that there has been no official reason given for the decision to push the release date of the ninth movie.

As Page Six notes, this isn’t the first time this week that Gibson’s social media has been in the news. The actor, who played Roman Pearce in the second, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth movies, is currently locked in a custody battle with his ex over their daughter Shayla Gibson. Gibson reportedly posted a video in which he cried and pleaded for his ex not to take his daughter away. Oddly enough, he also seemed distraught that a number of his rich friends weren’t “showing up” to support him and help with the mounting cost of his legal battle. The star claims he’s giving out $13,000 a month in legal fees, so it’s surprising that he’s so willing to walk away from the unexpectedly popular franchise. The video has since been deleted from his account, but TMZ managed to secure a copy.

FLORIDA COUPLE GOES TO TACO BELL FOR POST-WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT

Now the cocked-head, wide-mouthed grin has gone viral on Facebook after the photographer, Tony Bendele, posted them to his Facebook.

“I honestly don’t mind having attention on her instead of me. Dutch and Cricket are such a big part of me, and I will always have a special place in my heart for them,” Womer tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The two horses were a present from her father when she was 8 years old. Her close bond to the two animals and their connection to her father – who passed away in 2016 – prompted her to include them in her wedding. The two escorted Womer up to the ceremony. Dutch, her father’s horse, walked beside Cricket with an empty saddle.

“This just showed that my father was there with me through the whole thing,” Womer, an agriculture science major at Penn State University, said to Yahoo.

Bendele, who has photographed wildlife before, told Yahoo that he’s “never seen a horse doing the smile like that.”

“It actually caught my eye initially when we first started doing the photographs. As the bride was smiling the horse would look up and put its teeth just like that,” he said.

Womer concedes that Cricket isn’t exactly smiling for the cameras.

“Honestly, the horse is just shaking her head trying to get a fly off or something but with her showing her teeth, it looks like she is smiling,” she said.

But people on Facebook have still been enjoying the pictures and many have commented saying they would like to incorporate their own animals into their ceremonies.

To that, Bendele encourages people to make sure they know how their animals will react to large groups and loud sounds.
