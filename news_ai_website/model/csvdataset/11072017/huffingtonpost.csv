Tibetan spiritual leader His Holiness the Dalai Lama has warned the world is in for another century of ""violence"" and ""suffering"" if science isn't used to create peace.

Speaking at a one-day conference on Science, Religion and World Peace in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the 14th Dalai Lama called on world leaders to use science for the ""oneness of humanity"" instead of creating weapons of mass destruction.

SBS reported the Buddhist monk said it's time to reconsider how we use technologies created to kill.

""Science brought the powerful instruments to kill ... (If) situation of the world go continuously then this 21st century also will be similar century of violence, century of suffering,"" he said.

The 82-year-old also spotlighted religion as a factor causing divide across the globe and said we must act with a ""sense of concern of other's well-being and oneness of humanity.""

The Dalai Lama fled from Lhasa, Tibet into India after the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. He continues to live as a refugee in Dharamshala, India where a small Tibetan Government operates in exile.

The Tibetan monk won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and continues to travel the world to advocate for Tibet's autonomy, as well as promoting the Buddhist ideals of peace and compassion.

Reuters reported China recently warned world leaders against meeting with the Tibetan leader.

Zhang Yijiong, who heads the Communist Party's Tibet working group, said ""I hope governments around the world speak and act with caution and give full consideration their friendship with China and their respect for China's sovereignty.""",Dalai Lama Says World Leaders Should Use Science To Create Peace,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/04/dalai-lama-says-world-leaders-should-use-science-to-create-peace_a_23267010/

THE EDITED GUEST LIST

No more agonizing or arguing over whether to invite every single cousin or the fallback of implementing a no-kids policy. Simply invite your parents (or not!) and besties, and be done with it. When the guest list is cut by 90 percent, most people understand if they didn’t make the cut. Will Great Aunt Gloria lose it over being left out? Weigh that against being able to recognize — and be truly happy to see — every face in your crowd.

THE DOABLE DECOR

Lusting after that limited edition French china on Etsy? Go ahead. Buy a set or three. Dreaming of that florist you found on Instagram to make a table arrangement? Go ahead. DM her. When you’re just decorating one table (think: a super-chic dinner party) or one small room (hey, dancing is mandatory for you), the pressure’s off — especially when it comes to your wallet.

THE ANYTHING-GOES ATTIRE

Walking down the “aisle” of a courthouse, a garden, a restaurant or your own backyard doesn’t call for a 25-foot couture train — or the months of fittings that go with it. Want to wear a badass jumpsuit à la Solange? Do your thing. And if you do want the big gown, that’s your decision to make as well. The point is, you’re controlling things, not the dress code or other people’s expectations. (P.S. That also means no need to force your BFFS into matching bridesmaids dresses either. Just sayin’.)

YOU STILL GET TO HAVE YOUR DREAM WEDDING

An incredible cake, dreamy flowers, a photo booth, the playlist you’ve been curating since you were nine? None of these things need to be nixed just because you’re celebrating on a smaller scale. In fact, because there are fewer guests, you can splurge on the things you care about without going bankrupt, whether that’s a chef-made meal or your flower crown.

Of course, the goal is not to ban religious symbols, no one has claimed that.
Here you will be quick to say that this is not what Bill 62 is!
Bill 62 is not that bad.","Dear Minister Jean-Marc Fournier,

I'm not sure how to start this. Polemics are not the way I prefer to spend my writing time. However, after reading your post defending Bill 62, I could not but interrupt my day to retort.

In the post, you present yourself as a voice of reason, one that is concerned with the protection of human rights while at the same time conscious of the ""complexities"" of ""establish[ing] rules for living together in harmony that ensure respect for all.""

Quebec government House leader Jean-Marc Fournier responds to reporters questions at the entrance of a government caucus meeting on Sept. 19, 2017 at the legislature in Quebec City.

Unfortunately, in your attempt to do so, you rely on largely illogical arguments that unwittingly, or perhaps even wittingly, work to wither the ""harmony"" you think Bill 62 ensures.

First, you exclaim that the goal is not to ban religious symbols. I'm not sure why you felt that necessary to say; as if this were some sort of revelation. Of course, the goal is not to ban religious symbols, no one has claimed that. Those arguing against the bill are arguing about the oppressive nature of it, the fact that it unjustly impacts the lives of certain members of the community more than others. What you are calling a ""religious neutrality bill"" is inherently and unfairly charged against one segment of society and not the other. Of course it is not an attack on religious symbols; otherwise, how would you and proponents of the bill get away with hanging a cross in the national assembly?

There is a name for systems that disproportionately affect one religion and treats them differently from others: sectarianism.

What, may I ask, scares you about a woman with her face covered?

Second, you claim that the law is about security. What, may I ask, scares you about a woman with her face covered? Would you have us believe that Quebec is Baghdad and that we must be worried about jihadist impersonators planning to carry out terrorist attacks? Because, if so, we have a lot more to talk about than a woman's choice of clothing.

So what, do tell, is this security concern that is so worrisome that we need to resort to dictating what can and cannot be worn by someone else when navigating mundane social interactions such as receiving public services? And what if someone with their face covered choseto be the person providing a public service? Do they then need to choose between their faith and their want to be active and participatory citizens? Or have we written that off as a possibility altogether through our process of othering?

But maybe we should believe that Quebec is Baghdad, for the entire notion of this bill is to preserve ""harmony."" Of course, this is not to read too much into what you mean when you say that Bill 62 presents ""a way that respects our rights"" — I wonder who ""our"" is. I presume you think that we must be thankful that Bill 62 was passed and has averted the impending civil war bubbling under Quebec's surface! Truly, this bill has saved us all!

Third, you refer to other countries in the occident adopting laws similar to this, an argument that amounts to nothing more than ""all the cool kids are doing it."" Tell me, is this the standard of Canadian politics? The level of the widely debated topics you refer to at the beginning of your piece? Is this what it has been able to muster?

Tell me, do you find images of French policemen unclothing women on their beaches inspirational? Is this something for us to aspire to? Here you will be quick to say that this is not what Bill 62 is! Bill 62 is not that bad. How great of a nation we must be to reduce our debate on human rights to their level of vileness!

Finally, and as with every reactionary, you attempt to reinforce your claim with statistics with no consideration of social forces that may have led to those statistics.

76 per cent of Quebecers support this legislation and so does 68 per cent across Canada. For you, this is a statistic of endorsement, not one that elicits shock. You do not tie it with an overall rise in reactionary-nationalistic sentiment; you do not think that these numbers are reflective of the tremendous failures of Western governments to deal with a problem of their own creation.

No, for you, the people have spoken, and you are just fulfilling their wishes — opportunism.

Mr. Fournier, this post is addressed to you, but it also isn't.

We all, including you as a leader in your community and as a minister working within our government, have a responsibility to encourage mature debate around topics of social cohesion, inclusion and pluralism.

This responsibility is not only to safeguard the rights of minorities, it is a responsibility to stem the moralistic arguments and othering that can make notions of forced inclusion, such as Bill 62, seem palatable.

I really can't wait to see what kind of ""inclusion"" armed officers forcing women to unveil their faces will lead to.

Mr. Fournier: using thinly veiled, sub-par rationalizations such as the ones your piece offers leads to nothing more than a lack of trust in our government which undermines the perception of us being part of a cohesive society. It is this form of rhetoric that is getting in the way of ""promoting inclusion rather than isolation and withdrawal.""

MONTREAL — Two groups have filed a legal challenge to Quebec's Bill 62, saying the face-veil law ""gravely infringes"" the religious and equality rights of certain Muslim women in the province.

The recently adopted law prohibits students from covering their face in class.

It also forces people whose fare requires a card with photo ID to uncover their face before riding public transit, although they can put the veil back on once they've been identified.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and Marie-Michelle Lacoste, a Quebec woman who converted to Islam in 2003, filed the challenge in Quebec Superior Court on Tuesday.

""The Act gravely infringes the religious and equality rights of certain Muslim women in Quebec,"" their court document states.

Law doesn't target Muslims: Quebec justice minister

The challenge takes direct aim at the section of the law that forces public sector employees and private citizens to have their face uncovered when giving or receiving public services.

""This requirement directly infringes the freedom of religion of individuals, such as Muslim women, who cover their faces as a religious practice,"" it said.

""The Act thus precludes certain Muslim women, including affiants in these proceedings, from receiving various public services unless they act contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs.""

Quebec Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee has said the face-veil ban was instituted in order to ensure proper communication, identification and security during the exchange of public services.

The law has been panned across the country by federal and provincial politicians, who see it as targeting a small minority of Muslim women — essentially the only citizens who regularly wear face veils in public.

Vallee has said the legislation doesn't target any religious group and says most Quebecers agree with the principle behind the bill.

When asked recently whether her government had obtained legal opinions and is on stable footing for an eventual court challenge, Vallee simply responded: ""Yes.''

But some people forget that Virginia is still a swing state that elected a Republican governor as recently as 2009, she added.","In Virginia’s gubernatorial race on Tuesday, the Democratic Party has a chance to score its first major political win since President Donald Trump’s election.

Many Democrats worry, however, that the party is going to blow what once seemed like a made-to-order opportunity.

A victory for Democrat Ralph Northam, the current lieutenant governor, would provide the restive party a much-needed dose of optimism. But the consequences of a win by Republican Ed Gillespie, an inveterate Beltway power broker, would have reverberations far beyond Tuesday.

It would signal to Republicans, once wary of Trump’s toxicity, that wielding his brand of right-wing populism is a winning strategy ― even in a state with a popular Democratic governor that Hillary Clinton carried by a 5-percentage-point margin in the 2016 presidential election.

“It will be incredibly demoralizing,” said Yasmin Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committee member who has been volunteering for Northam’s campaign.

Taeb, who organized many of the Washington-based protests against Trump’s ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries, frets that a Northam loss could dull the enthusiasm of many of the people inspired to become politically active by the president’s election.

“If they feel as though they’ve been showing up since January, and it ends up not paying off on Nov. 7, I’m worried that we’ll see a lot of folks dropping off,” she said.

And that could hurt Democrats in other states in the 2018 midterm elections, in which the party hopes that anti-Trump fervor will propel it to gains.

Alex Wong/Getty Images Democrat Ralph Northam hopes to avoid a demoralizing loss for his party in Virginia's gubernatorial election on Tuesday. Polling suggests the race is very close.

If Northam loses, it will not be because of a lack of investment from state and national Democrats. His campaign had raised nearly $34 million as of the end of October, including some $7 million from the Democratic Governors Association. Gillespie, by contrast, had raised $24.5 million, of which some $10 million came from the Republican Governors Association.

The DNC also spent $1.5 million to help elect Northam and other Democratic candidates in the state. The Republican National Committee has spent $5 million to boost Republicans up and down the ballot.

The net result is a race where Northam and Gillespie are neck-and-neck. In RealClearPolitics’ average of major polls, Northam leads by 3.3 percentage points ― a sum within the margin of statistical error in most surveys.

Rather than suggesting a clear favorite in the race, the polling underscores a high level of uncertainty ahead of Tuesday’s results. Recent surveys have shown wildly disparate figures ― one poll showed a 17-point lead for the Democrat, another an 8-point advantage for his rival. Reasons for the disparity likely include differences in methodology and in estimates of who is likely to turn out.

Every statewide candidate officially runs independently in Virginia. But Northam is part of a de facto joint Democratic ticket with Justin Fairfax, running for lieutenant governor, and Attorney General Mark Herring, who is up for re-election. If elected, Fairfax, a 38-year-old attorney from the Washington suburb of Annandale, would be Virginia’s second black statewide elected official. (The first, Democrat Douglas Wilder, served as governor from 1990-1994.)

JIM WATSON/Getty Images Former President Barack Obama spoke at a campaign rally for Ralph Northam in Richmond, Virginia, on Oct. 19, 2017.

As a candidate, Northam, a 58-year-old pediatric neurologist, has emphasized his all-American biography and career. Born and raised on Virginia’s rural Eastern Shore, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and worked as an Army doctor during Operation Desert Storm before building a successful medical practice in the Hampton Roads region of southeast Virginia.

Northam has a long history as a moderate Democrat. He has admitted to voting for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections ― votes he has said he regrets and attributes to his political inattentiveness at the time. As a state senator in 2009, Northam flirted with switching parties, and during his 2011 re-election bid, he described health care as a “privilege.”

Northam’s past stances and initial reluctance to make the race a referendum on Trump prompted a robust primary challenge from former Rep. Tom Perriello. Perriello’s backers included Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as Our Revolution, the legacy organization from Sanders’ presidential campaign. Northam, who had the support of virtually every elected Democrat in Virginia, responded by revving up his anti-Trump rhetoric and tacking to the left on several economic issues. He ended up handily defeating Perriello in June.

In the general election, Northam has run on a relatively mainstream Democratic platform, including protecting women’s reproductive rights, using Affordable Care Act funds to expand Medicaid in the state, continuing to restore the voting rights of felons who have completed their sentences and increasing public education funding. He has touted the state’s strong economic performance under his and Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s leadership. And he has proposed providing free tuition for two years of community college or trade school in high-demand fields like information technology and health care, so long as the people who get their degrees commit to a year of public service of some kind.

Perhaps most of all, Northam has sought to appeal to widespread disdain for Trump in Virginia ― where, according to one recent poll, just 34 percent of residents approve of the job the president is doing.

But at times, Northam has appeared to be straining to appease all sides of the political spectrum. He puzzled observers with an ad promising that if Trump, the man Northam once called a “narcissistic maniac,” is “helping Virginia, I’ll work with him.” And last week, he said that as governor he would sign legisation banning “sanctuary cities” ― municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. His comment dismayed progressives, and prompted one group to call his stance “gutless” and “racist.”

The flap shifted scarce media and activist attention to an internecine dispute in the final days before the election, and prompted hand-wringing about whether Northam was a strong candidate.

“If Northam loses, the progressive left says, ‘Perriello would have won because he would have run as a progressive populist and that’s what the base of Democratic Party is yearning for right now,’” said Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia.

The Washington Post/Getty Images Ed Gillespie survived a tougher-than-expected primary challenge to emerge as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in Virginia.

Gillespie, 56, a former RNC chairman and longtime corporate lobbyist who grew up in New Jersey, personifies the kind of pro-business establishment Republican who is increasingly rare in national politics. As a GOP official and onetime White House aide to George W. Bush, Gillespie pushed the party to become more welcoming to people of color and backed comprehensive immigration reform that would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Right-wing populist and Trump campaign veteran Corey Stewart waged a nasty primary challenge against Gillespie fueled largely by promises to crack down on undocumented immigrants and safeguard Virginia’s Confederate monuments and heritage. Stewart even adopted a Trump-like epithet for Gillespie, deriding him as “Establishment Ed.” Gillespie ultimately prevailed, but by a shockingly close margin of just one percentage point.

Gillespie responded to the near-fatal populist challenge by doing his utmost to shore up the rural right-wing base that turned out for Stewart.

On the campaign trail, Gillespie has stuck to traditional, fiscally conservative Republican talking points. The heart of his platform is a proposal to cut Virginia income taxes by 10 percent across the board, one of several policies he argues will jump-start the state’s economic growth.

But on the airwaves, Gillespie has launched a scorched-earth campaign to paint Northam as an enabler of sexual predators and gangs of undocumented immigrants. In ads rife with racial overtones that began in September, Gillespie argued that policies embraced by his opponent have allowed the El Salvadoran gang MS-13 to run amok in Virginia.

Gillespie’s ads also have said that Northam, as governor, would try to strip Virginia of its Confederate history ― something the Republican stresses he won’t do.

Given Gillespie’s decision to pander to Virginia’s white-resentment-fueled right wing, a victory for him will again show Republicans that racial fear-mongering is a winning electoral strategy, said Kidd, the political science professor.

“Ironically, Republicans have criticized Democrats for two decades at least for running identity political campaigns, but Republicans ran what has by and large been an identity politics campaign with a little economic populism mixed in,” Kidd said. “If Gillespie wins it might mark another front in the culture wars in which Republicans embrace white identity politics.”

Indeed, other Republican candidates across the country are attacking Democrats by tying their policies to gang violence.

A Gillespie victory would almost certainly magnify that effect because it would occur in Virginia, “the place where [Trump] lost,” said Christian Dorsey, a Democrat on the Arlington County, Virginia, board of supervisors.

Sara D. Davis/Getty Images Vice President Mike Pence joined fellow Republican Ed Gillespie at a rally in Abingdon, Virginia, on Oct. 14, 2017. Gillespie decided not to invite President Donald Trump to campaign for him.

Of course, the most concrete impact of a Republican victory would be in the Old Dominion State itself, where McAuliffe has stood as a self-described “brick wall” between Virginians and the socially conservative policies of the Republican-controlled legislature ― particularly efforts to curb women’s reproductive rights. He has vetoed more bills than any governor in Virginia’s history, stymieing legislation that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, restricted voting rights and expanded access to handguns.

For Virginia Democrats, their neighboring state of North Carolina, where a Republican governor passed an infamous “bathroom bill” barring transgender residents from using the public restrooms of their choice, offers a frightening look at what life under unified GOP control could look like. (Following the election of a Democratic governor last year, the state repealed the law.)

“I look at North Carolina and everything that’s happened there and I say, ‘There but by the grace of God goes Virginia,’” said Atima Omara, president of the Young Democrats of America and a DNC member.

In addition, a Democratic loss at the top of the ticket would likely extinguish all hope of making major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates (no state Senate seats are on the ballot). Democrats, who recruited their largest number of House candidates in recent memory, are running in 17 GOP-held districts where Clinton won in 2016. Winning all 17 seats, though unlikely, would hand them control of the legislative chamber.

Even a narrower victory for Northam than had been hoped for could limit the Democratic pickups, said Taeb, the Northam volunteer.

If Democrats can pick up “6 to 8 seats, I would count it as a success,” she said.

But the implications of a Gillespie win extend well beyond the single four-year term to which he would be limited. During his last year in office in 2021, after the 2020 census, Gillespie would have the power to sign legislation redrawing Virginia’s congressional and state legislative districts for another decade.

And partisan gerrymandering is a Gillespie specialty. He helped oversee the GOP’s nationwide push to win control of state legislatures for the express purpose of redrawing political boundaries after the 2010 census to benefit the party. The severely gerrymandered districts that came out of that effort have handed Republicans nearly an unshakable hold on the U.S. House of Representatives and resulted in a net gain of hundreds of state legislative seats.

A Democratic governor could, by contrast, veto a Virginia redistricting plan offered by the Republicans and use the “bully pulpit” to inveigh against efforts to unduly favor the GOP, Dorsey said.

Omara of the Young Democrats of America remains “optimistic” that Virginia’s increasingly diverse demographics, disapproval of Trump and significantly stronger turnout in the primary bode well for Northam. But some people forget that Virginia is still a swing state that elected a Republican governor as recently as 2009, she added.

“We are a good reflection of what the country looks like,” Omara said. “We are a purple state. We have to fight for every vote.”",Democrats Are Terrified Of Losing Virginia's Big Election.

A Winnipeg woman will need extensive dental work after being punched in the face by a stranger on the bus — all because she tried to intervene in a case of sexual harassment.

It all started shortly after Aisha Walker boarded the number 11 bus in Winnipeg on Saturday evening. An ""intoxicated, homeless man"" soon began aggressively sexually harassing a young woman, Walker wrote on GoFundMe.

""After about 10 minutes of this, I got out of my seat, and positioned myself in between these two people so that the man could no longer speak to her. He was upset that I did this and we began getting into a verbal argument.""

But he wasn't the one who allegedly attacked her.

Aisha Walker says she needs a root canal, a crown, and fillings after being attacked by a stranger on a bus in Winnipeg.

A third passenger got involved, Walker wrote, telling her and the other man that they were both being stupid. When she asked him why it was stupid to stand up for a woman being harassed, he became angry.

The bystander began swearing and shouting that he would be happy to ""step off the bus"" to deal with her.

Walker said when she asked what that would prove, the man punched her ""directly in the mouth at full force.""

Major dental work required

She now has a black eye and seven shattered teeth — some of them are damaged so badly the nerves are exposed.

""It literally hurts to breathe,"" wrote Walker, who works in a bookstore and has a five-year-old daughter.

She started the GoFundMe page to raise money for her dental work — including a root canal and a new crown — as well as extra child care as she recovers. She's since been told by Manitoba Justice that her costs will be covered, so she says she will donate remaining funds to a women's support group or shelter.

I really can't sit by and watch that happen to someone right in front of my eyes. Aisha Walker

Despite the experience, Walker told HuffPost Canada that she won't hesitate to stand up for other women who need help.

""Most, if not all, of my female friends have been either sexually harassed, or sexually assaulted, at one point in their lives. Several of them multiple times,"" she said in an email.

""These are normal women from all different walks of life. After hearing enough stories like that, I really can't sit by and watch that happen to someone right in front of my eyes.""

Das Thema wurde auch im ARD-Talk ""Hart aber fair"" thematisiert

Dort warf CDU-Politiker Meister den Medien mangelnden Kooperationswillen vor - das konnte der Grünen-Europaabgeordnete Giegold nicht auf sich sitzen lassen

Müssen Promis und Politiker nun weltweit erneut zittern? Nach den Offshore Leaks (2013), Lux Leaks (2014), Swiss Leaks (2015) und vor allem den Panama Papers (2016) gibt es eine neue Veröffentlichung zu Steueroasen und dem Vermeiden von Steuerzahlungen durch Reiche. Das Material der Paradise Papers soll sich aus 21 Quellen speisen und rund 13,4 Millionen Dokumente umfassen.

Die Enthüllungen, in Deutschland vorangetrieben von einem Rechercheverbund aus NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" (""SZ""), standen nun am Montagabend zur Diskussion in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber fair"".

Der reißerische Titel: ""Steueroase Europa – wie uns Konzerne und Super-Reiche abzocken!"" Fast zwanzig Minuten lang waren sich die eingeladenen Politiker fast einig. Der CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarische Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, Michael Meister, Grünen-Europapolitiker Sven Giegold sowie Journalist Georg Mascolo meinten: Schuld sind die Steueroasen.

Doch dann attackierte Meister plötzlich den Überbringer der - zumindest für viele Steuerflüchtlinge - schlechten Nachrichten. Giegold konnte den Angriff auf die Medien nicht unkommentiert lassen - und keilte zurück.

CDU-Politiker Meister attackiert die Medien

Am Anfang von Frank Plasbergs Sendung musste vor allem der luxemburgische Außenminister Jean Asselborn einstecken. Der wurde dann auch schnell sauer, dass Luxemburg immer als Steueroase verspottet werde. Er betonte: ""Wir haben keine Briefkastenfirmen mehr!""

Doch Mascolo, Leiter des Investigativ-Rechercheteams von NDR, WDR und ""SZ"" kannte noch weitere Beispiele - deren Daten wohl Finanzstaatssekretär Meister gerne hätte.

""Würden Sie mit den Regierungen kooperieren, wenn Herr Meister fragen würden, die Sachen rüberzuschieben, um darauf gesetzgeberisch zu reagieren?"", fragt Plasberg den Journalisten.

Der zeigt sich hart: Er würde eine Zusammenarbeit ablehnen. ""Die Diskussionen hatten wir schon bei den Panama Papers."" Mascolos Begründung: ""Aus Gründen des Informantenschutz werden die Unterlagen staatlichen Behörden nicht zur Verfügung gestellt.""

CDU-Politiker Meister wollte das nicht akzeptieren - und prescht nach vorne. Aus seiner Sicht gehe es um zwei Dinge: Einerseits um Straftaten wie Geldwäsche oder Steuerhinterziehung, die hinter den Konstruktionen stecken würden. Und andererseits um Modelle, die man als Gesetzgeber noch gar nicht kenne.

""Da ist es sinnvoll zu wissen, was passiert eigentlich"", erklärte Meister. ""Ich wäre dankbar und es wäre auch hilfreich gewesen"", wenn die Unterlagen sowohl der Panama Papers als auch der aktuellen Paradise Papers den Staatsanwaltschaften und Finanzbehörden zugänglich gemacht worden wären - ""und nicht nur darüber berichtet worden wäre"", stellte der Finanzstaatssekretär klar.

Unfähigkeit der Politik, Probleme zu beheben

Die Medienschelte wollte Grünen-Finanzexperte Giegold nicht unkommentiert lassen. ""Die ganze Diskussion ist schon ein wenig absurd"", keilte er gegen Meister.

Die Politik müsste eigentlich dankbar sein. Denn über 30 Jahre habe es diese nicht geschafft, diese Steuerschlupflöcher zu schließen. ""Das jetzt die Journalisten den Druck entfalten, der uns zu dieser Debatte befähigt"", sei Giegold zufolge deshalb nur folgerichtig.

Er verstehe die Haltung der Journalisten vollkommen, ihre Ethik des Quellenschutzes nicht aufzugeben. Giegold unterstrich: ""Ich bin den Journalisten dankbar!""

Allerdings müsse vielmehr ""die Unfähigkeit der Politik"" kritisiert werden, das Problem innerhalb Europas nicht behoben zu haben, ""dass alle ihre Steuern gerecht bezahlen"".

Zumindest das Publikum hatte der Grüne da auf seiner Seite.

And the long assault on civil liberties, which the official United Party opposition went along with and which alone she opposed from within parliament.
Suzman deeply opposed communism, but equally opposed banning the Communist Party.
Helen Suzman, the South African Politician who strongly fought against the apartheid regime and was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize.
We should learn the right lessons and draw the correct conclusions from the extraordinary and well-lived life of Helen Suzman.","Exactly 10 years ago, on 7 November 2007, I telephoned Helen Suzman in Johannesburg from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I was a resident Fellow at its famous university. I called to congratulate her on her 90th birthday and apologise for my absence from the festivities she had organised that evening at the Wanderers Club. I mentioned, in passing, that it was ironic that her birthday coincided -- 7 November 1917 -- exactly with the Bolshevik Revolution -- and that she had managed to outlive both Communism and apartheid.

Helen was gifted with a rapier-sharp wit, and retorted, ""Indeed happy both didn't outlast me, but I'm not so confident that I will outlive the current government in South Africa"" (although the precise language she used was slightly earthier).

On the last observation, she was proven correct. Sections of South Africa today commemorate the 100th birthday of Suzman, the grande dame of both liberalism and parliamentary opposition. But it is worth noting how far South Africa has fallen -- even in the eight years since her death in January 2009, just four months before the election of Jacob Zuma as president of South Africa.

On my last meeting with her in the year she died, she expressed the hope that she would live long enough to see what Zuma ""would do"" as president. Reading the best-seller ""The President's Keepers"" by Jacques Pauw, which opens a sewer on the criminal enterprise over which Zuma presides, it is probably as well that she did not.

The outline facts of Suzman's 36-year career as MP for Houghton are very well known, but no less worth commemorating for that fact: Notably she exemplified singular purpose in pursuit of principle in politics, careful research and facts above highfalutin' rhetoric and philosophising, indefatigable energy and courage in going against the grain and the conventional wisdom of the day.

The context of those times -- from 1953 to 1989 -- from the apogee to the nadir of apartheid -- did not require much more than an opposition mindset, given the appalling nature of the regime she opposed. And the long assault on civil liberties, which the official United Party opposition went along with and which alone she opposed from within parliament. But she also noted, in a foreword to a book of mine ""Hope and Fear"" that the post-apartheid landscape was more difficult to navigate.

Having commended me for ""standing squarely in the great tradition of total opposition to racial discrimination"" to which she dedicated her career, she noted that the current challenge (and this was in 1998) ""was to honestly adapt core liberal values to the challenges posed by majority rule in a deeply divided, highly unequal society.""

The irony to Suzman's memory lies in the person the Foundation has chosen to commemorate her: Kgalema Motlanthe, who at the time of Mbeki's assault on Suzman and her successors, served as ANC Secretary General.

It is precisely this adaption with which the Democratic Alliance today wrestles. The party, on the one hand, has its KwaZulu-Natal leader dedicating the months of Suzman's centenary to Oliver Tambo, and various more liberal members of the caucus virtue signal their core values by quoting Hermann Giliomee's caution to the DA that the party should ""not bat on their opponent's pitch"".

Historian Niall Ferguson noted that it is the ""God of irony who turns the wheel of history"". And it is in the ironies and subtleties of Suzman's life and public career and example that an equally rich trove of observations about our country condition and its prospects can be observed.

First, since she shares her centenary with the famous Tambo, it is worth recalling a famous spat, brought back to life by Thabo Mbeki in January 2005. Mbeki from the height of his presidency and in order to expose the hypocrisy of the official opposition (then led by me) penned the following attack: he quoted Oliver Tambo in 1971: ""Mrs Suzman deserves special mention. This sweet bird from the blood-stained South flew to Zambia and sang a singularly sweet song. I am opposed to apartheid. I am opposed to the isolation of South Africa. I am opposed to violence. I am clearly in favour of a change, but determined to prevent change.""

Mbeki took this further and adapted it to the Democratic Alliance with the observation: ""With these words, Oliver Tambo exposed the great gulf between ourselves and others in the country who, like us said they were in opposed to apartheid and in favour of a change.""

As Suzman noted in a public speech later in 2005, ""Mbeki went further and converted Tambo's letter into a full-scale attack against the official opposition and people who, like me, object to policies which adversely affect our economy, encourage the emigration of skilled people, and discourage investment into job-producing projects which would reduce our appalling unemployment rate.""

Although extremely liberal on civil liberties, Suzman was more conservative on economics and had some mighty disagreements with one of her caucus colleagues -- with whom she did not get on -- Harry Schwarz, who was the opposite: a social democrat but a security hawk. And she certainly had no truck with race-based employment equity, onerous labour relations restrictive practices and other state-based throttles on enterprise and job creation.

This leads to another irony: the Helen Suzman Foundation -- established to honour her political contribution -- is tonight [Tuesday] hosting, quite appropriately, her centenary with a public lecture. But the irony to Suzman's memory lies in the person the Foundation has chosen to commemorate her: Kgalema Motlanthe, who at the time of Mbeki's assault on Suzman and her successors, served as ANC Secretary General.

For it was Mbeki who wrote of Suzman and the current DA, back in 2005 when Motlanthe served alongside him: ""They (Suzman and the DA) fight as hard as they can to ensure that they rather than us should set (the) agenda. They fight to ensure the dominance of their ideas as to what constitutes change... and about the ways and means that should be used to bring about such change.. This is a struggle we must and will continue to take on, namely the political and ideological struggle to determine the dominant ideas for the transformation of our society.""

For Mbeki and Motlanthe the DA was the ideological, class and race enemy. Motlanthe in a similar vein at the same time offered the observation at a May Day rally when he urged ""workers to intensely hate capitalism and to engage in the struggle against it"".

Of course, as I have observed elsewhere, compared to what was to follow, the Mbeki-Motlanthe era seems redolent of a golden age. But clearly, in the mid-2000s, there was a huge gulf between Suzman and the DA on the one side and the ANC on the other. Perhaps by choosing Motlanthe to commemorate Suzman it is a sign that the waters have closed; or that the ANC -- for all its other failings -- has succeeded in Mbeki's words ""to determine the dominant ideas for the transformation of society"".

But this then conjures yet another irony from Suzman's political career. In 1970, she addressed an eve of election rally for her leader Colin Eglin in Sea Point, where he was hoping to win the seat and end her long isolation in the apartheid parliament. Suzman deeply opposed communism, but equally opposed banning the Communist Party. When asked this question and with certain qualifications, she told the audience that she supported the unbanning of the SA Communist Party.

As Eglin noted, his conservative opponent Jack Basson (father of the more famous Whitey) ""plastered the constituency with posters stating the Progressive Party would unban the Communist Party"". Eglin did not share the view that this cost him the seat by just 232 votes, believing Suzman's record contributed to his total. But it proves that she, protest politician par excellence, never felt the need to trim her sails to the gusts of political correctness -- either under apartheid or afterwards.

But Suzman was an intensely human politician and not a saint: Van Zyl Slabbert -- who completely shared her philosophy -- was iced out of her circle for six years when he left parliament believing it could not bring the needed change to South Africa. I suffered a similar period of banishment in 1989 when I upset her plans to handpick her successor in parliament.

But when the DA held a farewell dinner for me in May 2007, she was the star of the gathering. Having warned me that being wheelchair-bound she would only stay ""for half an hour"" she left late in the evening. The circle had been squared.

Reste à savoir si la visite de Donald Trump en Corée parviendra à réchauffer les relations entre les deux pays.","INTERNATIONAL - Se rapprocher de l'ennemi... Ce 7 novembre, la visite asiatique de Donald Trump l'emmène en Corée du Sud. Un pays au cœur de l'actualité du fait des provocations incessantes de la Corée du Nord à l'égard du reste de la planète, mais dont le destin semble pourtant suspendu au bon vouloir de ""l'homme le plus puissant du monde"", le président des États-Unis.

Car la Corée du Sud peine à se faire entendre au sujet de tensions qui la concernent pourtant en premier lieu. Alors que son voisin nordiste ne cesse de perfectionner ses armes et technologies tout en défiant sans relâche la communauté internationale, c'est bel et bien Donald Trump qui se fait la voix -tonitruante en l'occurrence- de l'opposition à Kim Jong-Un.

Or selon un scénario établi par le Pentagone, la Corée du Sud subirait quelque 20.000 morts par jour en cas de conflit armé entre les deux États frontaliers. Un bilan qui serait infiniment plus lourd si le voisin communiste décidait d'utiliser des armes chimiques ou nucléaires. Et justement, cette possibilité seraient rendue chaque jour un peu plus crédible par l'attitude belliqueuse de Donald Trump, à en croire de nombreux Sud-Coréens.

La cote de Trump en berne

Selon un sondage réalisé en juin 2017 par le Pew Research Center, un think tank américain, 78% des Sud-Coréens ne font pas confiance au président Trump. Une autre enquête, réalisée elle fin 2016 par un institut sud-coréen, ajoutait que la proportion de Sud-Coréens estimant que les relations entre Washington et Séoul allaient se détériorer s'était multiplié par quatre entre 2015 et l'élection de Donald Trump.

De nombreuses tribunes ont également été publiées par des intellectuels et des personnalités sud-coréennes pour mettre en lumière la poudrière qu'est devenue, en partie malgré elle, la péninsule. ""Monsieur Trump, je vis en Corée du Sud et vous me terrifiez"", écrivait par exemple un éditeur coréen dans le New York Times, quand un correspondant de The Independent dans le pays assurait que les locaux craignaient bien plus le président américain que Kim Jong-Un.

C'est ainsi que des manifestations ont eu lieu les 4 et 5 novembre à Séoul, en amont de l'arrivée de Donald Trump dans le pays. Aux cris de ""Ne viens pas ici"", ""Trump imbécile"" ou ""Sans Trump, pas de guerre"", des centaines de militants se sont rassemblés à Séoul contre la visite officielle de l'exécutif américain. Nombreux sont les Sud-Coréens qui se demandent pourquoi ils devraient continuer de compter sur la protection américaine alors que les États-Unis semblent de moins en moins privilégier la solution pacifique, n'écartant désormais plus l'éventualité d'un conflit.

""Si une guerre se déclenche, nous allons tous mourir"", explique un manifestant au Washington Post, alors que des clichés d'un Trump grimé en Hitler circulaient dans la foule. ""Nous haïssons Trump, nous aimons la paix et l'égalité"", chantait le cortège. Plusieurs manifestants voulaient notamment alerter l'opinion publique américaine sur la position tenue par Donald Trump. ""J'espère que les citoyens américains regardent ce qui se passent ici. La guerre apporte la tragédie.""

Des menaces qui inquiètent

Au mois d'août, les propos d'un sénateur républicain, Lindsey Graham avaient déjà fait scandale en Corée du Sud. Évoquant la possibilité d'une guerre armée, il avait déclaré : ""Si des milliers de personnes meurent, elles mourront là-bas, pas aux États-Unis."" Un point de vue qui inquiète dans la partie australe de la péninsule.

Ainsi, après les propos décriés de Donald Trump promettant ""le feu et la furie"" à Pyongyang, le président du Sud, Moon Jae-in avait rétorqué dans une allocation télévisée que ""personne ne devrait être autorisé à décider d'une action militaire dans la péninsule sans l'accord de la Corée du Sud."" Une manière de chercher à freiner l'escalade de la violence et d'empêcher le milliardaire américain de précipiter à distance la région dans un conflit dévastateur.

C'est en grande partie sur cette position que le président Moon a d'ailleurs été élu au mois de mai dernier, promettant de s'investir dans le dossier de son encombrant voisin, notamment pour mettre fin à l'hostilité entre les deux pays. Une ambition qui a rapidement été mise à mal par les volontés de Donald Trump d'agir de manière unilatérale.

""Apprendre à dire non aux États-Unis""

Or entre les États-Unis et la Corée du Sud, la relation est particulièrement déséquilibrée. Comme le rappelle le site américain Quartz, en cas de conflit, la Corée du Sud verrait une autre nation souveraine prendre le contrôle opérationnel de son armée. Un cas de figure extrêmement rare, fruit d'un accord entre les États-Unis et Séoul datant des années 1950 et qualifié par un ancien général américain, Richard Stilwell de ""concession de souveraineté la plus remarquable au monde.""

Reste à savoir si la visite de Donald Trump en Corée parviendra à réchauffer les relations entre les deux pays. Il lui faudra pour cela rassurer Moon Jae-in, le président sud-coréen, activiste des droits de l'Homme et fils d'immigrants du Nord, qui se veut bien plus modéré que les Américains et même que les Japonais, eux aussi défenseurs d'une ligne dure vis-à-vis de Pyongyang. Un homme qui veut avant tout que ses compatriotes apprennent à ""dire non aux États-Unis.""

Car comme l'explique David Straub, un spécialiste de l'anti-américanisme en Corée du Sud cité par le Washington Post, les Sud-Coréens n'osent finalement que très peu montrer leur opposition à Donald Trump. ""Je pense que la plupart d'entre eux craignent que des manifestations contre la visite ou des critiques trop directes à son égard ne le mettent en rogne et ne détériorent la situation.""

Theresa May has apologised to victims of sex harassment in Westminster, admitting that “too many” women have been subject to abuses of power “over too many years”. The Prime Minister spoke after she, Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders agreed to introduce new safeguards as early as next month to protect Parliamentary and political staff – amid fresh allegations of historic and current sleaze. A former junior Labour party researcher alleged that a member of Ed Miliband’s office staff had tried to kiss her against her will and left her fearing she would be sacked for refusing him. And a former Tory MP was accused of putting his hand up a journalist’s skirt while they were live on air during Radio 4’s Any Questions programme.

Meanwhile Cabinet Minister Damian Green was interviewed on Monday by a special Cabinet Office ethics chief investigating allegations that he had made inappropriate advances on a young party activist and downloaded ‘extreme’ pornography on his Parliamentary computer. Green denies the claims. May and Corbyn – as well as Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, Green leader Caroline Lucas, the SNP’s Ian Blackford and DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson – met in the PM’s Commons office for an unprecedented cross-party meeting to agree a new complaints procedure for harassment claims. Speaking after the meeting, May said “I’m sorry that we have seen these abuses of power - too many taking place over too many years. “And the fact that they have taken place here at our seat of democracy should be a matter of shame for us all.” “I think if this hasn’t happened to you it’s difficult to appreciate the impact that being a victim of this sort of behaviour can have, it simply has a lasting impact on people.”

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon is the highest profile casualty of the sex harassment scandal, quitting his post last week over claims that he had behaved inappropriately towards younger women. Four Tory MPs and one Labour MP are facing internal party inquiries, while Conservative Charlie Elphicke has had his case referred to the police. HuffPost UK understands that at the Westminster meeting on Monday all the leaders agreed that trade unions should have a key role in helping draft the new system, which will be independent, as well as better staff support and a new working group to hammer out the details. May said: “What is important is that people who have been victims of this behaviour - be it sexual harassment or bullying of any sort - that those victims feel confident in coming forward with their complaints and knowing that there will be an impartial and proper and fair investigation of those complaints.” Meanwhile, BBC Radio 4′s PM programme reported that a former female member of staff in Ed Miliband’s office had spoken out about an incident in which a male colleague allegedly closed the door behind her and attempted to kiss her.

PA Archive/PA Images Ed Miliband.

The woman, whose identity was concealed and was referred to by the false name Susan, did not inform Mr Miliband or make a complaint at the time. She told the programme: “I thought, ‘Oh God, I’m going to be fired’. I thought he was going to be angry that I rebuffed his advance and there might be consequences for me. I thought the best thing to protect my position was not to say anything.” The woman said she would have liked to have been able to complain to an independent body, as she believed that if she reported it to the party, “they would close ranks on me as my position was very junior”. In a statement released by his office to PM, Mr Miliband said he was “deeply concerned to hear about this allegation of totally unacceptable behaviour”. He added: “I would strongly encourage the individual concerned to use the complaints process of the Labour Party to take her allegation forward. She should receive the support she has a right to expect.”

Wenn man den Bewohnern Glauben schenken darf, soll das Dorf jedoch verflucht sein

Wie die Bewohner mit dem vermeintlichen Fluch umgehen, seht ihr oben im Video

Die kleine Ortschaft Colobraro in der süditalienischen Region Basilikata soll verflucht sein. Deshalb trauen sich die Einwohner der umliegenden Dörfer noch nicht einmal, den Namen des Ortes auszusprechen.

Das Wort Colobraro leitet sich von dem lateinischen Wort Coluber ab, was Schlange bedeutet. Für die abergläubischen Einheimischen ist die Schlange der Inbegriff des Bösen. Die Leute in der Region glauben, dass denjenigen, der den Namen laut ausspricht, Unheil verfolgen werde. Das geht auch aus einer Dokumentation des BBC hervor. Das Dorf wird deshalb nur “Quel pases“ genannt, was übersetzt nur “dieses Dorf“ heißt.

Der Fluch begann im Jahr 1940

Zudem soll ein alter Fluch über dem Dorf liegen, der im Jahr 1940 begann. Der damalige Bürgermeister prophezeite bei einer Versammlung, dass auf der Stelle ein Kronleuchter von der Decke stürzen werde - sollten die Zuhörern seinen Worten keinen Glauben schenken. Der Legende zufolge, die jeder Bewohner von Colobraro kennt, fiel der Leuchter darauf sofort herunter.

Darüber hinaus lebten bis in die 70er Jahre die damals berüchtigten “Masciare“ in dem Dorf. Dabei soll es sich um Zauberinnen gehandelt haben, die mit ihrer bösen Magie angeblich ganze Städte kontrollierten. Ein Anthropologe besuchte das Dorf im Jahr 1952, um die Geschichte der Masciare zu erforschen. Er wurde laut einer Legende selbst Opfer des Fluchs: Alle seine Kollegen wurden schlagartig krank.

Heute versuchen die Bewohner das Beste daraus zu machen

Seitdem sind die Bewohner der Region sicher, dass Colobraro verflucht ist. Der heutige Bürgermeister der Stadt versucht jedoch, das Beste aus der Lage zu machen. Er hat zum Beispiel ein Festival ins Leben gerufen, in dem die Bewohner Colobraros ihr verfluchtes Dorf feiern. Die Einwohner inszenieren darin jeden August ihre Unglückstraditionen. Frauen treten als Masciare auf, Wahrsagerinnen lesen Schicksale aus Händen der Besucher und die Bewohner verkaufen Schutzamulette. So kann die Gemeinde immerhin ihre klammen Kassen auffüllen.

The ""Paradise Papers"" leak of offshore tax haven documents suggests Canada is losing much more money to offshore tax havens than previously estimated, says a watchdog group.

Canadians for Tax Fairness estimates that Canada's government loses between $10 billion and $15 billion annually ""due to corporate tax dodging using tax havens."" Prior to the Paradise Papers, it had estimated the losses at $5 billion to $8 billion annually.

The group's director Dennis Howlett noted that the Paradise Papers show, on a per capita basis, Canadians are twice as likely to use offshore tax havens as Americans.

He suggested that may be due to the fact that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is ""much more aggressive and much more effective"" in pursuing tax evasion, though that ""that may change because of Trump's administration.""

Canadians for Tax Fairness is adding its voice to a growing chorus accusing Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of ""misleading"" Canadians about the government's fight against tax havens.

The Paradise Papers, a leak of some 13.4 million records mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, included the names of at least 3,300 Canadians who have reportedly stashed money abroad. Among them were three former Canadian prime ministers — Brian Mulroney, Jean Chretien and Paul Martin — as well as the Liberal party's top fundraiser, Stephen Bronfman.

Though the use of offshore accounts is not itself illegal, they're are often tied to illegal activities, including failure to report income.

Former Prime Minister Jean Chretien speaks at the 50 Years of Standing Up for Canada event in Toronto, Jan. 21, 2014. Chretien has denied any impropriety after his name appeared in the Paradise Papers leak of offshore tax haven documents.

The Canada Revenue Agency issued a statement amid the Paradise Papers leak, saying it would not hesitate to investigate new evidence of tax evasion.

But some accused the agency of exaggerating its efforts.

""The CRA are up to their old tricks of trying to mislead Canadians, this time in response to the latest leak of tax haven information,"" Sen. Percy Downe, a Liberal-appointed senator who now sits as an Independent, said in a statement issued Tuesday.

Downe referred to the CRA's assertion of a ""billion-dollar investment"" to combat tax evasion in the two most recent budgets, and said the agency had in fact spent less than $40 million of that money.

""They also describe hundreds of audits and dozens of investigations, but when you go to the CRA website to look for the results of these activities, you see very little evidence of convictions and sentences for overseas tax evasion,"" Downe said, noting the CRA seems to have much better luck securing convictions for domestic tax evasion.

Howlett largely agreed with Downe's assessment.

""They point to all the investigations underway, but there are not many convictions,"" Howlett told HuffPost Canada in an interview.

""Often, there is no public information available. So we have no idea whether they forced people to pay the full tax bill. We don't know who's been convicted.""

Howlett lauded some of the CRA's recent efforts, but said the agency ""doesn't have a chance"" of combatting the problem effectively until loopholes in Canada's tax laws are closed.

Canada falling behind

Currently, Canada has tax treaties with a number of countries known to be tax havens, allowing people to park wealth in those regions, paying little to no tax, then allowing them to return that money to Canada, without paying Canadian taxes.

Howlett said Canada has fallen behind other countries in developing laws to combat offshore tax evasion. For instance, he noted that some countries have passed ""economic substance"" laws that require a business to prove that a subsidiary is more than a tax shelter, by providing evidence that it has staff and activity.

This summer, NDP MP Murray Rankin tabled a private member's bill that would do just that. The NDP notes that the U.S. passed a similar law under the Obama administration. Such a law would allow Canada to recover up to $400 million in tax revenue every year, Canadians for Tax Fairness estimates.

$261 billion in Canadian wealth stashed offshore

According to the group's analysis of Statistics Canada data, there was $261 billion of Canadian wealth stashed in the top 10 most popular tax havens at the end of 2016. That, however, is just what is officially known. Howlett estimates that there is at least another $100 billion of Canadian wealth hidden off the books.

Notably, the amount of money reported in tax shelters fell slightly from 2015 to 2016. Howlett suggests that last year's leak of the Panama Papers may have had something to do with that.

Leaks like the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers ""change the risk calculation"" for people and businesses using tax havens, Howlett said.

SONEBHADRA -- A German national was allegedly beaten by a railway contractor at the Robertsganj railway station in the district, police said today.

The incident comes days after a Swiss couple were attacked near the railway station at Agra's Fatehpur Sikri.

Holger Ereek was allegedly beaten by railway contractor Aman Kumar yesterday after which the station master informed the police.

Circle officer Vivekanand Tiwari said that the accused has been arrested.

However, the railway contractor alleged that when he greeted Ereek by saying ""welcome to India"", he hit him.

The victim refused to talk to the media.

On October 22, the Swiss couple from Lausanne in Switzerland, Quentin Jeremy Clerc (24) and his girlfriend Marie Droz (24), was chased and attacked with stones and sticks by a group of five youths in Fatehpur Sikri, triggering widespread outrage.

The couple was quoted as saying in a media report that they were strolling near the station at Fatehpur Sikri after a day in Agra when a group of youths started following them and later attacked.

The couple said as they lay on the ground bloodied and bruised, bystanders began taking videos of them on their mobile phones, the report said.

All the accused were arrested.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had sought a report from the UP government on the attack.

Union Minister of State for Tourism K J Alphons had dashed off a letter to Yogi Adityanath, saying the incident could have a negative impact on the image of the country.

Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police Sulkhan Singh had issued a list of guidelines, including deployment of policemen in plain clothes, more patrolling and installation of CCTV cameras, to prevent such incidents.

The couple were also offered a free stay in 5-star hotel in the national capital as a ""token of concern"" by Alphons.","After Attack On Swiss Couple, German Man Allegedly Assaulted In UP",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/05/after-attack-on-swiss-couple-german-man-allegedly-assaulted-in-up_a_23267074/

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Ravi Bhalla, who is running for mayor of Hoboken, posted a photo of the flyer on Facebook. It has a picture of Bhalla, a Sikh who wears the traditional turban, with the words “Don’t let TERRORISM take over our Town!” directly above him.

The flyer also warns of a “potential conflict of interest” regarding the city’s water supplier, which is a client of the law firm where Bhalla is a partner. That issue, however, has no connection with terrorism and the explanation of the conflict appears in much smaller print.

“Of course, this is troubling, but I want to be clear: We won’t let hate win in Hoboken,” Bhalla wrote on Facebook. “I want people to know that Hoboken is a welcoming community where my wife and I are proud to raise our two young children.”

Sikhs have repeatedly been the victims of hate crimes and harassment by people who mistake them for Muslims. A 2015 study conducted by the National Sikhs Campaign found that 20 to 28 percent of Americans misidentify Sikh men as Middle Eastern or Muslim. A large part of that is due to the turbans that Sikh men wear as part of their faith.

Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) tweeted in defense of Bhalla to denounce the flyers. Booker served as mayor of nearby Newark from 2006 to 2013, before running for Congress.

“My friend @RaviBhalla is running for Hoboken mayor,” Booker wrote. “This vile hateful flyer was put out. I condemn it! We all must condemn bigotry & hate!”

This isn’t the first racist incident during New Jersey’s local elections this year. Xenophobic mailers circulated earlier in the week over a school board election in Edison. They featured two Asian-American candidates with the word “deport” stamped on their pictures. The anonymous flyers also claimed, “The Chinese and Indians are taking over our town!”

The flyer falsely tying Bhalla to terrorism showed up just days before voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Language on the flyer claims it was paid for by a rival mayoral candidate, Michael DeFusco, who denies any association with the item.

“I condemn this piece of racist garbage in the strongest possible terms,” he said in a statement. “Political stunts like this are everything that’s wrong with politics today.”

Twitter has been accused of “bi-erasure” and “biphobia”, after photo and video search results for the term ‘bisexual’ and ‘bisexuality’ disappeared. The social media site apologised for what it said was “an error with search results for certain terms” on 5 November, however the apparent block still exists at the time of publication. It’s also worth noting that results for ‘gay’, ‘lesbian’ and ‘transgender’ were not removed by the error. “It’s extremely disappointing and damaging for a social media platform to erase bi people by excluding the term bisexual from its searches,” a spokesperson for Stonewall, which campaigns for LGBT+ equality across Britain, told HuffPost UK. “Erasure or the dismissal of bi identities is one of the reasons why some people find coming out as bi so difficult.” This was echoed by interviewees, who shared their experiences with HuffPost UK following Twitter’s so-called error.

HuffPost UK This is what comes up in Twitter's photo and video search results when you search for 'bisexual'.

Sarah*, 15 “Most of my experience as not being straight has come from being young, where often everything you know and understand isn’t taken seriously by those older than you. Apparently it’s ‘normal’ to question your identity or sexuality, but it isn’t ‘normal’ to confirm you’re anything but ‘normal’ - whatever that means. “Along with not being allowed to make a decision when you’re young, there’s a stigmatisation of bisexuality, not only amongst heterosexual society, but the LGBTQ+ community. Bisexuality, as simple as it is, is often synonymous with confusion, as you don’t identify as straight, and you don’t identify as gay, so in other people’s eyes you don’t really identify as anything at all. For other people, if you can’t be placed into a category or a box then you’re just a confused teenager, still learning and trying new things - not someone with opinions, emotions or ideas. “The relaxed use of negative stereotypes when it comes to bisexuality aids to the biphobia that runs quite deeply within society. The whole idea of you simply being bisexual because ‘it doubles your chance of a date’ is narrow-minded and harmful, when in fact, you’re simply just attracted to someone, regardless of gender.” Rob, 41

“Growing up in the 1980s, bisexuals were so invisible I didn’t even know that bisexuality existed. I knew from a very young age that I liked boys and girls but I also knew I wasn’t gay and I certainly didn’t know of any bisexual role models - I think the only one I had heard of was David Bowie but he seemed fantastical and I didn’t relate to him. I didn’t come out as bisexual to myself, never mind anyone else, until much later. “There is a cliché that bisexuals are confused but it was actually when bisexuality became visible to me that I realised I was bi and my confusion vanished completely. Visibility is vital. “Bi-erasure may seem like a small problem but it is thought that bi-invisibility is one of the reasons that, according to several reports, bisexuals have higher rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide than straight, gay and lesbian people. Had Twitter existed when I was a teenager I would have been searching for #bisexual to try to make sense of what I was feeling and the site has just made that much more difficult for today’s teens by censoring pictures and videos. “The bisexual community have used social media to raise visibility and understanding of our sexuality and this move by Twitter literally erases our identity.” Ruby, 27

“We get excluded from the everyday language used to discuss sexual identity (eg. gay marriage), and it often feels like our issues and struggles aren’t seen as serious enough to deserve attention or support. The limited resources and spaces that are specifically for us make it difficult to form support and social networks where we can talk to each other. And we need that. Bi+ people, particularly women, deal with extremely high levels of sexual violence and mental health issues and only about 28% of bi/pan people ever feel safe enough to come out to their friends and family. “My family, a therapist, and my friends all challenged me for years after I came out as bi, and the doubt and confusion lasted a long time. Then, a year ago, I started working on a community radio program about bisexuality. It was my first time speaking with other bi+ people and the same struggles and frustrations and doubts that I had lived with for years came up again and again, until it was obvious they were issues we all faced and not the character flaws they had been made to feel like. “Being able to find and talk to each other can make all the difference when you’re bi+. We don’t need it to be any harder.” Abigail, 26

“Throughout my childhood, my identity existed only in unpleasant slurs. Growing up in a religious home and going to school under Section 28 legislation [a law banning councils and schools in England and Wales from intentionally promoting homosexuality], the only pattern I saw around me was ‘grow up, meet someone of a different gender, get married, have babies’, so I assumed that was my life too. “I tried to ‘train’ myself to be straight - reward, punishment, guilt - but nothing worked. I suppressed myself through my teens and convinced myself that if I could fall in love with a man, I could put it behind me. Even after I came out as bi/pan [attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity] at 21, I was determined to conform with the heterosexual norm, because it was quite simply easier. But it wasn’t who I really was. “Over time I’ve come to embrace my whole identity and this growth in confidence is the driver behind co-founding Bi Pride UK, a charity working to create public spaces for celebrating attraction beyond gender. I’ve still got a way to go personally, though: I’ve been single since I came out and getting into a relationship scares me, because I know that over time I’ll be re-binarised as either straight or gay by society. I’ve fought too hard to be myself for that.” Ella, 15 “I suppose I’ve always known that I liked girls. I was never into boys when I was younger and my first kiss was with a girl. For a while I thought I was gay until I discovered the LGBT+ community online and learnt a variety of terms that I’ve been sheltered from by my country, having grown up in Northern Ireland, and my family. “I’ve met some supportive people in my life and some people who aren’t. I recently came out online to my friends and received some support, but in Catholic school the following week I heard whispers and some offensive and derogatory names being shouted. “People still in this day and age ‘don’t believe in bisexuality’ saying that people are ‘greedy’ and need to make a decision. I’ve heard that I’m ‘confused’ and that I’ll ‘get bored soon enough’ or ‘find a nice boy’ - and sometimes people say these comments without realising how offensive and hurtful they’re being. “Coming to terms with your sexuality is a big deal and when you get the courage to tell people, the last thing you need is people questioning you and being hurtful.” Lewis, 26

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

""Dass Tanja diese Stelle angenommen hat, bedeutet aber in vielerlei Hinsicht eine große Herausforderung: Ihre jüngere Tochter Lotte ist mit dem Umzug nach Eisenach nicht einverstanden und es fällt Tanja nicht leicht, ihre berufliche Zukunft über die Wünsche ihrer Tochter zu stellen. Trotzdem entscheidet sie sich für ihre Karriere und versucht, es für Lotte so erträglich wie möglich zu machen"", so Athenstädt weiter.

Erfahrung mit Patchworkfamilien?

In ""Familie Dr. Kleist"" geht es auch um Patchwork, Adoption und andere Familienformen. ""Ich habe persönlich keine Erfahrung damit gemacht, aber natürlich kenne ich viele Menschen, die in Patchworkfamilien aufgewachsen sind oder ihre Kinder alleine oder zu dritt oder viert erziehen"", erklärt Christina Athenstädt. Und was sind ihrer Ansicht nach die wichtigsten Eckpfeiler, damit solche Familienformen gelingen? ""Soweit ich das von außen sagen kann, gibt es wohl in jeder Familie nicht nur eitel Sonnenschein und das offene Gespräch ist meistens der beste Weg"", findet die Künstlerin.

Die Neue

Christina Athenstädt ist aber nicht nur die Neue in der Serie, sie war auch die Neue am Set. Wie fühlte sich das an? ""Ich bin anfangs immer eher schüchtern. Ich brauche bei jedem neuen Projekt ein paar Tage, um mich einzuleben"", gibt sie zu. Im Team von ""Dr. Kleist"" habe sie niemanden gekannt, aber das Team und die Kollegen hätten es ihr wirklich leicht gemacht. ""Es ist eine sehr angenehme Atmosphäre am Set.""

Arztserien und Krimis

Für Christina Athenstädt ist es nicht die erste Arztserie ihrer Karriere, sie hat schon in ""In aller Freundschaft - Die jungen Ärzte"" (2017) und ""Der Bergdoktor"" (2016) mitgespielt. Und dann stehen noch jede Menge Krimis in ihrer Filmografie. Und was ist das Besondere an diesen Genres? ""Ich kann Ihnen auch nicht sagen, warum man Ärzten und Polizisten im Fernsehen so regelmäßig bei der Arbeit zusehen möchte. Aber auch ich tue das immer wieder gerne"", verrät die Schauspielerin.

""Deeply saddened to hear of the death of an Abbotsford police officer today.","Police Chief Constable Bob Rich announces that an officer died in hospital after being shot near Mt. Lehman Road and Fraser Highway in Abbotsford, B.C., on Nov. 6, 2017.

ABBOTSFORD, B.C. — A British Columbia police officer is being remembered as a ""hero'' after he died Monday in an exchange of gunfire with a man accused of shooting at people in a parking lot.

Chief Bob Rich of the Abbotsford Police Department said officers were called about a possible stolen vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping complex at about 11:30 a.m.

The caller blocked the suspect's vehicle in while waiting for police to arrive, Rich said.

""Unfortunately, a male suspect emerged from that vehicle and began shooting at the caller and others with a shotgun,'' Rich said at a news conference.

There were several 911 calls reporting the shooting and police officers arrived in the area and attempted to engage with and arrest the suspect.

""There was an exchange of gunfire,'' Rich said, and one officer was taken to hospital with ""very serious injuries.''

Police officers investigate the scene of a shooting that left one police officer dead in Abbotsford, B.C., on Nov. 6, 2017.

""The horrible part of this story, our injured APD officer was pronounced dead at the hospital shortly after he arrived.''

The suspect, a man in his 60s from Alberta, fled in the vehicle and police officers pursued him to the intersection of Mt. Lehman Road and Fraser Highway, Rich said. The man was apprehended and taken to hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.

The deceased officer's name has not been released.

Rich said the investigation will continue and there are still many questions left to be answered. He said the police department's priority will be supporting the officer's family and each other.

He said he met with the officer's spouse and delivered the ""horrible news face to face.''

The officer who gave his life today is a hero. Chief Bob Rich

""Our officers' actions today, all of them, were absolutely heroic,'' he said. ""There were officers heroically trying to save the life of our member. There were officers immediately taking control of the scene.

""When they responded to this, they responded in a way that was designed to protect the public. This person was trying to kill people, members of the public, and our officers responded.

""The officer who gave his life today is a hero. He was protecting this community. He will always be my hero.''

Police officers bow their heads while Chief Bob Rich announces that an officer died in hospital after being shot near Mt. Lehman Road and Fraser Highway in Abbotsford, B.C., on Nov. 6, 2017.

An employee at a nearby vehicle dealership said the fatal shooting is connected to a sports car that was allegedly stolen over the weekend.

George MacDonald, a manager at MSA Ford in Abbotsford, said a man came in to test drive a Mustang around 9 a.m. on Saturday and drove off without leaving his driver's licence.

Shortly before noon on Monday, a dealership employee noticed the vehicle parked about 400 metres away at a restaurant, MacDonald said.

""One of my guys blocked the car in until the Abbotsford police came and before the police came the guy came back with a rifle and decided he wanted the car back,'' McDonald said. ""The truck took two or three bullet holes.''

McDonald said he left to return a key to the dealership minutes before the shooting took place.

""I did 20 years in the military but I'm not used to anything like that happening this close to home,'' he said.

Police officers investigate the scene of a shooting that left one officer dead in Abbotsford, B.C., on Nov. 6, 2017.

The Independent Investigations Office, which looks at all officer-related incidents that result in serious harm or death, sent its investigators to the scene. The office says it's believed the suspect was shot.

Premier John Horgan issued a statement on Twitter expressing his condolences to the family of the police officer.

""Deeply saddened to hear of the death of an Abbotsford police officer today. My heartfelt condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues,'' he said.

""As British Columbians, we are filled with grief at this tragic loss and give gratitude to those who put their lives on the line for us.''

This image of a wave crashing over Mornington Pier in Port Phillip Bay was taken while a strong cold front roared across the bay and southern Victoria.

As usual, the calendar features a range of pics from locations around Australia, some taken by professional photographers, others taken by people who just happened to be in the right spot at the right time.

One of our favourites is this magnificent sunset shot out the back of the Mt Hotham ski resort in Victoria, taken by from hobby photographer John Bagge (you can see more of his work here). He'd been having a family day in the snow and simply HAD to stop and take this on the way home.

Want another sunset? Try this one in the West MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs. It was taken by photographer Peter Nunn (more here) who was returning to Alice Springs from a photography trip to Simpsons Gap. When he saw this storm cell, he just had to climb a nearby hill and capture it.

Here's a change of pace. It's a gorgeous brooding pic of a plane on approach to Adelaide Airport taken by Adelaide local Asbjorn Kanck. Here's what the Bureau said of those unusual clouds:

This rare cloud type is called altocumulus stratiformis opacus asperitas. The altocumulus refers to the height and cloud type (cumulus cloud in the middle level of the atmosphere); stratiformis indicates it has formed in a layer; and opacus denotes the cloud is thick enough to mask the sun. Asperitas, from the Latin for roughen, refers to the wave-like feature underneath the cloud. One theory of how these clouds occur is that when mammatus clouds sink into an area of strong winds, it causes these rough, lumpy formations.

All we know is we'd rather not be on a plane landing in it. Very bumpy ride, we suspect.

How gorgeous is this one? It's fog in the valley at sunrise, as taken from Mt Buninyong near Ballarat. Local snapper Andrew Thomas (more of his work here) goes out most mornings looking for great imagery in his area. You got a good one that frosty July day, Andrew.

The calendar has several more pics and is available to buy at the Bureau's online shop. Look out for the fantastic cover image of a pool among the boulders up on North Ramshead, near Thredbo, with a moon halo in the background. Sweet.",Behold!

“I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape,” he wrote.

PREVIOUSLY:

Actress Kristina Cohen said in a lengthy Facebook post shared Monday that “Gossip Girl” star Ed Westwick raped her three years ago.

Cohen, 27, said that she met Westwick, 30, through her boyfriend at the time, a producer who goes unnamed in the post. The incident occurred when the couple went over to actor’s house one night, she wrote.

Cohen was taken aback when Westwick allegedly suggested “we should all fuck,” but her boyfriend convinced her to stay for dinner to avoid making their host uncomfortable. At Westwick’s suggestion, Cohen said she then retired to the guest room for a nap while her boyfriend tried to smooth things over.

“So I went and laid down in the guest room where I eventually fell asleep, I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong,” Cohen wrote. “I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me. I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.”

“It was a nightmare, and the days following weren’t any better,” she added.

A representative for Westwick did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.

Cohen said that her boyfriend blamed her for the assault and cautioned against speaking out against Westwick for the sake of her career.

Over the years, she has appeared in a handful of minor roles in projects including “Californication” and “The Middle,” as well as the web series “Ladies Like Us.” Westwick rose to fame on the hit CW soap playing bad boy Chuck Bass, a character with his own history of sexual assault. He now stars on the BBC Two series “White Gold.”

Cohen said the wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against powerful men in Hollywood pushed her to come forward with her story now. She hopes to change the public perception of men like Westwick and encourage other victims of sexual assault never to blame themselves.

“I’m sickened to see men like Ed respected in such a public way. Interviewed by prestigious platforms such as the Oxford Union Society at Oxford University, where he was honored as one of their ‘People who Shape our World,’” Cohen wrote. “How does this end? Men like Ed using fame and power to rape and intimidate but then continue through the world collecting accolades.”

“I hope that my stories and the stories of others help to reset and realign the toxic environments and power imbalances that have created these monsters,” she concluded.",Actress Kristina Cohen Says 'Gossip Girl' Star Ed Westwick Raped Her (UPDATE),https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/actress-kristina-cohen-says-gossip-girl-star-ed-westwick-raped-her_us_5a01ba61e4b0368a4e86f047?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Elton John wurde von der Elite-Universität am vergangenen Montag für seine karitativen Verdienste mit der ""Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian""-Auszeichnung geehrt. Dabei sei es ausgerechnet seine problematische Lebensphase gewesen, die ihn im Nachhinein dazu motivierte, ein besserer Mensch zu werden: ""Ich verlor meine Menschlichkeit in einem Exzess aus Drogen, Alkohol und einer Essstörung. Während meiner Sucht in den 80ern brach die AIDS-Krankheit aus und die Regierung nahm davon keine Notiz. Ich habe viele Freunde an AIDS verloren und habe wegen meiner Abhängigkeit nichts dagegen unternommen. Die Drogen haben mich in ein Monster verwandelt.""

Erst eine schicksalhafte Begegnung mit einem jungen AIDS-Kranken habe sein Leben verändert: ""Innerhalb von sechs Monaten wurde ich trocken und clean und das bin ich jetzt seit 27 Jahren."" In Anbetracht all der Skandale und Anschläge, die die USA derzeit erschüttern, sei es wichtiger denn je, füreinander da zu sein: ""Wir können die Welt verändern und unsere gemeinsame Menschlichkeit verinnerlichen.

Yeah, the twist that Cate Blanchett’s character, Hela, was Thor’s sister got out before the movie premiered on Friday, and Mark Ruffalo accidentally live-streamed the movie at an early screening, but many of the film’s secrets remain intact, including some major cameos.

Warning: “Thor: Ragnarok” spoilers below!

After Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets back to Asgard, where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been ruling in an Odin (Anthony Hopkins) disguise after secretly exiling the real Odin, Thor witnesses a play honoring Loki’s “death,” which happened in “Thor: The Dark World.” (Don’t worry. The dude wasn’t really dead.)

In the play scenes, Thor is played by Luke Hemsworth, Chris’ older brother; Odin is played by Dr. Grant himself, Sam Neill; and Loki is played by Matt Damon wearing a ridiculous Loki wig.

Director Taika Waititi told HuffPost the Damon cameo really happened because he’s good friends with Chris.

“It was like an homage to the previous films but also being a bit more irreverent, being able to poke fun at ourselves,” he said in reference to the play scene. “Chris is very good at that. He has great self-deprecating humor.”

Steve Granitz via Getty Images Luciana Barroso and Matt Damon at the ""Thor: Ragnarok"" premiere Oct. 10.

The director said the play was planned as an in-joke for everyone who saw “Thor: The Dark World,” adding, “We shot everything the same size and the same angle and we basically copied the entire death scene from that movie.”

For those who haven’t seen the previous “Thor” film, Waititi says it is still an “interesting piece of story” that helps set up Loki’s storyline.

As far as the other surprises in the movie, you should probably just see them for yourself. Marvel has gone to great lengths to keep them quiet. Even the trailers were digitally altered from the final film to hide plot points.

“When we came out with our first trailer, there were a few stories in we weren’t sure if we wanted in the film or not,” said Waititi. The director said they just “wanted to make a cool trailer,” but promotion “shouldn’t necessarily be just showing shots from the finished movie.”

La musique de Noël peut être drainante mentalement, selon une psychologue clinicienne.

«Les gens qui travaillent dans les magasins pendant le temps des Fêtes doivent déconnecter de la musique de Noël, parce que sinon, ça ne leur permet pas de se concentrer sur quoi que ce soit d'autre», explique la psychologue clinicienne Linda Blair à Sky News. «Vous dépensez toute votre énergie à essayer de ne pas entendre ce que vous entendez.»

Chaque année à la mi-novembre, les gens deviennent fous en étant forcés de se mettre dans l'ambiance des Fêtes. (Et vous ne pouvez qu'imaginer ce que ça fait aux millions de personnes qui ne célèbrent pas la fête.)

Cette réaction psychologique, note NBC News, est connue en tant «qu'effet d'exposition», selon la chercheuse en psychologie musicale Dr Victoria Williamson, qui conduit la recherche en psychologie à Goldsmith, University of London.

Selon Williamson, il y a une relation entre le nombre de fois au cours desquelles on entend une chanson qu'on aime et notre réaction. Les premières fois, on se sent festif, mais lorsqu'on l'entend trop fréquemment, ça devient exaspérant.

Winter shopping season

«Quiconque qui a déjà travaillé dans un magasin de Noël pendant le temps des Fêtes va savoir de quoi je parle», mentionne Williamson à NBC News. «Mais cette réaction peut dépendre de notre état psychologique, parce que certaines personnes aiment, ou peuvent tolérer, le bombardement de musique de Noël, tandis que d'autres sentent qu'ils deviennent fous.»

Pour ces derniers, nous n'avons pas de bonnes nouvelles pour vous, parce que la musique de Noël - du moins dans les magasins - est là pour rester, et c'est parce qu'elle encourage les clients à acheter davantage.

La recherche a démontré que le bon équilibre d'odeurs et de chansons de Noël peut rendre les acheteurs plus favorables à leur environnement, ce qui leur donnera le goût de magasiner davantage.

«On a démontré que la musique des Fêtes combinée avec des odeurs des Fêtes concordantes peuvent influencer les acheteurs à passer plus de temps dans un magasin, à y retourner, et à acheter», a noté Eric Spangenberg, Ph. D, le doyen de l'école d'affaires de la Washington State University.

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Mascolo glaubt nicht, dass das helfen würde

Die Fronten bei ""Hart aber fair"" waren klar: Michael Meister, CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, fordert eine Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers.

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Georg Mascolo, der das Rechercheteam von NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" leitet, lehnt jegliche Zusammenarbeit mit staatlichen Behörden ab. Sein Team hat die Dokumente für deutsche Leser ausgewertet.

Besonders absurd findet Mascolo dabei ein Argument, das CDU-Politiker Meister mantraartig im ARD-Talk von Frank Plasberg wiederholt: Eine Offenlegung der Papiere würde den Finanzbehörden helfen, mögliche neue Konstruktionen zur Steuerumgehung zu finden.

Die Probleme sind völlig offensichtlich

""Man muss gar kein Steuerrechtsseminar hier abhalten"", warf Mascolo in die Runde. Die Dinge, die nicht in Ordnung seien, könne jeder relativ einfach erkennen. Dann zerlegte der renommierte Journalist in drei Sätzen die Argumentation Meisters und anderer Finanzpolitiker:

► ""Wenn ich vor einem Haus stehe, in dem es drei Stockwerke gibt und 700 Firmen registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass dort irgendetwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Wenn auf einer Kleinstinsel 1000 Flugzeuge registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass das nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Und wenn ein international gut verdienendes Unternehmen seine Steuerlast auf 13 bis 15 Prozent drückt, dann weiß ich, dass etwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

Mascolo erbost: ""Wir diskutieren über diese Dinge schon viel zu lange.""

Ein Teil des Problems innerhalb der EU sei, dass es nicht nur um Kleinststaaten in der Karibik oder im Ärmelkanal geht. ""Wir reden über Mitgliedsstaaten in der Europäischen Union."" Damit spielt er auf Malta und die Niederlande an, die als Steueroasen in den Paradise Papers auftauchen.

Viele Pläne - ""Aber nichts geschieht""

Mascolo beklagte, dass es kurz nach öffentlichkeitswirksamen Steuerleaks immer wieder Pläne zum Stopfen der Schlupflöcher gegeben habe - doch die seien meistens nach ein oder zwei Jahren versandet.

An CDU-Politiker Meister gerichtet erklärte Mascolo: ""Ich wette, die Finanzbeamten kennen längst alle Konstruktionen. (...) Denn da stecken nicht viele Geheimnisse drin.""

Im Video oben: Martin reicht der Frau, von der er sich trennen will, ein Mikrofon mit einer unsensiblen Tonaufnahme

Und Kandidat Kevin schenkt Teilnehmerin Nadine statt einer Rose einen Hundeknochen

Die Macher der RTL-Kuppelsendung ""Schwiegertochter gesucht"" laufen in der diesjährigen Staffel wieder zur Höchstform der Menschenverachtung auf. Nachdem sie bereits erfolgreich die minderjährige Teilnehmerin Tutti bloßgestellt haben, ist in der aktuellen Folge Kandidatin Petra dran.

Petra hatte sich neben Catrin für das Wolfgang-Petry-Double Martin beworben. Schon in der Busfahrt zum Haus des Hobby-Sängers und seiner Mutter wurden die beiden mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik beschallt. Die Musik begleitete die Kandidaten von da an jeden Tag im Haus des selbsternannten Doubles.

Da ist es natürlich nur konsequent, dass die Kandidatinnen auch mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik verabschiedet werden. Denn RTL hat sich die wohl geschmackloseste Möglichkeit einfallen lassen, Kandidatin Petra nach Hause zu schicken.

Martin nimmt eine Sprachnachricht der besonderen Art auf

Martin überreichte jeder der Kandidatinnen ein Mikrofon mit einer selbst vertonten Aufnahme. Auf dem ersten Mikrofon sang er in wunderbar schiefer Tonlage: ""Ich habe Sehnsucht nach dir"", auf dem zweiten wiederum: ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"".

Das zweite Mikrofon überreichte er dann in einer Abschieds-Zeremonie der schwer verliebten Kandidatin Petra. Als diese auf den Knopf drückte und Martin fröhlich sang ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"" kamen ihr die Tränen.

Damit ist es RTL wieder einmal gelungen, eine Kandidatin zum Weinen zu bringen. Denn dass Martin selbst sich diese Idee hat einfallen lassen, ist höchst zweifelhaft.

Als Wiedergutmachung hat sich das RTL-Team dafür etwas ganz besonders Romantisches für Kandidatin Nadine einfallen lassen. ""Ich dachte, ich mache es heute mal so wie der Bachelor"", sagte Kevin zu seiner Auserwählten. Nur leider hatte Kevin keine Rose parat. Also reichte er Nadine ganz einfach einen Knochen. Einen Knochen, an dem normalerweise seine Hunde kauen.

Nadine war gerührt und willigte gleich darauf ein, die Nacht mit Kevin im Zelt zu verbringen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Verdacht: RTL hat einen perfiden Plan für die minderjährige Tutti bei ""Schwiegertochter gesucht""

Wer hätte auch widerstehen können, bei Kevins gekonntem Flirt-Spruch: ""Deine Augen gefallen mir, deine Nase auch, ich würde gerne eine Beziehung mit dir versuchen und später dann zusammen ziehen.""

Das kann man auch gleich beim ersten Date mal so klarstellen. Anschließend werden die beiden in einem Zelt schlafen, das so klein ist, dass Kevins Füße hinten rausschauen. Aber es ist bestimmt nicht die Absicht von RTL, sich über die Größe des Zweimeter-Mannes lustig zu machen. Alles purer Zufall, ganz bestimmt.

Natürlich ist das Zelt viel zu klein und seine Beine gucken raus. Mein RTL. #Schwiegertochtergesucht — anredo (@anredo) 5. November 2017

In her findings, Mkhwebane said the Ray Nkoyeni Municipality had breached its own anti-nudity policies, according to The Independent.

She called the use of the phrase ""relaxing the by-law"" a ""whitewashing and sugar-coating exercise intended to make the municipality's unlawful act seem more appealing or pleasant when in actual fact it was unlawful and improper"".

The Concerned Citizens Group on Monday announced the outcome of the three-year probe into whether the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality should have approved an application for nudists on Mpenjati Beach.

""This is what they should have done three years ago, reject the application.They should have told the nudists to go be naked in their bathrooms like everybody else.""

The group's Reverend Mike Effanga later told ""The Mercury"" the final report was hand-delivered to him on Friday.

""This is a victory, any wise municipality will realise this idea is dead. Laws are informed by morality and if you break the laws, you are offending morality,"" he said.

In contravening the laws, the municipality breached morality. And there is a zero possibility that the municipality can do anything now because they can't change the law in 30 days,"" Effanga added.

He was referring to the deadline for the implementation of remedial action.

The massive document leak known as Paradise Papers reveals that 714 Indians are linked to tax havens including Bollywood veteran Amitabh Bachchan, corporate lobbyist Niira Radia, liquor baron and fugitive Vijay Mallya, Union Minister Jayant Sinha and Sanjay Dutt's wife Manyata.

India ranks 19 among 180 countries in the number of names in the list.

The Indian Express reported today that Bachchan, whose name also appeared in the Panama Papers leak in 2016, became a shareholder of a digital media company incorporated in Bermuda in 2002, one year after he hosted the first season of the TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati.

The newspaper noted that it was unclear if Bachchan had reported his shareholding in the Bermuda-based Jalva Media Ltd to the Reserve Bank of India (as required by Indian law at the time).

In 2005, a notice published in The Bermuda Sun described the company as a ""bad debtor"" which stands ""dissolved.""

Over 13 million files revealed on Sunday, the bulk from two centuries-old Bermuda-based law firm Appleby, contain details of the offshore holdings of top politicians, celebrities and corporations. The documents were obtained by German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in collaboration with 96 media organizations.

The data reveals that Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has $13 million of her private money invested in off shore funds based in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.

The documents also reveal that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov.

Another notable finding in the Paradise Papers is about Stephen Bronfman, the top fund raiser and senior advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Brofman, according to the documents, was involved in moving millions of dollars to offshore tax havens.

Among the Indians, the Paradise Papers also names corporate lobbyist Niira Radia who was at the centre of the Radia Tapes media scandal in 2010.

The Indian Express reported today that Radia was part of two offshore companies based in Malta. She was director of the Suez La Vallette Limited in April 2012 and the Pegasus International Advisors Limited in August 2011.

Radia was ""removed"" from Suez La Vallette Limited in August 2014 and ""resigned"" in February 2014 from Pegasus International Advisors Limited, the newspaper reported.

Union Minister Jayant Sinha features in the Paradise Papers because he was the managing director of Omidyar Network, which invested in D. Light, a US company that has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands.

Sinha, who resigned from the company in 2013, was elected to parliament in 2014. In a series of tweets today, the minister responded to being listed in the Paradise Papers.

""These were bonafide and legal transactions undertaken on behalf of highly reputed world-leading organisations in my fiduciary role as Partner at Omidyar Network and its designated representative on the D.Light Board. All these transactions have been fully disclosed to relevant authorities through all necessary filings as required,"" the minister said, adding, ""It is crucial to note that these transactions were done for D.Light as an Omidyar representative, and not for any personal purpose.""

Manyata, Sanjay Dutt's wife, also appears in the Paradise Papers under her former name Dilnashin. The Indian Express reported that she is the director Nasjay Company Limited, set up in the Bahamas in April 2010.

Her spokesperson told the newspaper, ""As per the requirements of provisions of Income-tax Act, 1961, all the properties, company or body corporate or shares in any company are declared in the balance sheet.""

It was the 14th such speech during his time in Office and still there was no federal push to ban assault-style weapons.
Assault weapons are banned in Washington D.C. as were handguns until relatively recently.
No Administration has been prepared to take on the gun lobby and rid the nation of semi-automatic, assault-style weapons.
If the 'right to bear arms' is the constitutional reasoning that prevents a nation-wide ban on assault-style weapons, why is there a ban on fully automatic weapons?","""Thoughts and prayers are not enough. These guns are designed for one thing, to kill people.""

""In dark times such as these, Americans do what we do best: we pull together. We join hands. We lock arms."" -- Donald Trump.

The President left a few final words off the end of his statement. It should have read: ""We join hands. We lock arms. And we do nothing"".

Political platitudes are an insult to the dead. The inaction of America's leadership in removing semi-automatic, assault-style weapons from proliferation throughout the suburbs of the United States has allowed the bloody parade of mass killings to roll on. Sutherland Springs. Las Vegas. Orlando.

The blood of the dead has settled upon the hands of federal politicians.

This is not a recent stigma that can be laid at the feet of the current Administration alone. Republicans and Democrats alike are culpable for their lack of action in ensuring the safety of the American people from domestic terrorism at the hands of lone gunmen.

On June 16, 2016, President Obama addressed the American people following the massacre of 49 people at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. It was the 14th such speech during his time in Office and still there was no federal push to ban assault-style weapons. Indeed, Obama was still struggling to ban the sale of armour-piercing ammunition across the United States.

The AR-15 assault rifle and similar weapons are designed for one thing. To kill people. They are not an effective hunting weapon relative to the myriad of precision rifles available, designed for taking down deer and other game at extended ranges.

In fact the NRA, manufacturers and supporters of assault style weapons readily admit that the AR-15 and weapons like it are primarily marketed for home and self-defence. Self-defence against whom? Invading armies?

Some U.S. administrations do have tighter gun control than others. Assault weapons are banned in Washington D.C. as were handguns until relatively recently. The City's fight to maintain workable restrictions on access to certain firearms has been undermined by successive rulings in the U.S. Supreme Court that aspects of D.C.'s gun control laws were 'unconstitutional'.

Doing what is right is not always popular. And for those beholden to the powerful U.S. gun lobby it could be career ending. Therein lies the problem. No Administration has been prepared to take on the gun lobby and rid the nation of semi-automatic, assault-style weapons. Until decision makers are willing to put their own skin in the game, as happened in Australia in the mid '90s, nothing will change.

Australia suffered its most hateful and deadly mass murder in April 1996 when Martin Bryant murdered 35 people, including children, using legally available semi-automatic military weapons.

Australia's newly elected Prime Minister John Howard took immediate action, implementing federal firearm laws over and above state legislation. Mr Howard risked his own political future by implementing federal legislation to ban all assault weapons and restrict all other semi-automatic rifles to rural landholders deemed to have a genuine need to manage feral animals. The Government issued an amnesty and gun buyback at a significant cost to the federal budget bottom line.

At the next election, around a dozen Members of Parliament from the Howard Government lost their seats, in no small measure due to the stand the Government took on gun laws.

The price was worth it. Since 1996 there have been no repeats of the mass murder perpetrated at Port Arthur, while at the same time the rights of recreational shooters -- like myself -- to own firearms have been upheld.

Both sides of Congress have been afraid to take on 'big guns' for fear of being hounded out of office, accused of impinging upon individual rights under the second amendment.

The second amendment has been used as a cover-all, allowing military grade weapons to be proliferated throughout the suburbs of America. And yet the logic is false. If the 'right to bear arms' is the constitutional reasoning that prevents a nation-wide ban on assault-style weapons, why is there a ban on fully automatic weapons? If I have the right to own an AR-15 that discharges one bullet each time I pull the trigger, why not a weapon that can discharge the entire clip in seconds?

Perhaps because it's not in the interest of public safety to allow fully automatic military weapons to rest in the hands of civilians. And yet a semi-automatic version of the same weapon meets the public safety test? Ludicrous.

The precedence of the Australian example and what we are seeing on almost a monthly basis in the United States, places it beyond reasonable doubt that national legislation banning assault-style, semi-automatic weapons will help reduce the likelihood and severity of mass shootings.

Every month of inaction by Congress and, indeed, the President himself, to ban assault-style weapons, hastens the next breaking news story flashing across screens around the world, of another mass slaying in suburban U.S. by a gunman using an AR-15.","Without Presidential Action On Assault Weapons, U.S. Mass Killings Will Continue",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/brad-emery/without-presidential-action-on-assault-weapons-u-s-mass-killings-will-continue_a_23268763/

The men -- refugees and asylum seekers -- have been barricaded inside the centre for a week and say they are safer inside the shut-down centre than in new, but unsecured, accomodation closer to the Manus capital of Lorengau.

Lawyers for the refugees are expected to appeal the decision as early as Wednesday.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is adamant the men won't come to Australia and said activists were encouraging the men not to move. New Zealand offered to take 150 of the men but Turnbull rejected the offer on the grounds it would encourage people smugglers.

He blamed ""activists"" for encouraging the men not to move from the centre.

""I think... is that there are some activists in Australia, including the Greens senator Nick McKim, who are basically encouraging these people not to move,"" he told the ABC on Tuesday.

""It is not incumbent on PNG to deliver services and this remains the responsibility of the service providers but at the new locations where the residents have to move to.""

""In one case, a refugee who has epilepsy, had a fit and was unconscious for several hours,"" Amnesty said.

""Refugees called to guards to provide medical assistance but there was no response. In another incident, a refugee self-harmed and, while physically stable, he remained in a fragile mental state, supported only by his friends.""

""Moving hundreds of men to a town where refugees have been beaten, stabbed and robbed is incredibly irresponsible,"" she said in a statement.

It was the most awful moment. Afterwards, you'd never have dreamed that jockey Kathy O'Hara and chestnut mare Single Gaze would be lining up as serious chances in the Melbourne Cup. But here they are.

The fall happened in April, 2016. Coming round the home turn of the Australian Oaks at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse, top jockey Kathy O'Hara peeled to the outside of the field aboard Single Gaze to make her run.

That's when it happened. In one of those horrible moments which you can file under ""that's racing"" rather than negligence, jockey Damien Oliver pushed his mount Jameka wide to make its run. It cannoned into another horse, Happy Hannah, which in turn struck Single Gaze.

Down they went.

There were huge initial fears for both horse and rider. O'Hara suffered concussion, and later underwent surgery that night for a collapsed lung. The horse, thankfully, was OK.

Even in her semi-conscious state, as she lay on the Randwick turf, all O'Hara could say to trainer Nick Olive was ""Nick, Nick, how's the horse?""

It took until February this year for Single Gaze to race again. Canberra-based trainer Nick Olive extended the olive branch to O'Hara and reunited the duo. Two wins and a string of consistent results followed, highlighted by a close-up second in traditional Melbourne Cup lead-up, the Caulfield Cup, in October.

""She went sensational. She gave everything and I'm so proud of her. She's so tough,"" O'Hara said after that race.

Jockeys often switch between horses on a race-to-race basis. But when they stick, they often form a close bond. These two have now raced 23 times together, and as you'd imagine, they're great mates.

So much ❤️❤️ A post shared by Kathy Ohara (@kathy_ohara) on Oct 21, 2017 at 3:07am PDT

Onwards, then, to the Melbourne Cup, where Single Gaze will line up as a 40-1 outsider. It's not that there's anything wrong with its form. It's just that there are several hard-fit gallopers who've been running on the big stage for a while now.

Single Gaze may not quite have their class, but she's definitely got the guts.

O'Hara, meanwhile, will try to become the second female jockey after Michelle Payne to win Australia's greatest race. The Sydney-based 31-year-old has been riding professionally for 15 years. In that time she's notched up almost 800 winners, including 215 in Sydney.

O'Hara is in hot form too, having ridden three of the eight winners at the most recent Sydney race meeting just last weekend.

Don’t panic though: You’re not high, she is. Pam has been eating marijuana-infused gnocchi with Linda Robson, in a real-life scene that will air on TV next week.

The three-part documentary ‘Gone To Pot’ sounds like it would more at home on Viceland - or at the very least a 10pm slot on Channel 5 - but it’s ITV who commissioned the series, which sees some familiar faces - the ex-‘EastEnders’ actress, Linda, John Fashanu, Christopher Biggins and Bobby George - on a voyage of discovery, learning more about the drug.

Before jetting off to California, Pam had little first-hand experience of it - “I’d smoked a bit when I was younger but nothing great… And like all good politicians of course, I didn’t inhale” - but when HuffPost UK spoke with the actress just days after she returned to the UK, she explained that the trip did succeed in changing her perceptions.

In the first episode, viewers will see the gang learn that many medical users in the US are over 55 - a factor that helped ITV decide who could be good for the show - as they visit a dispensary to learn about which products could help their various ailments.

Denn ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"" und ""Die Welt"" lehnen das Verteufeln von Steueroasen ab

Für Steuergewerkschafts-Chef Thomas Eigenthaler ist diese Argumentation ""absurd""

Für den Durchschnittsdeutschen liegen die Steueroasen in weiter Ferne. Das liegt weniger daran, dass Reisen in die Steuerparadiese der Südsee vergleichsweise teuer sind. Vielmehr mangelt es ihnen am Vermögen, um die zahlreichen Schlupflöcher skrupellos auszunutzen.

Erst ab einem bestimmten Steuerbetrag rechnet sich der Aufwand, und damit zugleich der Ertrag, um Geld am deutschen Fiskus vorbeizuschleusen.

Doch diese augenscheinliche Ungleichheit ist für Olaf Gersemann, ""Die Welt""-Ressortleiter für Wirtschaft und Finanzen, und Peter A. Fischer, Leiter der Wirtschaftsredaktion der ""Neuen Zürcher Zeitung"" (""NZZ""), kein Problem.

Denn beide verteidigen in ihren Kommentaren die Steueroasen.

""Simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur""

So schreibt Fischer in seinem Beitrag für die NZZ, indem die investigativen Journalisten einige Fälle vermuteten Missbrauchs publikumswirksam herauspicken, würden sie versuchen, alle Offshore-Geschäfte zu verteufeln. Doch diese haben ""in einer immer globaleren Welt nicht nur ihre Berechtigung, sondern sind oft sogar zwingend.""

Der Wirtschaftsjournalist betont, Offshore-Transaktionen seien meistens entweder ""simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur eines Geschäfts"" oder Resultat von tatsächlichen Unzulänglichkeiten und Missständen in den betroffenen Ländern.

Für letzteres nennt Fischer ein Beispiel: die aus seiner Sicht ""prohibitiv scharfe"" Besteuerung von Unternehmensgewinnen in den USA.

Deshalb dürfe man Steueroasen nicht grundsätzlich verteufeln - wie es weltweit Medien machen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Übergriffige Kassenwarte

Gersemann von der ""Welt"" sieht das ähnlich. Hinter den Offshore-Geschäften gebe es keine Doppelmoral - und ""eine pauschale Vorverurteilung aller Offshoreaktivitäten ist durch nichts gerechtfertigt.""

Seine Argumentation: ""Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe"", behauptet er in seinem Kommentar.

Gerade angesichts einer immer weiter alternden Gesellschaft würden die Finanzminister laut Gersemann zunehmend ""internationale Kartelle mit Mindeststeuersätzen bilden, denen niemand entrinnen kann"".

Deshalb würden Steueroasen dazu dienen, ""auf Dauer zu verhindern, dass die Kassenwarte allzu übergriffig werden."" Die Steuerverstecke würden Schutz bieten – vor der ""Gier der Finanzminister"".

Gersemanns Quintessenz: ""Wenn es Steueroasen nicht schon gäbe, müssten sie dringend erfunden werden.""

""Zeugt von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung""

Thomas Eigenthaler, Vorsitzender der Steuergewerkschaft, hält diese Argumentation für ""absurd"". ""Wenn wir alles machen, was nicht verboten ist, um auf egoistische Weise einen persönlichen Vorteil zu erreichen, dann kann ein Gemeinwesen nicht funktionieren"", betont er im Gespräch mit der HuffPost.

Denn wenn man Leistungen des Staates abrufe, dann sei es ihm zufolge es unmoralisch, wenn man sich nicht am Staatswesen beteilige. Zudem ist es demokratisch beschlossen, dass die Wohlhabenderen mehr schultern und nach unseren Gesetzen einen höheren Steuersatz zahlen als die niedriger Verdienenden.

Wenn man sich allerdings den Steuerpflichte entziehe, sei das ein ""billiges und arrogantes Vorgehen"", dass ""von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung zeugt"", unterstreicht Eigenthaler.

And, more precisely, the chemical compounds which allowed it to happen.

We may have had several billion years under our belts to figure it out, but scientists today continue to be puzzled by how early cellular life on Earth first came to be.

Researchers have long speculated that a chemical reaction called phosphorylation was a crucial step in the arrival of early life forms.

This is because in order for life to come into existence it needed a few simple ingredients - strands of nucleotides to store genetic information, chains of amino acids for cell function, and lipids to form cell walls and other structures.

These are just basic requirements of all biological structures.

Despite knowing this, scientists had never been able to find a phosphorylating chemical agent that would have plausibly been around at this time, in the right quantities, in the right place, to serve as the trigger.

But now researchers at the Scripps Research Institute have found one that could have played this central role: diamidophosphate (DAP).

Senior author Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy and his colleagues have previously shown how DAP is able to generate a variety of simple sugars that are present in early life forms.

“That in turn would have allowed other chemistries that were not possible before, potentially leading to the first simple, cell-based living entities,” said Krishnamurthy.

“It reminds me of the fairy godmother in Cinderella, who waves a wand and poof, poof, poof, everything simple is transformed into something more complex and interesting,” he added.

It might have been able to do what early life forms required, but is there evidence that this compound even existed in this period?

A single mother will be £2,236 worse off under the government’s Universal Credit benefit than they would have been if Labour’s tax credit system had been left in place, research published on Monday has revealed. According to the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), the government’s flagship benefits reform is a “colossal failure” that will leave a generation of children “scarred” by austerity. The analysis, conducted with the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), also calculated that one million more children are likely to be in poverty in 2020 as a result of cuts to the new benefit programme. According to the data, the freezes and cuts to Universal Credit work allowances will leave lone parents worse off by, on average, £710 a year, couples £250 a year. And a single parent already working full time on the national living wage would have to work an extra 41 days a year to make up for the losses suffered as a result of the cuts.

Theresa May is under pressure from backbench Tory MPs as well as the Labour Party to pause the roll-out of the system - or make significant changes to how Universal Credit operates. The new benefit system, the brainchild of Iain Duncan Smith, combines six of the main welfare benefits into a single payment. It is designed to both simplify the system and encourage people back into work. David Cameron promised in 2009 in his party conference speech that Duncan Smith was the “one person this party can rely on” to tackle child poverty. But Alison Garnham, the chief executive, of CPAG, said today that pledge “has been broken”.","Universal Credit Leaving Children 'Scarred' By Poverty, Warns Think-Tank",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/universal-credit-leaving-children-scarred-by-poverty-warns-think-tank_uk_59ff3f34e4b0baea26324bcf?9ok&utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Papers included in the leak show Diamond's plans for a company called Helipad Plain, which was created in Mauritius in 2015.
Closer to home, the fallout over the Paradise Papers release has struck instantly in Canberra.
""Until the Government commits to a comprehensive Tax Haven Transparency package, as Labor has, the public is going to rely on Paradise Papers style leaks to expose the murky use of tax havens,"" he said in a statement.
""But the Turnbull Government is more likely devoting their energy to a scare campaign about public information about who uses these tax havens and how much tax they pay.","The estate of deceased INXS frontman Michael Hutchence has been entangled in the Paradise Papers leak.

The estate of former INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, actress Nicole Kidman and the Australian arm of mining giant Glencore have become entangled in the largest leak of information in history, a mammoth journalistic investigation on the world's tax havens dubbed the Paradise Papers.

The leak -- 13.4 million documents and 1.4 terabytes of data -- was obtained by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which further shared the trove with nearly 100 media partners worldwide.

Included in the leak -- alongside links to Queen Elizabeth, U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- are several prominent Australian identities.

As the Australian Financial Review reported ""many senior Australian business figures appear in the data in their entirely legitimate roles as executives and directors of offshore subsidiaries and some ASX-listed companies. It should be noted these are standard, legal business structures.""

As The Guardian and the ABC report, one of the more intriguing disclosures is information about the estate of deceased INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.

The Paradise Papers show how the singer's former lawyer Colin Diamond claimed key parts of Hutchence's estate, and embarked on a plan revolving around ""commercial exploitation of the sound recordings, images, films and related materials embodying the performance of Michael Hutchence"".

Papers included in the leak show Diamond's plans for a company called Helipad Plain, which was created in Mauritius in 2015. The ABC reports the company was involved in plans to commercially exploit the 20th anniversary of Hutchence's death, including a documentary, releasing previously unheard songs, and a film.

A deep investigation into the case of Hutchence will air on ABC's Four Corners on Monday night.

The Guardian reports the Australian arm of mining company Glencore was ""involved in cross-currency swaps of up to $25bn of a type under specific investigation by the Australian tax office"". These type of swaps, while legal, are being investigated by the ATO with suspicion they may be used to avoid tax by shuttling interest payments from high-tax nations to low-tax nations.

The papers show that Bermuda-based and Australian-based arms of Glencore swapped billions of dollars in Australian currency to American currency in 2013.

Glencore's Australian arm moved billions through Bermuda https://t.co/k2MsRosopk — Gareth Hutchens (@grhutchens) November 5, 2017

Actress Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban are also named in the papers; The Australian Financial Review reported the pair registered a limited liability partnership in Tennessee in 2014.

Closer to home, the fallout over the Paradise Papers release has struck instantly in Canberra. The ATO confirmed it had been made aware of the investigation in recent weeks, and stood ready to take action on any Australians avoiding tax obligations.

""We anticipate further data may be published by the ICIJ and the ATO will continue to work closely with other tax administrations to share intelligence on advisers operating globally,"" ATO deputy commissioner for international affairs, Mark Konza, said in a statement.

""Domestically, we are working with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Federal Police, and Austrac to further cross-check data and build our intelligence base, undertake audits, apply significant tax penalties where appropriate and refer cases to the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce for criminal investigation.""

Konza said the ATO ""investigate all leads and have the resources and expertise to take action against taxpayers or intermediaries found to be caught-up in the illegal use of offshore structures or providers"".

In an interview on ABC radio on Monday, Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison said the ATO was ""on the front foot"" in regards to investigating any Australian misdoing exposed in the Paradise Papers publication.

""Australia is doing what we must be doing in relation to these latest revelations. We have been leading the charge in relation to international jurisdictions since the last set of papers,"" Morrison said at a doorstop interview later on Monday.

""As we heard at Estimates, the ATO said that Australia's laws, particularly on multinational tax avoidance, were exactly what they need to be to enable the ATO to get the job done. The ATO have also said they have the resources. They have more than 1,000 people at the ATO who are working specifically on issues related to companies, multinationals and private companies.""

Morrison said the Government had been working hard on ensuring big corporations met their tax obligations in Australia.

""Pay your tax. That has always been my message to big multinationals. Pay your tax based on what you earn here in Australia. The good news is that it is happening more and more often. The tax office has pointed to $4 billion of settlements, around about $1 billion of which have been specifically able to be dealt with because of our tougher multinational anti-avoidance laws,"" he said.

""On top of that we have about $7 billion worth of sales which have come back into the GST net because of our tougher multinational anti avoidance laws. So my message to multinationals is pay your tax and increasingly that is exactly what they are doing.""

""Not only are we doing everything that the ATO believes we should be doing but when you look around the world we have now one of the toughest, if not the toughest jurisdiction on multinational tax avoidance of anywhere in the world.""

Labor, however, is calling on the Government to do more. The opposition assistant treasurer Dr Andrew Leigh said more needed to be done to expose these 'tax havens'.

""Until the Government commits to a comprehensive Tax Haven Transparency package, as Labor has, the public is going to rely on Paradise Papers style leaks to expose the murky use of tax havens,"" he said in a statement.

""But the Turnbull Government is more likely devoting their energy to a scare campaign about public information about who uses these tax havens and how much tax they pay.

Your body processes calories from certain foods differently, depending on whether or not the food (and its ingredients) are nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor. Kelly Hogan, a clinical nutrition and wellness manager at Mount Sinai’s Dubin Breast Cancer center, helped explain why certain foods, such as kale, are processed differently in our bodies than a food like sugary cereal. She said it’s important to focus on the nutrient density of foods.

“A [100-calorie] bowl of kale with an egg is going to give you high quality protein, fiber and a big variety of vitamins and minerals like vitamins, A, C, K, folate, etc,” Hogan said. “A [100-calorie bowl of] cereal that is high in sugar is not going to give you the same quality nutrients. And what’s more, the fact that it is low in protein and fiber but high in sugar can set you up for a blood sugar spike and crash, bringing on more cravings for sweets or refined starches throughout the day.

She added, “It’s easy to overeat when eating these types of food because of these blood sugar fluctuations and the fact that they aren’t typically super filling.”

You can tell you’re having a blood sugar crash if you start to experience irritability, dizziness, weakness or an intense feeling of hunger, Hogan said.

“This is where the term ‘hangry’ comes from as well ― when our blood sugar is low and we need to eat something, we often have difficulty concentrating, focusing and are more likely to snap at others,” she explained. “The body will physiologically crave something sweet or starchy when blood sugar is low because these are the foods that can raise blood sugar quickly.”

To prevent these type of crashes, try eating foods that are nutrient rich, like fruits, veggies, lean proteins, legumes, nuts, seeds, beans and dairy (the Center for Disease Control has a helpful graphic that offers nutrient-dense information for certain ingredients). Hogan likes to call these “whole foods” and you might know some of them by another term ― “complex carbohydrates.”

“Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates that take the body longer to break down into sugar because they have longer, more complex chemical structures compared to sugar,” she said. “They are a more sustainable energy source because of this and won’t raise blood sugar quite as quickly as more simple sugars.”

And no matter what, don’t assign foods labels like “good” or “bad.”

“Giving food labels like that fuels a diet culture and harmful relationship with food,” Hogan said. “In a diet with plenty of these whole foods, there is absolutely room for less nutrient dense but also delicious foods, like cake, for example.”",How Your Body Knows The Difference Between 100 Calories Of Kale vs. Junk Food,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-your-body-processes-100-calories-of-cereal-differently-from-100-calories-of-kale_us_59fc8990e4b0b0c7fa39c362

Rekindling has won the 2017 Melbourne Cup at Flemington.

Johannes Vermeer ran second and Max Dynamite ran third -- an incredible performance from the nine-year-old which ran second in 2015. Big Duke ran fourth, the first Australian horse to finish.

The winner was purchased as a yearling by prominent Melbourne businessman Lloyd Williams, who has now won his sixth Cup as an owner.

Rekindling, which started at 15-1, was ridden by Corey Brown, the Sydney-based rider originally from the tiny town of Wingham, on the NSW north coast. Brown rode 2009 Melbourne Cup winner Shocking, and has ridden around the world since then, before moving back home earlier this year.

Just got there. That's Rekindling in the pink cap.

""I've been back from overseas for about nine months, I can't believe it,"" Brown told Channel 7, flanked by his wife Kylie and brood of three teenage daughters.

""It's a dream even riding in the race but to come out and win it again... I'm lost for words.""

....Aaaand that makes two Cups for Corey.

This was a stirring Melbourne Cup. As with 2016 when Heartbreak City and Almandin cleared out from the pack, two horses battled it out down that long, long Flemington straight.

Johannes Vermeer had been ridden beautifully -- so well in fact that jockey Ben Melham perhaps hit the lead a little earlier than planned. He kicked well clear. But could he hold on? Almost. Half a length was the difference and all credit to the winner.

Incredibly, the Irish-trained winner was the youngest horse in the race -- classed as a four year old in Australia because the horses' birthday falls on August 1, but technically still three.

His trainer Joseph O'Brien is also young, at just 24. His father Aidan O'Brien is one of the foremost trainers in the world, but young Joe has now done something his dad is yet to achieve.

""I really didn't expect to have to say a few words. All I can really do is thank Lloyd and Nick [Williams] who sent me the horse at the start of the year. I can't quite believe it yet.""",Melbourne Cup 2017: The Winner Is Rekindling,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/melbourne-cup-2017-the-winner-is-rekindling_a_23268830/

Tatsächlich will Präsident Erdogan bis 2021 ein türkisches Auto auf den Markt bringen

""Die Deutschen sind in Panik"", glaubt die türkische Tageszeitung ""Günes"". Der Grund: Die Regierung von Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan plant, ein in der Türkei produziertes Auto Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Spätestens 2021 sollen fünf heimische Unternehmen im Verbund das Elektroauto auf den Markt bringen.

Die Erdogan-nahe Zeitung ""Günes"" zeigte in ihrer Sonntagsausgabe Angela Merkel auf der Titelseite. ""Schau, wie wir das machen"", lautete die große Überschrift in schwarzen und roten Lettern. Die deutschen Medien hätten eine ""Schmutzkampagne"" gestartet, aus Angst vor dem neuen Konkurrenten auf dem Automobilmarkt, so der Vorwurf der Zeitung.

Tatsächlich hatten mehrere deutsche Medien in der vergangenen Woche über Erdogans Auto-Projekt berichtet.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Leiter des Center Automotive Research (CAR) der Universität Duisburg-Essen, sagte der ""Welt"", das türkische Projekt sei ""Harakiri"". Es sei schade um das Geld, mindestens eine halbe Milliarde Euro werde ""einfach verbrannt"".

Schlechte Chancen für das Erdo-Car

Das größte Problem an dem Projekt: Im vergangenen Jahr seien in der Türkei lediglich 760.000 Autos verkauft worden. Zum Vergleich: In Deutschland gab es im gleichen Jahr 3,4 Millionen Neuzulassungen. Der heimische Markt alleine bietet somit nur bescheidene Absatzmöglichkeiten.

Bislang gibt es wenige Details über das türkische Auto, dessen Prototyp im Jahr 2019 fertiggestellt werden soll. Offenbar könnte es auf dem Aufbau des Saab 9-3 basieren, den die türkische Regierung im Jahr 2015 von der schwedischen Holdinggesellschaft National Electric Vehicle Sweden erworben hat.

Ob das der deutschen Industrie tatsächlich Sorgen bereitet, bleibt fraglich. Denn keines der fünf türkischen Unternehmen des Konsortiums verfügt über Erfahrungen beim Autobau.

Struggling against an orgy of shouting, clapping, and singing, the solemn weight of history dissolves in the deep shadows of the Gol Gumbaz. A royal tomb, the Gumbaz is sublimely grave in a way only maqbaras can be. Yet, after half a millennium it is also the sanctuary of a motley public. Despite its sepia magnificence, it is reinvented daily and is many things and places simultaneously.

And why not? Buildings, after all, do have a life of their own. They breathe and suffer, and are reborn with the communities who live in and around them. They change with the people who come to them as much, perhaps, as people are changed by their experiences of them. This infusion of character is constant and dynamic, and so the original creative intent becomes one amongst an unending matrix of meanings which emerge from brick and mortar.

This flux characterises Bijapur, a palimpsest notable for the legacies of the monumental Adil Shahs. The long shadows of memory and the tangible history of built form make the boundaries of past and present sfumato with constant use. From the Baran Kaman to the Taj Bauri, from Ibrahim Rauza to Gagan Mahal, the past speaks in Bijapur. It whispers of ambition, the seductions of power strange and terrible, desire and aspiration immortalised in stone. Born of vanity and vision, it symbolises a fusion of form, time, and space not only in terms of what was but also of what can be.

How do we imagine — spatially, economically, and affectively — the contours of such a fusion though? Who belongs to a city, and to whom do its edifices, not just its monuments but also buildings and infrastructure, belong? The law shelters the business of conservation from the commerce and traffic of daily life. Our conservation apparatus seems designed to institute alienation, and rarely does a neighbourhood, community, or people claim trusteeship over a building. We care about our homes, the houses we live in, but find it difficult to think of our cities as home, to care for the songs and shadows they surround us with.

The personal, therefore, is exiled from the communal, and the voice of memory and affect is unable to find a niche under the arch of history. In turning deaf to these voices, in seeing our past not as vibrantly alive but as delicately dead, we perform a grave disservice to our future. The Jami Masjid in Bijapur, for example, belongs both to the community of worshipers, as to the conservation apparatus which serves to memorialise it as a beacon of dakhini architecture. These meanings are not necessarily contrary, but that they often can be is a story local not just to Bijapur but to scores of cities across the subcontinent.

What is needed, then, is a marriage of interpretations and practice. Writing in 1889, Henry Cousens, then Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey of India (Western Circle), related that 'Bijapur has been called the Palmyra of the Dekhan'. In almost a century since, as the Palmyra lies devastated, the built legacy of Bijapur is at risk of an oblivion given the splintering of civic belonging and urban development. The manifold significance of the past is often in its ability to overwhelm, to instil a reverential awe which prompts interrogation and introspection. As we cloister these works and stories of our ancestors behind higher walls and turn blindly towards the future, we risk becoming harsher, meaner, and poorer.

Our heritage belongs to all of us. We cannot privilege one meaning and practice, without irrevocably losing the layered richness which grounds us organically to our communities and cities. The processes of use and interpretation have to be contextual, and it is through constant conversation alone that this erosion can be checked. How, for instance, do we make Taj Bauri relevant to the potable needs of residents without losing sight of the public generosity which informed its making? How do we reinvent Gol Gumbaz as a rendezvous point for a citizenry starved of safe public spaces? Can Baran Kaman become the breathing emblem of ambition which soars, and fails, and yet lives? The challenge at hand is to birth a future which sustains as much from the past as it loops back to it, where growth will aspire to be not from but with a common legacy. This challenge is monumental in itself, for it is not specific to Bijapur. It is ours, a shared task: it is a challenge to make the past one with the future.

Die ""Paradise Papers"" zeigen erneut, wie viele Reiche sich der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung entziehen

Gleichzeitig wird im politischen Diskurs lieber nach unten getreten

Das größte Problem sind aber nicht die ""sozial Abgehängten"", sondern die realitätsferne Elite

Der Publizist Jakob Augstein hat nicht immer Recht mit dem, was er in seiner Kolumne bei ""Spiegel Online"" veröffentlicht. Doch in seinem Text zu den Enthüllungen um die ""Paradise Papers"" hat er mit wenigen Sätzen ins Schwarze getroffen: ""Das System ist zutiefst krank. Es ist unmoralisch und unanständig“, schreibt er. ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.“

Das nunmehr öffentliche System von Briefkastenfirmen, mit denen Reiche ab einer bestimmten Anlagesumme sich das Steuerzahlen sparen können, ist ein erschreckendes Beispiel für den Unwillen der Privilegierten, Solidarität mit den wirtschaftlich Schwächeren zu zeigen.

Diese Steuersparmodelle sind meist völlig legal. Das macht sie aber noch lange nicht legitim, im Gegenteil. Die Verstrickung vieler deutscher Firmen und Privatpersonen zeigt, dass der alte rheinische Kapitalismus, der diesem Land Jahrzehnte lang sozialen Ausgleich und einen vergleichsweise hohen Lebensstandard für möglichst viele Menschen beschert hat, mittlerweile mausetot ist.

Und es gibt solche Menschen, die ohne den Anflug eines schlechten Gewissens diese Lücken nutzen. Ist ja alles erlaubt. Was sich jene, die sich sonst gerne zur ""Leistungselite"" dieses Landes zählen, dabei gerne unterschätzen: Macht geht auch mit Verantwortung einher.

Und genau das unterscheidet die Reichen auch von den Küchentischtricksern in den Reihenhäusern der urbanen Stadtrandlagen, die einen Zusammenstoß mit einem nachtblinden Fuchs gerne mal zum Wildunfall aufmotzen, um dann bei der Auto-Versicherung abzukassieren. Unehrlichkeit gibt es auch bei den Ärmeren. Aber sie hat längst nicht so große Folgen.

Wir haben ein moralisches Führungsproblem in diesem Land. Und es strahlt von oben nach unten aus. Mit Folgen für die politische Landschaft in der Bundesrepublik.

Auch die Populisten hetzen gegen die Armen

Es gibt eine Frage, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Siegeszug des Populismus bisher viel zu wenig diskutiert wurde: Warum eigentlich treten so viele Menschen gegen die vermeintlich Schwächeren in der Gesellschaft aus?

Der Erfolg der AfD wäre undenkbar ohne dieses Phänomen. Die Partei will das Arbeitslosengeld II für jene erhöhen, die mindestens zehn Jahre beschäftigt waren.

Außerdem plant sie, die Steuern für die Mittelschicht zu senken und die Erbschafts- sowie die Gewerbesteuer abzuschaffen. Davon profitieren vor allem jene, die einer geregelten Arbeit nachgehen und über ein vererbbares Vermögen verfügen.

Die nationalistisch denkenden Teile der Mittelschicht dürften sich von der Arbeits- und Sozialpolitik der AfD ganz gut vertreten fühlen. Und klar ist auch, auf wessen Kosten das geht: Es gibt weniger Geld für Asylleistungen, weniger Geld für Zuwanderer. Überhaupt: weniger Geld für alle, die nicht in die politischen Kategorien des AfD-Gesellschaftsbildes passen.

Das ist kein rein deutsches Phänomen. In Tschechien hat kürzlich ein Multimilliardär mit seiner Partei die Parlamentswahlen gewonnen, dessen Wahlkampf gespickt war mit Spitzen gegen Arbeitslose und Sozialhilfeempfänger.

Feindbilder passend für jede soziale Schicht

In Österreich hat die FPÖ ihren Wahlkampf mit dem Slogan ""neue Fairness"" bestritten. Auf Plakaten war ein österreichischer Rennradler zu sehen, der vorne auf dem Tandem sitzt, und eine dickbäuchige Karikatur eines faulen und obendrein auch linken Sozialhilfeempfängers auf dem Hintersattel mitziehen muss.

Die Motive gleichen sich in den Ländern Europas. Und die Populisten haben für fast jede Gesellschaftsschicht ein vermeintlich überalimentiertes Feindbild parat: Für die Wohlhabenden sind das die ""links-grün versifften Gutmenschen"", die mit Steuergeldern ihr angeblich zweifelhaftes Wirken finanziert bekommen.

Für die weniger Wohlhabenden sind es die Ausländer, deren Existenz nach Meinung des Stammtisches ""auf Kosten von Obdachlosen, Alten, Kranken und Armen"" finanziert wird.

Und wer selbst ohne Job ist, darf sich bei den Rechtspopulisten immerhin noch daran ergötzen, dass es ja noch jene Arbeitslosen gibt, die selbst verschuldet und durch eigene Faulheit in diese Situation geraten sind. Das sind im Zweifelsfall immer die anderen.

Auch die Linken treten nach unten

Übrigens ist dieses Phänomen des Nach-unten-Austretens auch aus einem ganz anderen Kontext sehr aktuell: Linke erheben sich selbst gerne über die AfD-Wähler, indem sie diese als ""dumme Nazi-Prolls"" diffamieren.

Die Stigmatisierung von Rechten als ""ungebildet"" oder ""sozial minderwertig"" ist nicht nur gefährlich, sondern lenkt den Blick von jenen gesellschaftlichen Bruchlinien ab, die in Deutschland den sozialen Frieden gefährden – und dadurch mitverantwortlich sind für den Aufstieg der rechten Parteien.

Die Scheren zwischen Arm und Reich, Stadt und Land, Rentnern und Pensionären, Akademikern und Handwerkern sind derart offensichtlich geworden, dass die so gewachsenen Unterschiede das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl vieler Menschen verletzen. Und – da sind wir wieder bei den ""Paradise Papers"": Auch dafür ist derzeit kaum jemand bereit, die Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Das moralische Führungsproblem.

Die Regierenden verstehen das Problem noch immer nicht

Wenn ein Akademikerkind eine dreimal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf ein Studium hat und eine zehnmal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine erfolgreich abgeschlossene Promotion als ein Arbeiterkind, dann wirkt das entmutigend auf jene, die eigentlich eine ""Aufsteigerbiografie"" leben könnten.

Wenn die Pensionen für Staatsdiener zwanzig Prozentpunkte höher liegen als die Renten für Arbeitnehmer, dann wird dadurch der Verdruss auf das System befeuert.

Und wenn die CSU beim Breitbandausbau ganz auf die Kraft des freien Marktes vertraute, der aber aus Profitgründen gar nicht daran dachte, die abgelegeneren Regionen Deutschlands mit schnellem Internet zu versorgen, dann wächst auf dem Land der Verdruss gegen die ""Eliten"" in den Städten.

Was wir in Deutschland bräuchten, wäre ein Masterplan, wie die gespaltene Gesellschaft wieder näher zusammengeführt werden kann. Das betrifft politische Maßnahmen, muss aber auch auf unser gesellschaftliches Leitbild abzielen.

Populisten und Radikale hatten in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik stets dann die schlechtesten Chancen, wenn Wohlstand in Deutschland gerecht geteilt wurde.

Dem gegenüber steht derzeit der Trend, dass sich Reiche in Deutschland in ihre eigene Welt zurückziehen. Privatschulen haben immer mehr Zulauf, ebenso wie kommerziell betriebene Universitäten. Wer sich eine private Altersvorsorge leisten kann, muss sich nicht mehr allein auf die gesetzliche Rente verlassen.

Und wer genug Geld gesammelt hat, dass er im Stehen schlafen müsste, wenn er es unter das Kopfkissen legen würde, der kann sich auch die legale Ausweichbewegung in die so genannten ""Steuer-Oasen"" leisten.

Das Deprimierende ist, dass die Politik immer noch nicht erkannt hat, wie viel gesellschaftlicher Schaden dadurch entsteht.

Wer ständig nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge kräht, aber nicht einmal ansatzweise willens ist, die Reichen in diesem Land zu gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu zwingen, der beweist damit eigentlich nur, dass er die Probleme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nicht verstanden hat.

Wenn man den Bewohnern Glauben schenken darf, soll das Dorf jedoch verflucht sein

Wie die Bewohner mit dem vermeintlichen Fluch umgehen, seht ihr oben im Video

Die kleine Ortschaft Colobraro in der süditalienischen Region Basilikata soll verflucht sein. Deshalb trauen sich die Einwohner der umliegenden Dörfer noch nicht einmal, den Namen des Ortes auszusprechen.

Das Wort Colobraro leitet sich von dem lateinischen Wort Coluber ab, was Schlange bedeutet. Für die abergläubischen Einheimischen ist die Schlange der Inbegriff des Bösen. Die Leute in der Region glauben, dass denjenigen, der den Namen laut ausspricht, Unheil verfolgen werde. Das geht auch aus einer Dokumentation des BBC hervor. Das Dorf wird deshalb nur “Quel pases“ genannt, was übersetzt nur “dieses Dorf“ heißt.

Der Fluch begann im Jahr 1940

Zudem soll ein alter Fluch über dem Dorf liegen, der im Jahr 1940 begann. Der damalige Bürgermeister prophezeite bei einer Versammlung, dass auf der Stelle ein Kronleuchter von der Decke stürzen werde - sollten die Zuhörern seinen Worten keinen Glauben schenken. Der Legende zufolge, die jeder Bewohner von Colobraro kennt, fiel der Leuchter darauf sofort herunter.

Darüber hinaus lebten bis in die 70er Jahre die damals berüchtigten “Masciare“ in dem Dorf. Dabei soll es sich um Zauberinnen gehandelt haben, die mit ihrer bösen Magie angeblich ganze Städte kontrollierten. Ein Anthropologe besuchte das Dorf im Jahr 1952, um die Geschichte der Masciare zu erforschen. Er wurde laut einer Legende selbst Opfer des Fluchs: Alle seine Kollegen wurden schlagartig krank.

Heute versuchen die Bewohner das Beste daraus zu machen

Seitdem sind die Bewohner der Region sicher, dass Colobraro verflucht ist. Der heutige Bürgermeister der Stadt versucht jedoch, das Beste aus der Lage zu machen. Er hat zum Beispiel ein Festival ins Leben gerufen, in dem die Bewohner Colobraros ihr verfluchtes Dorf feiern. Die Einwohner inszenieren darin jeden August ihre Unglückstraditionen. Frauen treten als Masciare auf, Wahrsagerinnen lesen Schicksale aus Händen der Besucher und die Bewohner verkaufen Schutzamulette. So kann die Gemeinde immerhin ihre klammen Kassen auffüllen.

US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has business ties to a shipping firm linked to Vladimir Putin's inner circle, according to a vast leak of financial documents that also revealed Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's investments in tax havens.

It was also revealed that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's top fundraiser and senior advisor Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, moved some USD 60 million to offshore tax havens with ex-senator Leo Kolber.

The findings have emerged as part of the Paradise Papers released by the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which was behind the Panama Papers made public last year.

There is no suggestion that Ross, Bronfman or the Queen's private estate acted illegally. But Ross's ties to Russian entities raise questions over potential conflicts of interest, and whether they undermine Washington's sanctions on Moscow.

The revelations about Bronfman could spell trouble for Trudeau, who was elected two years ago riding on the coattails of promises to reduce economic inequality and tax avoidance.

In the case of Queen Elizabeth's private estate, critics may question whether it is appropriate for the British head of state to invest in offshore tax havens.

Ross, a billionaire investor, holds a 31 per cent stake in Navigator Holdings through a complex web of offshore investments detailed in the documents examined by nearly 100 news organisations as part of an international collaboration. The 79-year-old reduced his stake when he took public office, according to public filings.

Navigator Holdings runs a lucrative partnership with Russian energy giant Sibur, which is partially owned by Putin's son-in-law Kirill Shamalov and Gennady Timchenko, the Russian president's friend and business partner who is subject to US sanctions.

The US imposed sanctions on Russian entities and individuals following its annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine.

Ross's private equity firm has been the biggest shareholder in Navigator. His personal share of the firm's stake was reduced when he took office in February, but the commerce chief's investment is still valued at between USD 2 million to USD 10 million, according to his security filings and government ethics disclosure.

The New York Times reported that Ross's stake in Navigator has been held by companies in the Cayman Islands. His wealth, estimated to exceed USD 2 billion, is said to be tied to similar arrangements in various tax havens like the Cayman Islands. ""Secretary Ross was not involved with Navigator's decision to engage in business with Sibur, a publicly traded company, which was not under sanction at the time and is not currently,"" said James Rockas, a Commerce Department spokesman.

""Moreover, Secretary Ross has never met the Sibur shareholders referenced in this story and, until now, did not know of their relationship.""

The documents also show around 10 million pounds (USD 13 million) of the Queen's private money was placed in funds held in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, first reported in Britain by the BBC and the Guardian newspaper.

They reported the funds reinvested the money in an array of businesses, including controversial rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and a chain of alcohol stores that later went bankrupt.

A spokeswoman for the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the monarch with an income and handles her investments, said, ""All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate.""

""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds,"" she added.

The spokeswoman added that one of the fund investments represents only 0.3 per cent of the total value of the Duchy.

The Paradise Papers contain 13.4 million documents mainly from Appleby, an offshore law firm with offices in Bermuda and beyond. The files were first obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, and shared with the ICIJ and partner media outlets.

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Muholi will show three of her series at the event.

You'll often read they have unrealistic expectations, they're self-centered and they expect things to be handed to them. Maybe you've even heard that they won't work as hard or they have difficult personalities to manage.

Today's entry-level workforce is made up of mostly millennials, and despite what you may read elsewhere, they can be your best employees. I've worked with national companies where I had to hire, train and fire my team, and every workforce has employees at both ends of the spectrum. Yes, there are bad millennial employees, like in any workforce, but the overwhelming majority of them are just fine.

I was born in between Gen X and millennials, not really fitting into either group. There are a few different names for this in-between generation, but I like to think it gives me a unique ability to understand both generations. I often see my Gen X manager co-workers frustrated with their employees, and here's the advice I give them: Rather than entitled and self-centered, view millennials as driven and demanding the best for themselves. Then tap into this resource.

Rather than entitled and self-centered, view millennials as driven and demanding the best for themselves.

Yes, millennials will push you to be a better manager and test your patience, but look at it as a challenge and rise to it.

Don't be a bad manager

There are many bad managers. They're not all bad people, they just had bad managers themselves and are emulating these bad traits. Usually this entails treating an employee like a simple tool: give them a task and expect it to be fulfilled as asked. You're the boss after all, shouldn't they do exactly as you say? That's not managing — that's just giving orders.

With this brute-force method, you'll get certain a certain amount accomplished, but your team will likely never reach its full potential. Morale will be low. Turnover will be high.

Employees aren't robots. You'll get more out of them if they feel a sense of higher purpose and achievement. If it were as easy as just giving an order, the military wouldn't care about morale or making sure soldiers have a sense of purpose. They go to great expense to make sure they have both. In a career where you can literally go to jail for not following orders, they still work hard on morale because it really is the best way to get great results.

The biggest difference between a Gen X employee and millennial is the expectation of work.

Make your team a part of the goal and allow them share in the reward and you'll find they push themselves harder than you could. Find what motivates them, and lead them towards that goal. They'll put that bursting ambition and creativity to work for you. This can be a simple pizza party to mark the achievement.

The biggest difference between a Gen X employee and millennial is the expectation of work. Where a Gen Xer may be happy to simply have a job with a steady paycheck in this dog-eat-dog world, this isn't enough for millennials. Millennials aren't afraid to be unemployed (which they are in record numbers). Rightly or wrongly, they do expect to have a great job they enjoy with benefits that match. This is often why the Gen X manager looks at a millennial as entitled.

What appears to be entitlement is more just frustration that they aren't at the same level as their own expectations. Having a huge sense of self-worth isn't bad, they just need help directing this energy. Set lofty goals and expectations, and reward them when they meet both. They will surprise you.

Firing millennials is OK

But wait — aren't there bad teams? Yes, there are. You should talk to the person who hired them — or the person that didn't fire them. Oh, that's you? Then you need to hire, fire and manage them properly, or you're being a bad manager again. Your entire team could be suffering due to one or two individuals. Like all employees, you can fire millennials, and yet most managers seem afraid to. Why?

A lot of managers I've spoken have the same problem: The employee has talent (heck, they might even be amazing at their job!), but they complain, undercut the manager's position, and generally drag down the workplace morale. What are they to do?

The manager thinks they are in a tough spot. If they discipline the very talented employee by talking to them or putting something on file, what if they quit and can't replace the talent? I give the manager the same advice my boss and mentor gave me the first time I came across this problem: what if they stay? I will take a less talented employee with the right attitude over an extremely talented troublemaker any day. An unhappy superstar isn't using all their talent and effort, anyways.

Don't hold millennials back

Don't hire someone for the job because you think they'll be around for a while. You'll regret this if you truly want the best team possible. Only hire people that have a desire to be better and move up in the world, and then help them get there. A rising tide lifts all boats, and these individuals will push your whole team to new heights.

The best managers I've ever had always cared about my future and did everything they could to help me reach my goals. In turn, I would march head first into battle for them with everything I had. I've made sure I've offered my employees the same. Don't hold your team back because you're afraid of losing a great employee. This only serves you, and they'll know it. After all, you're not supposed to be the self-centered one, right?

Millennials may need some leadership — so lead them, and they just might surprise you.

Nous défendrons nos droits jusqu'au bout."" Ce 6 novembre, alors que le désormais ex-gouvernement catalan en est réduit à choisir entre l'exil en Belgique et l'emprisonnement en Espagne, son leader déchu Carles Puigdemont s'est exprimé au moyen d'une tribune publiée sur le site des Britanniques de The Guardian.

Un texte dans lequel il parle sans retenue, accusant directement Madrid d'agir de manière antidémocratique et de chercher à étouffer la voix du peuple. ""Est-ce que quelqu'un pense que le gouvernement catalan aura droit à une audience juste et indépendante, non-influencée par la politique et la pression médiatique? Je ne le crois pas"", écrit Carles Puigdemont.

""En agissant de manière arbitraire, antidémocratique et selon moi illégale, l'État espagnol a décidé de dissoudre le parlement catalan en pleine législature, de révoquer le président et le gouvernement catalan, d'intervenir dans notre autonomie et dans les institutions que les Catalans ont construites au sein de notre nation depuis des siècles. ""

Un projet toujours assumé

Plus loin, celui qui était devenu le 130e président de Catalogne en 2016 critique le traitement judiciaire réservé à ses proches. ""Les leaders de ce projet démocratique sont désormais accusés de rébellion et risquent la sanction la plus sévère de la loi espagnole, la même que pour un assassinat ou du terrorisme: 30 ans de prison."" De même, il qualifie l'emprisonnement de plusieurs membres du gouvernement ""d'outrage colossal qui aura de très sérieuses conséquences"", et ce alors que contrairement à d'autres factions indépendantistes, les Catalans ""n'ont jamais opté pour la violence, bien au contraire.""

Dans sa tribune, Carles Puigdemont réaffirme que sa volonté de proclamer l'indépendance était au cœur du programme sur lequel son parti s'est présenté et a remporté les élections catalanes en 2015. ""Les gens qui nous ont soutenu ont toujours su quel était notre objectif. Et pourtant, deux ans après ces élections, nous sommes accusés de sédition, de conspiration et de rébellion pour avoir simplement poursuivi un programme électoral qui n'a jamais été secret.""

""Ce qui est en jeu, c'est la démocratie""

Une raison pour laquelle le président déchu s'en prend vertement à la manière dont l'Espagne gère les volontés d'indépendance. ""Il y a deux niveaux de démocratie: on peut être un parti pro-indépendance, mais uniquement si on n'est pas au pouvoir."" Et de critiquer une fois de plus un pays qui veut présenter à la justice ""ceux qui respectent leurs engagement électoraux"" et ""où les liens entre la justice et l'exécutif sont visibles par tous.""

Au lendemain de sa libération conditionnelle par la justice belge, Carles Puigdemont accuse finalement le gouvernement espagnol d'avoir facilité la tâche de l'extrême-droite et des fascistes. ""Dans des manifestations organisées par le parti au pouvoir en Espagne, les héritiers directs du régime de Franco ont marché, certains brandissant des drapeaux fascistes et faisant des saluts nazis.""

""Nous continuerons de dénoncer à la face du monde les graves manquements démocratiques désormais évidents en Espagne"", ajoute-t-il. ""Nous défendrons nos droits jusqu'au bout. Parce que ce que qui est en jeu est bien supérieur à nos avenirs personnels: ce qui est en jeu, c'est la démocratie elle-même.""

TORONTO — A lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein alleging the Hollywood mogul sexually assaulted an Ontario actress nearly two decades ago is being allowed to proceed even though lawyers have not been able to track him down.

A Toronto court gave the woman's lawyers permission to file a statement of claim Monday despite their failure to serve Weinstein and his former assistant, who is also named as a defendant, with legal documents.

Alex Smith, who represents the actress, said they tried and failed to serve Weinstein at his home in Westport, Conn., and believe he could also be in Phoenix, Ariz., or somewhere in Europe.

""His whereabouts are unknown,"" he said.

They also repeatedly tried to serve Weinstein's former assistant at her office and through her lawyer but have not succeeded so far, Smith said.

""His whereabouts are unknown."" Alex Smith

None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have been filed.

The court issued an order Monday for substituted service, meaning lawyers can take other means to serve the defendants with the lawsuit instead of doing so in person.

""When you start a lawsuit, with a statement of claim the first originating document, it has to be served personally, that's the rule — meaning it has to be put in that person's hand,"" said Erik Knutsen, a law professor at Queen's University.

""If for some reason you have difficulty with that, or it's impossible, the rules of civil procedure in those special circumstances allow lawyers or parties to ask the court to grant what's called substituted service but before you even get there you have to also prove that alternatives to something other than personal service don't work,"" he said.

Watch: Ashley Judd opens up about Harvey Weinstein

​

​​​​​​​​​​​Some alternative methods include sending it by mail or giving it to the person's lawyer, he said.

Substituted service allows lawyers to print a notice in the newspaper or serve someone else, such as a spouse, if that makes it likely the targeted person will see it, Knutsen said.

""The overarching reason behind all of this is, suing someone in civil court is a really important thing and so we want to make sure that as best as reasonably possible, that really important document gets in the hands of that person and not lost or something,"" he said.

Actress says she suffered distress, depression

In a statement of claim, the actress, who cannot be named as she is seeking a publication ban on her identity, alleges she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein while she had a part in a movie being filmed in and around Toronto.

The actress is seeking millions of dollars in damages, claiming she has suffered mental distress, extreme social anxiety and depression, as well as social isolation and feelings of guilt, worthlessness and shame as a result of what happened.

The civil case will return to court on Dec. 1. The woman's lawyers will eventually be seeking to move ahead with the claim without using her name, arguing that identifying her would cause irreparable harm to her mental health and well-being. An affidavit filed in court said she may not continue with the case if she must use her name.

Smith said the woman is starting to see a therapist who will provide evidence on the effect it would have on the actress if she were publicly identified.

The woman's allegations come as Weinstein, an Oscar-winning film producer, faces a slew of sexual harassment allegations from several women.

He was fired from his namesake company on Oct. 8, days after reports of sexual harassment by him ran in the New York Times. Weinstein's representative Sallie Hofmeister has said Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.

NEW DELHI -- India may announce measures next week to help traders and small businesses who say a new nationwide goods and services tax (GST) has increased their tax and administrative burden.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said if there is consensus at the next GST council meeting due over November 9 to November 10, the government would take the necessary steps to help traders and strengthen the country's economy.

A panel of ministers last month recommended reducing tax rates for small businesses and traders and raising the minimum revenue threshold for companies that need to pay tax, local media reported.

The launch in July of the long-awaited GST, which transformed India's 29 states into a single customs union, has left thousands of small and medium-sized firms at the bottom of the supply chain short of working capital.

Modi is facing criticism for the disruption to the economy caused by the roll-out of GST and the shock removal of higher-value bills from circulation last year. As a result of these issues India's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in four years this fiscal year, a Reuters poll found.

Modi's comments came days after India jumped about 30 places to 100th on the World Bank's ""Ease of Doing Business"" rankings, reflecting reforms in accessing credit, power supply and the protection of minority investors.

Modi said he expected India's ranking to improve next year when the GST and other reforms were considered.

There are still three weeks until the November 25 ballot, which means that Australia will have to endure at least some One Nation-branded campaigning.



Here are three things you should expect in the coming weeks:

1. Electricity, Electricity, Electricity

According to Hanson, keeping electricity bills down is the single most important issue for One Nation in the election.

The senator is set to announce a plan for Queensland One Nation to use $1.4 billion worth of profits from government-owned assets to create electricity subsidies for households. The proposal will aim to undercut the Labor Party's proposed electricity policy, which planned to shave off $50 from each household electricity bill.

Speaking to The Australian, Hanson said that the cost of electricity was ""the main thing affecting the whole state"".



""I have travelled all over Queensland and people are suffering across the state, businesses are closing down and it's hurting ordinary families,"" she said.

On Sunday Queensland Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls threw his hat into the ring, pledging to reduce household power bills by $160 over two years.

2. Less Criticism Of Islam

This one might come as a bit of a shock. One Nation's most recent 30-page Queensland policy booklet doesn't even mention mosques, halal food, or Islam.

And even more suprisingly -- One Nation candidate Shane Holley recently campaigned outside Logan Mosque alongside local Muslims, calling for ""harmony"" in the seat of Stretton.



Holley told the crowd that it was ""fantastic to be able to dispel some of the myths out there"" about One Nation, according to SBS.

IMMIGRATION POLICY | @PaulineHansonOz speaks for the silent majority but the other parties refuse to listen. #auspolhttps://t.co/V4nlojwOh1 — Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) October 26, 2017

This stance is at odds with the party's past calls for a Royal Commission into Islam and a ban on Muslim immigration into Australia -- and there's no knowing whether it will hold as Hanson joins the campaign trail on Monday.

3. Malcolm Roberts!

If you thought the High Court decision that kicked Malcolm Roberts out of Federal Parliament would get rid of him for good, think again -- he's campaigning to be the candidate for the state seat of Ipswich.

Ipswich has traditionally been seen as a Labor safe-haven, with the LNP only winning the seat once in the past 34 years. The close-by seat of Lockyer was almost won by Hanson when she ran for it in 2015.

Election analyst Antony Green told the Sydney Morning Herald that it would be ""highly surprising if One Nation won there on first preferences, which would mean they would have to come from behind on LNP preferences"".

In an interview with Daniel Radcliffe about his new movie “Jungle,” we brought up the theory and asked if it could explain why the Dursleys were so mean.

Yeah, that’s easy to say when you don’t live with the Dursleys.

In the “Harry Potter” universe, it’s a little befuddling why the Dursleys hate Harry so much. He seems like a generally genial guy. Sure, he can be a bit moody, but he’s got a piece of the Dark Lord living inside of him. Give the man a break.

Actually, the fact that Harry is somewhat of a Horcrux became the center of a popular theory a couple of years ago, and it seemed to finally explain why the Dursleys were so horrible to the wizard all this time.

According to the theory, the Dursleys were such turd buckets because Harry was a Horcrux and they had to live with him for years. Just like Slytherin’s Locket adversely affected Ron’s mood during “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” Harry may have had a similar effect on the Dursleys. Though Ron and Hermione spent a lot of time with Harry at Hogwarts, the Dursleys were with him constantly over a much longer period of time.

In an interview with Daniel Radcliffe about his new movie “Jungle,” we brought up the theory and asked if it could explain why the Dursleys were so mean.

“Oh OK, so it affects the behavior of people around it,” he said. “That’s interesting, yeah.”

Radcliffe continued, “Yeah, that’s definitely the first time I’ve heard that one. It’s definitely interesting because it sort of posits a world where these people only known to be a certain way. Actually if you remove him from the situation, [they] would have been quite a nice, friendly family.”

OK, maybe “friendly family” is a stretch.

“Having been there for Richard Griffiths’ (Vernon) and Fiona Shaw’s (Petunia) performances,” Radcliffe said, “I feel like it was more they just hated having this kid around.”

“But I think that’s definitely a cool theory,” he added. “Has anyone asked Jo Rowling what she thinks of that one yet? I feel like that one ― that’s definitely a good one.”

Though it’s not in the books, J.K. Rowling has written about the Dursleys’ dislike for Harry on Pottermore, calling them “reactionary, prejudiced, narrow-minded, ignorant and bigoted.” Rowling explained that Petunia’s loathing stemmed from jealousy of her sister Lily’s magical abilities, and that Vernon hated anything out of the ordinary. The couple also had a falling out with Harry’s parents and never made up.

Rowling doesn’t mention whether or not Harry being a Horcrux contributed to the Dursleys’ hatred; however, the theory does make a lot of sense and offers a unique way of looking at the family.

What's behind the wine memes is friendship and connection -- we are signalling to friends and colleagues about a shared experience.
Just like the Jack Daniels beanie signifies a person really, really likes Jack Daniels and wants the world to know it; wine memes and coffee cups with 'wine time' on them help us to craft a certain type of identity.

Wine memes disturb me because they glorify wine.","Looking through Facebook today I stumbled upon four wine memes in a row -- gifs with oversized wine glasses, women sobbing comically into wine -- funny and relatable.

One of them said, ""Here's to friends with the same taste in wine, and different tastes in men"", with The Golden Girls clinking enormous glasses of red wine together. My friends that posted or tagged each other in these videos all work in mental health; they're smart, insightful, high-achieving people who I respect and admire.

So, why is this a thing, and why does it seem to be so prolific among clever people? A couple of years ago, publicly sharing a wine meme would have been unusual for anyone who had some kind of investment in looking responsible. Promotion of an alcoholic beverage was reserved for people who wore Jack Daniels beanies and had stubby coolers with vaguely sexist statements on them.

Memes have been a relatively recent phenomenon and their success seems to depend on how relatable they are (such as, the recent one of a child being horrified when someone starts eating their chips) and how edgy they can be (memes about drinking, embarrassing drunken scenarios and Tinder would be examples of this).

Memes seem to be a way of representing or symbolising something that is either too boring or too controversial to put into words -- somewhere between a poem and an emoticon. The wine memes that seem to be the most popular always involve drinking to excess, and some kind of extreme display of emotion -- the ultimate representation of what it's like to drink a lot.

What's behind the wine memes is friendship and connection -- we are signalling to friends and colleagues about a shared experience.

One thing's clear, the culture has shifted, perhaps in a good way, towards not caring as much about what others think and being able to share vaguely inappropriate content. Just like the Jack Daniels beanie signifies a person really, really likes Jack Daniels and wants the world to know it; wine memes and coffee cups with 'wine time' on them help us to craft a certain type of identity.

What is a woman who likes wine like? Perhaps she is busy, overworked, stressed out. Perhaps she needs some 'me time' and wine is the best way to achieve this. You could almost see the proliferation of wine memes as a new way for people to have a voice. But what exactly are we saying?

""I'm exhausted and having a terrible week, but I don't want to share that because nobody really wants to hear it.""

Or: ""I really love wine because it gives me the opportunity to take some time for myself after I've given everything to my family, friends and work.""

Or: ""I love spending time with my friends and getting really silly after a couple of wines, and I want to remind them of how much fun we had.""

The wine memes themselves aren't really the problem. It is obvious from the women tagging other women -- friends, colleagues, family -- that it's a way to connect, a way to say ""I miss you"" or ""let's hang out"" or ""remember when we had that awesome night"". What's behind the wine memes is friendship and connection -- we are signalling to friends and colleagues about a shared experience.

And if it's about that, why let wine take all the credit? Yes, it was there at the time -- and perhaps lowered your inhibitions enough so that you could have deep and meaningful conversations with friends. But so was music, and probably French onion dip, and likely some kind of couch -- and we don't make couch memes. As we know, wine by itself, in bad company, is just wine. It is the people behind the experiences that are a make or break.

Wine memes disturb me because they glorify wine. Wine is just a bunch of off-grapes that cause our brains to release chemicals which turn wine into something that we worship, think about, talk about. Wine has become the focus, not the friendships behind it. Our drinking culture is shifting away from drinking to excess, but one group that is actually increasing its alcohol consumption is women between the ages of 21 and 35.

I wouldn't dream of saying down with wine memes. In fact, I find comically large wine glasses as funny as the next person. My point is that it might be helpful to look a bit deeper when we are sharing memes or participating in them.

Perhaps it is saying something about modern female identity, that we make jokes about the sweet embrace of alcohol, while biding our time until 5pm when it feels okay to pour that wine.

Now, more than ever, women have a voice and a platform, one which is growing larger every day. It might be a good time to examine our relationship with alcohol, and figure out why, when the rest of the country is moving away from it, we are gravitating towards it, with open arms and excessive displays of emotion (and oversized wine glasses).

Perhaps it is just that we care less about what people think, and want to live our lives on our terms. Or, perhaps we are trying to say something very important, and don't quite yet have the words to say it.",Put A Cork In Your Wine Memes,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/briony-leo/why-we-need-to-put-a-cork-in-the-wine-memes_a_23267532/

The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government over the death of 26 people in a blast at an NTPC plant in Rae Bareli.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar has resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia and left India with a missed opportunity to prove its neighbourly worth.

When Osama bin Laden wasn't planning terrorist attacks, such as 9/11, he was apparently watching YouTube videos like ""Charlie Bit My Finger"", among other pop cultural things, such as Tom & Jerry cartoons.

Main News

The CIA has released over 470,000 files from the raid carried out on the late Osama bin Laden's hideout, excluding classified information sensitive to national security, as also a cache of pornography, pop songs and malware.

All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Scientists have found a previously undiscovered hidden chamber in Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, the first such discovery in the structure since the 19th century.

Off The Front Page

An increase in sales volumes of consumer packaged goods companies has boosted hopes of a recovery in consumption demand, indicating the possible end of the lingering effects of last year's demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax regime in July.

Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for meeting the Chinese Ambassador during the recent border standoff at Doklam, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was a matter of ""great sadness"" that the Congress Vice-President did not ""trust the country or its government"" during that period.

The United States Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed Kenneth Ian Juster as the next ambassador to India, filling a position that has been vacant for months after Richard Verma, an Obama appointee, left in the traditional churn accompanying the administration change.

Opinion

Ever since Hardik Patel came in contact with the Congress, he has been vacillating from one extreme to another. The party has also been trying a balancing act between the Patidars, Dalits and other backward classes. Will this turn of events prove to be the Congress' pain or gain? asks Aurangzeb Nashqbandi in the Hindustan Times.

The Hindu asks three leading experts whether sexual harassers should be named and shamed in public. The answers, unsurprisingly, range from 'Yes', 'No' and 'It's complicated'.

The 19th Party Congress has re-identified the 'principal contradiction' facing society. There will be consequences, warns Jahangir Aziz in The Indian Express.

Dabei sind die Pneus gerade bei winterlicher Witterung der Schlüssel zur sicheren Fahrt. Welcher Wechsel-Typ du bist und wie du dem Winter mit richtigem Profil und Zeitpunkt die kalte Schulter zeigst, klären wir in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Der Übervorsichtige

Die Winterreifen bei Bikini-Wetter abziehen? Niemals! Winter’s coming und das meist ziemlich überraschend. Um auf Nummer sicher zu gehen, lässt du die Reifen das ganze Jahr über am Auto. Die Regel „O bis O“ steht schließlich nicht ohne Grund für „oft und ohne Pause“. Zu viel Sicherheit gibt es nicht, was soll schon schiefgehen?

Es ist natürlich lobenswert, dass du so schön rutschfest von A nach B kommen möchtest. Doch zeig ruhig etwas mehr Mut zur Veränderung. Wenn du nicht gerade Allwetterreifen fährst, dann empfiehlt es sich, den Winterpneus auch mal eine Pause zu gönnen. Aus Expertensicht ist es an der Zeit für Sommerreifen, wenn sich die Temperaturen über sieben Grad halten. Fährst du weit darüber hinaus auf den Pneus für warmes Wetter, nutzen sich die Lamellen schneller ab, verlieren ihren Grip und du verbrauchst mehr Sprit. Liegen die Temperaturen unter sieben Grad, darfst du deine Winterreifen hingegen sehr gerne aus der Sommerpause holen.

Die Nervensäge

Du möchtest dein Umfeld schon lange vor Oktoberbeginn auf die Bedeutung eines guten Winterreifens hinweisen. Warum allerdings jeder mit den Augen rollt, den du mit wissendem Lächeln unterrichtest, ist relativ unklar. Um dennoch mit gutem Beispiel voranzugehen, ziehst du die winterlichen Pneus gerne vor den Augen der Nachbarschaft auf. Dazu lässt du spannende Facts verlauten und rufst zur Not auch ungebetene Belehrungen über den Gartenzaun - denn Sicherheit geht vor.

Wenn sich in deiner Nachbarschaft kein solches Exemplar findet, stehen die Chancen ziemlich gut, dass du es bist. Dein Wissen rund um Winterreifen ist beträchtlich, doch vielleicht wartest du darauf, dass jemand fragt. Bis dahin gibt es mit Sicherheit auch noch einige Reifen-Fakten, die auch du noch nicht kennst. Wusstest du zum Beispiel, dass sich mit einer Euro-Münze die Profiltiefe checken lässt? Verschwindet der Goldrand nicht gut bedeckt im Hauptprofil, ist es Zeit für neue Pneus.

Vielleicht hat es ja Vorboten gegeben, die du übersehen hast. Lebkuchen in den Regalen sind keine guten Anhaltspunkte, denn sie stehen dort schon seit August. Dass aber allmählich die Weihnachtsmärkte öffnen, hätte durchaus ein Hinweis sein können. Doch jetzt hat dich der Winter kalt erwischt. Spätestens mit den ersten Minusgraden stehst du mit hochgezogenen Augenbrauen vor dem Thermometer. Was sollst du jetzt bloß tun und wer hätte das ahnen können?

Gib es zu, so eine leichte Vorahnung hattest du schon vor der ersten Schneeflocke. Wenn dich der Winter dennoch aufs Glatteis geführt hat, heißt es jetzt handeln! Denn ohne Winterreifen bringst du bei Eis und Schnee nicht nur dich, sondern auch Mitfahrer und anderen Verkehrsteilnehmer in Gefahr. Zudem erwartet dich ein Bußgeldkatalog, der mit bis zu 120 Euro Strafe für fehlende Winterreifen sowie einem zusätzlichen Zähler auf deinem Punktekonto droht. Wenn es trotz aller Vorsicht dennoch einmal zum Schadensfall kommt, hilft nur noch eine gute Kfz-Versicherung.

Der Stauverursacher

Als besondere Unterart des Überraschten quittierst du den Wintereinbruch nicht etwa mit einem Reifenwechsel. Du willst schließlich „nur mal eben wirklich ganz kurz“ zum Supermarkt fahren. Für das Aufziehen der Pneus für widrige Witterungen hast du gerade einfach keine Zeit. Da dir Sicherheit dennoch am Herzen liegt, entschließt Du dich, ganz langsam und vorsichtig zu fahren. Denn du weißt, wie es geht (alle Fahrer hinter dir zur Weißglut zu treiben).

Diese Einstellung solltest du dringend auf Eis legen. Wenn dir der Gedanke an Strafen und Punkte nicht einheizt, sollte es die massiv erhöhte Unfallgefahr tun. Vor allem der Bremsweg setzt auf eisiger Straße zur Verlängerung an und vervierfacht sich. Die Fahrt mit sogenannten M+S Reifen, das steht übrigens für „Matsch und Schnee“, ist nicht grundlos Pflicht. Gib dem Kontrollverlust auf winterlichen Straßen keine Chance und bleib bei der O bis O Regel - von Oktober bis Ostern.

Die Rarität

Du bist ein seltenes Fundstück der Straße und kommst beim Thema Bereifung sicher nicht ins Schleudern. Verblüffend ist dein tadelloses Wissen, denn du weißt auch ohne Blick auf Paragraf 36 der Straßenverkehrsordnung, dass die Mindestprofiltiefe bei 1,6 Millimetern liegt. Weil du allerdings auf Sicherheit setzt, hältst du dich an die Expertenempfehlung von mindestens vier Millimeter Hauptprofiltiefe. Wirklich eine Reife(n) Leistung!

Dass Pulverschnee und Pferdestärken nicht zum Sicherheitsrisiko avancieren, ist Fahrern wie dir zu verdanken. Dein Wissen geht über Profile und die situative Winterreifenpflicht hinaus. Allerspätestens, wenn „winterliche Wetterverhältnisse“ wie Glatteis und Schneematsch oder Reifglätte herrschen, bist du auf Winterpneus unterwegs. Ja, als wahrer Profil-Profi weißt sogar, wie deine Reifen am liebsten gelagert werden. Kühl, trocken und dunkel darf es sein, mit Luftdruck auf 0,5 bar über der Herstellervorgabe und übereinanderliegend, in Felgenbaum oder Wandhalterung aufbewahrt.

Sicher und winterfest mit der Allianz

Statt ihrer Reifen wechseln viele Fahrer im Winter gerne das Thema, denn wer weiß schon so genau, wann die Zeit reif ist. Dabei birgt kaum ein anderer Fahr-Faktor so große Risiken, wie eine ungeeignete Bereifung. Wenn es kälter wird, ist es zudem Zeit, über deine Kfz-Versicherung nachzudenken, denn der Stichtag steht am 30. November ins Haus. Mit der Allianz hast du einen Partner an der Seite, mit dem du auf Nummer sicher fährst und sicherst dir zudem 50 Euro Rabatt* auf den ersten Versicherungsbeitrag.

When did it become okay for men to tickle their female colleagues or give them a full-body hug from behind or sandwich them between each other in the workplace? I don't think even wrestlers do so, right?

But hey, it seems a little slap and tickle is more than kosher on the sets of 'The Great Indian Light Molestation', sorry, I meant 'Laughter Challenge'.

Far more disturbing than the alleged sexist slur on The Great Indian Laughter Challenge and the ensuing controversy between Mallika Dua and Akshay Kumar, are the opening credits of the show – as I found out over the last two weekends. For all of you who've missed the show, let me bring you up to speed. The Great Indian Laughter Challenge is a show on Star India which has a celebrity judge in the form of Akshay Kumar, who has done his share of comedy. And had three mentor judges — Zakir Khan, Hussain Dalal and Mallika Dua — who would choose 12 stand-up comics as finalists for the show. The show's anchor is Katrina Kaif-doppelganger and Bigg Boss contestant Eli Avram.

All good till now. It's not a manel, there's female representation, and the judges and mentors are all directly connected to comedy. (The three mentor judges have been removed as of last week, to be replaced by that doyen of comedy, Sajid Khan and the saving grace that is Shreyas Talpade.) The format of the show is that if you want to choose a contestant, you have to ring a bell or ""bell bajao"" – a take on the Hindi aesthetic phrase, ""bell bajaana"". Or to take the mickey out of someone.

The week of the three mentors being summarily removed from the show, there was a brouhaha because journalist Vinod Dua wrote a Facebook post about the sexist remarks made by the ""cretin"" Akshay Kumar about his daughter Mallika when she was ringing the bell for a contestant. Kumar said, ""Tum uska bell bejao, mein tumhara bell bajaata hu"" (literally translating to - you ring his bell and I'll ring yours). Mallika posted about it, got trolled by Akshay fans, and deleted the post soon after.

This was followed by a video being released of a comic who imitated Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi to wide applause (and was the same person Dua was ringing the bell for). This comic's act was deleted from the show and he was asked to perform a new act. Everyone cried censorship, blue murder, we love comedy - the usual noises were made and forgotten.

Which is what made me tune into this show to see what the kerfuffle was all about.

And I must admit none of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

The opening credits of the episodes with Dua, Dalal and Khan had Akshay Kumar repeatedly tickle Mallika Dua. Because that's what grown men are supposed to do to grown women on a show about comedy. Tickle them. Not tickle the male mentors, though. That would be too 'gay', right? If there was something to be offended by, one would think it would be this. But these are concessions one must make for getting a toehold in mainstream entertainment, I suppose.

None of these controversies match up to what were the opening credits of the show, or how the female mentors and anchors (I'm sure with their permission) are physically treated in the programme.

Now this treatment wasn't reserved for Mallika Dua. In the episode in which Sajid Khan and Shreyas Talpade came on as judges, there was no one to tickle in the credits. But the producers, director and I'm assuming Kumar thought outside the box and came up with a routine which left me goggle-eyed. Eli Avram, the anchor, came on the stage only to have Sajid Khan hold a red heart-shaped balloon against her chest, while Talpade held it against her back. They then sandwiched her between them, with Khan facing her and jumping to and fro while holding the said balloon to her bosom. Through it all, Akshay Kumar laughed uproariously. Avram also giggled. And finally, Kumar hugged Avram from the back.

This is a workplace which seems tailor-made for Harvey Weinstein, Dustin Hoffman, Shakti Kapoor, and Brett Ratner.

We all know that jokes about Mr Modi may not pass muster on most channels. But that really is the least of our concerns right now. Going by 'The List' being released, and the unending stories of powerful men who have gotten away with sexually harassing women at the workplace, there are far greater worries than not being able to crack a joke about Modi. The rampant sexism and manhandling of women, which seems to pass off as normal in Hindi films and TV shows, is actually what we should be concerned about while discussing The Great Laughter Challenge. What's worse is that the women seem to be loving the inappropriate touching and attention, much like in horrendous films like Grand Masti and Judwaa 2 and so on. This is the sexual and sexist tripe that male audiences watch and then emulate. The one thing you can be sure of, there was nothing to laugh at by the end of it. A pity, since the comedy acts were quite good. But when you have a lewd and sexist sideshow headlined by a superstar, it's hard to pay attention to the main act.

If you'd like a lesson in how not to behave with female colleagues, do watch The Great Indian Laughter Challenge on Saturday and Sunday at 8pm on Star India.

ÉDUCATION - Tous les devoirs faits au collège plutôt qu'à la maison pour les élèves qui le souhaitent: cette promesse, censée contribuer à réduire les inégalités entre familles, est entrée en vigueur ce lundi 6 novembre et sera étendue l'an prochain au primaire.

""Avec la mesure 'devoirs faits', nous offrons un soutien scolaire gratuit à tous les collégiens pour lutter contre les inégalités"", a déclaré le ministre de l'Education Jean-Michel Blanquer dans un entretien au quotidien 20 Minutes.

Certains élèves ne peuvent en effet pas se faire aider à la maison pour effectuer leurs devoirs, d'autres ne disposent pas d'un cadre serein pour les faire. ""Il s'agit d'aider les élèves qui ne bénéficient pas des circonstances familiales leur permettant de bien travailler à la maison"", a expliqué Jean-Michel Blanquer.

""La mesure est intéressante car on sait très bien que la question des devoirs est un facteur d'inégalités sociales"", estime Catherine Nave-Bekhti, secrétaire générale du Sgen-CFDT. ""Mais sa mise en oeuvre est un peu précipitée, elle intervient alors que les emplois du temps sont déjà calés, et il va falloir s'assurer que ce sont bien les élèves qui en ont le plus besoin qui en bénéficient"", souligne-t-elle.

Il s'agit d'un nouveau chantier pour le collège, après l'assouplissement de la réforme du collège (avec le retour des classes bilangues) et une modification probable du brevet pour la session 2018.

Quatre heures d'accompagnement par semaine

Cette mesure, qui rejoint une promesse de campagne d'Emmanuel Macron de rétablir des études dirigées au collège, sera appliquée dans les 7.100 établissements français, avant d'être étendue au primaire à la rentrée prochaine.

Elle devrait dans un premier temps concerner environ le quart des collégiens mais ""cela pourrait monter à 35% des élèves lorsque le dispositif sera mieux connu"", estime le ministre de l'Education.

Concrètement, une heure par jour d'accompagnement -soit quatre heures par semaine- sera proposée aux élèves. Selon les premiers retours, 35% des collèges mettront en œuvre la mesure en fin de journée et 65% lors de la pause de midi ou des heures de permanence.

Il y aura a minima un accompagnant pour 15 élèves.

Professeurs volontaires payés en heures sup et assistants d'éducation seront mobilisés. Le monde associatif, déjà très présent dans le domaine de l'aide aux devoirs, devrait aussi être impliqué.

S'y ajoutent 7.000 jeunes en service civique. ""Mais notre objectif est d'atteindre 10.000"", indique le ministre.

""S'agit-il d'études surveillées, d'une simple mise à disposition aux élèves d'un lieu pour faire leurs devoirs ou bien d'une véritable aide méthodologique?"", s'interroge Frédérique Rolet, secrétaire générale du Snes-FSU, pour qui les objectifs de cette mesure doivent encore être précisés.

En fonction des buts recherchés, une qualification des personnels assurant sa mise en œuvre pourrait s'avérer nécessaire.

Un coût de 220 millions d'euros en 2018

Une analyse partagée par Hervé-Jean Le Niger, vice-président de la FCPE (fédération de parents d'élèves): ""Il faut un accompagnement pédagogique de qualité"", a-t-il dit sur RTL, insistant sur le nécessaire ""lien"" entre ""l'équipe qui fait travailler les élèves et leurs professeurs habituels"". ""Sinon cela n'a aucun sens"".

""Il va falloir une vraie coordination au sein des collèges, avec quelqu'un capable d'animer l'équipe de volontaires"", prévient aussi Claire Krepper, secrétaire nationale du Se-Unsa.

Elle rappelle que la mesure n'est ""pas nouvelle"": ""Il y a déjà eu moult dispositifs, comme l'accompagnement éducatif"", mis en place en 2008 dans les écoles des quartiers défavorisés puis étendu aux collèges, qui proposait aux élèves des activités pédagogiques et éducatives après la classe.

""Là on a un recentrage sur le scolaire"", relève Claire Krepper. ""Si cela peut déboucher sur une réflexion, en équipe, sur la meilleure manière de faire travailler les élèves en dehors des heures de classe, c'est intéressant"", juge-t-elle. Mais ""encore faut-il que la mesure soit correctement financée"".

Selon Jean-Michel Blanquer, ""220 millions d'euros seront destinés à financer ce dispositif pour les collégiens en 2018"".

Derzeit finden sich einige Schlagzeilen und dazu gehörige Artikel, in denen erklärt wird, warum die dreijährige Tochter von Mila Kunis jeden Freitag einen Schluck Wein trinken darf. Alkohol im Kindesalter? Ob das wirklich zur Religion gehört, wenn Kleinkindern schon der Geschmack von Alkohol nahe gebracht wird und ob es sinnvoll ist, derartigen kulturell aufgebauten gesellschaftlichen Geisteserkrankungen anzuhängen, bleibt hier einmal außen vor. Eindeutig belegbar ist hingegen, dass jemand, der glaubt, keine Ahnung hat, da er es immerhin nicht weiß.

Soviel zu Mila Kunis und ihrer dreijährigen Tochter, nun zum Thema: Alkohol im Kindesalter! Gelegentlich führt mein Weg durch das LWL-Museum für Naturkunde in Münster, in dem seit vermutlich Jahrzehnten eine Dauervorstellung zu den Indianern Nordamerikas genau dieses Thema aufgreift. Die Indianer wurden immer weiter zurück gedrängt, das Ziel war anscheinend ihre Ausrottung sowie sie erst ab 1924 durch ihre Geburt innerhalb der USA automatisch auch Staatsbürger der USA sind. Sie gelten aber gewiss noch heute nicht als vollwertige Bürger und mit Pech werden sie mal eben per Zwang von dem einen in das andere Reservat umgesiedelt.

100 Millionen Indianer sind durch die Entdeckung der neuen Welt durch den „Weißen Mann"" ums Leben gekommen, viele systematisch. Noch heute leben Indianer in Nordamerika meist in abgelegenen Reservaten wie in einem Drittweltland mit einer Arbeitslosigkeit von oft über 60%. Bereits in den Entdeckerjahren war es üblich, den Indianern Alkohol zu geben. Der Weiße Mann hatte wohl auch die Hoffnung, dass sich mit jeder Party einige Indianer totgesoffen haben. Alkohol hat ab diesen Entdeckerjahren eine feste Tradition im Indianerleben, Alkohol im Kindesalter gehört dazu.

Harold Red Eagle säuft seit seinem achten Lebensjahr

Alkohol im Kindesalter ist unter Indianern in US Reservaten anscheinend ein alltägliches Phänomen, sowie rund 75% der Indianerfamilien wenigstens einen Alkoholiker zählen. So die Zeitung „Montana's Indians"" aus dem Jahr 1996, die Harold Red Eagle einen Artikel widmete. Damals war er 37 Jahre alt, soff damit schon seit 29 Jahren und hält sich an einem Pfahl fest. Sein eigener Vater war es, der ihm den Alkohol gab. Was genau die Absichten eines solchen Vaters waren, geht aus dem Artikel nicht hervor.

Harold Red Eagles Tochter begann das Trinken erst mit 13 Jahren. Mit 18 muss sie für drei Jahre ins Gefängnis, immerhin hat sie ihren 14 jährigen Bruder getötet. Sie erstach ihn mit einem Messer, als sie betrunken war. Im Reservat gehen 79 Prozent aller Straftaten auf Alkohol zurück.

„It was her family's way of life.""

„All she saw us do was drink alcohol.""

Alkohol im Kindesalter vermutlich eine ganz schlechte Idee

Wenn die Eltern der Kinder Raucher sind und diese den Rauch bereits kennen, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass sie mit dem Rauchen anfangen. Beim gesellschaftlich etablierten Alkohol ist es ähnlich. Wenn die Kinder sich bereits im Kleinkindalter an den Geschmack alkoholischer Getränke gewöhnen, ist das mehr als fraglich. Es ist wie beim Zucker, dass es nicht 100 Gramm sein müssen. Ein Stück Würfelzucker macht bereits den „Pin"" im Hinterkopf und die leuchtenden Augen, wenn es wieder einmal ein Stück Zucker oder auch mehr gibt. Dieser „Pin"" wird durch die Häufigkeit oder durch größere Mengen natürlich immer stärker.

Es kommt aber auch auf die Menschen an, ob sie für etwas empfänglich sind. Wer es bereits in den Genen oder im Wesen hat, ein Alkoholproblem hervor zu bilden und auch noch Alkohol im Kindesalter vorkommt, dann ist es nur um so wahrscheinlicher, dass genau dieses Problem früher, stärker und damit problematischer hervorgebildet wird.

Weiterhin sind die Organe oder die Psyche von Kindern erheblich empfindlicher. Wesentlich kleinere Mengen Alkohol, Drogen, Umweltgifte oder sonstige Gifte können einen maßgeblich größeren Schaden als beim Erwachsenen anrichten. Nicht Grundlos sind es die Kinder, nicht die Erwachsenen, die rund um Atomkraftwerken reihenweise an Leukämie erkranken.

Wenn dann zu lesen ist, dass Kinder alkoholfreies Bier trinken, ist dieser „Pin"" natürlich nicht vorhanden, auch in Sauerkraut oder anderen Speisen sind bis 0,5 % Alkohol enthalten. Dennoch bringt man den Kindern schon den Geschmack und das Ritual nahe. Auch wenn es eine den Indianern mitgebrachte Kultur des weißen Mannes ist, so wäre es schön, wenn sie wenigstens den Jugendschutz beachten oder den Alkoholismus weitgehend durchbrechen täten. Wer sich jedoch bereits selber als Schweralkoholiker klassifizieren muss und Kinder groß ziehen soll, der bringt damit ganz automatisch einige Defizite mit. Erlebte man selber Alkohol im Kindesalter und lebt folglich im Dauersuff, dann ist es gewiss schwerer, die eigenen Kinder vom Saufen abzuhalten als bei jemandem, der im Leben eine Perspektive mit Job und Einkommen hat. Wer die Armut in der Welt bekämpft, der bekämpft auch ihre Probleme.

The research highlights that many people still see physical illness as a more legitimate reason to take time off work, meaning they are often reluctant to speak to their employer about mental health. Three quarters (74%) of workers said they are more likely to take a day off work for a physical illness such as a cold or back ache than if they were suffering from stress, anxiety or depression. Almost half of workers (45%) diagnosed with the conditions admitted they would feel uncomfortable telling their employer about it, according to the survey, and a further three in five (59%) said they would not want any evidence of them having experienced stress, anxiety or depression on their work record. The panel of GPs revealed that once they’d diagnosed patients with either stress, anxiety or depression, one in six people asked for their diagnosis to be concealed on a work sick note. This is perhaps unsurprising as research by the charity Business in the Community (BITC) suggests that more than one million UK employees could face demotion, disciplinary or dismissal after sharing mental health issues with employers.","Symptoms Of Depression, Anxiety And Stress Rising In UK, But Many Delay Seeking Help",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/one-in-six-have-asked-doctors-to-hide-mental-health-problems-on-sick-notes-report-finds_uk_5a0089bde4b0c96530012f0a?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

There are fears Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year sentence, could have her time in jail extended as a direct result of the foreign secretary’s comment.

She was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing last weekend at which Johnson’s remarks were cited as proof that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime”.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s family maintain she was simply on holiday in Iran to show her infant daughter Gabriella to her grandparents.

But Fox told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme that any blame should rest with Iran not with Johnson.

“We all make slips of the tongue and we have got to be very careful that we are not over reacting to this,” the international trade secretary said.

He added to Sky News: “I think what we are seeing here is an attempt to discredit the foreign secretary without thinking first of all what the impact may be and what excuses it may give to the Iranian regime to act improperly.”

Labour MP Tulip Siddiq told HuffPost UK she was “shocked and dismayed” by Fox’s comments.

Johnson called Iran’s foreign minister on Tuesday morning.

He is also facing demands to publically correct what he said in an effort to prevent her sentence being lengthened by an extra five years.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told the BBC this morning he wanted Johnson to retract what he said in parliament “and say clearly that Nazanin wasn’t training journalists and that she was just there on holiday”.

“I have promised Nazanin that it’s still possible that they will be home for Christmas. I’m still battling on those terms,” he said.

Johnson told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee last week:

“When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. “(Neither) Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible.”

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, which employs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, has urged Johnson to correct his “serious mistake”.

Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Johnson should quit if his actions have damaged Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s prospects of freedom.

Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn where Zaghari-Ratcliffe lives, said: “I am in equal measure shocked and dismayed by Liam Fox’s comments this morning.

“To say that we shouldn’t ‘over-react’ to Boris’s grave error simply shows him as another government minister who is ignorant to the details of this young mother’s tragic case.”

Conservative MP Anna Soubry said Johnson’s actions were “appalling”.

She said on Twitter: “In ‘normal’ times Boris Johnson would have been sacked long ago.”

Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said Johnson “must be sacked”.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: “Last week’s remarks by the Foreign Secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.”

Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK, expressed disappointment that Fox had chosen to defend Johnson rather than “provide vital clarification over the fact that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a charity worker who was on a family trip in Iran when she was arrested last year”.

“Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already been subjected to solitary confinement, a grossly unfair trial and now reportedly faces the threat of a new criminal charge,” she told HuffPost UK.

“The Foreign Secretary’s call last week for Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be released was welcome, but he must clarify his remarks about her work and the purpose of her visit to Iran.

“Now is the time for a straightforward, public clarification from the UK Government about Zaghari-Ratcliffe being the victim of a glaring miscarriage of justice who should be released immediately and allowed to return back to Britain with her daughter Gabriella.”

Redress, a human rights organisation who has worked with Nazanin’s family to secure her release, told HuffPost UK that Johnson needs to “focus on the serious repercussions of his words”.

“As a British citizen in a deplorable situation Nazanin has every right to expect that her Foreign Secretary will be able to advance her case,” Redress director Carla Ferstman said.

“Instead, she has had to go through the trauma of being hauled in front of a judge again and may well face an extension of her time in prison. To blow this off as a simple mistake belies the importance of his position and the seriousness of Nazanin’s plight. Boris Johnson must make it clear publicly and as soon as possible that she is an innocent mother who was simply on holiday and must be brought home immediately.”",Liam Fox Warns Against 'Overreaction' To Boris Johnson's Claim About Briton Jailed In Iran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liam-fox-warns-against-overreaction-to-boris-johnsons-claim-about-briton-jailed-in-iran_uk_5a0172b5e4b066c2c039e2d8?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

“Game of Thrones” fans may shed a tear when HBO’s fantasy epic draws to a close following its eighth and final season, but the British actress says she’s eager for the show to end so that she can pursue other projects.

It’s “incredibly exciting” and “will be nice to pick roles that I want to do,” the 20-year-old told BBC Newsbeat in a piece published online Thursday.

“I can show the world what sort of actress I want to be and shape my career a little bit,” she added.

Williams has appeared as the sword-wielding, list-keeping Arya Stark since she was just 14. The actress acknowledged that the prospect of not having the show as a safety net was “nerve wracking.”

But “on the other hand,” Williams said she’ll be “free” and able to develop independent movies via her newly-launched production company.

Le rappeur le plus écouté de l'année 2016, qui a accepté de comparaître dans le cadre d'une procédure de plaider-coupable, a reconnu sa culpabilité. Le tribunal a ensuite homologué, en audience publique, la peine de 5000 euros d'amende et six mois de suspension du permis de conduire.

L'artiste de 27 ans, Julien Marie de son vrai nom, ""versera sans difficulté"" le montant de l'amende, a souligné son avocat Damien Benedetti, en tendant au président l'avis d'imposition de Jul, ce ""contribuable fort généreux avec la ville de Marseille"", a-t-il souligné. Quant à la peine de suspension du permis de conduire, ""elle ne posera pas de difficulté"", son label ayant mis un chauffeur à sa disposition.

8 points de permis en moins

Barbe de plusieurs jours, en noir des baskets à la doudoune, Jul a assuré au tribunal qu'il ne récidiverait pas après ce délit routier. Son casier judiciaire portait jusqu'ici trace d'une condamnation à 4 mois de prison avec sursis en 2011 pour un vol aggravé.

Outre la sanction pénale, sa virée sur l'autoroute A50 a déjà valu à Jul la perte de 8 points de permis sur 12, le mettant à la merci d'une annulation s'il grille un feu rouge, par exemple, l'a sermonné le président.

Fin octobre, la ""mauvaise journée"" de Jul, titre d'une chanson de son nouvel album dévoilée juste après les faits, s'était achevée par son interpellation alors qu'il roulait à ""plus de 160 kilomètres heure"", faisant des appels de phare aux voitures roulant devant lui, parmi lesquelles une voiture de policiers de la Bac, qui l'ont intercepté.

Un mot d'excuse sur Facebook

Après sa sortie de garde à vue, il s'était dit ""désolé"" sur Facebook, dans un texte truffé de fautes d'orthographe.

Son passager avait été interpellé avec une arme de poing de 9 mm de calibre, et une petite quantité de résine de cannabis.

L'obiettivo è rilanciare - come spiega poco sopra un uomo a lui molto vicino - e farlo in particolar modo prendendo di petto il Movimento 5 stelle.

E il capogruppo Luigi Zanda nel suo incessante lavorio tra Transatlantico e corridoi, ha già sollevato obiezioni sulla costituzionalità di una legge che va a toccare diritti acquisiti. Gli occhi sono puntati al Nazareno, fra poco più di una settimana, dove si preannuncia un clima che Renzi ha tutte le intenzioni di riscaldare per rispondere allo schiaffo siciliano.

If not enough calcium is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, calcium will be taken from the bones.
""Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, calcium-fortified foods such as soy products, and to a lesser degree some leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds and fish,"" Spendlove said.
One cup of calcium-fortified breakfast cereal (40g) contains up to 200mg of calcium -- ½ cup of calcium-fortified orange juice (100ml) contains up to 80mg of calcium; two slices of bread (30g) provides 200mg of calcium.
""It is much better to get calcium from foods (which also provide other nutrients) than from calcium supplements,"" Spendlove said.","When we think of calcium, what springs to mind are teeth, bones and cows milk. While calcium is certainly related to these things, the mineral is required for many more processes in our bodies and is found in an array of healthy foods.

To find out everything about calcium, including why we need it and where we can find it, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

What is calcium and why do we need it?

""Calcium is a mineral and facilitates a number of functions in the body, including bone and tooth formation, muscle contraction and nerve transmission,"" nutritionist Zoe Bingley-Pullin told HuffPost Australia. ""It also regulates heart rhythm and plays a role in electrolyte balance.""

Calcium plays a role in:

strengthening bones and teeth

regulating muscle functioning (such as contraction and relaxation)

regulating heart functioning and blood clotting

regulating the transmission of nervous system messages and enzyme functions.

Interestingly, calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body and is stored in our teeth and bones.

How much calcium do we need per day?

""The amount of calcium we require does change as we age,"" accredited practising dietitian and performance dietitian Jessica Spendlove told HuffPost Australia.

""Calcium requirements are at their highest for men and women during adolescence when we are developing peak bone mass, and then also later in life when bone mass is naturally declining.

""For women, this is at the onset of menopause (typically in their 50s) and for men this is once they hit their 70s.""

What happens when we're calcium deficient?

""Calcium deficiency may cause or be associated with a number of health conditions such as heart palpitations, tooth decay, poor bone mineral density and osteoporosis, muscular cramps, depression and stunted growth,"" Bingley-Pullin said.

Osteoporosis is quite common in western cultures and often results in bone fractures, Spendlove explained.

""When the body notices there is not enough calcium circulating in the blood, it will use hormones to reduce the amount excreted out by the kidneys in the urine. If not enough calcium is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, calcium will be taken from the bones.

""If your dietary intake of calcium is constantly low, your body will eventually remove so much calcium from the skeleton that your bones will become weak and brittle.""

Osteoporosis is one of the major causes of morbidity amongst older Australians and New Zealanders, particularly postmenopausal women.

""Calcium intake throughout life is a major factor affecting the incidence of osteoporosis -- however, other factors, notably adequate vitamin D status and exercise, also play a role,"" Spendlove said.

What foods are high in calcium?

Calcium is found in many foods, including animal and plant-based products.

""Good sources of calcium include dairy foods like milk, yoghurt and cheese, calcium-fortified foods such as soy products, and to a lesser degree some leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds and fish,"" Spendlove said.

Good dietary sources of calcium and recommended doses:

Dairy products including milk, yoghurt, cheese and buttermilk -- 300mg equates to roughly 250ml of milk, 200g tub of yoghurt, 250ml of calcium-fortified soy or plant milk, or 40g of cheddar cheese

-- 300mg equates to roughly 250ml of milk, 200g tub of yoghurt, 250ml of calcium-fortified soy or plant milk, or 40g of cheddar cheese Leafy green vegetables including broccoli, collards (cabbage family), bok choy, Chinese cabbage and spinach -- 100mg equates to roughly one cup of cooked spinach, although not all of this may be absorbed (due to the high concentration of oxalate, a compound in spinach that reduces calcium absorption); 45mg equates to roughly one cup of cooked broccoli, but the absorption from broccoli is much higher at around 50–60 per cent.

Kale, broccoli and cabbage can provide good doses of calcium.

Other notable sources of calcium include:

Soy and tofu

Fish -- sardines and salmon (with bones); half a cup of canned salmon contains 402mg of calcium

Nuts and seeds -- brazil nuts, almonds and sesame seed paste (tahini). Fifteen almonds contain about 40mg of calcium.

Calcium-fortified foods -- including breakfast cereals, fruit juices and bread. One cup of calcium-fortified breakfast cereal (40g) contains up to 200mg of calcium -- ½ cup of calcium-fortified orange juice (100ml) contains up to 80mg of calcium; two slices of bread (30g) provides 200mg of calcium.

Are calcium supplements beneficial?

Before considering a calcium supplement, it's important to check in with a GP to assess your calcium and vitamin D levels by way of bone mineral density scans, blood tests, food diary and/or symptoms.

""It's important to assess vitamin D status as well because vitamin D helps to regulate the absorption of calcium,"" Bingley-Pullin said.

""It is much better to get calcium from foods (which also provide other nutrients) than from calcium supplements,"" Spendlove said.

""If you have difficulty eating enough foods rich in calcium, you might need to consider a calcium supplement, especially if you are at risk of developing osteoporosis. It's a good idea to discuss this with your doctor or other registered healthcare professional.

""If you do take calcium supplements, make sure you don't take more than the amount recommended on the bottle. Too much calcium may cause gastrointestinal upsets, such as bloating and constipation.""",These Are The Best Sources Of Calcium,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/these-are-the-best-sources-of-calcium_a_23267568/

In his own way, Harry's character reminds us of that ancient and very important distinction between opinion and knowledge. Opinion requires little to no evidence to utter — faith even less so. Knowledge claims, at the other end of the truth-meter, have robust reasons and solid evidence to back them up.

Without this basic and fundamental understanding of how to sort through declarations, our world is now overrun by opinions masquerading as facts. As a result, poorly supported assertions of faith and opinion end up forging public policy — all which have a direct effect on our individual and collective well-being.

Need examples?

Poorly supported assertions of faith and opinion end up forging public policy.

Look no farther than the U.S. It's the culmination of the Trump Effect. ""Fake news."" Denying bold-faced facts. Brushing aside serious science in place of one's own uneducated version of reality.

But don't forget that sloppy thinking doesn't stop at borders. The same anti-intellectualism is rife in our own mainstream Canadian politics and media venues.

Consider the reaction to recent remarks from the newly appointed governor general, Julie Payette, at no less a venue than the Canadian Science Policy Convention in Ottawa. It illustrates to what extent critical distinctions and tough-minded demands for reason have been lost on so many of us, and society in general.

Speaking to the audience, Ms. Payette did a riff on the most popular of opinions warmly held close by too many, including those in our echelons of political power:

""Can you believe that still today in learned society, in houses of government, unfortunately, we're still debating and still questioning whether humans have a role in the Earth warming up or whether even the Earth is warming up, period?""

She continued:

""And we are still debating and still questioning whether life was a divine intervention or whether it was coming out of a natural process let alone — oh my goodness, a random process.""

Could there be more examples? Unfortunately, yes. How about adding pseudo-medicine and astrology to the list?

Andrew Scheer, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.

Now, if you do a simple search of this event, and read the outrage by those like Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Rex Murphy, you see what happens once you abandon the world of evidence and reason.

Here are the most favoured of responses:

The go-to of modern culture — shut down things we don't like to hear. Be outraged. Have a hissy fit. Try to whip up drama like 12-year-olds on a school playground. Just make sure you avoid the question: Is it true? If that doesn't quite do it, double down on the outrage because it — your sensitivities about ""The Unquestionable"" — is being questioned. (Typically being some claim of religion or any of its New Age variants.) Start the comeback by returning to 1): ""How dare you ..."" In step 3), keep to 2), backed by 1), then misquote and overly embellish what was originally asserted. It's the old, tried but true ""straw man"" approach. That is, misrepresent what's being claimed, as it's then so much more easily shown to be outrageous.

What is perhaps most remarkable about the various tantrums over Ms. Payette's speech is how detractors, like Scheer and Murphy, think it's Payette who is offering mere opinion about these topics. As Murphy wonders, how could she ""seek to place herself as an umpire or judge on questions of faith?""

Therein lies one of the exact, terrible confusions at stake: Payette wasn't saying this list was the result of her own research. Whether it's the reality of anthropogenic climate change; the task of explaining the origin of life; how disease shouldn't be treated; how astrology doesn't work: this isn't a matter of her personal inquiry into the issues.

It's what scientific research does. The collaborative results, indeed, aren't a matter of any scientist's opinion. It's based on a majority of peer-reviewed research and, as such, gets us as close to the ideals of truth, fact and knowledge as we can get in this earthly world.

Don't forget how far those like Murphy and Scheer have gone in their defence of the indefensible. It's not about saying, ""Well, sure, their views aren't based on facts, but they have a right to their opinion."" It's gone one step further down the epistemic sinkhole: We are not even allowed to talk about the differences between facts and opinionated nonsense — even at a conference on science and policy.

So, to answer CBC's Robyn Urback, where she asks: ""In what universe is it appropriate for a governor general to deride people for their beliefs?"" It's simple, Robyn: In a universe where there's still a difference between opinions and facts.

Not only does the film, 'Jeremy the Dud', flip prejudices on their heads but also features only one main cast member without a real-life disability. Nick Boshier, better known as one half of the Bondi Hipsters, plays Jeremy a man born ""without specialty"" which is more casually referred to as ""a dud"".

Forced to wear a large label displaying his lacking specialty, on his birthday Jeremy is old enough to move out of assisted living and in with his Aunt and her two kids. While Jeremy just wants to get a job and maybe find a place of his own, he even tells his Aunt he doesn't want to be a burden, but everyone around him still seems to see him as just that.

'Jeremy the Dud' was created by Robot Army Productions in partnership with genU, a not-for-profit organisation that helps people with disability to set new limits on their lives, to see aging and disability as challenges, rather than disadvantages.

Out of the film's cast, 22 with disability are all genU participants, with only two actors appearing without a disability, Boshier and Jackson O'Doherty who plays another dud. According to the film's release, the production would have to start and stop to make sure only disabled people were in frame.

While 'Jeremy the Dud' takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to subverting the typical stigma and judgement that people with disability may face on a daily basis, at its core has a beautifully heartfelt message.

Jenny Lewis fotografiert Mütter mit ihren ein Tage alten Babies

Sie ist selbst Mutter und will anderen zeigen, dass sie keine Angst vor der Geburt haben müssen

Die Bilder zeigen allesamt starke, glückliche Mütter, denen die unbändige Liebe für ihr Kind deutlich anzusehen ist

Der Geburt eines Babys ist einer der prägendsten Momente im Leben einer Frau. Viele werdende Mütter begleitet in den Wochen davor neben all der Vorfreude auch ein ängstliches Gefühl.

Die Fotografin Jenny Lewis will ihren Teil dazu beitragen, dass die schönen Gefühle überwiegen. Mit einem Fotoprojekt One Day Young will sie schwangeren Frauen zeigen, dass eine Geburt nichts ist, vor dem man Angst haben muss.

Die Bilderstrecke zeigt verschiedene Mütter mit ihren Neugeborenen. Die Fotos sind alle am Tag nach der Geburt aufgenommen.

“Als ich Mutter wurde, hatte ich das Gefühl, dass ich anderen schwangeren Frauen sagen muss 'Alles wird gut!'"", sagte Lewis der HuffPost UK. Sie selbst ist Mutter von zwei Kindern. Ruby ist acht Jahre alt und Herb sechs.

Das Buch über eine Hebamme änderte alles

""Oft hört man von all den furchtbaren Dinge, die bei der Geburt schief gehen können. Bevor ich mein erstes Kind bekam, habe ich nicht eine positive Sache gehört"", beschreibt die Mutter ihre damalige Situation.

""Ich dachte, alles dreht sich nur um Periduralanästhesien und Krankenhäuser. Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich es genießen könnte, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

Helen und Hudson

Das änderte sich, als eine Freundin ihr ein Buch über die Hebamme Ina May Gaskin zeigte. ""Das Buch beinhaltet Kurzgeschichten über die Frauen, die sie betreut hat"", sagte Lewis.

“Diesen Frauen ging es gut. Sie haben die Wehen überstanden und ihre Ängste überwunden. Plötzlich habe ich gemerkt, wie sich meine Gedanken änderten und was es wirklich bedeutete, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 30 Fotos zeigen, dass Hebammen die Welt zu einem besseren Ort machen

""Nur wenige sagen 'Weißt du was? Ich habe die Geburt tatsächlich genossen. Es hat mir Selbstbewusstsein gegeben. Das war das schönste Gefühl, das ich jemals hatte'"", sagte Lewis. Dabei gebe es viele Frauen, die genau diese Empfindung hätten - sie zum Beispiel.

Jenny und Suki

""Das soll keineswegs die Erfahrungen von Frauen klein machen, die eine schwere Geburt hatten. Aber es muss Stimmen von beiden Seiten geben"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Ich wollte Teil von der anderen Seite sein - ein Teil einer Geschichte, über die andere vielleicht auch stolpern, so wie es mir mit Ina May passiert ist. Eine Geschichte, die die Balance zwischen den Seiten herstellt und Frauen vielleicht auch ein bisschen die Angst nimmt.""

""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte""

Mit ihren Fotos habe sie den den Moment nach der Geburt festhalten wollen - und zeigen, dass die Frauen danach immer noch sie selbst sind. ""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte.""

""One Day Young"" war geboren.

Alle Frauen, die auf den Bildern zu sehen sind, haben sich auf Lewis' Facebook-Aufruf gemeldet.

Einige kontaktierten die Fotografin auch, nachdem sie ihre Flyer in kleinen Läden und an Laternen gesehen hatten.

“Schon nach den ersten paar Shootings war mir klar: Das ist etwas wirklich Besonders”, sagte Lewis. ""Die Atmosphäre war so wundervoll.""

In den ersten 24 Stunden nach der Geburt beobachte sie eine ganz besondere Energie zwischen Mutter und Kind. Die Frauen hätten alle ganz leuchtende Augen gehabt. ""Ich wollte diesen Moment einfangen - bevor die täglichen Sorgen zurück zu ihnen finden. Es ist eine große Ehre, als Fotografin die Möglichkeit haben zu dürfen, das festzuhalten.""

“In diesen ersten 24 Stunden kommt die innere Kriegerin der Frauen zum Vorschein. Sie bekommen diese Kraft, um ihr Kind zu beschützen und das sieht man auch auf den Bildern"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Sie sind wie diese heldenhaften Bilder von Soldaten auf dem Schlachtfeld oder ein Fußballspieler nach dem gewonnenen Spiel, noch voller Adrenalin. Dieser Moment wird selten festgehalten. Aber das, was sie erreicht haben, ist mindestens genau so wichtig wie das Tor oder der gewonnen Kampf - und dieser Moment verdient es, in einer Arena aufgenommen und gefeiert zu werden.""



Xanthe und Louie

Für sie ist jede Frau auf jedem Bild einzigartig - und doch verbindet sie etwas. ""Jeder hat seine Probleme, aber in diesem Moment werden sie unwichtig und jede ist gleich - auf einer Augenhöhe. Es ist egal, ob ich die Frauen in einer Villa oder in einem Hostel fotografiere. Der Blick in den Augen der Frauen ist immer der gleiche: Sie sind stolz auf sich selbst.""

When Indian designer Kresha Bajaj took on the mammoth task of stitching her love story on to her bridal lehenga, she didn’t realise that she was setting in motion the next big Indian wedding trend for the year.

The designer who was married to Vanraj Zaveri, scion of family that runs the jewellery chain Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri & Sons, in an intimate ceremony claimed she had driven herself and everyone around her crazy in trying to find the perfect lehenga. “What was I going to do with a lehenga that would just sit in my closet, never to be worn again?” she told HuffPost India, admitting that she has never been a fan of heavy traditional attire.

Bajaj was inspired by the 'Real Housewives' television show star Adrienne Maloof who had framed her wedding dress as an art piece in her walk-in closet. “I thought it was a cool idea. Vanraj loves art, and I don’t because I get bored of looking at the same thing on my wall,” she says. “But I didn’t want to get sick of looking at my wedding outfit. The nicest thing we’d never get bored of looking at was our love story. And that’s what I decided to put into my lehenga.”

Bajaj says that the process was not easy. “Initially it was a bit worrying because we didn’t want it to come out comical,” she says. Her beau chose white and gold as the theme for their wedding trousseau, and Bajaj would spend hours with the karigars who were embroidering special milestones from the couple’s life together on to the cloth.

“The image of two people clinking their glasses is inspired by Vanraj’s first Instagram post after proposing to me in the Maldives,” reveals Bajaj. “We had just popped a bottle of champagne, and he clicked a picture of me with the glass of champagne and the ring.”

The original image that inspired the design below:

Another scene is inspired by the proposal picture that Bajaj posted on her Instagram feed, while a third scene features the wedding venue itself. “This one of Leela Palace Udaipur, where we got married, is from the time when we were going to the hotel in a boat to finalise our weddings preparations,” she says.

The original image that inspired the design

The newlyweds' names have also been embroidered in a repeated pattern in beautiful zari work on the lehenga.

“The hem of the lehenga and the dupatta are adorned with jumping dolphins,” says Bajaj, revealing the story behind this atypical pattern. “Vanraj and I knew each other as kids but never really got along. In 2014, we found ourselves working on a project against dolphin captivity together, and that’s when we really connected.”

Zaveri also wore a white and gold silk sherwani that borrowed a simple floral pattern from Bajaj’s blouse. “We wanted to keep it really simple. He also made beautiful jewelled buttons for his outfit, and designed my wedding jewellery,” says Bajaj, who claims to have hated jewellery all her life, but was happy with her husband’s timeless designs.

Bajaj's golden heels showcase her edgy side

Bajaj added her own edgy style to the classic ensemble by donning a pair of golden Giuseppe Zanotti heels. “I had to have something crazy and insane,” she says laughing. She also mentioned that she chose a simple but unique mehendi design eschewing standard patterns.

Bajaj's unique mehendi

Although people at the wedding didn’t catch onto the love story on Bajaj’s outfit right away, they were quite impressed when they came to know about the story behind the design. Her lehenga has also caught the eye of several to-be brides around the world, specially in London and Australia.

The groom's outfit borrowed the floral pattern from the bride's choli

Now, Bajaj says she has opened a service to design similar custom-made bridal trousseaus. The price for each personalised lehenga will range approximately between ₹3.5–12.5 lakh, however Bajaj has said she can work within a client’s preferred budget range.

Derzeit finden sich einige Schlagzeilen und dazu gehörige Artikel, in denen erklärt wird, warum die dreijährige Tochter von Mila Kunis jeden Freitag einen Schluck Wein trinken darf. Alkohol im Kindesalter? Ob das wirklich zur Religion gehört, wenn Kleinkindern schon der Geschmack von Alkohol nahe gebracht wird und ob es sinnvoll ist, derartigen kulturell aufgebauten gesellschaftlichen Geisteserkrankungen anzuhängen, bleibt hier einmal außen vor. Eindeutig belegbar ist hingegen, dass jemand, der glaubt, keine Ahnung hat, da er es immerhin nicht weiß.

Soviel zu Mila Kunis und ihrer dreijährigen Tochter, nun zum Thema: Alkohol im Kindesalter! Gelegentlich führt mein Weg durch das LWL-Museum für Naturkunde in Münster, in dem seit vermutlich Jahrzehnten eine Dauervorstellung zu den Indianern Nordamerikas genau dieses Thema aufgreift. Die Indianer wurden immer weiter zurück gedrängt, das Ziel war anscheinend ihre Ausrottung sowie sie erst ab 1924 durch ihre Geburt innerhalb der USA automatisch auch Staatsbürger der USA sind. Sie gelten aber gewiss noch heute nicht als vollwertige Bürger und mit Pech werden sie mal eben per Zwang von dem einen in das andere Reservat umgesiedelt.

100 Millionen Indianer sind durch die Entdeckung der neuen Welt durch den „Weißen Mann"" ums Leben gekommen, viele systematisch. Noch heute leben Indianer in Nordamerika meist in abgelegenen Reservaten wie in einem Drittweltland mit einer Arbeitslosigkeit von oft über 60%. Bereits in den Entdeckerjahren war es üblich, den Indianern Alkohol zu geben. Der Weiße Mann hatte wohl auch die Hoffnung, dass sich mit jeder Party einige Indianer totgesoffen haben. Alkohol hat ab diesen Entdeckerjahren eine feste Tradition im Indianerleben, Alkohol im Kindesalter gehört dazu.

Harold Red Eagle säuft seit seinem achten Lebensjahr

Alkohol im Kindesalter ist unter Indianern in US Reservaten anscheinend ein alltägliches Phänomen, sowie rund 75% der Indianerfamilien wenigstens einen Alkoholiker zählen. So die Zeitung „Montana's Indians"" aus dem Jahr 1996, die Harold Red Eagle einen Artikel widmete. Damals war er 37 Jahre alt, soff damit schon seit 29 Jahren und hält sich an einem Pfahl fest. Sein eigener Vater war es, der ihm den Alkohol gab. Was genau die Absichten eines solchen Vaters waren, geht aus dem Artikel nicht hervor.

Harold Red Eagles Tochter begann das Trinken erst mit 13 Jahren. Mit 18 muss sie für drei Jahre ins Gefängnis, immerhin hat sie ihren 14 jährigen Bruder getötet. Sie erstach ihn mit einem Messer, als sie betrunken war. Im Reservat gehen 79 Prozent aller Straftaten auf Alkohol zurück.

„It was her family's way of life.""

„All she saw us do was drink alcohol.""

Alkohol im Kindesalter vermutlich eine ganz schlechte Idee

Wenn die Eltern der Kinder Raucher sind und diese den Rauch bereits kennen, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass sie mit dem Rauchen anfangen. Beim gesellschaftlich etablierten Alkohol ist es ähnlich. Wenn die Kinder sich bereits im Kleinkindalter an den Geschmack alkoholischer Getränke gewöhnen, ist das mehr als fraglich. Es ist wie beim Zucker, dass es nicht 100 Gramm sein müssen. Ein Stück Würfelzucker macht bereits den „Pin"" im Hinterkopf und die leuchtenden Augen, wenn es wieder einmal ein Stück Zucker oder auch mehr gibt. Dieser „Pin"" wird durch die Häufigkeit oder durch größere Mengen natürlich immer stärker.

Es kommt aber auch auf die Menschen an, ob sie für etwas empfänglich sind. Wer es bereits in den Genen oder im Wesen hat, ein Alkoholproblem hervor zu bilden und auch noch Alkohol im Kindesalter vorkommt, dann ist es nur um so wahrscheinlicher, dass genau dieses Problem früher, stärker und damit problematischer hervorgebildet wird.

Weiterhin sind die Organe oder die Psyche von Kindern erheblich empfindlicher. Wesentlich kleinere Mengen Alkohol, Drogen, Umweltgifte oder sonstige Gifte können einen maßgeblich größeren Schaden als beim Erwachsenen anrichten. Nicht Grundlos sind es die Kinder, nicht die Erwachsenen, die rund um Atomkraftwerken reihenweise an Leukämie erkranken.

Wenn dann zu lesen ist, dass Kinder alkoholfreies Bier trinken, ist dieser „Pin"" natürlich nicht vorhanden, auch in Sauerkraut oder anderen Speisen sind bis 0,5 % Alkohol enthalten. Dennoch bringt man den Kindern schon den Geschmack und das Ritual nahe. Auch wenn es eine den Indianern mitgebrachte Kultur des weißen Mannes ist, so wäre es schön, wenn sie wenigstens den Jugendschutz beachten oder den Alkoholismus weitgehend durchbrechen täten. Wer sich jedoch bereits selber als Schweralkoholiker klassifizieren muss und Kinder groß ziehen soll, der bringt damit ganz automatisch einige Defizite mit. Erlebte man selber Alkohol im Kindesalter und lebt folglich im Dauersuff, dann ist es gewiss schwerer, die eigenen Kinder vom Saufen abzuhalten als bei jemandem, der im Leben eine Perspektive mit Job und Einkommen hat. Wer die Armut in der Welt bekämpft, der bekämpft auch ihre Probleme.

NEW DELHI -- A combination of smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and moisture turned Delhi into a ""gas chamber"" today, prompting authorities to announce a series of preventive measures including a four-fold hike in parking fees and slashing of metro fares.

The smog brought down visibility levels, affecting flight and train operations. The heavy air permeated living rooms and even the underground metro stations in the city making it difficult to breathe, turning eyes watery.

In the evening, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced that primary schools in the national capital will remain close tomorrow.

The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, empowered to enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), also directed the states in the region to start preparing for implementing measures like 'odd-even' in light of the ""crisis situation"".

The air quality index was in the 'severe', with a score of 448 in a scale of 500, category for the second time this year. Earlier, Diwali fireworks had triggered peak pollution levels on October 20.

The National Green Tribunal took the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana to task, seeking to know why steps to prevent steps were not taken despite knowing well in advance that such a situation was likely to arise.

The Delhi government is mulling over shutting schools till the peak pollution levels prevail. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: ""Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of year. We have to find a solution to crop burning in adjoining states.""

""Considering high level of pollution, I have requested Manish Sisodia, Education Minister, to consider closing schools for few days,"" he added.

The Indian Medical Association said Delhi was witnessing a ""public health emergency"" and appealed to the government to stop outdoor sports and other such activities in schools to protect the health of children.

Later, in a meeting to review the status of air quality, the EPCA announced that all measures under the GRAP's severe category will be implemented across the region till further notice.

CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar told PTI the intensity of pollution peaked since last night as moisture-heavy winds from Uttar Pradesh and hot winds carrying emissions from stubble burning from Punjab and Haryana have dealt a double- whammy.

""We are not expecting a dramatic change in the next two- three days. Shallow fog and a complete absence of wind are preventing the dissipation of pollutants at the ground level,"" Sudhakar said.

The wind speed is currently around 3 metres per second, Sudhakar said, explaining it is inadequate to disperse particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM10.

EPCA chairman Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain directed the municipal bodies in the region to immediately enhance parking fees by four times and instructed the Delhi Metro to lower fares during off-peak hours for at least 10 days, introduce more coaches and ensure frequent services.

Among other measures, the EPCA instructed Delhi and neighbouring states - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana -- to strengthen the public transport system by introducing more buses and said a fine of Rs 50,000 would be imposed on road construction agencies violating dust pollution norms.

The body asked the Delhi-NCR governments to start preparing for measures like odd-even and a complete ban on construction activities if pollution aggravates.

The measures also include complete closure of brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers across the region till further notice and a ban on entry of goods vehicles - not destined for Delhi for the next 20 days - in the city.

Sisodia, who is also Delhi's education minister, convened a meeting of officials of education, health and environment departments over shutting schools. He directed the environment department to submit a report on the city's pollution levels.

Meanwhile, the CISF ordered issuance of over 9,000 face masks for its personnel deployed to guard the IGI Airport, the Delhi Metro and other government ministries and installations here.

""Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of year.

VIE QUOTIDIENNE - Les usagers n'ont désormais plus à se déplacer en préfecture pour obtenir cartes grises et permis de conduire, qu'ils recevront par courrier après avoir fait les démarches sur internet, a affirmé le ministère de l'Intérieur.

Les guichets d'accueil des préfectures pour ces ""titres de la vie courante"", sources d'interminables files d'attente, sont définitivement fermés à partir de lundi 6 novembre et remplacés par des procédures dématérialisées ouvertes ""24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7, via le site du ministère de l'Intérieur ou de l'Agence nationale des titres sécurisés"", www.ants.gouv.fr.

Le remplacement par des démarches numériques de ces guichets devenus ""obsolètes"" doit ""faciliter la vie de l'usager"" et permettre une meilleure ""lutte contre la fraude"", a expliqué le secrétaire général du ministère, Denis Robin, en saluant ""un véritable changement de modèle pour les préfectures"".

Seules quelques procédures, comme l'annulation ou la suspension de permis ou l'échange de permis étranger, nécessiteront de se rendre physiquement dans les préfectures, a précisé l'Intérieur dans un communiqué.

Des ""médiateurs numériques""

Pour répondre à tout dysfonctionnement, les préfectures garderont ""une capacité résiduelle"" pour traiter les cartes grises et permis jusqu'au 30 novembre. Le site www.demarches.interieur.gouv.fr permet d'aiguiller les internautes, et l'ergonomie des nouvelles procédures sera suivie par un comité d'usagers, précise le ministère.

Les usagers qui n'ont pas accès à internet et peu familiers des démarches en ligne pourront être accompagnés par des ""médiateurs numériques"" dans 285 points en préfecture et sous-préfecture et dans les espaces publics numériques.

Cette nouvelle étape dans la dématérialisation des relations entre les préfectures et les usagers a fait l'objet d'une expérimentation dans les départements de la région Grand Est.

4000 personnes étaient jusqu'ici dédiées au sein du réseau préfectoral à la délivrance de ces titres qui représentaient 11 millions d'opérations aux guichets pour les cartesgrises, et 2,5 millions pour les permis de conduire.

Cette dématérialisation des procédures permettra de recentrer une partie des personnels préfectoraux sur des missions prioritaires de l'Etat comme la sécurité, l'accompagnement des collectivités, la lutte contre la fraude et la coordination territoriale des politiques publiques, selon Beauvau. La suppression de 1300 emplois dans le réseau préfectoral s'accompagne d'un ""vaste plan de requalification et de formation des agents"", avance Denis Robin.",Vous n'aurez plus à vous déplacer pour obtenir carte grise et permis de conduire,http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/11/06/vous-naurez-plus-a-vous-deplacer-pour-obtenir-carte-grise-et-permis_a_23268085/

Elton John wurde von der Elite-Universität am vergangenen Montag für seine karitativen Verdienste mit der ""Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian""-Auszeichnung geehrt. Dabei sei es ausgerechnet seine problematische Lebensphase gewesen, die ihn im Nachhinein dazu motivierte, ein besserer Mensch zu werden: ""Ich verlor meine Menschlichkeit in einem Exzess aus Drogen, Alkohol und einer Essstörung. Während meiner Sucht in den 80ern brach die AIDS-Krankheit aus und die Regierung nahm davon keine Notiz. Ich habe viele Freunde an AIDS verloren und habe wegen meiner Abhängigkeit nichts dagegen unternommen. Die Drogen haben mich in ein Monster verwandelt.""

Erst eine schicksalhafte Begegnung mit einem jungen AIDS-Kranken habe sein Leben verändert: ""Innerhalb von sechs Monaten wurde ich trocken und clean und das bin ich jetzt seit 27 Jahren."" In Anbetracht all der Skandale und Anschläge, die die USA derzeit erschüttern, sei es wichtiger denn je, füreinander da zu sein: ""Wir können die Welt verändern und unsere gemeinsame Menschlichkeit verinnerlichen.

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

Das behauptete die Anwältin in einem Interview in Moskau

Es könnte ein Paukenschlag sein. Im Fall der Verstrickung des Wahlkampfteams von US-Präsident Donald Trump mit dem Kreml hat die russische Anwältin Natalia Veselnitskaya brisante Informationen veröffentlicht.

So soll Donald Jr. ihr versprochen haben, ein 2012 von der Obama-Regierung eingeführtes Gesetz zurückzunehmen, das russischen Staatsbeamten Sanktionen auferlegt. Das berichtet die Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg mit Verweis auf ein Interview der Anwältin in Moskau.

""Falls wir an die Macht kommen...""

Das Versprechen soll Trump Jr. bei einem viel zitierten Treffen am 9. Juni 2016 in New York geäußert haben. Ebenfalls anwesend: Trumps Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und der damalige Kampagnen-Manager Paul Manafort. Letzterer hatte sich Ende Oktober nach monatelangen Ermittlungen gegen ihn dem FBI gestellt. Manafort wird unter anderem Verschwörung gegen die USA vorgeworfen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schlüsselfigur in der Russland-Affäre: Wer ist George Papadopoulos - und wie gefährlich ist er für Trump?

Nach eigener Aussage reiste Veselnitskaya unter anderem mit dem Ziel nach New York, sich für das Ende der amerikanischen Sanktionen gegen Russland einzusetzen. Darum ging es auch beim Treffen im Trump Tower am 9. Juni. ""Falls wir an die Macht kommen, werden wir uns anschauen, was wir diesbezüglich unternehmen können"", soll Trump Jr. der Anwältin geantwortet haben.

Veselnitskaya ging nach eigener Aussage allerdings nicht im offiziellen Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die Gespräche.

Treffen war Zeitverschwendung

Im Gegenzug wollte der Präsidentensohn Unterlagen, die belegen, dass Hillary Clintons Wahlkampagne veruntreute Gelder bezogen hat. Geldgeber der Demokraten sollen bei den Steuern getrickst haben und diese Gelder an Hillary Clinton gespendet haben. Eine Information, die der britische Publizist Rob Goldstone Trump Jr. zuvor in einer E-Mail übermittelt hatte – im Namen Veselnitskayas.

Mit diesen konnte die Anwältin aber nicht dienen. Trump Jr. bezeichnete das Treffen darum im Nachhinein als Zeitverschwendung.

Veselnitskaya sicherte zu, die brisanten Informationen über das Gespräch auch unter Eid an den US-Sonderermittler Robert Mueller weiterzugeben, wenn es verlangt werde. Damit würde der Druck auf Donald Trump massiv wachsen – eine illegitime Absprache mit der russischen Regierung im Wahlkampf wäre wohl nur noch schwer mehr von der Hand zu weisen.

“PREPA’s system appears to be running on fumes.”The story of PREPA is the story of Puerto Rico.
By offering stable, well-paid jobs to electrical workers, PREPA helped create a Puerto Rican middle class, says José Caraballo Cueto, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico has hired a tiny Montana-based contracting company called Whitefish Energy to oversee grid restoration.
“But Puerto Rico never said ‘Hey, we need crews’,” says Mike Hyland of the American Public Power Association (APPA), which represents 1,100 utilities.","IN A room beneath the smokestacks of the Aguirre steam plant in south-eastern Puerto Rico, an engineer points to a colourful poster entitled “How Electricity Arrives at Your Home”. In normal circumstances, explains Alexis Torres, burning oil turns water to steam, which spins mechanical turbines and sends energy out through power lines that criss-cross the island territory. Hurricane Maria made landfall 30 miles from the Aguirre steam plant. The south-east, where coal and oil plants generate much of the island’s electricity, suffered the worst damage.

A month later, 82% of Puerto Ricans still lack power. The island operates a centralised electricity grid: the plants in the south-east provide power to beach resorts in the north-west and metropolitan San Juan; 80% of the power lines were destroyed by the storm. Restoring them is a finicky process. By October 10th 16% of the island’s power had been restored. Later that day it dropped back down to 8% when a plant partially shut down, leaving the airport, police headquarters and several hospitals in the dark. “I was in the middle of open-heart surgery,” one surgeon said. A back-up generator saved his patient. Thousands of the diesel-fuelled contraptions are powering food refrigeration, water purification and other vital needs. But closed schools and shuttered businesses are the new norm. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island.

Maria’s fury would have battered any grid, but the scope of the damage, the sluggish pace of repairs and the suffering from weeks without power have almost as much to do with mismanagement as they do with wind and rain. Last year Synapse Energy, a consultancy based in Massachusetts, carried out the first-ever audit of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and found that the power lines were “cracking, corroding and collapsing”. The utility had been operating for decades without regulation or oversight. Imprudent spending was accelerating a decade-old debt crisis. “The results are grim,” the authors wrote. “PREPA’s system appears to be running on fumes.”

The story of PREPA is the story of Puerto Rico. The utility, created by a New Deal governor in 1941, powered rapid industrialisation in the 1970s as American pharmaceutical and other firms flocked to the island to take advantage of federal tax benefits. By offering stable, well-paid jobs to electrical workers, PREPA helped create a Puerto Rican middle class, says José Caraballo Cueto, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico. The boom was short-lived. When the federal government peeled back the tax perks in 1996, factories started leaving and PREPA began losing customers.

Declining revenues were exacerbated by political patronage, corruption and inefficiency. Municipalities and government agencies do not pay for electricity in Puerto Rico. Successive governments spent tens of millions of dollars evaluating solar and natural-gas projects in order to wean PREPA off its dependence on oil, but did next to nothing. Less than 3% of the island’s energy came from renewables.

PREPA is responsible for $9bn of Puerto Rico’s $73bn of debt. As PREPA and other agencies borrowed billions of dollars from international creditors (and from each other, a practice some have compared to a Ponzi scheme), the utility started skimping on maintenance. In 2014 an austerity law prompted hundreds of experienced employees to retire and claim their pensions before cuts took effect. They were never replaced. The result, according to Synapse’s report, was generator failures, blackout rates four times higher than other American utilities, rising consumer costs, environmental violations and an increasing numbers of worker injuries and fatalities. A three-day blackout in 2016 caused by a fire at the Aguirre plant foreshadowed the darkness and economic standstill Hurricane Maria would bring. “We took the risk and we are paying the price,” says Mr Torres, peering at his poster.

In the aftermath of the hurricane, debate is swirling about how to fix the electrical system and who should pay. “We must rebuild better,” Governor Ricardo Rosselló has said, voicing enthusiasm for a proposal from Elon Musk, founder of Tesla, to deploy solar panels and batteries throughout the island to decrease dependence on the weak grid. This is a fine idea, but also an expensive one. Besides, federal emergency aid—the House of Representatives approved a $36.5bn package on October 12th, though only a fraction will go to Puerto Rico—can typically be used only to reconstruct what existed before the disaster.

The reconstruction has begun in an unusual fashion. Puerto Rico has hired a tiny Montana-based contracting company called Whitefish Energy to oversee grid restoration. Normally, states and municipalities contact a “mutual aid network” that can quickly mobilise thousands of repairmen. “But Puerto Rico never said ‘Hey, we need crews’,” says Mike Hyland of the American Public Power Association (APPA), which represents 1,100 utilities. Mr Rosselló originally claimed he could not get in touch with the APPA, and then later explained that he began negotiating with Whitefish before Hurricane Maria. The company had responded to a request for repair work after Hurricane Irma, and it appeared to be Puerto Rico’s cheapest option. José Roman of the Puerto Rican Energy Commission, an independent body created in 2014 to regulate and monitor PREPA, confirmed that no official bidding process took place. “The government was in emergency mode,” he said.

“It wasn’t like all the big guys were jumping up and down to go to a bankrupt island,” said Ken Luce, a spokesman hired by Whitefish a week ago. The company, which has two full-time employees, began as a joint-venture in 2015 with a Brazilian company called Comtrafo to build a transformer plant in Montana, a project that has since sputtered out. The Puerto Rican government declined to provide details on the contract, but Mr Luce said that Whitefish demanded only a $2m deposit for supplies and crews. It has 220 men on the island, though it plans to increase these to around 1,000 in order to meet the government’s goal of 95% power restoration by Christmas. Until several days ago, Whitefish’s website consisted of a single page with a photo of a helicopter and the contact information for a spokesman.

Puerto Rico’s ability to get the lights back on—and get them to stay on—may determine the island’s future. People will not wait indefinitely for schools without electricity to reopen if they can afford flights to mainland America. Yarimar Bonilla, a Puerto Rican anthropologist at Rutgers University, asked thousands of residents how they felt about Puerto Rico’s territorial status. They told her that, historically, reliable government services like electricity, water and communications made them feel superior to their non-American neighbours like Dominicans and Cubans.

Più duri i tecnici della Camera dell'Upb, che parlano di ""programmazione di corto respiro"" e addirittura di rischio di avvio di una procedura europea sui conti.

BANKITALIA: ""No a passi indietro sulle pensioni"". La preoccupazione principale della Banca d'Italia è legata alle discussioni in corso sulla previdenza. ""È importante non fare passi indietro"" rispetto alle riforme del passato, sottolinea il vice direttore generale Luigi Federico Signorini, spiegando che ""nel lungo periodo la sostenibilità delle finanze pubbliche poggia in larga misura sulle riforme pensionistiche introdotte in passato, che assicurano una dinamica della spesa gestibile nonostante l'invecchiamento della popolazione"". Questo però ""non significa non fare aggiustamenti su singoli casi meritevoli"". Per Bankitalia ""l'economia italiana continua a migliorare"" e il quadro macro del governo ""per il prossimo anno si conferma condivisibile"". Inoltre, ""date le misure contenute nella manovra, anche nel 2019 appare possibile conseguire una crescita non lontana da quella programmata, sempre che non muti il quadro economico e finanziario internazionale"". Proprio per questo ""occorre trarre vantaggio dal buon andamento dell'economia per rafforzare la finanza pubblica, ponendo il debito su un percorso credibile di riduzione significativa"". Bankitalia riconosce al Governo di aver tenuto conto nella manovra di questa esigenza, anche se ""il sentiero è più graduale di quello pianificato in primavera"".

Bene manovra su giovani, statali e investimenti. La Banca d'Italia condivide le priorità della legge di bilancio, date dal governo al lavoro giovanile, al rinnovo del contratto dei dipendenti pubblici e agli incentivi a favore degli investimenti delle imprese. Signorini giudica tutte e tre le misure ""ragionevoli"". Per quanto riguarda gli strumenti di Industria 4.0,, ""i dati disponibili concordano nel suggerire una valutazione positiva. Dai nostri sondaggi si ricava che gli incentivi stabiliti con le due ultime manovre di bilancio hanno contribuito ad accelerare e rafforzare il recupero ciclico degli investimenti"". Sull'occupazione ""meglio sarebbe, potendo, ridurre il cuneo fiscale per tutti; ma, date le risorse limitate, appare ragionevole la scelta di sostenere prioritariamente le prospettive occupazionali dei più giovani"". È infine ""un passaggio senz'altro ragionevole, dato il lungo blocco del passato"", il riavvio della contrattazione nel pubblico impiego.

Ci sono però due ombre sul futuro. Il primo è sulle coperture, perché è rischioso basare una quota rilevante delle coperture della manovra sulle misure di lotta all'evasione. ""È ragionevole, sulla base dell'esperienza - ha affermato il vice direttore generale - attendersi effetti positivi dalle misure di contrasto all'evasione. Tuttavia la stima di tali effetti resta per forza di cose incerta. Basare una quota significativa delle coperture su tali introiti, come avviene per gli anni successivi al 2018, comporta un elemento di rischio; esso andrà tenuto presente nel monitorare nel corso del tempo l'evoluzione effettiva dei conti"". Il secondo è sulla sterilizzazione dell'Iva: ""come in passato si è scelto di non cancellare definitivamente le clausole di salvaguardia, ma di farlo solo per 1 anno. Esse riducono di fatto l'orizzonte di programmazione della politica di bilancio. Idealmente l'adozione, al loro posto, di provvedimenti percepiti come permanenti ridurrebbe l'incertezza tanto sui saldi della finanza pubblica quanto sulle forme di tassazione"". Per la Banca d'Italia, infatti, ""la prevedibilità è importante per imprese, cittadini, mercati"".

CORTE DEI CONTI: ""Solo ritocchi sulle pensioni"". ""Ai fini della tutela degli equilibri di fondo della finanza pubblica gli interventi al margine del sistema pensionistico"" devono essere ""disegnati in maniera tale da limitare la platea dei destinatari alle situazioni di effettivo disagio, anche per minimizzare gli ovvi effetti di frammentazione che finiscono per produrre"" afferma il presidente della Corte dei Conti Arturo Martucci di Scarfizzi, sottolineando dall'altro lato che le misure, come l'Ape social, vanno articolate ""nel modo più chiaro possibile per favorirne la celere implementazione"".

La lotta all'evasione come copertura è un rischio. Per la Corte dei Conti, la lotta all'evasione fiscale costituisce ""una priroità assoluta dell'azione pubblica"", ma ""presenta dei limiti quando usata come tipologia di copertura, soprattutto per l'inevitabile incertezza nella realizzazione dei risultati attesi"". Per questo l'invito è al Parlamento a non cambiare la dimensione delle misure previste in manovra, viste le coperture limitate. ""Una scelta importante - ha osservato il presidente dei magistrati contabili - alla vigilia di un anno che si presenta molto impegnativo: per le rilevanti scadenze istituzionali, per il consolidamento e il rafforzamento della crescita e per il possibile mutamento di alcune variabili esogene fin qui favorevoli (a partire da una politica monetaria molto espansiva)"".

UPB: ""In linea teorica si rischia la procedura Ue"". La voce più critica è, come spesso accaduto nelle occasioni più recenti, quella dell'Ufficio Parlamentare di Bilancio, che evoca addirittura il rischio teorico di un avvio di una procedura europea sui conti italiani. ""Il quadro di finanza pubblica evidenzia una programmazione di 'corto respiro' che inficia la trasparenza dei conti pubblici nonché la prevedibilità del quadro macroeconomico"" rileva il presidente Giuseppe Pisauro, che evidenzia un quadro ""rischioso"" anche sul fronte della riduzione del debito pubblico. ""L'evoluzione dei saldi di finanza pubblica"" è legata alla clausole di salvaguardia, la cui ""credibilità risulta peraltro indebolita dai ripetuti interventi di parziale sterilizzazione o rinvio"". Sul fronte del debito, la riduzione cumulato al 2020 ""è attribuibile quasi interamente all'andamento dell'avanzo primario che a sua volta è fortemente condizionato dall'attivazione delle suddette clausole di salvaguardia"" e dagli obiettivi degli introiti da privatizzazioni rispetto alle quali non sono fornite ""informazioni sufficienti per valutare se il programma sia realizzabile"". Secondo l'Upb, ""il rispetto delle regole presenta rilevanti fattori d'incertezza"". C'è in manovra un ""forte rischio di deviazione significativa per quanto riguarda sia il sentiero di aggiustamento del saldo strutturale (in termini annuali e biennali), sia il rispetto della regola sulla spesa, a causa del maggior tasso di crescita della spesa totale indicato rispetto al Def (1,6 contro l'1,2 per cento)"".","Altolà di Bankitalia e Corte dei Conti sulle pensioni, ombre sulle coperture della manovra",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/07/altola-di-bankitalia-sulle-pensioni-dubbi-sulle-coperture-della-manovra_a_23269032/

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Dabei ist ein Abfangversuch äußerst riskant

Trump will sich bei seiner Asienreise außerdem mit dem russischen Präsidenten Putin treffen

US-Präsident Donald Trump ist zu Beginn seiner fast zweiwöchigen Asienreise in Japan eingetroffen. Einige hundert amerikanische und japanische Soldaten bereiteten ihm am Sonntagvormittag (Ortszeit) auf dem US-Militärstützpunkt Yokota einen begeisterten Empfang.

""Japan ist ein geschätzter Partner und wichtiger Alliierter, und wir danken ihnen für ihre Freundschaft"", sagte Trump.

Nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur Kyodo soll er jedoch im Vorfeld Unverständnis für Tokios Reaktion auf zwei kürzliche Raketentests durch Nordkorea geäußert haben. Er könne nicht verstehen, warum ein Land von Samurai-Kriegern die Raketen nicht abschoss, soll Trump gesagt haben.

Dabei wäre sowohl ein erfolgreicher als auch ein gescheiterter Abschuss äußerst gefährlich.

""Japan will der Eskalation wohl aus dem Weg gehen""

Der Abfang einer Rakete - gerade einer Interkontinentalrakete - gilt als große Herausforderung. Die USA testeten im Mai 2017 ihr Raketenabwehrsystem ""Ground-based Midcourse Defense"" (GMD) - mit einer Erfolgsquote von 53 Prozent, wie das Pentagon mitteilte.

Das japanische Verteidigungsministerium habe sich nach der Berechnung der Flugroute der nordkoreanischen Raketen dazu entschlossen, keinen Abgangversuch zu starten, berichtet die japanische Tageszeitung ""Japan Times"". Ein Fehlversuch würde Japan blamieren und Nordkorea womöglich zu weiteren Test ermuntern, so die Überlegung.

Ein erfolgreicher Abschuss könnte außerdem die Situation eskalieren lassen. ""Einen Abschuss hätte Nordkorea umgehend als Provokation und Anlass für zeitnahe weitere Raketentests gesehen, dieser Eskalation wollte Japan wohl aus dem Weg gehen"", zitierte der ""Spiegel"" einen ranghohen Bundeswehroffizier nach einem kürzlichen Raketentest der Nordkoreaner.

Trump will sich mit Putin treffen

Der gefährliche Konflikt um das Atomwaffenprogramm in Nordkorea wird eines der zentralen Themen der zweiwöchigen Asien-Reise von Trump sein. Darüber wird er am Montag auch mit dem japanischen Ministerpräsidenten Shinzo Abe in Tokio sprechen.

Seine erste Asienreise wird Trump von Japan aus weiter nach Seoul führen, nach China, Vietnam und auf die Philippinen. Trump erwartet während seiner Reise auch ein Treffen mit seinem russischen Kollegen Wladimir Putin.

""Ich denke, es wird erwartet, dass wir uns mit Putin treffen"", sagte Trump am Sonntag auf der Reise nach Tokio an Bord der Air Force One mitreisenden Reportern. ""Wir wollen, dass Putin mit Nordkorea hilft, und wir werden eine Reihe verschiedener Anführer treffen"", sagte Trump. Die beiden Präsidenten haben sich zuletzt am Rande des G20-Gipfels in Hamburg getroffen.

Ein Treffen Trumps mit Putin am Rande eines Gipfels der Asiatisch-Pazifischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft (Apec) in Da Nang in Vietnam war von russischer Seite bereits ins Spiel gebracht, vom Weißen Haus aber bislang nicht bestätigt worden.

Trump selbst hatte vor der Reise dem Sender Fox News gesagt: ""Das ist eine sehr wichtige Reise. Wir können uns mit Putin treffen."" Eine endgültige Bestätigung eines Treffens steht gleichwohl noch aus.

Le 12 décembre prochain, un sommet international sur le climat est organisé dans la capitale française, deux ans après la signature de l'accord de Paris au terme de la COP21. La présidence de la République française a déclaré ce 7 novembre qu'environ 2.000 participants en provenance d'une centaine de pays et de 800 organisations et acteurs publics et privés étaient invités, mais pas le président des États-Unis.

Annoncée par Emmanuel Macron cet été, la réunion se tiendra juste après la 23e conférence de l'ONU sur les changements climatiques, la COP23, qui se déroule jusqu'au 17 novembre à Bonn, en Allemagne. ""Il faut dresser le bilan de notre trajectoire par rapport aux engagements. Si nous n'accélérons pas nos efforts, nous n'arriverons pas à atteindre l'objectif d'une augmentation (de la température) de 1,5 degré à la fin du siècle. Il faut redoubler d'effort, un sursaut"", a précisé l'Elysée via un communiqué.

Le retrait américain fait grincer des dents

""Pour l'instant, le président Donald Trump n'est pas invité"", car les chefs d'Etat conviés sont ceux ""des États engagés dans la mise en oeuvre de l'accord"", a ajouté la présidence de la République, qui conviera cependant des représentants du gouvernement américain.

Donald Trump avait effectivement annoncé en juin le retrait des États-Unis de l'accord de Paris, qui ne sera toutefois effectif qu'en 2020. Adopté fin 2015 et ratifié à ce jour par 169 pays, ce pacte historique vise à limiter le réchauffement mondial sous 2°C, voire 1,5°C, par rapport au niveau d'avant la Révolution industrielle.

Mais l'annonce du retrait américain est venue porter un coup à un processus complexe, qui demande notamment de se détourner des énergies fossiles (charbon, pétrole, gaz) pour réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre.

Pas de nouveaux engagements chiffrés

A ce stade, les engagements volontaires pris par les États à Paris poussent encore le thermomètre mondial à plus de 3°C. En dépit de progrès comme la stabilisation des émissions de CO2, l'écart entre l'action et les besoins est ""catastrophique"", prévenait l'ONU dans un rapport publié la semaine dernière, appelant alors les pays à renforcer leur contribution.

Interrogé sur l'utilité concrète d'un rendez-vous climatique supplémentaire et sur la possibilité d'obtenir des résultats en une seule journée, l'Elysée a affirmé qu'il était ""nécessaire et important"" pour renforcer la mobilisation internationale.

""Mais ce ne sera pas une ""pledging conference"", c'est-à-dire une conférence avec des engagements officiels chiffrés"", avertit l'Elysée.

D'abord, revoyons certains concepts :

Le genre, théorisé entre autres par Judith Butler dans Trouble dans le genre, a été distingué de la notion commune de « sexe » pour désigner les différences sociales entre hommes et femmes qui n'étaient pas directement liées à la biologie.

L'identité de genre renvoie à la façon dont les humains pensent et ressentent leur identité en regard des deux sexes définis et construits dans la société. Un homme se sentant pleinement homme serait cisgenre. Une personne qui a une identité de genre différente du sexe assigné, des hommes avec des caractères féminins et des femmes masculines peuvent construire des identités de genre multiple. Dans nos sociétés, certaines personnes ne sont point en mesure de s'identifier au sexe masculin ou féminin (transgenre entre autres). Ces personnes se définissent en dehors de la dualité femme-homme. D'ailleurs, le gouvernement canadien est désormais en mesure de reconnaitre ces personnes.

L'identification du sexe d'une personne, quant à elle, n'est pas aussi simple qu'il y paraît. Nombreux sont les auteurs qui ont tenté de souligner la pluralité irréductible des critères de détermination du « vrai sexe » d'une personne. En fait, ni l'anatomie (pénis/vagin), ni l'ADN (chromosomes XY/XX) et ni l'organisation du cerveau humain ne permettent de donner une définition sûre du sexe. D'ailleurs, certaines analyses sur l'intersexuation ont ainsi démontré comment tous les jours, des sexes indéterminés sont promulgués ou reconstruits en fonction de critères directement liés à la nécessité sociale de distinguer les hommes des femmes.

L'indéfectible rupture du lien entre sexe et tempérament

Combien de fois avons-nous entendu dire que les femmes sont dotées de capacités cognitives liées davantage à la sensibilité et la douceur tandis que les hommes seraient davantage agressifs et violents? Trop de fois, je dirais. Selon la chercheure Margaret Mead dans Mœurs et sexualité en Océanie, on entrevoit des conclusions étonnantes à ses analyses. Chez les Aparesh, en Océanie, leur idéal est celui d'un homme doux et sensible marié à une femme tout aussi douce et sensible que lui. Chez les Mundugumor, c'est celui d'un homme violent et agressif marié à une femme tout aussi violente et agressive. Chez les Chambuli, quant à eux, on entrevoit une image renversée de ce qui se passe dans nos sociétés. La femme y est la partenaire dominante : elle a la tête froide, et c'est elle qui mène la barque. L'homme est, des deux, le moins capable et le plus émotif.

La dérive vers l'utilisation abusive de la biologie pour expliquer les différences entre les sexes reste une vraie menace pour la démocratie.

Lorsqu'il est question d'une telle confrontation, des conclusions très précises se dégagent. Pour ainsi dire, certaines attitudes que l'on croyait traditionnellement associées au tempérament féminin – comme la passivité, la sensibilité et l'amour des enfants – peuvent aisément être typiques des hommes d'une tribu et, dans une autre, inversement, être complètement rejetées par la majorité des hommes et des femmes. Ainsi, les auteures Catherine Vidal et Simone Gilgenkrantz affirment qu'il n'y a plus aucune raison de croire que les différences traditionnelles que nous dégageons des hommes et des femmes sont irrévocablement déterminées par le sexe d'un individu. De ce fait, prétendre que c'est la testostérone qui fait les hommes compétitifs et agressifs tandis que les oestrogènes rendent les femmes émotives et sociables relève d'une vision simpliste, bien loin de la réalité biologique. Si dans un groupe social, hommes et femmes tendent à adopter des comportements stéréotypés, la raison tient d'abord à une empreinte culturelle rendue possible grâce aux propriétés de plasticité du cerveau humain. D'ailleurs, l'idée même de différenciation des sexes est liée au capitalisme sauvage : c'est le sujet de prédilection de l'industrie pharmaceutique qui tente d'accroître ses marchés par la vente de produits miracles stimulant féminité ou virilité. La dérive vers l'utilisation abusive de la biologie pour expliquer les différences entre les sexes reste une vraie menace pour la démocratie.

Le cerveau n'a pas de genre

Lorsque l'on nait, nous ne sommes pas conscients d'avoir un sexe. On l'apprend au fur et à mesure que nos capacités cognitives se développent. Gaïd le Maner-Idrissi nous rappelle que le sexe n'est pas inné. Ce n'est qu'à partir de deux ans et demi qu'un enfant est en mesure de s'identifier à l'un des « deux sexes ». Or, depuis la naissance, l'enfant évolue dans un environnement qui est, pour la plupart du temps, sexué : la chambre, les jouets, les vêtements et même la socialisation diffèrent selon le sexe qu'on attribue à l'enfant tout en prétendant de l'identité de genre de ce nouvel individu en développement. Selon certaines expériences, des adultes, de manière inconsciente, ont adopté des interactions davantage physiques avec les bébés garçons, alors qu'ils s'orientaient vers la socialisation chez les filles. Ainsi, l'interaction avec l'environnement social, familial, culturel et scolaire va orienter les goûts, les aptitudes et ainsi contribuer à forger l'identité même d'un individu, et ce, en fonction des rôles masculins et féminins dictés par la société (théorisé par Cordelia Fine). Pour ainsi dire, la structuration de notre matière cérébrale est entièrement liée au reflet intime de l'expérience vécue de chaque individu.

Au niveau des performances, on a démontré qu'hommes et femmes réussissent de manière égale dans les tâches de langage et d'orientation; des aptitudes verbales et spatiales; des sciences naturelles et des mathématiques. Prenons l'exemple d'une classe d'élèves de 11-13 ans qui s'apprêtent à faire un test mesurant les capacités de représentation spatiale. Lorsque le test est présenté par le professeur comme étant un test de géométrie, les résultats des garçons sont meilleurs que les filles. Néanmoins, lorsque le professeur présente son test comme étant une évaluation en dessin, alors les filles présentent des résultats meilleurs que les garçons. Cette expérience vient démontrer comment les filles viennent à intérioriser, de manière inconsciente et invraisemblable, une infériorité en mathématique. Néanmoins, on a tout de même démontré que garçons et filles n'ont pas des statistiques différentes au niveau du raisonnement mathématique.

Vers une éducation non genrée

Je rêve d'une éducation où la notion de binarité du genre (dualité femme-homme) serait inexistante. Comment s'est-on rendu là? Comment se fait-il qu'il existe encore des disparités probantes entre femmes et hommes? Encore aujourd'hui, les femmes occupent une place limitée au sein des pouvoirs politiques, des conseils d'administration et des mouvements syndicaux. Cette hiérarchisation du genre est issue davantage de normes sociales établies par le patriarcat d'où la nécessité de s'en défaire. La binarité du genre n'est qu'illusion.

. Il n'y a pas de masculinité, ni de féminité, mais des gens qui adoptent des comportements stéréotypés tout ça, bien entendu, dans un contexte d'une société hétéronormative vouée à une reproduction et une croissance économique perpétuelles.

En 1949, dans le deuxième sexe, Simone de Beauvoir nous rappelle qu'on « ne nait pas femme, on le devient ». Pour ainsi dire, il y a déjà plus de soixante ans, on dénotait déjà l'imbrication de la normalisation du genre de nos sociétés. Il n'y a pas de masculinité, ni de féminité, mais des gens qui adoptent des comportements stéréotypés tout ça, bien entendu, dans un contexte d'une société hétéronormative vouée à une reproduction et une croissance économique perpétuelles. Le genre, quant à lui, est nul autre qu'une construction sociale.

FÉMINISME - ""Pourquoi [les femmes] n'accepteraient pas de gagner moins que leurs collègues (...) s'il est admis au plus haut niveau que 'le masculin l'emporte sur le féminin'?"" C'est avec cette interrogation à l'esprit que 314 enseignants et enseignantes ont signé une tribune sur le site d'information Slate, ce mardi 7 novembre.

Ils y déclarent ""avoir cessé ou nous apprêter à cesser d'enseigner la règle de grammaire résumée par la formule 'le masculin l'emporte sur le féminin'"", et appellent chacun à en faire autant, notamment les autres enseignants, les professionnels de la presse et de l'édition, les écrivains...

Pour ces signataires, la répétition de cette formule à l'école ""induit des représentations mentales qui conduisent femmes et hommes à accepter la domination d'un sexe sur l'autre"".

Elle est d'autant plus illégitime à leurs yeux qu'elle n'a été créée que récemment dans l'histoire de la langue française. ""Elle a été mise au point au XVIIe siècle"", rappellent ces enseignants, qui indiquent par ailleurs qu'elle a été par la suite généralisée pour des raisons ""politiques"".

Ils citent ainsi les défenseurs de cette réforme de la langue, qui assumaient de défendre un masculin ""plus noble"". ""Le masculin est réputé plus noble que le féminin à cause de la supériorité du mâle sur la femelle"", écrivait ainsi Beauzée dans sa ""Grammaire Générale"" publiée en 1767.

Pour certains grammairiens, au contraire, le masculin serait ""utilisé comme la marque du neutre"" en français. C'est ce qu'expliquait au moins d'octobre le grammairien Antoine Gautier, maître de conférence en langue française à l'université Paris-Sorbonne, dans le Figaro. Pour lui, c'est la formulation de la règle qui serait ""malheureuse"", et qui devrait être modifiée. ""Beaucoup de filles le prennent mal, et ça se comprend"", justifiait-il.

Des accords de proximité, de majorité ou au choix

Les signataires de la tribune proposent comme solution de revenir aux règles qui prévalaient alors à l'époque, héritées du latin. ""Nous déclarons enseigner la règle de proximité"", indiquent-ils par exemple,qui consiste à accorder les mots concernés avec le terme le plus proche. Ainsi, plutôt que d'écrire ""les maîtres et les maîtresses engagés"", il faudrait écrire ""les maîtres et les maîtresses engagées"".

D'autres solutions existent, indiquent-ils, comme un accord ""de majorité"" -s'il y a plus de femmes, on accorde au féminin- ou plus simplement un accord ""au choix"".

Cette prise de position intervient alors que l'écriture inclusive fait débat, depuis la publication du premier manuel scolaire à l'avoir adoptée. Ce mode d'écriture vise à féminiser d'avantage la grammaire, comme le recommandait en 2015 le Haut Conseil à l'Égalité entre les Hommes et les Femmes. Cela peut passer par l'intégration de la terminaison du féminin entre des points, quand c'est nécessaire. Par exemple, on pourrait écrire ""les maître.sse.s"", à la place de ""les maîtres et les maîtresses"".

Ces propositions avaient choqué les Immortels de l'Académie Française, qui avaient dénoncé à la fin du mois d'octobre un ""péril mortel"" pour la langue française.

Après avoir publié cette tribune, Slate a annoncé adopter également cette règle de l'accord de proximité. ""La rédaction va revenir à une règle plus juste issue du latin et appliquée en leurs temps par Corneille et Ronsard"", informe le site, qui dit défendre ""une langue plus inclusive, sans impact pour les plus conservateurs de nos internautes et bien plus équitable"".

Dans la foulée, le site Les Nouvelles News a indiqué à son tour adopter cette règle grammaticale.

OTTAWA — A gaggle of young constituents — and their parents — descended on Parliament Hill today to press politicians to resolve ongoing airport hassles children face due to security list snags.

Ten families from the group known as the No Fly List Kids planned to make their case to MPs and ministers with the aim of ensuring that funding for a new computer system to fix the problem is included in the 2018 federal budget.

Parents of children who have repeatedly endured nerve-wracking airport delays because a youngster's name matches one on a no-fly list say federal security legislation now before Parliament will do nothing in the short term to ease their woes.

The government is proposing an amendment to the Secure Air Travel Act that would allow the public safety minister to tell parents that their child is not on the Canadian no-fly list, meaning the name simply matches that of someone who is actually listed. The government says this would provide assurance to parents about their child's status.

The legislation, part of a broad package of security-related measures, would also allow federal officials to electronically screen air passenger information against the list, a process currently in the hands of airlines. The government says this would prevent false name matches by enabling it to issue unique redress numbers for pre-flight verification of identity.

But it also means creating a new computer system to do the job.

Scott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the department understands the frustration of travellers and wants to reassure them that work on long-term improvements continues.

""However, it will take time to make regulatory and database changes to support a redress system. We are grateful for the patience and understanding of those affected in the meantime.""

'Every time we fly it happens'

Families were disappointed funds for the new system did not turn up in the last federal budget and they're beginning to lose patience.

""This is a technical problem that requires a technical solution,"" said Sulemaan Ahmed, whose son Adam, 8, has been held up many times before boarding a flight.

""The families are not willing to wait longer for more excuses.""

In June 2016 the government created an inquiries office to help resolve travellers' problems. But the No Fly List Kids group, which now includes more than 100 youngsters, says the difficulties persist.

""Every time we fly it happens,"" said Heather Harder, whose son Sebastian, 3, has been repeatedly flagged.

""My family is from Saskatchewan. And so we go back to visit them fairly often. Every leg of the trip we're stopped,"" she said after a news conference Monday.

""We've only flown domestically. We're actually too nervous to fly internationally.""

Ahmed and his wife Khadija Cajee stressed the need for a more effective redress system last month in a presentation on behalf of the group to a House of Commons committee conducting consultations on the next budget.

""Some of our children have been denied initial boarding and delayed to the point that they have missed flights internationally. Older No Fly List Kids avoid travel due to the potential for stigmatization,"" the submission said.

""All families find the security screenings become increasingly invasive as their children have gotten older.""

Ahmed worries about children who have been caught in the no-fly web for years and now find themselves travelling abroad as young adults, with no guardians nearby to sort out problems.

""This goes beyond the no-fly list, actually,"" he said. ""This could impact their employment, this could impact security clearance, this could impact admission into universities and schools.""

Mismatches often involve Muslim-sounding names

In addition, the group says, the mismatches often involve Muslim-sounding or Arabic-sounding names, raising the question of charter of rights guarantees of equality under the law.

""The darker side here is that we know that things go terribly wrong when it comes to information-sharing and lists of this sort that get shared with governments around the world,"" said Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada, who attended the news conference.

""It can even lead to unjust imprisonment, disappearances and torture. That's why we need to take this seriously.""

The No Fly List Kids group has enlisted support from MPs of all stripes who have written letters to encourage Finance Minister Bill Morneau to include the redress measure in the next budget.

Among them is Toronto Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, who chaired the House of Commons public safety committee when it issued a report on national security calling on the government to provide the financial resources for the new system.

""Through expert witnesses, it became apparent to our committee that the no-fly list's social cost, without an appropriate redress system, greatly outweighs its security benefit,"" Oliphant says in the August letter.

At the time, the Eskom board also asked three other senior Eskom executives to step aside.","Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan (L) and former president Kgalema Mothlante (R) attend the opening night of the documentary film Promises and Lies screening at the Constitutional Hill on May 4, 2017 in Johannesburg.

Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan has questioned the ""recklessness"" of decisions taken by politicians and state-owned company board members.

""What lessons are we learning about the recklessness of some of the decisions made both by politicians and by boards, and the kind of financial impact it has on big entities like Eskom, and perhaps in today's context the country itself?"" he asked former Eskom CEO Tshediso Matona, who appeared on Tuesday before Parliament's public enterprises portfolio committee.

The committee is conducting a months-long inquiry into corruption and maladministration at state-owned companies.

Matona was Eskom CEO for only five months -- from October 2014 to March 2015 -- before he was suspended by the utility's board after a meeting that included Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.

Gordhan, who serves as an ordinary ANC MP on the committee, cited an affidavit tabled by Matona ahead of his appearance.

""In your affidavit... you say your suspension could lead to a downgrade, and that in fact Standard & Poor did downgrade Eskom to junk status on March 19, 2015. You also express the view that at the time, S&P did say that this downgrade to junk status was linked to your suspension.""

Matona said he did not know of any other incident before this where what he termed a ""misgovernance event"" had triggered a downgrade in the manner it happened at Eskom.

READ: Former Eskom CEO Tells State Capture Inquiry: 'It's Too Late'

""This was a time when we were also talking to investors. We wanted to give them assurance that we've got a handle on the company... It was natural then that when a dramatic event of that nature happens that investors would take fright... that's why they did the downgrade,"" he said.

At the time, the Eskom board also asked three other senior Eskom executives to step aside.

Asked why the board had suspended him, Matona said he had a sense that the meeting to discuss his suspension was being handled in a manner that would create a defence for the board, allowing me to make representations.

""I chose to walk away, and leave that sorry and sordid episode behind me.""

""But it was a farce, in my view. I could see at the time that the outcome was predetermined... In the final analysis, I concluded that the board did not see me fitting into whatever its plans are.""

He declined to speculate further.

On his suspension, he said there was no basis whatsoever for this, and it had come as a complete shock.

""Particularly suspension by a board that had just taken office... When the pretext of an investigation of the state of the affairs of the company was given, I could not buy that. Because I believe that the problems of the company had been well established at the time. So we knew where the problems were operationally and financially.

He had challenged his suspension through the Labour Court, which had found it to be unfair, and then the CCMA.

He had finally been ""made an offer"" to leave Eskom, which he had accepted.

""I chose to walk away, and leave that sorry and sordid episode behind me.""

Earlier, Matona revealed that there had been ""serious in-fighting"" among members of the previous board, which had been in place when he took office in October 2014.

""There was significant tension, you could call it turmoil, there was serious in-fighting between the board [members] on a range of issues, but largely to do with procurement.""

This had almost rendered the board dysfunctional.

He also described an electricity supplier that was facing dire problems when he stepped in as CEO, after previously serving as public enterprises director general.

Eskom at the time was battling to balance its books and its revenues were under pressure, mainly the result of rising levels of municipal debt. However, the ""burning platform"" he found himself on was the utility's operational problems.

Matona said he was told that in 2010, at the time of the Soccer World Cup, a decision had been taken to defer power station maintenance. This had happened again at the next elections.

""There was significant tension, you could call it turmoil, there was serious in-fighting...""

""A culture had set in of deferring maintenance... By the time I got there, the units were packing up one after another.""

On the diesel that Eskom had been forced to buy to power its peak supply generators at the time of the load shedding that followed, he suggested that the procedures invoked to cope with the emergency had allowed the utility ""to deviate from what normal procurement would be"".

This had created a ""major risk"" to who was awarded a diesel supply contract, and the price charged for the fuel.

Apple revamped its overseas subsidiaries to take advantage of tax loopholes on the European island of Jersey after a crackdown on Ireland's loose rules began in 2013, according to The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The news outlet and the non-profit investigative organization cited confidential records that were obtained by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and shared. The cache of 13 million secret documents came from Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm that helps businesses and wealthy individuals find tax shelters.

The moves came after a U.S. Senate subcommittee found in 2013 that Apple had avoided tens of billions of dollars in taxes by using overseas havens. The paper said Apple has $128 billion in offshore profits not taxed by the U.S.

By 2015, Apple had moved the tax home of two Irish subsidiaries to Jersey, a self-governing island in the English Channel, and also made Ireland the tax home of a different European subsidiary.

Apple said in response that the reports contained various ""inaccuracies.'' For instance, the company said its 2015 corporate reorganization was ""specially designed to preserve its tax payments to the United States, not to reduce its taxes anywhere else.''

The Cupertino, California-based company said it was the largest taxpayer in the world, paying $35 billion in corporate income tax over the last three years, including $1.5 billion in Ireland. It said it pays an effective tax rate of 21 per cent on foreign earnings.

The company said that it told regulators in the U.S. and European Commission of the reorganization of its Irish subsidiaries in 2015 and said the moves did not reduce its tax payments in any country.

During the research, conducted by Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg , 43 patients with “severe” or “moderately severe” depression underwent an art therapy course.

Art therapy has a “clear effect” on severe depression, helping some people to get back to work after time off, new research suggests.

According to the researchers the majority of the participants were so affected by their depression that they were unable to work at the start of the study.

The individual art therapy took place in psychiatry or primary care and was conducted by a specially trained therapist.

Each session began with a short briefing and a relaxation exercise. After that participants created artwork with crayons and water colours.

“The materials were simple, allowing people to doodle and feel free to express themselves the way they wanted to, and then they would talk about the picture and its significance,” Christina Blomdahl, PhD at the institute of health and care sciences and licensed occupational therapist and art therapist, explained.

After 10 hour-long treatment sessions the patients had improved on an average of almost five steps on a rating scale used for depression.

Blomdah said this represents a large leap that entails a “considerable” change to everyday life, and sometimes it may also mean that a patient is able to return to work.

Anxiety, sleep, ability to take initiative and emotional involvement are some of the factors that are assessed. In the control group that had not undergone art therapy there was no definite change.

“The conclusion is that it was the art therapy that facilitated their improvement,” Blomdah said.

“Painting pictures based on themes and discussing the pictures with the therapist promotes self-reflection and brain stimulation that takes place outside of the conscious mind.”

Although Blomdahl’s study was based on adults, Mary­-Rose Brady, director of operations at the British Association of Art Therapists, previously told HuffPost UK art therapy can be particulalry useful for children struggling with mental ill health.

“We know that children who can’t understand or name their feelings are more likely to ‘act them out’, so art therapy can provide relief to a child whose only previous option was to dissolve into tears or have an angry outburst in response to overwhelming feelings,” she said.

“Art materials enable children to externalise troubling or confusing emotions, giving them form and enabling them to make links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, perhaps for the first time.”

Debbie Thwaites, founder of art therapy charity Shine Again, explained how this works.

“One young boy I saw just wanted to paint poo,” she said.

“He wasn’t able to say ‘this person is making me feel like poo’, but he was able to get all the brown and black colours out, make a big mess and say ‘that’s what I feel like’.”

Based on the recent findings, Blomdahl hopes that art therapy will be used more extensively in healthcare.

“Based on evidence requirements it has been more or less scrapped by psychiatry, but this is one of the largest studies that has been conducted in this area,” she said.

“It is a step that may lead to more people being trained in it and the method being used again.”","Art Therapy Has 'Clear Effect' On Severe Depression, Research Finds",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/07/art-therapy-has-clear-effect-on-severe-depression-research-finds_a_23269098/

Die ""Paradise Papers"" zeigen erneut, wie viele Reiche sich der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung entziehen

Gleichzeitig wird im politischen Diskurs lieber nach unten getreten

Das größte Problem sind aber nicht die ""sozial Abgehängten"", sondern die realitätsferne Elite

Der Publizist Jakob Augstein hat nicht immer Recht mit dem, was er in seiner Kolumne bei ""Spiegel Online"" veröffentlicht. Doch in seinem Text zu den Enthüllungen um die ""Paradise Papers"" hat er mit wenigen Sätzen ins Schwarze getroffen: ""Das System ist zutiefst krank. Es ist unmoralisch und unanständig“, schreibt er. ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.“

Das nunmehr öffentliche System von Briefkastenfirmen, mit denen Reiche ab einer bestimmten Anlagesumme sich das Steuerzahlen sparen können, ist ein erschreckendes Beispiel für den Unwillen der Privilegierten, Solidarität mit den wirtschaftlich Schwächeren zu zeigen.

Diese Steuersparmodelle sind meist völlig legal. Das macht sie aber noch lange nicht legitim, im Gegenteil. Die Verstrickung vieler deutscher Firmen und Privatpersonen zeigt, dass der alte rheinische Kapitalismus, der diesem Land Jahrzehnte lang sozialen Ausgleich und einen vergleichsweise hohen Lebensstandard für möglichst viele Menschen beschert hat, mittlerweile mausetot ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Kein Interesse, Schlupflöcher zu schließen

Und das ist vor allem eine Mentalitätsfrage. Es gibt in Deutschland Menschen, die solche Schlupflöcher für die Reichen und Superreichen offen stehen lassen. Sie sitzen derzeit auch bei den Sondierungsgesprächen für eine mögliche Jamaika-Koalition mit am Tisch.

Und es gibt solche Menschen, die ohne den Anflug eines schlechten Gewissens diese Lücken nutzen. Ist ja alles erlaubt. Was sich jene, die sich sonst gerne zur ""Leistungselite"" dieses Landes zählen, dabei gerne unterschätzen: Macht geht auch mit Verantwortung einher.

Und genau das unterscheidet die Reichen auch von den Küchentischtricksern in den Reihenhäusern der urbanen Stadtrandlagen, die einen Zusammenstoß mit einem nachtblinden Fuchs gerne mal zum Wildunfall aufmotzen, um dann bei der Auto-Versicherung abzukassieren. Unehrlichkeit gibt es auch bei den Ärmeren. Aber sie hat längst nicht so große Folgen.

Wir haben ein moralisches Führungsproblem in diesem Land. Und es strahlt von oben nach unten aus. Mit Folgen für die politische Landschaft in der Bundesrepublik.

Auch die Populisten hetzen gegen die Armen

Es gibt eine Frage, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Siegeszug des Populismus bisher viel zu wenig diskutiert wurde: Warum eigentlich treten so viele Menschen gegen die vermeintlich Schwächeren in der Gesellschaft aus?

Der Erfolg der AfD wäre undenkbar ohne dieses Phänomen. Die Partei will das Arbeitslosengeld II für jene erhöhen, die mindestens zehn Jahre beschäftigt waren.

Außerdem plant sie, die Steuern für die Mittelschicht zu senken und die Erbschafts- sowie die Gewerbesteuer abzuschaffen. Davon profitieren vor allem jene, die einer geregelten Arbeit nachgehen und über ein vererbbares Vermögen verfügen.

Die nationalistisch denkenden Teile der Mittelschicht dürften sich von der Arbeits- und Sozialpolitik der AfD ganz gut vertreten fühlen. Und klar ist auch, auf wessen Kosten das geht: Es gibt weniger Geld für Asylleistungen, weniger Geld für Zuwanderer. Überhaupt: weniger Geld für alle, die nicht in die politischen Kategorien des AfD-Gesellschaftsbildes passen.

Das ist kein rein deutsches Phänomen. In Tschechien hat kürzlich ein Multimilliardär mit seiner Partei die Parlamentswahlen gewonnen, dessen Wahlkampf gespickt war mit Spitzen gegen Arbeitslose und Sozialhilfeempfänger.

Feindbilder passend für jede soziale Schicht

In Österreich hat die FPÖ ihren Wahlkampf mit dem Slogan ""neue Fairness"" bestritten. Auf Plakaten war ein österreichischer Rennradler zu sehen, der vorne auf dem Tandem sitzt, und eine dickbäuchige Karikatur eines faulen und obendrein auch linken Sozialhilfeempfängers auf dem Hintersattel mitziehen muss.

Die Motive gleichen sich in den Ländern Europas. Und die Populisten haben für fast jede Gesellschaftsschicht ein vermeintlich überalimentiertes Feindbild parat: Für die Wohlhabenden sind das die ""links-grün versifften Gutmenschen"", die mit Steuergeldern ihr angeblich zweifelhaftes Wirken finanziert bekommen.

Für die weniger Wohlhabenden sind es die Ausländer, deren Existenz nach Meinung des Stammtisches ""auf Kosten von Obdachlosen, Alten, Kranken und Armen"" finanziert wird.

Und wer selbst ohne Job ist, darf sich bei den Rechtspopulisten immerhin noch daran ergötzen, dass es ja noch jene Arbeitslosen gibt, die selbst verschuldet und durch eigene Faulheit in diese Situation geraten sind. Das sind im Zweifelsfall immer die anderen.

Auch die Linken treten nach unten

Übrigens ist dieses Phänomen des Nach-unten-Austretens auch aus einem ganz anderen Kontext sehr aktuell: Linke erheben sich selbst gerne über die AfD-Wähler, indem sie diese als ""dumme Nazi-Prolls"" diffamieren.

Die Stigmatisierung von Rechten als ""ungebildet"" oder ""sozial minderwertig"" ist nicht nur gefährlich, sondern lenkt den Blick von jenen gesellschaftlichen Bruchlinien ab, die in Deutschland den sozialen Frieden gefährden – und dadurch mitverantwortlich sind für den Aufstieg der rechten Parteien.

Die Scheren zwischen Arm und Reich, Stadt und Land, Rentnern und Pensionären, Akademikern und Handwerkern sind derart offensichtlich geworden, dass die so gewachsenen Unterschiede das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl vieler Menschen verletzen. Und – da sind wir wieder bei den ""Paradise Papers"": Auch dafür ist derzeit kaum jemand bereit, die Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Das moralische Führungsproblem.

Die Regierenden verstehen das Problem noch immer nicht

Wenn ein Akademikerkind eine dreimal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf ein Studium hat und eine zehnmal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine erfolgreich abgeschlossene Promotion als ein Arbeiterkind, dann wirkt das entmutigend auf jene, die eigentlich eine ""Aufsteigerbiografie"" leben könnten.

Wenn die Pensionen für Staatsdiener zwanzig Prozentpunkte höher liegen als die Renten für Arbeitnehmer, dann wird dadurch der Verdruss auf das System befeuert.

Und wenn die CSU beim Breitbandausbau ganz auf die Kraft des freien Marktes vertraute, der aber aus Profitgründen gar nicht daran dachte, die abgelegeneren Regionen Deutschlands mit schnellem Internet zu versorgen, dann wächst auf dem Land der Verdruss gegen die ""Eliten"" in den Städten.

Was wir in Deutschland bräuchten, wäre ein Masterplan, wie die gespaltene Gesellschaft wieder näher zusammengeführt werden kann. Das betrifft politische Maßnahmen, muss aber auch auf unser gesellschaftliches Leitbild abzielen.

Populisten und Radikale hatten in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik stets dann die schlechtesten Chancen, wenn Wohlstand in Deutschland gerecht geteilt wurde.

Dem gegenüber steht derzeit der Trend, dass sich Reiche in Deutschland in ihre eigene Welt zurückziehen. Privatschulen haben immer mehr Zulauf, ebenso wie kommerziell betriebene Universitäten. Wer sich eine private Altersvorsorge leisten kann, muss sich nicht mehr allein auf die gesetzliche Rente verlassen.

Und wer genug Geld gesammelt hat, dass er im Stehen schlafen müsste, wenn er es unter das Kopfkissen legen würde, der kann sich auch die legale Ausweichbewegung in die so genannten ""Steuer-Oasen"" leisten.

Das Deprimierende ist, dass die Politik immer noch nicht erkannt hat, wie viel gesellschaftlicher Schaden dadurch entsteht.

Wer ständig nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge kräht, aber nicht einmal ansatzweise willens ist, die Reichen in diesem Land zu gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu zwingen, der beweist damit eigentlich nur, dass er die Probleme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nicht verstanden hat.

Denn in der RTl-Sendung werden Menschen aus der Provinz bloßgestellt - mit fatalen Folgen

Katastrophen fangen oft ganz harmlos an. So auch die neue Folge von „Bauer sucht Frau“, jener scheinbar putzigen und doch so giftigen Reality-Soap auf RTL.

Kameraschwenk über die thüringische Provinz. Hintergrundmusik: 70er-Jahre-Geträller. Rosi sitzt am Frühstückstisch eines Bauernhofs vor zwei drögen Scheiben Brot. Der Hausherr hat ein Milchtrauma aus der Jugend und kann keinen Käse riechen. Dafür hat er sie mit einem Pfund Butter überrascht.

Doch die Dame stellt ihn auf die Probe und drapiert den eigens mitgebrachten Edamer auf den Tisch.

Weibliche Stimme aus dem Off: „Auch Rosi erbringt einen Liebesbeweis, sie versteckt den Käse unter Marmelade.“ Der Bauer muss vor die Tür. „Nur die frische Landluft kann dem 66-Jährigen jetzt helfen. Rosi bleibt ratlos zurück. Muss sie sich vom Käse verabschieden, wenn sie bei Günter bleiben möchte?“, sagt die Sprecherin.

Nahaufnahme. Hintergrundmusik: italienisches Liebesgeschnulze.

Offenbarungseid der Sonderlichkeiten

Die ersten Minuten, die ersten Lacher. Das Muster bei „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist ewig gleich: Die ganze Sendung ist ein Spott auf die Mittelmäßigkeit der Provinz. Auf die Sorgen der Menschen. Auf deren Ausdrucksweise, Marotten und Schrullen. Das ist infam, und auch gefährlich.

Am größten ist die Freude bei dem Produzenten, wenn die ganzen, normalerweise aus verständlichen Gründen unbeleuchteten Peinlichkeiten des Kennenlernens mit der Lupe seziert werden.

Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten

So wird das Landleben zur Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten und für jene, die es werden wollen. Da können sich Lasse und Laura aus Prenzlauer Berg genauso wie Jupp und Jutta aus Krefeld in dem wohligen Gefühl ins Fernsehkissen drücken, dass sie in der besseren von zwei möglichen Welten an diesem Abend leben.

Die ganze Niedertracht der RTL-Fernsehmacher

Überhaupt: Am nervtötendsten ist der Soundtrack.

Mit schmalzigen Liebesliedern, die sich selbst der heißgelaufendste Kuchelrock-Ultra nicht in einer Öffentlichkeit zu spielen trauen würde, die größer ist als die eigene, demente Hauskatze; schunkeltauglichen Unterhaltungsschlagern aus der Wirtschaftswunderzeit mit dem Cool-Faktor von Schnarchpflastern; und amerikanischen Große-Welt-Songs, die einen ironischen Kontrast zu den Misthaufen der deutschen Provinz herstellen.

Hier wird die ganze Niedertracht der Fernsehmacher von RTL offensichtlich. Was für Eltern muss man haben, um anderen Menschen so eine spöttische Inszenierung anzutun?

Als Zuschauer kann solche Fernsehsendungen wegkonsumieren wie eine Tafel Milchschokolade, dafür sind sie ja gemacht.

Doch am Ende bleiben die Kalorien auf der Seele: Ist es wirklich richtig, dabei zuzusehen, wie ganz normale, bisweilen ziemlich liebenswert wirkende Menschen zum Belächelt- und Belachtwerden preisgegeben werden? Sollten wir wirklich dabei zuschauen, wie die deutsche Provinz als Hort der Unzulänglichkeiten dargestellt wird?

Eine bösartige Sendung

Nein, verdammt. „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist eine bösartige Sendung. Sie sorgt dafür, dass ganze Gesellschaftsschichten in Deutschland gegeneinander ausgespielt werden, nur damit RTL und der Bertelsmann-Konzern ihre Gewinnmarge steigern können.

Wenn wir über die Bruchlinien in unserer Gesellschaft sprechen, die derzeit zu immensen politischen Verwerfungen in Deutschland führen, dann fängt die Diagnose an einem beliebigen Abend bei Sendern wie RTL an. Wir haben verlernt, uns gegenseitig zu respektieren. Und das hat auch mit dem öffentlichen Bild zu tun, das von Milieus und Regionen medial produziert wird.

„Bauer sucht Frau“ ist Wahlwerbung für die AfD. Hier wird der Graben ausgeschaufelt, der Menschen in Deutschland trennt, und hinter dem jene Barrikaden errichtet werden, an denen derzeit gekämpft wird. Man kann RTL dafür nicht oft genug kritisieren.

The wellness industry has really boomed over the past decade in Australia.

More than ever before people are educating themselves about what they put in and on their body and are actively seeking out information and products to best care for their health.

Proof of that lies in the popularity of diets such as Paleo and Keto, but perhaps why these diets don't work for everybody is that we shouldn't be taking a one-size-fits-all approach.

It's the same when it comes to looking after our complexions. Products that make your friend glow or clears up their acne might not yield the same results for you and that's because the genetic makeup of each of our skin is totally individual.

That's where DNA testing is coming in. Traditionally used for tracking family history or solving crimes, DNA testing is becoming increasingly popular in prescribing the perfect diet, exercise or skincare routine for individuals.

A DNA test isn't as invasive as it sounds. All that's needed is a swab of the inside of the cheek.

It makes sense. Both the wellness and beauty industries, up until now, have been largely based on a trial and error approach, and it's costing Aussies a whopping $28.6 billion a year. With customised plans based on our own DNA we can cut out a lot of time and money wasted on trying products and fads that aren't right for us.

This year Aussie skincare brand Rationale launched a two-phase skin genetic test called DNArray. The therapist first obtains a DNA sample, by swabbing inside your cheek, to identify specific genetic skin strengths and weaknesses. Based on results you are prescribed a targeted skin care treatment plan.

""Skin DNA testing reveals the skin 'blueprint' we were given by our parents. A skin DNA test spotlights our individual skin strengths and weaknesses and what we should focus on to achieve healthy, glowing skin for life,"" Richard Parker, founder and Director of R+D of Rationale told HuffPost Australia.

""A consultation takes place that includes a DNA analysis, a UV scan, to see how your skin is coping with the sun, and a full medical skin history. A DNA sample is taken painlessly with a cotton swab to the inside of the mouth. This is sent our Laboratory for analysis. A week later we receive your full report and customise the perfect regime to maintain your skin in the optimal state of health and radiance.""

With this information you can get to work on improving your current skin as well as safeguarding against how your skin is likely to deteriorate in the future.

Rationale has pioneered isotropic, or skin identical, formulas. What this means is: our products feature ingredients found naturally in human skin, at exactly the same concentrations, in vehicles that we designed to deliver active ingredients exactly where they need to go. The result is healthy, luminous skin! A post shared by Rationale (@rationale) on Sep 30, 2017 at 11:58pm PDT

""Your report tells us what we must focus on short and long term to restore and maintain your skin in top condition. For example, if you are low in antioxidants, we must start by adding these to your skincare regime. If you have sensitive skin, we will prescribe a regime that begins with strengthening,"" Parker said.

""DNA skin analysis takes the guesswork and painful mistakes out of finding the perfect skincare programme. It's specific to each individual and it is completely accurate. The aim is to be on a healthy 'diet' of all of the skin's own vitamins, minerals and nutrients that protect and repair sun damage, the major cause of skin ageing.""

The Rationale DNArray Medical Consultation costs $150.

Another Aussie business using DNA testing to prescribe customised plans is Functional Food Solutions by dietician Peta Carige. The consultant to the Australian Rugby 7s Men's and Women's squads, Waratahs Rugby Union and the Manly Sea Eagles Rugby League team, Carige is regarded as one of the top sports dietitians in Sydney.

Thanks to the popular social media 'fitspo' world we live in Carige says one of the challenges she currently faces is that everyone who eats healthy or has a six pack thinks they are experts in nutrition. Because of this, much of her time is spent 'busting myths' with clients and providing them with factual, scientific answers.

Born from that frustration and her passion for wellness, Carige has created an online space, Functional Food Solutions. Carige uses personalised genetic profiling, again by obtaining a swab from the inside of the mouth, to help best prescribe the right diet for each client.

A post shared by Peta Carige (@petacarige) on Jun 8, 2017 at 7:32pm PDT

""DNA doesn't directly tell us about our diet, but what it does tell us is what we are predisposed to through our genetics, such as cardiovascular disease or more susceptible to gaining weight when we eat high fat foods,"" Carige told HuffPost Australia.

""Therefore, we then have the knowledge to make the correct choices for our genetics to hopefully prevent chronic disease in the future. It's pretty amazing. The other way genetic testing can assist our dietary choices is through testing our genetic predisposition to processing starch carbohydrates.

""We can then make food choices that our body prefers which can result in less bloating or lethargy and more successful weight loss.""

The test is quick and painless, and the result is personalised based on your DNA. The best bit is no more jumping from paleo to keto to low FODMAP to try and work out how you should be eating.

""We can do a genetic test by taking a mouth swab that is sent away to the lab run by FitGenes. This test then tells us how well your genetics enables to you process starch carbohydrates. We then use this result in combination with what you already eat, and your goals to devise the best meal plan for you and your genetic make up. It is really taking a personalised meal plan to the next level,"" Carige said.

""Once results are in, two things happen. Firstly, the patient knows that their meal plan is truly tailored to them and secondly I find that patients are much more compliant with their meal plan. The combination of these two, results in great results that are often achieved faster than standard dietary intervention.""

The cost for an initial Consult with Carige is $180 and the test is $160.",DNA Testing Is The Key To Your Best Skin And Perfect Diet,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/07/dna-testing-is-the-key-to-your-best-skin-and-perfect-diet_a_23267516/

Dorothy Parvaz Former Evin prison detainee Dorothy Parvaz says Boris Johnson's comments could be 'potentially devastating' to Zaghari-Ratcliffe

Last weekend, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing at which Johnson’s remarks were cited as proof that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime”. Meanwhile, the mother-of-one’s family maintain she was simply on holiday in the country to show her infant daughter Gabriella to her grandparents. “You’re so incredibly vulnerable in there - you can’t control what people are saying on the outside or how that might affect you,” Parvaz said. “The fact is, if she hears this is happening, it will be devastating. If one thing you have said is found to be what they consider to be a lie or inconsistent, everything you say is a lie.”

According to Parvaz, detainees face daily cross-examinations, with interrogators constantly changing conditions in an attempt to trip prisoners up and get them to admit to their alleged crimes. “You have to wage a big psychological battle everyday to try and keep your mind straight, to get through interrogation, to convince the people questioning you that you’re not what they’re accusing you of being,” she said. “You have no interaction with anybody else. If you happen to pass somebody in the courtyard, you’re absolutely not allowed to say a word.” Before she was released from the prison after two and a half weeks without charge, the journalist, who worked for Al Jazeera at the time, was held in solitary confinement and blindfolded almost constantly when allowed out of her cell.

The pop star and “Voice” coach sat down with CBS Sunday Morning and spoke candidly about how her popular on-screen persona sparked identity issues.

“America feels like my aunt [telling me], “You know, you’re growing up so much and we don’t want to see you grow up,” she said, continuing, “I think why people loved Hannah Montana was because Hannah Montana did feel real, and that’s because I was under there.”

When asked how she dealt with that, she replied, “I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now. I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”

She then credited her provocative “Wrecking Ball” music video as the catalyst for allowing her to distinguish her true self from her squeaky-clean Disney star alter ego.

“I didn’t realize that it was going to shift me into truly being my own person,” Cyrus said. “It changed my life. I felt like that divide, that boundary, was very clear.”

The video’s sexual nature —who can forget a naked Cyrus riding on a wrecking ball — combined with a controversial performance at the 2013 Video Music Awards catapulted the singer into a brand new territory, identity-wise. It also led to a fair share of criticism.

Ardern is in Sydney for a whirlwind visit after being elected New Zealand PM in October. The brief stop in Australia is the Labour leader's first overseas trip as Prime Minister.

Turnbull and Ardern met on Sunday morning at Kirribili House where they discussed a range of bilateral issues including terrorism, regional security, trade, North Korea and the crisis on Manus Island.

Turnbull said while he appreciated New Zealand's offer his government would prioritise its existing refugee deal with the US. Under that agreement, 1,250 refugees from the two Pacific nations will be resettled in the US.

Ardern said the offer, originally made by her predecessor John Key, still stood.

""I did renewed New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru ... It is a very genuine offer,"" she said.

""From the perspective of New Zealand we want our offer to stay on the table so we can assist as much as we are able.""

The comments come as roughly 600 asylum seekers on Manus Island remain without power, food and water in an attempt by authorities to encourage them to seek refuge on the island.

The situation emerged after the controversial PNG detention facility was shut down this week.

The crisis has escalated to the point where the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has labelled it an unfolding humanitarian crisis.

Empty calorie foods and drinks include: soft drinks, alcohol, energy drinks, cordial, some white breads, biscuits, sweets, pastries, ice cream, condiments, fatty processed meats and many deep-fried takeaway foods.
What's the opposite of empty calorie foods?
The foods we should replace empty calorie foods with include healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats such as avocado, nuts and seeds.
""When people count calories, they also often avoid foods that are nutrient dense and higher in calories (like those mentioned before -- fatty fish, nuts and so on) and replace them with lower calorie foods that have minimal nutritional benefit.""","When it comes to food and eating, we all have different approaches. There are some of us who see food just as delicious food, while others see it in terms of nutrition or even as energy (calories).

While it's important not to get too caught up in the amount of calories in food (because not all calories are created equal), knowing about empty calories is a helpful way to stay on track and keep your weight in check.

To understand more about empty calories and which foods and drinks they are found in, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

What is a calorie?

""A calorie is a unit of energy. It is the amount of energy or heat that is required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius,"" Rebecca Gawthorne, accredited practising dietitian and nutritionist, told HuffPost Australia. ""One calorie is equal to 4.18 kilojoules.

""In a food and nutrition context, a calorie is the unit of food energy. When people talk about the calories in food, they are referring to how much energy that food provides your body when you eat or drink it.""

What is an empty calorie?

""Empty calories refer to foods that are high in calories (that is, they are 'energy-dense') but are also 'nutrient-poor', meaning they are very low in essential nutrients and have little or no nutritional value,"" Gawthorne said.

""These are foods that are often heavily processed with many additives and we don't require them in our diets -- we can live without them.""

As nutritionist Steph Lowe of The Natural Nutritionist explained, ""an empty calorie refers to nutrient-poor foods and drinks that are usually full of added sugars and poor-quality fats"".

What are empty calorie foods? Empty calorie foods and drinks include: soft drinks, alcohol, energy drinks, cordial, some white breads, biscuits, sweets, pastries, ice cream, condiments, fatty processed meats and many deep-fried takeaway foods.

Do empty calories make you gain weight?

The short answer: yes.

""There is no health benefit to consuming foods that contain empty calories and they can actually have a negative impact on our health, leading to weight gain and chronic diseases, so it's best to limit or avoid empty calories,"" Gawthorne said.

""The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating recommends limiting discretionary foods, which would include empty calories, to only 'sometimes' and in small amounts. There is no specific calorie amount [to stay within] but it's best not to consume empty calories on a daily basis.""

But why exactly do these energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods cause weight gain? Lowe explained this is primarily due to the way refined sugars and poor-quality fats affect our body's processes.

""Refined sugar spikes the fat storage hormone insulin, and poor-quality fats impair mitochondrial function and contribute to inflammatory weight gain,"" Lowe told HuffPost Australia.

Alcohol is packed with energy (calories) but zero nutrition.

What's the opposite of empty calorie foods?

The foods we should replace empty calorie foods with include healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats such as avocado, nuts and seeds.

""Foods that are opposite to empty calories are those that are energy-dense (that is, they contain calories -- but remember calories aren't 'bad' or 'unhealthy' when accompanied by nutrients we need to live) and are high in essential nutrients,"" Gawthorne said.

""For example, foods like salmon, nuts and avocado contain nutrients and calories but are very healthy for us.""

Now, with all this talk of calories, it's important to mention that counting calories isn't the best way to manage or lose weight. While it's good to know about empty calories, both Gawthorne and Lowe recommend focusing on real, whole foods rather than their caloric value.

""I believe it's more important to focus on the health and nutritional value of food instead of calories,"" Gawthorne said.

Stick to these types of meals and leave junk food as a treat.

""It's good to be aware of calories in foods, especially when it comes to empty calories. However, I don't believe counting calories is a healthy way to lose weight. Counting calories can become an obsessive habit and take the focus off health and doesn't always lead to weight loss or improvements in health.

""When people count calories, they also often avoid foods that are nutrient dense and higher in calories (like those mentioned before -- fatty fish, nuts and so on) and replace them with lower calorie foods that have minimal nutritional benefit.""

Further, Lowe highlighted that to describe weight loss as 'energy in versus energy out' isn't telling the whole story. For example, 150 calories of chocolate will not be processed in the body the same way as 150 calories of fruit.

""One of the biggest myths is what we refer to here at The Natural Nutritionist as 'The Calorie Fallacy'. Physiology is not math or physics for that matter,"" Lowe said. ""It's about eating real food.""",What Are Empty Calorie Foods And Why Are They Bad?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/01/what-are-empty-calorie-foods-and-why-are-they-bad_a_23263969/

In the past week, we’ve watched (and rewatched) all of the latest installments which means there’s only one thing left to do. Yup, it’s time to start thinking about what might happen in the third series.

Creators the Duffer Brothers have already confirmed that it’s coming, so here are all the questions that will need answering... Will we see Eleven’s sister again? Episode seven, ‘The Lost Sister’, didn’t quite fit in with the rest of the series. While the writers needed to take Eleven out of Hawkins so that she could return and, ultimately, save everyone in the end, this episode-long shift of focus felt a little clunky. Given how divise the episode has been, we wouldn’t be too shocked if the Duffer Brothers just pretended this whole thing hadn’t happened. But as Eleven’s sister, Kali, remains somewhere out there with her group of bandits and misfits, it has cleared a path for potential future storylines.

Netflix

And what about the other children used by the lab? Eleven is (obviously…) number 11 and Kali was branded ‘008’, so - assuming the scientists worked in numerical order - there are potentially at least nine other children that they experimented on. Are they still alive? And if so, will Eleven use her powers to find them, as she did her ‘sister’? Could Eleven’s mother ever be saved? It was heartbreaking to watch Millie Bobby-Brown’s character discover the truth about what happened to her mum, finding her suffering from mental and physical health issues after receiving electro-shock treatment from the lab, in order to make her forget about her daughter. She remains at her home, which begs the question of whether there’s any way she could be saved? Surely Eleven wouldn’t be able to resist visiting her again… #JusticeForBob?

Yeah, he made a lot Dad jokes, called his car “the Bobmobile” and listened to too much Kenny Rogers, but in the end, we really grew to love Sean Astin’s character. If he’s good enough for Joyce Byers, he’s good enough for us - and let’s not forget that Bob played a pretty pivotal role in figuring out where Chief Hopper was when he got lost in the Upside Down, before then coming to the rescue again when the demodogs took over the lab. Quite frankly, to call him ‘the new Barb’ would probably be an undersell, but just as fans of Nancy’s best pal demanded justice for her after season one, we’re hoping for some sort of event to commemorate for Bob’s untimely demise. At least name the Radio Shack after him. What about the two romance storylines? Lucas Sinclair and Mike Wheeler both had their first kisses, with newbie Max Hargrove and Eleven respectively, during the finale’s Snow Ball dance scene so this will obviously need addressing in future episodes. The Duffer Brothers have confirmed that there’ll be another time skip for the next series though, so it’s unlikely that we’ll get to see the immediate aftermath of the romantic encounters. What’s next for Hopper and Eleven?

Not all of the new relationships in ‘Stranger Things 2’ were romances and the pairing of Hopper and Eleven brought us so much joy, but it was tinged with sadness given that Hopper’s daughter, Sarah, died years ago. Seeing him dote on Eleven and attempt to teach her about the world was heart-breakingly beautiful and when they patched up their differences to close the gate to the Upside Down, we were literally cheering on the sofa. For season three, we’d love to see their bond get even stronger so please guys, no arguing this time. We seriously can’t take it. And Steve and Dustin?

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartner kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex - nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

The research highlights that many people still see physical illness as a more legitimate reason to take time off work, meaning they are often reluctant to speak to their employer about mental health. Three quarters (74%) of workers said they are more likely to take a day off work for a physical illness such as a cold or back ache than if they were suffering from stress, anxiety or depression. Almost half of workers (45%) diagnosed with the conditions admitted they would feel uncomfortable telling their employer about it, according to the survey, and a further three in five (59%) said they would not want any evidence of them having experienced stress, anxiety or depression on their work record. The panel of GPs revealed that once they’d diagnosed patients with either stress, anxiety or depression, one in six people asked for their diagnosis to be concealed on a work sick note. This is perhaps unsurprising as research by the charity Business in the Community (BITC) suggests that more than one million UK employees could face demotion, disciplinary or dismissal after sharing mental health issues with employers.","Symptoms Of Depression, Anxiety And Stress Rising In UK, But Many Delay Seeking Help",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/one-in-six-have-asked-doctors-to-hide-mental-health-problems-on-sick-notes-report-finds_uk_5a0089bde4b0c96530012f0a

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartner kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.

Cette protection réduite s'explique par une mutation de la souche H3N2 dominante en 2016, expliquent les virologues dont l'étude a été publiée lundi 6 novembre dans les comptes rendus de l'Académie américaine des sciences (PNAS).

Le vaccin pour la saison 2017-2018 est similaire à celui de l'an dernier, ce qui augure une saison ""difficile si elle est de nouveau dominée par le virus H3N2"", explique Scott Hensley, professeur à la faculté de médecine Perelman de l'université de Pennsylvanie et principal auteur de ces travaux, en recommandant toutefois la vaccination.

Le vaccin 2016 avait bien été ""actualisé"" pour y inclure la nouvelle version de cette protéine mutante mais sans grand succès, précise-t-il.

Basculer vers de nouvelles technologies pour la production de vaccins

La plupart des protéines virales de vaccins sont purifiées à partir de virus cultivés dans des œufs de poule. Mais une petite partie des vaccins est produite à partir de cultures cellulaires, plus rapides et plus souples.

Or Scott Hensley et son équipe ont constaté que la protéine mutante du virus H3N2 se développait mal dans des cultures dans des œufs. Les chercheurs ont montré que les anticorps produits chez des furets, un modèle de recherche animal pour la grippe, et chez des humains, exposés aux virus produits dans ces cultures, neutralisaient difficilement les virus H3N2 en circulation.

His case kicked off this entire citizenship circus currently turning Federal Parliament into a national laughing stock, but former Greens senator Scott Ludlam said he has been enjoying watching the controversy unfold as he posts hilarious memes from the sidelines.

""I loved that job and the people I was working with, so it was a wrench to have it suddenly gone. On the other hand, I've had plenty of time to savour the slow and richly deserved disintegration of the Government, so that's something,"" Ludlam told HuffPost Australia.

Ludlam, a Greens senator for Western Australia, resigned from parliament in July after discovering he held New Zealand citizenship. This breached section 44 of the constitution, and meant he was ineligible for election. Two days later, his Greens colleague in Queensland, Larissa Waters, also resigned after realising her Canadian citizenship.

Since then, more than a dozen federal MPs have had questions raised about their potential dual citizenship, and four other politicians -- Malcolm Roberts, Fiona Nash, Barnaby Joyce and Stephen Parry -- have been forced to leave parliament after their own citizenship status was revealed.

Ludlam has kept a low public profile since he revealed his citizenship dramas and immediately resigned from the parliament, in contrast to Roberts, Nash and Joyce who resisted calls to resign and instead waited for a High Court judgement.

The former WA senator has been active on Twitter, though, shooting out a number of memes and barely concealing his thoughts on the ever-growing controversy.

On Monday, after Liberal MP John Alexander became the latest member to become embroiled in the section 44 mess, Ludlam tweeted the 'disaster girl' meme of a young child in front of a burning house. The meme is often used to denote someone enjoying the situation they have created -- as Know Your Meme explains, the image of the girl is often ""superimposed on to images of natural disasters and accidents to imply that she has caused some type of calamity depicted in the background"".

Ludlam said he had felt ""a mix of bewilderment, regret and increasing amounts of schadenfreude"" in watching the dual citizenship drama unfold. He said, since resigning from parliament, he had split his time between ""a lot of handover and transitional stuff, reading, thinking, writing, and occasional undisciplined shitposting.""

Just days after he resigned from the Senate, he tweeted a GIF of falling dominoes, a seemingly prescient post considering the number of politicians who have fallen in his wake.

He has also posted a number of jokes since, jokingly taking credit for bringing the often-ignored section 44 to light.

He even dropped a gag in response to another Twitter user asking ""have you just come close to bringing down the Government"".

""Trust [in Government] was already in short supply before this latest shambles. This hasn't helped matters, and I know I carry a measure of responsibility for that. The Government could have cauterised this mess by agreeing to an immediate audit, which is surely where this needs to end up,"" Ludlam said.

""There's more to come, it seems. Now it's playing into internal fault lines within the Coalition, which is deeply destabilising for the country and also means Kevin Andrews' head is on television a lot more.""

The former senator has not outlined any plans to return to politics, unlike Waters who has signalled she would like to remain in the arena, and is still weighing up his options.

Von Amts wegen sind bestandskräftige Leistungsbescheide nach § 22 SGB II mit Wirkung für die Vergangenheit nach § 44 SGB X iVm. § 40 SGB II zurückzunehmen, wenn die Rechte der Leistungsberechtigten infolge der Nichtanwendung der ab dem 01 .01.2010 geltenden WNB betroffen und Leistungen nach § 22 SGB II zu Unrecht nicht erbracht worden sind. Ggf. reicht die Rückwirkung in der Regel bis zum 01.01.2011.""

Mittels Überprüfungsantrag gem. § 44 SGB X hatte P. Vorsorge getroffen, dass auch für das Jahr 2010 keine bestandskräftigen Leistungsbescheide vorliegen. Damit erweiterte sich sein Rechtsanspruch automatisch um ein Jahr.

Dazu kam noch die Tatsache, dass das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis über kein „schlüssiges Konzept"" für die Ermittlung der Kosten der Unterkunft verfügte. (Auch das aktuelle Konzept der Firma Analyse & Konzepte ist derzeit noch beim LSG (L 6 AS 120/17) anhängig.)

Bereits die Weisung MAIS war eine Rechtsverletzung in der Absicht der Vermögensschädigung für Tausende von Betroffenen im Jahr 2010.

In den Mühlen der Rechtsverdreher - Jobcenter verweigert Erstattung

Existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen gibt es anscheinend nur auf dem Klageweg.

In der Zeit vom 08.07.2011 bis zum 26.11.2013 führte P. zwei KDU-Klagen vor dem Sozialgericht in Dortmund. In dieser Zeit wechselten dreimal die zuständigen Richter.

Zuletzt musste das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis den erfolgreichen Rechtsanwalt und für die Bewilligungszeiträume vom 01.08.2011-31.01.2012 (S 19 AS 4056/11; W 578/11) und vom 01.02.2012-31.07.2012 (S 19 AS 308/12, W 83/12) 12 x 48,40 € = 580,80 € bezahlen.

Trotz ministerialer Weisung vom 15.08.2012 verweigerte das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis Jahre lang die von Amts wegen angeordnete Erstattung von Januar 2011 bis Juli 2011, also weitere 7 Monate á 48,40 € = 338,80 €.

Am Donnerstag, den 17.07.2014 wurde ein weiteres Hauptsacheverfahren über die Nachzahlung der KDU für das Jahr 2010 im Sozialgericht Dortmund unter Vorsitz der Richterin Sülow verhandelt. Dabei ging es um den Beweis des fristgerechten Zugangs zweier Überprüfungsanträge.

Als Behördenvertreterin des Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis behauptete die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch. im Termin ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"". Diese Behauptung wurde ohne jeden belastbaren Beweis vorgetragen und völlig anhaltslos geglaubt.

Richterin Sülow schenkte der unbewiesenen Aussage mehr Glauben als dem Verfasser als Faxversender, obwohl nachweislich drei gesendete Faxe mit Datum, Uhrzeit und Nummer des Jobcenters an das Jobcenter Iserlohn gesandt worden waren.

Untätigkeitsklage trotz unstritigem Rechtsanspruch

Mit dieser Entwicklung hatte niemand gerechnet. 580,80 € verloren, weil die Jobcenter-Mitarbeiterin behauptete ""das Fax sei nicht zugegangen"".

Im Urteil des Sozialgericht Dortmund vom 17.07.2014 (S 19 AS 357/12) heißt es:

""Zur Begründung führt sie aus, ein Überprüfungsantrag vom 14.06.2011 sei dort weder bekannt noch zugegangen. Empfangsjournale des Faxgerätes mit der Nummer 02371/905799 für den 14.06.2011 seien bei dem Beklagten nicht mehr vorhanden.""

Damit wurde die Untätigkeitsklage für den Zeitraum 01.01.2010 bis 30.06.2011 über 48,40 € monatlich und damit insgesamt 871,20 Euro Existenzsichernde Leistungen abgewiesen, obwohl der Rechtsanspruch auf der Grundlage des WNB NRW unstrittig ist.

Spätere Recherchen zeichnen die Vorgänge jedoch klarer: Die Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags erfolgte durch die Datenschutzbeauftragte Frau Andrea Sch., die nicht einmal in dem Gebäude Friedrichstraße 59/61, sondern in der Brausestraße arbeitet, in dem das entsprechende Faxgerät steht.

Außerdem war wohl zum Zeitpunkt des Faxzugangs (21:37 Uhr) niemand mehr im Gebäude. Ob die betreffende Beklagtenvertreterin überhaupt nur einmal einen Faxeingang in der Hauptzentrale miterlebt hat? Von der Erfassung im ""Eingangsbuch"" ganz zu schweigen.

Als sicher gelten darf aber, dass die Reinigungskräfte das Büro häufiger betreten als die Wortführende ""Zeugin"" mit ihrer Behauptung.

Auch die Zeit der Faxübertragung, Dienstag, 14.06.2011 um 21:37 Uhr, lässt die Aussage der Jobcentervertreterin unglaubwürdig erscheinen.

Aber niemand ist so blind, wie der, der nicht sehen will.

Diese Behauptung des Nichtzugangs des Antrags wertete die Vorsitzende Richterin höher als die Aussage der Person, die das Fax versendet, die ordnungsgemäße Übertragung überprüft hat, die Eintragung der Übersendung eigens dokumentiert hat und anschließend den Überprüfungsantrag in den entsprechenden Ordner einlegt hat.

Berufungsverfahren bei Landessozialgericht in Essen

Am 03.04.2015 wurde eine Berufungsverhandlung beim LSG NRW verhandelt. Die Richter stellten auch einen gravierenden Rechtsverstoß in der Bescheidbearbeitung fest, was zu einer weiteren Nachzahlung von 338,80 € für die Zeit vom 01.01.2011-31.07.2011 führte, wollten aber keine Nachzahlung für das Jahr 2010 entscheiden.

Noch immer sind 580,80 € offen.

Und noch eine weitere Klagerunde

Nachdem weder das SG Dortmund noch das LSG NRW vollständig Abhilfe schaffen wollten, wurde ein drittes Mal in gleicher Sache der Rechtsweg über eine juristische Hintertür beschritten.



Am 01.07.2015 wurden zwei Überprüfungsanträge wegen der Ablehnungsbescheide vom 03.04.2012 & 16.04.2012 per Fax an je drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis (Fax: 02371 905-799; 905-848; 905-859) gesandt.

Um postalische Eingangsbestätigung der Überprüfungsanträge wurde ausdrücklich gebeten.

Am 03.08.2015, 31.08.2015, 05.10.2015, 28.10.2015, 30.11.2015 und 31.12.2015 erfolgten Erinnerungen. Zwei Faxe an jeweils drei Faxgeräte im Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis. - Ganz wie beim ersten Mal!

Siebenmal Sechs Fax-Anträge. Bei keinem der 42 Anträge erfolgte auch nur ein Bescheid. Nicht einmal eine Eingangsbestätigung. Aber diesmal ist jede einzelne Übersendung dokumentiert und das auch mit Bildvorschau und OK-Bestätigung.

Inzwischen ist eine weitere Untätigkeitsklage (Az.: S 14 AS 1515/16) anhängig und die Überprüfungsanträge sind aus der Akte verschwunden.

Wer nicht klagt, bekommt auch nichts - so die erschreckende Erfahrung vieler Leistungsberechtigter.

Die Statistik der BA „Widersprüche und Klagen SGB II - September 2017 listet 407 Jobcenter auf und weist für das Jobcenter Märkischer Kreis einen Bestand von 1714 anhängigen Klagen aus, das sind 10% bei 17.149 Bedarfsgemeinschaften (nur 41 Jobcenter verwalten mehr BG's; 50 Jobcenter haben mehr Klagen anhängig)

For more easy means to curb your daily spending, check out the video above.","Let's get this out of the way: No one gets excited about saving money. Nobody.

Spending money? That's a different story, especially when it comes to food, according to the people at Credit Canada and Capital One Canada.

Their informal study found when it came to financial guilty pleasures, eating out takes the cake. Over 70 per cent of respondents admitted to dining out and ordering takeout more than a few times a month.

""Show of hands. Who here would rather spend money rather than save it? Everybody? Yeah, I thought so.""

Sounds harmless on paper, unless that paper is your bank statement. A typical month of eating out can cost Canadians nearly $200.

Other guilty indulgences for Canadians include daily coffee purchases, online shopping, clothing shopping and beauty services. While there's nothing wrong with lattes or ordering a new espresso machine online, the danger lies in not seeing the money leaving your wallet.

""It's easier than ever to order in, hail a ride and shop online without ever opening your wallet, but you can lose sight of where your money is going if you're not careful,"" says Brent Reynolds, Capital One Canada' Chief Customer Experience Officer.

So it shouldn't come as a surprise why some financial planners urge consumers to use cash more often in conjunction with a budget to save. It may sound old-fashioned, but at least you'll know you've reached your limit when you physically have no more money.

A $6 matcha latte each day is the kind of purchase you'll want to reconsider if you're trying to curb your spending.

And if the idea of regular bank trips to withdraw money feels foreign, a tweak to your spending psyche might be a better place to start.

According to Utpal Dholakia, one of the four behaviours behind undisciplined spending is apathy towards paying unreasonable prices. For the Rice University professor, everyone has a range of what they think is an acceptable price for an item.

For him, he's comfortable paying anywhere from $3 to $8 for a sandwich. Anything below that window is a steal and anything above that price point gives him pause. By lowering your maximum price point for habitual purchases, your mind should subconsciously second-guess if $12 is really OK for avocado toast. (Spoiler alert: It's not).

In the essay, published on Tuesday in Lenny Letter, Carlson wrote, “this is not a partisan issue, it’s a cultural one.”

“Boorish behavior transcends ideology and political lines, despite the fact that there are many who seek to blame Democrats for Harvey Weinstein’s behavior or Republicans for Bill O’Reilly’s,” she continued. “It is not liberal to ask for a workplace where you are not fondled or groped. It’s not conservative to expect to meet with a man without having him dangle his hotel key or ask you to sit on his lap while he has an erection.”

Carlson, whose book on the issue of workplace harassment and assault was released last month, also wrote about the importance of turning outrage into action with bipartisan legislation.

“I’m working with both parties to craft a bipartisan bill to take the secrecy out of sexual-harassment cases where women in the workplace have been forced to sign mandatory arbitration clauses,” she wrote.

Since speaking out in June 2016 with allegations of sexual harassment against Roger Ailes (who died in May at the age of 77), Carlson has worked with Democrat Senators to testify against mandatory arbitration laws that force victims of workplace harassment or assault into closed-door settlements that very rarely go in favor of the victim, and that also force victims into silence. Carlson has been a vocal supporter of the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2017 that was introduced by Democrats back in March ― and she’s pushing to get Republicans to support the Act as well.

“How ironic would it be if the Arbitration Fairness Act ended up on President Trump’s desk?” she wrote.

Ultimately, Carlson emphasized the importance of women coming together ― regardless of political affiliation or professional industry ― to change the culture of pervasive sexual harassment and violence in this country.

“I’m proud my case last year helped chart a course for the brave women who are now standing up and speaking out,” she wrote.

BHOPAL -- In light of the horrific gang-rape of a 19-year-old girl, a city Superintendent of Police (CSP) and three Town Inspectors (SHOs in other states) have faced action. The inspectors who head MP Nagar, Habibganj and GRP police stations have been suspended. The CSP (DSP rank) has been removed and sent to the police headquarters.

Action was taken over the delay in registering an FIR, the harassment caused to the girl and her family. They were turned away from police stations, and despite the horrific crime, and the policemen didn't give a patient hearing to her, let alone registering case.

The actions were taken on directions from Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan

The girl was gangrape and later abandoned near the railway track in Bhopal.

Four men accosted the girl, who is pursuing graduation and preparing for civil services exam, when she was returning from her tuition classes. The accused cornered and overpowered her, took her to a desolate spot near the railway track, close to the Habibganj station, and raped her.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

The accused escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station.

The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Unter Wilderern gilt er als eine Legende: Seit seinem 16. Lebensjahr macht der Amerikaner Hossein Golabchi, kurz als ""Soudy"" bekannt, Jagd auf teils stark bedrohte Tiere.

Ein Foto, das im Jahr 2008 entstanden sein soll und nun veröffentlicht wurde, sorgt gerade für besonders viel Empörung unter Tierschützern. Denn auf dem Bild ist der aus dem Iran stammende Trophäenjäger zu sehen, wie er stolz mit einem toten Schneeleoparden über seinen Schultern posiert.

Auf dem Bild ist erkennbar, dass dem Tier offenbar mindestens zwei Mal in seine Hinterbeine geschossen wurde, bevor es letztlich seinen Verletzungen erlag. Das Tier soll er vor neun Jahren auf einer Jagd in Zentralasien erlegt haben. Die Jagd auf die bedrohte Wildkatzenart ist allerdings weltweit illegal. Trotzdem berichtete der Schütze schon 2008 stolz über das Erlegen des Raubtieres in seinem Buch “Obsessed!”.

Illegaler Handel auf dem Schwarzmarkt

Leider ist der Schneeleopard unter sogenannten Wilddieben ein beliebtes Ziel, mit dem illegale Händler auf dem Schwarzmarkt viel Geld verdienen. Um ein Zeichen gegen die Jagd des bedrohten Tieres zu setzen, startete die Umweltschutzorganisation TERA eine Petition gegen Golabchi. Bis jetzt fand sie bereits Unterstützung von über 100.000 Menschen.

Die Tierschutzaktivistin Amanda W. schreib dazu:

“Wir müssen bei diesem langjährigen und außerordentlich aktiven Trophäenjäger seltener Raubkatzen ein Exempel statuieren, sonst werden diese wundervollen Tiere für immer verschwinden. Ich habe diese Petition am Internationalen Tag des Schneeleoparden 2017 gestartet. Lasst uns alle zusammen arbeiten, damit dieser Mann bis zum Schneeleoparden-Tag 2018 zur Rechenschaft gezogen wird.”

Über 400 wilde Tiere

Wie viele Tiere Soudy in seiner Karriere insgesamt erlegt hat, ist unklar.

Allerdings stellt er laut ""Superslam"", einem Wettbewerb unter Wildjägern, die ihn 2003 mit einem Award ehrten, allein in seinem eigenen Museum 400 wilde Tiere 225 verschiedener Spezien aus.

TERA sieht den Trophäenjäger als ein Symbol der Wilddieberei, die mit ihren Errungenschaften Geld im Darknet verdienen. Daher ist ihr Ziel ihn als Beispiel vieler ins Gefängnis zu bringen. Obwohl das Erlegen des Wildtieres bereits vor einigen Jahren stattgefunden hat, würden Fälle der Wilddieberei nicht verjähren.

Obwohl sich Hossein Golabchi auf Anfrage vieler Medien zu dem Fall bisher nicht geäußert hat, gab TERA nun bekannt, dass er laut eigenen Angaben die Überreste des Leopards erst nach Deutschland gebracht und daraufhin nach Mexiko verschifft habe. Eine genaue detaillierte Stellungnahme werde momentan erwartet.

Vor dem Aussterben bedroht

Seit 1972 gilt der Schneeleopard als eine vor dem Aussterben bedrohte Tierart. Laut dem Naturschutzbund NABU gibt es in ganz Asien nur noch rund 4.000 frei lebende Schneeleoparden. Allein in Kirgistan sank die Zahl der Wildkatzen in 30 Jahren von 1.400 auf nur noch rund 300 Exemplare.

What do you say about a man who invalidates 86.4 percent of a country's currency overnight, and then keeps coming up with explanations over the next one year to tell the citizens that it was a success?

You don't need to be an economist to realize that if the bulk of currency in a country where transactions are largely carried out in cash (80 to 98 percent, depending on which estimate one takes), is suddenly invalidated, the results will largely be disastrous, a few benefits here and there, notwithstanding.

It has almost been a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a late evening broadcast to the nation, invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The idea was to attack black money and fake currency which were used to finance terrorism.

As the press release accompanying the demonetisation decision put it: ""Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time.""

Modi invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which he said were used to store black money, and then decided to introduce a Rs 2,000 note, making it even more easier for those who have black money, to store some of it, in the form of cash.

Let's look at a few points one by one.

1) The total value of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that were invalidated stood at Rs 15.44 lakh crore. On November 15, 2016, a week after Modi announced the demonetisation decision, the Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the government expected that around Rs 4-5 lakh crore of the invalidated notes won't make it back into the banking system.

The hope was that those who have black money in the form of cash will not deposit it in the banks because they would end up creating an audit trail. This would end up destroying black money. Of course, nothing of that sort happened.

Around 99 per cent of the invalidated currency made it back into banks. This basically meant that what was supposed to be an attack on black money became a big money laundering scheme.

2) Why did this happen? This happened primarily because no basic research was carried out to check if demonetisation could really attack black money. In May 2012, the ministry of finance had published a White Paper on black money. As per data offered in this White Paper, it can be calculated that on an average around 4.9 percent of the black money is held in the form of cash. A bulk of the black money is held in the form of real estate and gold. Hence, by attacking cash/currency, Modi ended up sending the entire country on a merry-go-round. This is what happens when you make a decision that goes against the data that is on offer.

3) In August 2014, Raghuram Rajan, the then governor of the Reserve Bank of India, whom the Modi government let go by not offering a second term, said: ""In the past, demonetisation has been thought of as a way of getting black money out of circulation. Because people then have to come and say 'how do I have this 10 crores in cash sitting in my safe and they have to explain where they got the money from. It is often cited as a solution. Unfortunately, my sense is, the clever find ways around it.""

Rajan further said: ""Black money hoarders find ways to divide their hoard into many smaller pieces...I think there are ways around demonetisation. It is not that easy to flush out the black money.""

Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This is precisely what happened. Those with black money found various ingenious ways to divide their black money into smaller amounts and exchange it. Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This was before any such proposal for demonetisation was on the table. As Rajan writes in his recently released book I Do What I Do: ""I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetization, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them, and felt there were potentially better alternatives to achieve the main goals. I made these views known in no uncertain terms.""

Of course, PM Modi decided not to listen to the best economist he had at his disposal.

4) No country in a reasonably good economic position has demonetised currency in the past, at the same level that India did. This is primarily because the economics of demonetisation is very complex. This was also overlooked. In short, there was enough evidence available which said that demonetisation as a tool to weed out black money, would not work.

5) Demonetisation was also supposed to ""to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN)."" Take a look at Table 1, which basically lists out the number of fake currency notes that were detected in the banking system.

Table 1: Denomination-wise Counterfeit Notes Detected in the Banking System

(April to March)

(Source: Annual report of the Reserve Bank of India)

The number of fake Rs 500 (old) and Rs 1,000 notes that were detected during the financial year stood at around 5.74 lakh. The total number of demonetised notes stood at around 2,400 crore. This basically means that as a proportion, the fake notes identified between April 2016 to March 2017 stands close to 0 percent of the demonetised notes.

Demonetisation failed to achieve its second big objective. In fact, if you look at Table 1 carefully, fake notes of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 hit the market, soon after demonetisation.

6) In a matter of few weeks it was clear that demonetisation would not achieve its two main objectives. Hence, a third objective was introduced. This was to move towards a cashless society through digital transactions.

As Modi said in the November 2016 edition of the Mann Ki Baat radio programme: ""The great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a 'Cashless Society'. It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible. But why should India not make a beginning in creating a 'less-cash society'? Once we embark on our journey to create a 'less-cash society', the goal of 'cashless society' will not remain very far.""

Indeed, a very noble motive, but at what cost?

How are things looking on this front? Let's first look at the total value of digital transactions. Data for total digital transactions is available up to August 2017 and has been adjusted for real time gross settlement, which can only be used for transactions of Rs 2 lakh or more. Take a look at Figure 1.

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

The total value of digital transactions in August 2017 was more or less similar to the total value of digital transactions before demonetisation. As Figure 1 tells us, digital transactions by value kept increasing between January and August 2016. After that they have gone up and down. This also reflects the overall slowdown of the economy post demonetisation.

How do things look, when it comes to volume of digital transactions? Take a look at Figure 2.

Figure 2:

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

While, there was a huge one time jump when it comes to the volume of digital transactions post demonetisation, things have remained flattish since then. The initial jump wasn't surprising given that there was barely any cash going around in the financial system. But that growth hasn't sustained.

Hence, the digital goal has not been achieved either. Such a fundamental behavioral change cannot be made overnight. People have to be nudged towards it and not forced, as was the case.

7) In the game of changing goal posts, an increase in the income tax base, has been highlighted as another benefit of demonetisation. The question is, has this increase translated into higher direct tax collections? For the period, April to September 2017, ""Net Direct Tax collections represent 39.4% of the total Budget Estimates of Direct Taxes"". For the same period last year, ""38.65% of the Budget Estimates of direct taxes for FY 2016-17 has been achieved.""

Yes, there has been a marginal improvement in direct tax collection. But this still does not justify the destructive effect that demonetisation had on the economy.

Another point made in the game of changing goal posts is that income tax notices have been sent to many people. So, what? People with black money have access to the best CAs and the best lawyers, and know how the system functions. They aren't exactly sitting there waiting to pay fines and hand over their money to the government.

Also, take a look at Table 2. This tells us very clearly, the limited processing capacity of the Income Tax department.

Table 2:

(Source: Annual Report, Ministry of Finance)

8) There is enough evidence going around by now to say that the informal part of the economy, which dealt in cash, received a huge blow, from which it is yet to come out. The tragedy is that much of this is not reflected in the GDP numbers, given that the GDP numbers tend to measure the formal part of the economy, and not the informal one.

Also, there is a huge contradiction here. The Modi government has been saying that self-employment is the way forward when it comes to jobs. If self-employment is the way forward, then the informal sector needs to be handled with care.

In fact, as former prime minister Manmohan Singh, put it in an interview to Bloomberg Quint: ""The value created by the informal sector will be captured in the form of income, wealth or consumption effects. Hence, we must be cautious about sweeping generalisations about the informal economy and passing moral judgments about the entire sector.""

9) One of the claimed successes of demonetisation has been that the cash to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has come down. In a speech made on October 4, 2017, Modi said: ""Demontisation के बाद Cash to GDP Ratio अब 9 प्रतिशत पर आ गया है। (after demonetisation, the cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent.""

This fall in cash to GDP ratio is being passed off as an achievement and the fact that nation as a whole has become more honest. As Modi said in the speech referred to earlier in the piece: ""भाइयों और बहनों, इस सरकार ने देश में संस्थागत ईमानदारी को मजबूत करने का काम किया है। ये सरकार के अथक परिश्रम का ही परिणाम है कि आज देश की अर्थव्यवस्था कम Cash के साथ चल रही है। (Brothers and sisters, this government has worked to strengthen the institutional honesty of the country. It is due to the tireless hard-work of this government that today the country's economy is running on less cash.)""

For the period of three months ending March 2017 and June 2017, the non-government part of the GDP (which forms around 90 per cent of the GDP) has grown by a little over 4 per cent. When growth in economic activity slows down, the growth in currency in circulation is bound to be impacted as well.

So, yes, the hard work of the government has led to a lower cash to GDP ratio, but at the cost of slowing down economic activity. Hence, claiming this as success, is more of trying to build a narrative around demonetisation being successful, rather than being an actual success of any sort.

10) Another point that is being made is that a lower cash to GDP ratio means that the country has become more honest. Take a look Figure 3. It basically plots the cash to GDP ratio of different countries.

Figure 3:

(Source: https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/curse_of_cash_data)

Japan has the highest cash to GDP ratio at 19.4 per cent. India is nearly half of that at around a little over 10 per cent. Is India a more honest nation than Japan? As per the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2016, Japan is the twentieth least corrupt country in the world. India stands at the 79th position, despite having a much lower cash to GDP ratio.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Or take the case of Brazil, which has a cash to GDP ratio of 3.31 per cent. Like India, it is the 79th least corrupt country in the world. Then there is the Eurozone (country's which basically use euro as their currency). Their cash to GDP ratio is higher than that of India. Is the Eurozone more corrupt than India?

Hence, the link between a low cash to GDP ratio and low corruption is basically very weak. It is basically something that the Modi government has invented in order to build a positive narrative around demonetisation.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Around 18 months ago I travelled back to the UK to surprise my father for his 70th birthday party. It was an absolutely magical moment as I shuffled towards the front door with a cardboard box in front of my face and yelled ""SURPRISE!"".

My dad was delighted, my brother and sister were delighted, and so was my mum. Even though she and Dad have been divorced for 17 years -- more than half my life -- she was the one who drove me to the party.

We are a loving, supportive family, but we are not a conventional family. My mum came out when I was 14. In a dimly lit room, she quietly told me that the woman we knew as a close friend was someone she had embarked on a relationship with.

My parents lived together (in separate rooms) for a further two years, something that I now see for the huge sacrifice it was: living in the same house to provide stability and consistency for their teenage children.

When my mum moved out of the home that my brother, my sister and I grew up in, she moved five minutes around the corner so we could walk between each parent's house and sleep at whichever house we wanted to. No complicated custody agreements, just whatever my siblings and I wanted to do. When my dad made us 'curry' during his experimental cooking phase, we ate it even though pineapple, chicken, curry sauce and peas are not necessarily an appetising combination. We ate it because he tried.

If my mum knew Dad was at work, she would come over -- take the back-door key from its 'secret' hiding spot -- wash and dry his curtains and re-hang them before he got home. Not because my dad was lazy, he simply didn't notice when the curtains were dirty, and Mum wanted the house to be nice for all of us.

Dad never said a bad word about Mum, and Mum never said a bad word about Dad. They had each other's backs. We spent every birthday and Christmas together, sometimes with my parent's new partners. And now they both have long-term partners or companions who we have known for years -- it's almost like having a mum, a dad and then two more mums.

That's not to say it was never sad or hard to accept that they had separated. It doesn't mean that we never argued with our parents, or had teenage tantrums or that Mum and Dad were perfect. We all f****d up in different ways, but the one consistency was love.

My family has helped me understand that marriage is simply allowing two people who are in love to have that love recognised by law. Conflating family and marriage does a disservice to both.

Having an unconventional family has not harmed me or my brother or sister. We have all gone on to be successful and happy in our chosen fields. We did this with our 21st Century, decidedly non-nuclear family. We did it because our parents backed us, and loved us, and told us if we worked hard we could be what we wanted in life.

So we did. And we are. My family is not about the specific sum of its parts, the number of men or women who play the role of parents, it's about how capable each member of the family is to love and support one another, unconditionally.

It's about parents answering phone calls at 1am when their kids are in a foreign country and stressed out about work. It's about writing 12 cards to be opened on each of the 12 days of Christmas when a daughter lives overseas or taking a six-hour round trip to drive and pick up a child from the airport.

Once, four or five years ago, the five of us had dinner at Dad's house. Mum mentioned that someone had asked her when she would be getting some grandchildren, and she had warned them never to say that in front of my brother or sister or me. We thanked her and Dad for never pressuring us to be -- or do -- anything other than what made us happy. Dad looked taken aback. ""Of course! Our job is just to support you and help you be happy,"" he said. I won't ever forget that.

The truth is that my parents were, and are, better as friends. They should be allowed to love and marry who they want. That should be the case for everyone, including here in Australia. Because loving who they wanted enabled them to be better parents, better and happier people and made our family vastly richer in love and understanding.

It has made my siblings and I better people, more capable of being better members of our communities.

Es ist die Kehrseite einer gesellschaftlich notwendigen Diskussion darüber, wie Christen und Muslime zusammenleben wollen

Einige Muslime haben darauf ziemlich coole Antworten gefunden

Muslim zu sein, das kann gerade keinen Spaß machen. Neben ein bisschen sachlicher Auseinandersetzung gibt's vor allem Vorurteile und Gepöbel. Im Netz, auf der Straße, überall.

Wie schön, dass sich viele Muslime ihren Humor bewahrt haben. Eine kleine Sammlung der lustigen, sarkastischsten, besten oder anrührendesten Antworten von Muslimen auf die täglichen Zumutungen:

1. Bad Hair Day

Klar, mit einem Kopftuch lässt sich ein Bad-Hair-Day schon mal eher rumbringen als ohne. Aber eine Dauerlösung ist das nicht.

Der US-Biologiestudentin Heraa Hasmi wurde das Gefrotzel jedenfalls zu blöd. Als eine junge Frau twitterte: ""Kopftuchträgerinnen haben es gut, sie müssen sich nicht Haare waschen"", schrieb sie:

""Menschen haben es so gut, sie müssen nicht duschen, seit sie Kleidung tragen.""

2. Sorry, keine Zeit für Dschihad

Kurz nach Weihnachten 2015 soll der Chef der IS-Terrormiliz Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alle Muslime dazu aufgerufen haben, sich dem Kampf anzuschließen. Der Autor und Menschenrechtsaktivist Iyad El-Baghdadi – er schreibt vorsichtshalber in seinem Twitter-Profil, dass er also nicht der Baghadadi sei – hat die Info verbreitet. Seine Follower wussten die offenbar ironisch gemeinte Vorlage zu schätzen.

Und antworteten, warum sie, leider, leider, auf keinen Fall kämpfen könnten: ""Ich muss meinen Goldfisch noch zum Tierarzt bringen.""

3. Danke, Mr. Trump

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Und da hatte sich Hend Amry, einen bekannte muslimische Bloggerin, vernehmen lassen: ""Can I get an Allahu Akbar"".

CAN I GET AN ALLAHU AKBAR https://t.co/mSM0VTb3YY — Hend Amry (@LibyaLiberty) 26. Juli 2017

Heißt so viel wie: Danke, Mr. Trump. Sie haben soeben gesagt, dass wir unseren Gott, Allah, anbeten dürfen.

Der Tweet hat inzwischen mehr als 102.000 Likes und wurde 38.000 Mal geteilt.

4. Die arme, unterdrückte Muslima

Muslimische Frauen sind brav, folgsam und räumen den ganzen Tag Männern und der Kinderschar hinterher. Soweit das Klischee.

Als eine Twitter-Nutzerin fragte, vor was denn die Follower am meisten Angst in der Ehe hätten, schrieb die Kopftuch tragende Gül trocken: ""Müde nach Hause zu kommen und zu sehen, dass mein Mann das Abendessen noch nicht gekocht hat.""

5. Homosexuell? Na klar!

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Aznahn Munas ist laut Medienberichten selbst Muslim, stammt aus Pakistan und hat in Australien eine Firma mitgegründet, die Tücher für Frauen verkauft: Halstücher, Kopftücher.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

I was at the gym praying in the yoga room and 3 ladies started following my motions.That's my story on how I accidentally led a yoga class. — Hamzah (@Hamzah_AlS) 14. August 2013

7. Message an den IS

Nach jedem Terroranschlag fordert jemand, Muslime müssten mehr gegen den Terror tun. Eine Forderung, über die man sicher diskutieren muss.

Nur sind viele Muslime genervt - denn so einfach ist die ganze Sache eben auch nicht.

8. Christen ohne Fehl und Tadel

Der bekannte US-Anwalt und Aktivist Qasim Rashid war sauer. ""Ein weißer Übermensch hat mir geschrieben, der Islam sei gewalttätig und höhnte, ich solle ihm eine christliche Version des IS zeigen.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Und das ist erst der Anfang der Aufzählung.

Die 17-jährige Lamyaa aus dem US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania veröffentlichte im Frühjahr 2017 eine Konversation mit ihrem Vater in Saudi-Arabien.

Denn ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"" und ""Die Welt"" lehnen das Verteufeln von Steueroasen ab

Für Steuergewerkschafts-Chef Thomas Eigenthaler ist diese Argumentation ""absurd""

Für den Durchschnittsdeutschen liegen die Steueroasen in weiter Ferne. Das liegt weniger daran, dass Reisen in die Steuerparadiese der Südsee vergleichsweise teuer sind. Vielmehr mangelt es ihnen am Vermögen, um die zahlreichen Schlupflöcher skrupellos auszunutzen.

Erst ab einem bestimmten Steuerbetrag rechnet sich der Aufwand, und damit zugleich der Ertrag, um Geld am deutschen Fiskus vorbeizuschleusen.

Doch diese augenscheinliche Ungleichheit ist für Olaf Gersemann, ""Die Welt""-Ressortleiter für Wirtschaft und Finanzen, und Peter A. Fischer, Leiter der Wirtschaftsredaktion der ""Neuen Zürcher Zeitung"" (""NZZ""), kein Problem.

Denn beide verteidigen in ihren Kommentaren die Steueroasen.

""Simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur""

So schreibt Fischer in seinem Beitrag für die NZZ, indem die investigativen Journalisten einige Fälle vermuteten Missbrauchs publikumswirksam herauspicken, würden sie versuchen, alle Offshore-Geschäfte zu verteufeln. Doch diese haben ""in einer immer globaleren Welt nicht nur ihre Berechtigung, sondern sind oft sogar zwingend.""

Der Wirtschaftsjournalist betont, Offshore-Transaktionen seien meistens entweder ""simpler Ausdruck der globalen Natur eines Geschäfts"" oder Resultat von tatsächlichen Unzulänglichkeiten und Missständen in den betroffenen Ländern.

Für letzteres nennt Fischer ein Beispiel: die aus seiner Sicht ""prohibitiv scharfe"" Besteuerung von Unternehmensgewinnen in den USA.

Deshalb dürfe man Steueroasen nicht grundsätzlich verteufeln - wie es weltweit Medien machen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf

Übergriffige Kassenwarte

Gersemann von der ""Welt"" sieht das ähnlich. Hinter den Offshore-Geschäften gebe es keine Doppelmoral - und ""eine pauschale Vorverurteilung aller Offshoreaktivitäten ist durch nichts gerechtfertigt.""

Seine Argumentation: ""Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe"", behauptet er in seinem Kommentar.

Gerade angesichts einer immer weiter alternden Gesellschaft würden die Finanzminister laut Gersemann zunehmend ""internationale Kartelle mit Mindeststeuersätzen bilden, denen niemand entrinnen kann"".

Deshalb würden Steueroasen dazu dienen, ""auf Dauer zu verhindern, dass die Kassenwarte allzu übergriffig werden."" Die Steuerverstecke würden Schutz bieten – vor der ""Gier der Finanzminister"".

""Zeugt von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung""

Thomas Eigenthaler, Vorsitzender der Steuergewerkschaft, hält diese Argumentation für ""absurd"". ""Wenn wir alles machen, was nicht verboten ist, um auf egoistische Weise einen persönlichen Vorteil zu erreichen, dann kann ein Gemeinwesen nicht funktionieren"", betont er im Gespräch mit der HuffPost.

Denn wenn man Leistungen des Staates abrufe, dann sei es ihm zufolge es unmoralisch, wenn man sich nicht am Staatswesen beteilige. Zudem ist es demokratisch beschlossen, dass die Wohlhabenderen mehr schultern und nach unseren Gesetzen einen höheren Steuersatz zahlen als die niedriger Verdienenden.

Wenn man sich allerdings den Steuerpflichte entziehe, sei das ein ""billiges und arrogantes Vorgehen"", dass ""von einer gewissen Staatsverachtung zeugt"", unterstreicht Eigenthaler.

Testifying before Parliament's public enterprises portfolio committee, former Eskom CEO Tshediso Matona – who was appointed in October 2014 -- said he took over a utility that was ""in serious dire straits"".

It was battling to balance its books and its revenues were under pressure, mainly the result of rising levels of municipal debt. But the ""burning platform"" he found himself on was its operational problems.

Matona said he was told that in 2010, at the time of the Soccer World Cup, a decision had been taken to defer power station maintenance. This had happened again at the elections.

""A culture had set in of deferring maintenance... By the time I got there, the units were packing up one after another.""

Matona served as CEO for only five months, before being suspended by the Eskom board in March 2015.

He said his removal ""was without any basis whatsoever"", and had come as a complete shock.

On the diesel that Eskom had been forced to buy to drive its peak-supply generators at the time of the load shedding, he suggested that the emergency procedures invoked at the time had allowed the utility ""to deviate from what normal procurement would be"".

He said this this had created a ""major risk"" when it came to who was awarded the contract.

His testimony before the inquiry included details of ""serious in-fighting"" among members of the Eskom Board over procurement matters.

""There were significant tensions... you could call it turmoil,"" he said, describing what he found at the utility when he took over.

Antizyklische Kaufgewohnheiten sorgen nicht nur bei Bikinis und anderen Saisonprodukten, sondern auch bei Autos für echte Schnäppchen. Wer sich zum Beispiel den Sommerluxus eines Cabrios bereits im Winter gönnt, kann in der Regel nicht direkt „oben ohne“ spazieren fahren, dafür aber massiv sparen. Welche anderen Preissenker sich in den saisonalen Gepflogenheiten des Automarktes verbergen und wann die Zeit zum Kauf reif ist, zeigen wir dir gemeinsam mit der Allianz.

Sparfüchse nutzen saisonale Effekte

Der Preis für die vorausschauendsten Käufer geht auch in diesem Jahr wieder an alle, die ihre Weihnachtsgeschenke bereits im Juni und die Badehose im September in den Einkaufswagen legen. Für jeden, der da Kaufabsichten hegt, sollten sie ein Vorbild sein, diese Götter des Preisolymps. Denn in ihren Geldbeuteln sammeln sich übers Jahr zahlreiche Extrascheine. Auch auf den Automarkt lässt sich ihre Philosophie übertragen und Interessenten können die Jahreszeiten für sich nutzen. Das wird sicher jeder bestätigen, der mit dem Fall der ersten Schneeflocke noch versucht hat, günstige Winterreifen aufzutreiben. Für die Suche nach dem perfekten Gebrauchtwagen zum bestmöglichen Preis gilt die Faustregel: Im Herbst stehen in der Regel die Händler auf der Gewinnerseite, im Frühjahr die Käufer.

Dies gilt vor allem für Kleinwagen und ältere Fahrzeuge, die vorausschauend eher im Frühjahr oder Sommer erworben werden sollten. Spätestens in den Wintermonaten erreichen diese Preise ihr Höchstniveau. Natürlich geht nichts über eine umfassende Beobachtung der aktuellen Marktsituation und individueller Angebote. Doch Interessenten können mit antizyklischen Käufen echte Schnäppchen erzielen. Wer im Sommer auf die Idee kommt, sich ein Cabrio oder ein klassisches Urlaubsauto à la VW-Bus anzuschaffen, zahlt in der Regel kräftig drauf. Allein typisch sommerliche Ausstattungsmerkmale wie Klimaanlagen stehen mit den ersten Sonnenstrahlen hoch im Kurs und sorgen für Preisanstiege. Autohändler verzeichnen für Neuwagen im Frühjahr und Herbst meist eine hohe Nachfrage. Dies hängt nicht zuletzt damit zusammen, dass in diesen Jahreszeiten am meisten neue Modelle erscheinen und so gewähren sie nur wenige Rabatte.

Schmuddelwetter für Schnäppchenjäger

Die üblichen Gesetze von Angebot und Nachfrage machen also nicht an der Autotür Halt. Bleiben wir beim Traum des Frischluft-Flitzers und dem Motto „Kaufen, wenn es keiner braucht“: Auf der Suche nach einem Cabrio stehen die Chancen für ein Schnäppchen am besten, wenn das Wetter eher nach Übergangsjacke als nach einem offenen Verdeck verlangt. Sobald draußen die Blätter braun werden, sinken die Preise, allerdings auch das Angebot. Die Vergünstigungen sind dem einfachen Umstand zu verdanken, dass die Händler zum Ende des Jahres nicht auf ihren Sommerautos sitzen bleiben wollen. Für jedes Fahrzeug fallen Kosten an und so zeigen sie sich wetterfühlig bestrebt, die Bestände auszudünnen. Anders als im florierenden Frühjahr bieten sie zum Teil ein Viertel Nachlass, auch auf Bestseller.

Im Winter können Autohändler im Allgemeinen deutlich weniger Autos veräußern und versuchen, den Verkauf mit Rabatten anzukurbeln. Besonders der Dezember gilt als typischer Käufer-Monat, da die Händler sich vor den Feiertagen einiger Standkosten entledigen wollen. Das gleiche Preis-Schicksal ereilt Oldtimer und urlaubstaugliche Wagen, die vor allem bei gutem Wetter Hochkonjunktur haben. Wird es draußen wärmer, steigen die Preise für Campingträume und heiß geliebte Klassiker. Bei Händlern ist die Rabattschlacht von Hersteller zu Hersteller unterschiedlich, Gebrauchtwagen sind von Schwankungen im Allgemeinen etwas weniger stark betroffen als Neuwagen. Ob du allerdings einen neuen Flitzer oder Gebrauchtwagen erwirbst – mit dem Kauf wird eine passende Kfz-Versicherung zum wichtigsten Anliegen.

Unabhängig von der Jahreszeit vergleichen

Obwohl die Jahreszeiten Einfluss auf die Preise für dein neues Traummobil nehmen können, führt kein Weg an vorausschauenden Vergleichen vorbei. Selbst wenn die Logik des Marktes nicht gerade dazu einlädt, ein allradbetriebenes Auto im Herbst oder das klimatisierte Freiluft-Vehikel im Sommer zu kaufen, halten sich Schnäppchen nicht nur an saisonale Bedingungen. Nimmt zum Beispiel der Absatz einer bestimmten Marke oder eines Modells ab, werden Preisnachlässe verstärkt. Kommt ein Nachfolgemodell auf den Markt, sinken die Preise für junge Gebrauchte und Jahreswagen. Autohändler brauchen mehr Platz für „die neuen“ und machen die Vorgängermodelle durch Rabatte zum Schnäppchen. Weil die Preise im Allgemeinen auch regional schwanken, kann sowohl bei Gebraucht- als auch Neuwagen der Blick über die eigenen Stadtgrenzen hinaus helfen. Letztlich ist es eine genaue Recherche, die zum Wagenglück verhilft.

On Thursday, Jackson seemed open to lifting Manafort's house arrest but skeptical of removing his electronic monitoring.","WASHINGTON ― Attorneys for former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told a federal judge on Saturday that he's not ""akin to a 68-year-old 'Jason Bourne' character"" despite his possession of three passports.

Manafort is set to appear in court again on Monday morning for a hearing on the conditions of his release following his arrest last week on 12 federal counts, including conspiracy and money laundering. He and his business associate Rick Gates have pleaded not guilty to the charges brought forward by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.

U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Manafort's second court hearing on Thursday that she was concerned that he posed a flight risk. In a court filing on Saturday, Manafort's lawyers assured the judge that the reason he had three passports was ""mundane"": He has a primary passport, a second passport to submit with visa applications to certain foreign countries, and a third that he applied for after he lost his primary passport, which he later found.

Manafort's ""frequent flyer status,"" lawyer Kevin Downing wrote, ""should not be over-emphasised to show a potential risk of flight when a person's job requires extensive travel."" He said that Manafort was just a ""successful domestic and international political consultant"" who ""travelled frequently and represented businessmen, political parties, and commercial interests around the world,"" activities that were ""completely"" legal.

""It would be odd, indeed, if he did not frequently travel, both domestically and abroad, given his clientele and the nature of his business,"" Downing wrote.

He also noted that Manafort has been married for almost 40 years and has two daughters and two grandchildren in the U.S. He said that his client's primary assets are also in the United States.

One of the charges that Manafort is facing relates to his alleged failure to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires lobbyists to disclose when they're working on behalf of a foreign principal. Downing, not incorrectly, said that particular charge was ""rarely pursued (or successfully prosecuted) in a criminal case.""

Manafort is currently on house arrest under electronic monitoring and a $10 million unsecured bond. He's seeking less onerous conditions of release. To guarantee his future court appearances, his attorney said Manafort would be willing to pledge a $3 million Trump Tower apartment in New York City, another $3.5 million home in New York, a $1.5 million home in Palm Beach, Florida, and a ""combination of life insurance policies held in trust and/or in his or his wife's name"" and valued at approximately $4.5 million ― for a total of more than $12 million.

Although Manafort has not yet reached an agreement with prosecutors over the conditions of his release, his lawyers wrote that he would agree to limit his travel to Florida, Virginia, New York and Washington, D.C. Prosecutors with Mueller's office are expected to file their response to the Manafort filing on Sunday.

Nicolas Mesly, reporter et photographe

Hugo Jolion-David, journaliste vidéo



« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

The commercial, posted on Nov. 2 on Coca-Cola Middle East’s YouTube page, shows a dad handing his daughter the keys to his car, and then sitting in the passenger seat as she makes several attempts to drive, starting and stopping hesitantly. But once she has a sip of Coke, she peels off down the road with confidence. “Change has a taste,” the ad concludes.

As of Monday, the video had garnered over 60,000 views.

The ad comes five weeks after the conservative Muslim kingdom announced plans to lift its ban on women driving, which will come into effect next June.

Under Saudi law, women still cannot mix freely with men, obtain a passport or leave the country without a male guardian’s permission. They also have to wear an abaya that covers their bodies down to their feet, among other rules.

“Coca-Cola is continuing its legacy of celebrating positive social and cultural change in its advertising campaigns by releasing a topical and timely ad in the Middle East,” Omar Bennis, public affairs director at Coca-Cola Middle East, told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “The campaign touches on the brand’s values surrounding diversity and inclusion and aligns with Coca-Cola’s commitment to enable the economic empowerment of women.”

The ad will run in Saudi Arabia but not in the United States, company representatives told HuffPost.

Wälder sind für ihn nicht nur „Holzfabriken und Rohstofflager"", sondern auch Lebensräume für viele Tier- und Pflanzenarten, die miteinander verwoben und voneinander abhängig sind. Immer, wenn sie sich artgerecht entfalten können, bieten sie Schutz und Erholung. Mit seinem Engagement setzt er ein hoffnungsvolles Zeichen für die Zukunft, dass das geheime Leben der Wälder und der Bäume weiterhin stattfindet und auch unsere Nachfahren noch staunend zwischen den Bäumen spazieren können.

Der Aufenthalt in der Natur verbessert die Stimmung und entlastet die Atemwege. Deshalb ist es wichtig, in die Stadtbebauung mehr Grün zu integrieren - das beeinflusst positiv Herzschlag und das vegetative Nervensystem. „Es geht dabei nicht um Sauerstoff, sondern offensichtlich um einen Reiz, der unser vegetatives Nervensystem runterfahren lässt"", sagt Peter Falkei, Direktor der Klinik und Poliklinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie am Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in München. Wenn man durch einen Wald geht, werden die neuronalen Netze „heruntergefahren"". Er vermutet, dass dies mit einem Gefühl von Geborgenheit zu tun hat, einem Schutz vor Lärm und Stress. Auch regenerieren sich Hirnareale, die zuständig für Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration sind, während eines Spaziergangs, der uns hilft, wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu kommen in der Schräglage der Welt.

Städte machen nervöser und lassen Menschen schlechter schlafen. Auch Lichtverschmutzung ist ein enormes Gesundheitsrisiko. Im Gehirn kommen die beiden Schaltstellen Mandelkern und Cingulum ins Spiel: Der Mandelkern reagiert auf Dinge, die er nicht kennt und nicht verorten kann; das Cingulum macht den Relevanzcheck: Ist etwas wichtig für die eigene Person oder nicht? Aktuelle Studien belegen, dass beide bei Menschen, die in Städten mit mehr als 100.000 Einwohnern aufwachsen, aktiver sind, was zu einer Grundunruhe der Städter führt, „einer Art unproduktiven Aufmerksamkeit"" (Falkei). Meistens sind Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen auf private Stressfaktoren und berufliche Probleme zurückzuführen.

Viele Menschen greifen dann auf Antidepressiva zurück. Laut Depressionsatlas der deutschen Techniker Krankenkasse hat sich zwischen 2000 und 2013 die verschriebene Tagesmenge an Antidepressiva verdreifacht. 2015 zahlten die gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen dafür rund 750 Millionen Euro an die Pharmaindustrie.

Statt auf Medikamente zu setzen verordnen Ärzte in Japan ihren Patienten Waldtherapien, denn bewusstes Gehen durch den Wald ist gesundheitsfördernd. Inzwischen hat der Trend auch Deutschland erreicht. Auf Usedom darf sich seit September 2017 ein Wald „Kur- und Heilwald"" nennen.

Für 94 Prozent der erwachsenen Deutschen gehören die Natur und insbesondere der Wald zu einem guten Leben. Das ist das Ergebnis einer Studie des Bundesamtes für Naturschutz (BfN) zum Naturbewusstsein der Deutschen, die 2016 erschien. Die Nähe zur Natur ist mit einer größeren Lebenszufriedenheit verbunden.

Bäume haben bis heute nur deshalb überlebt, weil sie eine enorme (Widerstands-)Kraft bzw. Resilienz und genetische Vielfalt innerhalb einer Art aufweisen. „Fest und stark ist nur der Baum, der unablässig Winden ausgesetzt war, denn im Kampf festigen und verstärken sich seine Wurzeln"", schrieb schon der römische Philosoph Seneca. Wo sich Bäume wieder erneuern, erleben sich auch die Menschen als selbst regulierendes Prinzip. Bäume, die bis heute einzigartig sind, dienten den Menschen als Heiligtum, als Nahrungs- und Inspirationsquelle. Prominente Baumliebhaber waren Goethe, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Bismarck, Hermann Hesse, Kurt Tucholsky, Winston Churchill, Ruth Maria Kubitschek oder Michael Gorbatschow.

Der Wald hat heute neben der Holzproduktion seine größte Bedeutung im Klimaschutz - nämlich die (über)lebensnotwendige CO2-Sequestrierung. Deshalb muss eine nachhaltige Optimierung zwischen der Holzproduktion und der Klimawirkung gesucht werden. Viele große private Waldbesitzer in Deutschland haben (häufig im Gegensatz zu den Staatsforsten) seit langem einen hohen Holzvorrat im Wald angestrebt. Damit verbunden ist die Befolgung einer dynamischen Nachhaltigkeitsregel (Holz + CO2-Sequestrierung). In absehbarer Zukunft muss viel weniger Holz geschlagen werden, denn für den Klimaschutz ist es zwingend, die Biomasse im Wald mindestens bis ins Jahr 2150 so hoch wie möglich anwachsen zu lassen.

Der Begriff Nachhaltigkeit kommt aus der Forstwirtschaft und bezeichnet die Nutzung eines regenerierbaren Systems, so dass es in seinen wesentlichen Eigenschaften erhalten bleibt und sich auf natürliche Weise erneuern kann. Der US-amerikanische Songwriter, Country- und Folk-Sänger Songwriter John Denver gründete die Organisation „Plant It 2000"" zur Wiederaufforstung hunderttausender Bäume, der Unternehmer und Umweltaktivist Douglas Tompkins, Gründer und ehemaliger Chef der Textilmarken The North Face und Esprit Holdings Limited, kaufte ein großes Gebiet in Argentinien und Chile auf, um Nationalparks zu schaffen. Und der ehemalige Chefdirigent der Berliner Philharmoniker Claudio Abbado ermöglichte mit zwei Konzerthonoraren die Anpflanzung von 90.000 Bäumen in seiner Heimatstadt Mailand.

In seinem Privatgarten am Landsitz Highgrove spricht Prinz Charles regelmäßig mit seinen Bäumen und behandelt sie fast wie Persönlichkeiten. Zudem setzt er sich seit Jahrzehnten mit seinen Stiftungen für Naturschutz und Artenvielfalt ein.

Als der Reformator Martin Luther im April 1539 in seinem Garten die Bäume betrachtete, sprach er: „Gelobt sei Gott, der Schöpfer, der aus toten verstorbenen Kreaturen im Lenz alles wieder lebendig macht!"" Er liebte Bäume aber nicht nur wegen ihrer Erhabenheit und Schönheit, sondern auch wegen ihres nachhaltigen Nutzens. Sein berühmter Satz „Wenn ich wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, würde ich heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen."", lässt sich zwar nicht belegbar nachweisen, weil der erste schriftliche Nachweis erst in einem Rundbrief der hessischen Kirche aus dem Jahre 1944 zu finden ist - dennoch wäre diese Aussage sicher in seinem Sinne gewesen.

Ein immerwährender Neuanfang.

Die deutsche wie die internationale Presse reagiert mit Empörung auf die Enthüllungen

Die Paradise Papers sorgen für Empörung auf der ganzen Welt. Großkonzerne, Promis, Superreiche – die Enthüllungen belegen ausführlich, dass weltweit Unternehmen und Privatpersonen bei der Steuer tricksen.

“Skrupellose Eliten vermeiden ihre gerechte Besteuerung, während Otto-Normal-Verbraucher zuhause Straßen, Schulen und Sozialausgaben finanziert”, bringt es Birgit Marshall für die “Rheinische Post” auf den Punkt.

Klar ist: Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Gabriel Zucman verliert allein die Bundesrepublik jedes Jahr 17 Milliarden Euro an Einnahmen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Paradise Papers"": Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten

Politik in Bedrängnis

""Spiegel""-Journalist Jakob Augstein findet in seinem Kommentar harte Worte für den laxen Umgang der Bundesrepublik mit den superreichen Steuersündern. ""Das System ist zutiefst krank"", schreibt er. Und die Wut darauf wachse. ""Sie sucht sich nur die falschen Ziele. Der Hass der Betrogenen gilt eher dem Kriegs- als dem Steuerflüchtling"", bemerkt Augstein. Und ergänzt: ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.""

Auch die internationale Presse sieht die Politik in der Bringschuld, die Steueroasen durch härteres Vorgehen zu zerschlagen. “Um dieser Situation ein Ende zu bereiten, sollte man jene beiden Kräfte zerstören, die sie aufrechterhalten”, schreibt die französische Zeitung “Le Monde”: ""Die grenzenlose Gier einiger weniger und die Untätigkeit der Staaten.” Letzteres sei dabei nicht unbedingt einfacher anzugehen, als Ersteres.

Denn dass Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen sich Steuerparadiese wie den Kaiman Inseln, Malta, oder Bermuda bedienen, um Geld zu horten, ist spätestens seit den “Panama Papers” bekannt. Passiert ist jedoch nicht viel, um die Steuertrickser zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Marshall von der “Rheinischen Post” glaubt, dass die “unerträgliche Schieflage” gefährliche Stimmungen verschärfen könne: “Gerade demokratisch gewählte Regierungen verlieren Glaubwürdigkeit, wenn es ihnen weiterhin nicht gelingt, die Reichsten ausreichend zu besteuern”, kommentiert sie.

Mehr noch: Ranghohe Politiker wie US-Handelsminister Wilbur Ross sind selbst in die Enthüllungen verwickelt.

""Bild""-Zeitung: Auch der kleine Mann trickst bei der Steuer

Der einzige Trost sei, dass die Digitalisierung für mehr Transparenz sorgen werde, weil Dateien gehackt werden können, folgert die belgische Zeitung “De Tijd”. “Jedes neue Leck stellt die steuerliche Doppelmoral bloß.”

Olaf Gersemann von der “Welt” ist da anderer Meinung. Er sieht in den Offshore-Geschäften keine Doppelmoral. “Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe”, behauptet er in einem Kommentar.

Die “Bild”-Zeitung argumentiert sogar, auch der “kleine Mann” würde gerne mal bei der Steuer tricksen. Mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro gingen in Deutschland jedes Jahr durch alltäglichen Steuerschummel verloren, heißt es in dem Bericht.

„Dahinter stecken häufig dieselbe Gier, dieselben egoistischen Motive, einfach sparen zu wollen“, zitiert die “Bild” den Chef der Deutschen Steuergewerkschaft, Thomas Eigenthaler. Der Steuerexperte vermutet, dass viele Leute für sich beschließen: “Wenn die da oben sich das erlauben, dann erlaube ich mir das auch.“

Enthüllungen wie die Paradise Papers könnten dieses Gefühl noch verstärken.

Wieso sind Steueroasen schlecht?

Aber darf man Steueroasen grundsätzlich verteufeln? Die “Neue Zürcher Zeitung” springt jedenfalls für sie in die Bresche: “Offshore-Geschäfte gehören zu einer globalen Welt. Manchmal sind sie notwendig und manchmal Ausdruck von Missständen, kaum je aber deren Ursache”, heißt es.

Den internationalen Steuerwettbewerb anhand einiger missbräuchlicher Beispiele generell als kriminell hinzustellen, sei deshalb fahrlässig.

Die Londoner “Times” meint Offshore-Zentren hätten zwar prinzipiell eine legitime Rolle, würden sie doch “Besitztümer vor dem Zugriff durch Schurkenstaaten schützen.” Meistens, so räumt die britische Zeitung ein, wären sie jedoch dazu da, um Superreichen zu helfen.

""The ANCYL advises Ramaphosa to desist from using such divisive language of 'winning' teams in the ANC.

In the ANC there are no winning teams.","The African National Congress Youth League has strongly criticised deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa after his announcement of his running mate ahead of the party's December elective conference.

In a statement, the ANCYL said Ramaphosa's pronouncement of a winning team exposed his lack of respect for organisational processes and procedures.

""That kind of behaviour undermines the current process of the ANC Branch General Meeting (BGM) where members are nominating their preferred candidates using guiding documents like 'Through the eye of the needle',"" its national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said.

Mkhize said Ramaphosa's pronouncement of a ""winning"" team demonstrates his hunger to lead at all costs, even to the disunity of the party.

""The ANCYL advises Ramaphosa to desist from using such divisive language of 'winning' teams in the ANC. The people that he mentioned as his 'winning' team must also distance themselves from such a divisive title. In the ANC there are no winning teams. The ANC is a unitary organisation and the winner remains the ANC,"" he added.

Ramaphosa announced his slate on Sunday during a rally in Ga-Sekhukhune, Limpopo.

He expressed his support for Naledi Pandor as his deputy, current ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe as National Chairperson, former KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Senzo Mchunu as secretary general and Gauteng chairperson Paul Mashatile as the party's treasurer general.

While Mantashe, Mchunu and Mashatile are seen as bringing support from their respective provinces, Pandor is regarded as bringing on the ticket a scandal free record in government, which Ramaphosa is hoping will stand him in good stead if he wins the elective conference and then have to face an increasing ANC hostile electorate in the 2019 elections.

Until now, Pandor's name has not appeared on any of the CR17 campaign top six.

No obstante, cuando es difícil parar esos hábitos e interfieren en la vida diaria, se pueden convertir en trastornos del comportamiento.
""No tratamos el hábito directamente para que la persona no tenga que aprender una respuesta contraria que lo reemplace"".","¿Te estás toqueteando el pelo o mordiendo las uñas sin darte cuenta mientras lees este artículo? Una investigación de la Universidad de Montreal, en Canadá, sugiere que los comportamientos compulsivos de este tipo dicen mucho más sobre tu personalidad de lo que crees.

Las personas que suelen ser impacientes o que se aburren y se frustran con facilidad tienen más probabilidades de llevar a cabo comportamientos repetitivos en relación con el cuerpo, tales como rascarse, morderse las uñas o arrancarse las pestañas, explicaron los especialistas.

El estudio, publicado en una edición del Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, apunta al perfeccionismo (un rasgo que puede ser más nocivo de lo aparente) como una causa subyacente.

""Creemos que los individuos con estos comportamientos repetitivos pueden ser perfeccionistas, lo que significa que son incapaces de relajarse y de llevar a cabo una tarea a un ritmo normal"", afirmaba en un comunicado de prensa el doctor Kieron O'Connor, profesor de psiquiatría en la universidad y uno de los principales autores del estudio. ""Por tanto, son proclives a la frustración, la impaciencia y la falta de satisfacción cuando no alcanzan sus objetivos. También experimentan un mayor nivel de aburrimiento"".

En el estudio, los investigadores trabajaron con 48 participantes, de los cuales la mitad presentaba habitualmente estos comportamientos. Los otros participantes, que no tenían estos hábitos, actuaban como grupo de control. Se preguntó a los participantes hasta qué punto experimentaban emociones como aburrimiento, enfado, culpa, irritabilidad y ansiedad. Entonces, cada participante era expuesto a situaciones destinadas a provocar alguna sensación en particular, entre otras relajación, estrés, frustración y aburrimiento. En el caso del aburrimiento, por ejemplo, el sujeto simplemente se quedaba solo en una sala durante seis minutos.

Los participantes con un historial de conductas nerviosas centradas en el cuerpo expresaron una mayor necesidad de llevar a cabo esos comportamientos cuando se sentían estresados o frustrados. Pero no sentían esta necesidad cuando estaban relajados.

Si te muerdes las uñas de vez en cuando, no hay por qué preocuparse; probablemente no estés causando mucho daño. De hecho, los investigadores afirman que estos comportamientos cumplen un propósito temporal cuando no somos capaces de canalizar nuestra energía de forma más productiva.

""Los efectos positivos de estos hábitos son la estimulación y una forma (inadaptada) de regular la emoción"", explicaba O'Connor vía correo electrónico a la edición estadounidense de The HuffPost. ""Lo que desencadena el hábito principalmente es la frustración y la impaciencia, de modo que ese gesto sustituye a una acción más constructiva"".

No obstante, cuando es difícil parar esos hábitos e interfieren en la vida diaria, se pueden convertir en trastornos del comportamiento. La actriz Olivia Munn, por ejemplo, ha hablado alguna vez sobre su lucha contra la tricotilomanía, un trastorno de ansiedad que consiste en quitarse las pestañas de forma compulsiva.

""No me muerdo las uñas, pero me arranco las pestañas"", confesó Munn en New York Daily News en 2012. ""No duele, pero es muy molesto"".

Entonces, ¿cómo pueden tratarse estos hábitos? De acuerdo con O'Connor, en la actualidad existen dos posibles vías: un tratamiento de conducta que implique sustituir la manía por una acción contraria, y la otra sería mediante un enfoque diferente que se centre en los factores subyacentes que crean tensión, como el perfeccionismo y los pensamientos negativos.

""Observamos todos los pensamientos y comportamientos presentes en situaciones de alto riesgo para esa conducta y los modificamos a través de una terapia cognitiva para que se asemejen a los pensamientos en situaciones de bajo riesgo"", contó O'Connor. ""No tratamos el hábito directamente para que la persona no tenga que aprender una respuesta contraria que lo reemplace"".",El perfeccionismo detrás del hábito de morderte las uñas,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/11/07/el-perfeccionismo-detras-del-habito-de-morderte-las-unas_a_23268877/

388,"['successfully', 'stop', 'relationships', 'core', 'schilling', 'positive', 'beliefs', 'dating', 'relationship', 'selfsabotage', 'ready', 'single', 'selfsabotaging']","Three Types of Negative Dating Beliefs Schilling says that negative dating beliefs fall into three key categories and they can impact on how we approach dating situations.
The final step towards a 'dating win' is the 'ambivalent' approach -- ""one foot in and one foot out of the dating pool,"" Schilling explained.
Schilling suggests starting by dating yourself can lead to positive relationships in the future.
""Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship,"" Schilling said.
You can also join Melanie Schilling's private Facebook group for single women who are ready to stop self-sabotaging and start dating.","Your core beliefs could have a lot to answer for.

'Why are you still single?'

We've either been asked the question or posed it ourselves, but what's the real answer?

People will respond to this in a variety of ways, most commonly placing the blame on surface pressures, but it's actually the way we speak to ourselves about dating that could be the real answer to this query.

""Most people play a significant role in keeping themselves single,"" relationship expert Melanie Schilling told HuffPost Australia. ""It's common to blame external factors -- for example, 'it's too cold, I'll start dating after winter' or 'there's a man drought' -- and at the core of most self-sabotage is fear.""

Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship.

Self-sabotaging behaviours are usually based on fear and while people adapt these as a means of self-protection, often they can actually prevent dating success rather than guaranteeing it. These can arise from fear of rejection, vulnerability or being hurt again and giving up independence or happiness.

""Often when people have been emotionally scarred in the past -- and let's face it, who hasn't -- it's common to be self-protective. But there is a difference between being healthily skeptical and undermining your own happiness,"" Schilling said.

""At the core of dating resistance is usually a set of beliefs -- about oneself, about partners or about relationships.""

Three Types of Negative Dating Beliefs Schilling says that negative dating beliefs fall into three key categories and they can impact on how we approach dating situations. 1. Beliefs about yourself -- 'I don't deserve happiness, I'm useless at relationships, I'll only mess it up, I'm better off single.' 2. Beliefs about men and women -- 'All men/women cheat, they will break my heart, they always leave eventually.' 3. Beliefs about relationships -- 'What if something better comes along?, a relationship will stunt my independence, I don't have time for a relationship.'

Holding some or all of these core beliefs can impact on your level of 'date readiness' and can result in self-sabotaging your own dating success.

Schilling has devised the 'Date Ready Ladder' that can help assess where you might sit in the realm of dating and therefore, what you can do to improve your dating success.

The first three rungs on the ladder illustrate behaviours that can lead to a 'dating fail', while the top three are approaches that could lead to a 'dating win'.

'Self-sabotage' is ""actively undermining and blocking opportunities for social interaction or dating potential,"" Schilling said. ""Essentially telling the world you are not interested in a relationship -- either consciously or unconsciously.""

The next step up the ladder is the 'resistant' category, where ""despite feeling open to a relationship, [you avoid] opportunities or make oneself unavailable for dating options"".

The final step towards a 'dating win' is the 'ambivalent' approach -- ""one foot in and one foot out of the dating pool,"" Schilling explained. ""Sending mixed messages to potential dates.""

Sending mixed messages is characteristic of being in an 'ambivalent' dating mindset.

So, how do we recognise that we could be self-sabotaging our own dating lives and move out of our own way?

Schilling suggests starting by dating yourself can lead to positive relationships in the future.

""Self-compassion and self-awareness are the first steps in attracting and developing a positive relationship,"" Schilling said.

Von Januar bis Dezember räkelt sich eine andere Traumfrau auf der Motorhaube, als hätte sie nicht verstanden, wie sie anders in den Innenraum des Autos gelangen soll. Frauen werden seit der Erfindung des Rades des völligen Unverständnisses für die Männerträume auf vier Reifen verdächtigt. Wohl kaum ein anderes Klischee hat es in der Popkultur derart weit gebracht und wird so häufig in Büchern, Filmen und augenrollenden Gesprächen thematisiert. Dass Frauen durchaus etwas mit Autos anfangen können und was an den größten Mythen dran ist, zeigt unser Vorurteilscheck in Zusammenarbeit mit der Allianz.

Mythos 1: Tücke der Parklücke – Frauen können nicht einparken

Es ist der Klassiker der Klischees: Frauen können ohne lastergroße Lücken und unendliche Weiten zum mehrzügigen Rangieren einfach nicht einparken. Der Mythos mangelnder weiblicher Parkkünste hält sich hartnäckig, dabei erheben sich aus Studien protestierende Gegenstimmen. So zeigten beispielsweise Untersuchungen der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, dass vor allem das negative Selbstbild der Fahrerinnen zu schlechten Parkergebnissen führe. Andere Studien beschäftigten sich mit dem sozialpsychologischen Phänomen der „Bedrohung durch Stereotypen“. Die Tatsache, dass Frauen sich am Steuer ständig mit dem Vorurteil vermeintlicher Parkunfähigkeit konfrontiert sehen, verunsichert und schafft Misstrauen gegenüber den eigenen Fahrkünsten. Ein britischer Parkplatz-Betreiber will sogar herausgefunden haben, dass sich Männer einfach schneller mit ihrer Parkleistung zufriedengeben. Frauen hingegen strebten nach Perfektion und bräuchten dementsprechend länger. Die Mutter aller Mythen fußt somit auf vorurteilsbedingtem Mangel an Selbstbewusstsein bei Frauen und der unbescheidenen männlichen Begeisterung über die eigenen Parkfertigkeiten. Als Gegenmittel empfehlen wie den Damen an dieser Stelle, nie müde zu werden, süffisant grinsende Fahrer auf ihr schief geparktes Auto hinzuweisen.

Mythos 2: Spaß am Gas – Frauen kennen keine Fahrfreude

Während der Gedanke an Pferdestärken männliches Blut zur Wallung bringt, können Frauen darüber nun wirklich nicht jubilieren. Bei diesem Vorurteil scheint die Zeit irgendwann in den 1950er Jahren stehengeblieben zu sein. Das Klischee, der unmotivierte Fahrer vor dem eigenen Auto müsse ein Opa mit Hut oder eine Frau sein, kann relativ leicht ausgehebelt werden. Eine Umfrage des Autobauers Ford ergab Anfang des Jahres beispielsweise, dass Männer und Frauen bei der Fahrt eines schnittigen Sportwagens den gleichen Fahrspaß empfinden. Die Emanzipation ist längst am Gas-Pedal angekommen und so genießen auch Fahrerinnen den Sprint über die Straße. Zwar sind die Männer in Flensburg punktemäßig stärker vertreten, allerdings ist das häufigste Vergehen unter weiblichen Punktesünderinnen die zu schnelle Fahrt. Doch wehe dem, der da jetzt den Finger hebt und auf ein erhöhtes Unfallpotenzial verweist. Die Verkehrsunfallszahlen des Statistischen Bundeamtes beweisen regelmäßig, dass Frauen weniger unfallanfällig sind als Männer. Eine gute Kfz-Versicherung ist hingegen geschlechtsunabhängig der Garant für Fahrspaß mit sicherem Gefühl. Die Allianz bietet dazu individuellen Schutz für jeden Fahrer – und jede Fahrerin.

Mythos 3: Porsche statt Püppchen – Mädchen spielen nicht mit Autos

Wie viel neidisches Gebrüll mag es unter Weihnachtsbäumen schon gegeben haben, wie viele tränennasse Puppenkleidchen angesichts von vier Kubikmetern Lego und den Rennstrecken großer Brüder. Doch da lässt sich leider nichts machen, denn Barbie und Co. sind die idealen Spielsachen für Mädchen. Dass dieser Mythos eher von klassischen Rollenbildern als kindlichen Neigungen am Leben gehalten wird, zeigen verschiedene Erhebungen. Dem Bundesverband des Spielwareneinzelhandels zufolge gibt es immer mehr Mädchen, die lieber mit Autos spielen. Studien zufolge fördere der Rollentausch von Miniatur-Schönheitssalon und Rennbahn die kognitive und emotionale Entwicklung. Gewisse Vorlieben lassen sich natürlich nicht absprechen, doch freuen sich auch die meisten Prinzessinnen über Rennautos. Ein Experiment der französischen Supermarktkette Les Magasins U kommt zu einem ganz ähnlichen Ergebnis. Kaum waren Jungs und Mädchen mit der vollen Bandbreite von Auto bis Zauber-Barbie allein, griffen kleine Superhelden zu Puppen, Mädchen nach Bohrmaschinen und Bentleys.

Mythos 4: Wo bin ich? Frauen haben keinen Orientierungssinn

Wenn es einen Zusammenhang gibt, über den sich Wissenschaftler nicht einigen können, dann ist es der zwischen Geschlecht und Orientierungssinn. Den Wissenschaftlern der Norwegian University of Science and Technology zufolge sind Männer dank des Testosterons und der Orientierung an Himmelsrichtungen im Orientierungsvorteil. Frauen orientierten sich eher an festen Wegpunkten. Zwei Wissenschaftlerinnen der University of Edinburgh zufolge bietet dieser Umstand jedoch auch Vorteile. Zwar hätten Frauen ein schlechteres Gedächtnis für räumliche Anordnungen, doch gewährt die Navigation nach optischen Fixpunkten in mancher Umgebung bessere Auskunft. Dass sich Männer und Frauen unterschiedlich orientieren, setzt sich übrigens auch bei Ahnungslosigkeit fort. Eine Studie des Instituts Fly Research belegte die männliche Unbelehrbarkeit. Demnach nimmt jeder Vierte eine halbstündige Irrfahrt mit ungeahntem Ausgang in Kauf, bevor er nach dem Weg fragt.

Mythos 5: Fluchen und Funkeln – Männer donnern, Frauen dekorieren

Müssten Eigenschaften wie das Anschreien anderer Autofahrer oder Faustschwenken vor dem Abbiegen einem Geschlecht zugeordnet werden – die meisten würden auf die Männerwelt tippen. Doch eine Studie der Scout24-Gruppe wies nicht nur die Deutschen als Fluch-Europameister aus, sondern krönte zudem die Frauen zum fluchenden Geschlecht, das deinem Ärger lautstark Luft macht. Da wir schon einmal beim Thema Luft sind, ein dekoratives Vorurteil ist nicht ganz von der Hand zu weisen. Ob Duftbäume mit Käsekuchen-Aroma, Kinderschühchen und Einhörner, die es zur 50 Liter Tankfüllung gratis dazu gab: Frauen stehen im Verdacht, ihren Rückspiegel als eine Art Hort für jegliches Sammelsurium zu nutzen. Das Resultat: Beim Fahren schwankt und funkelt allerhand am Rückspiegel und irritiert weit über die Grenzen des eigenen Autos hinaus. Beim Blick in manches Auto fällt es schwer, diesen Mythos auszuhebeln.

Alles andere als mythisch: Gut versichert mit der Allianz

Frauen beweisen Freude am Fahren, parken fluchend doch perfekt ein und beschäftigen sich durchaus mit ihren Autos. Doch für jeden Fahrer und jede Fahrerin gilt: Nur mit einer guten Kfz-Versicherung fährt es sich auf Nummer sicher. Die Kfz-Versicherung der Allianz ist als zuverlässiger Partner immer mit am Steuer.

La marca, el lugar de creación y de fabricación, la composición de la prenda, de y por quien ha sido importada o exportada, sus importantísimos cuidados... Todo ello aparece en una larga etiqueta que es todo un apéndice de la misma.

Pero ahora Zara se ha encontrado con un problema en sus etiquetas, en concreto en las de sus tiendas de Estambul, en Turquía. No es que sean puramente informativas: es que van un paso más allá.

İşçiler Zara ürünlerine etiket asarak destek istedi: Alacağınız ürünü ben yaptım ama paramı alamadımhttps://t.co/jFJYsegSFz pic.twitter.com/id9EYXPylG — Cumhuriyet (@cumhuriyetgzt) 31 de octubre de 2017

Las etiquetas de las que habla el diario Cumhuriyet en este tuit han sido colocadas en varias prendas de diversas tiendas de Estambul. La razón de las mismas es una protesta: la de los 140 trabajadores de Bravo, una empresa subsidiaria de Zara (aunque también de otras empresas como Mango y Next), que cerró en julio de 2016. Al quedarse en la calle, los trabajadores exigen ahora a la marca emblema de Inditex que les paguen lo que se les adeuda, al parecer, los últimos tres meses de salario, según Cumhuriyet.

Para hacerlo, nada mejor que usar una llamativa etiqueta. En el mensaje escrito en la misma se puede leer: ""Yo he hecho esta prenda que tú vas a comprar, pero no he cobrado mi parte por ella"". Los trabajadores también han decidido protestar a través de la plataforma Change.org, donde han recopilado unas 25.000 firmas.

""En julio de 2016, nuestro jefe se negó a pagar gran parte de los salarios que habíamos ganado haciendo la ropa para estas marcas. Los acreedores llegaron a nuestra fábrica y se apoderaron de todas las máquinas y objetos de valor. Mientras tanto, nuestro jefe desapareció, llevándose nuestros salarios con él. Todavía no hemos recibido nuestros salarios ni ningún tipo de compensación por despido"", afirman en la petición.

¿POR QUÉ EN TIENDAS DE ZARA?

Entonces, si el problema está en un suministrador de la cadena (uno más de las decenas que trabajan, en este caso, para Zara o Mango), en una fábrica textil concreta, ¿por qué las protestas tienen lugar en las tiendas de una marca concreta, el punto de venta? Lo primero y más obvio, porque esa es la mejor estrategia por parte de los trabajadores para llamar la atención del cliente y de los medios y, por tanto, para hacer presión a las marcas.

Pero también por lo que ellos mismos afirman en su petición: ""Las marcas globales ganan la mayor parte de los beneficios de esta producción y se ha demostrado en multitud de ocasiones que son los verdaderos jefes de la industria, quiénes determinan las condiciones en la fábrica"". Por ello, buscan que el público tome ""conciencia de esta dinámica de poder"" y que las marcas se hagan cargo de su responsabilidad y se vean ""obligadas a aceptar que son responsables de asegurar que sus productos se han producido de manera justa"".

Por su parte, la empresa ha reconocido que, en el caso de Zara y de su matriz, Inditex, la empresa ""ha firmado un Acuerdo Marco Global con IndustriAll Global Union [la patronal global del textil] y aceptó la responsabilidad de los derechos básicos de los trabajadores en sus fábricas proveedoras"".

El HuffPost se ha puesto en contacto con Inditex para conocer su posición al respecto. Aseguran que, por su parte, quedaron al corriente de los pagos con la fábrica. Pero, como han trabajado con ellos durante años, están buscando un acuerdo e incluso crear un fondo económico para ayudar a los trabajadores.

Firstly, that child needs to live somewhere where there actually is a school.
Not all kids living amidst war or fleeing it have access to education, or can manage to go to school.","Delivering education in emergency situations, such as in refugee camps or war zones, is fraught with challenges. Beside the usual mundane logistical needs of any school and the ongoing task of ensuring quality of learning, schools serving vulnerable populations have additional challenges like figuring out how to teach kids who have experienced trauma, whose home situation is unstable, or who cannot speak the local language of the host country.

But one major problem of education is often already solved in such situations: motivation. Research is increasingly recognizing the pivotal role played by motivation in the learning process. When someone is personally driven to learn something, there is a better chance they will be successful at school. I have seen this in my own teaching of graduate students in Canada. When the stakes are raised — for instance, the penalty for failing an assignment is higher, or the reward for a good assignment greater — they rise to the occasion. The same students can submit work of vastly varying quality in response to their level of motivation. But when students think they can squeak by without investing too much in their learning, they will. Every learner has competing priorities, and motivation is an indicator that moves one's education up or down on the ladder of those priorities.

But what strikes me about education in countries experiencing war is that the motivation challenge for educators is less acute, because a girl whose made it to a classroom in Afghanistan, or a Syrian refugee boy whose made it to a school in a strange new country has already had to fight so hard to get there, their motivation is in overdrive. These children understand profoundly that education opens doors, and they in particular need such doors opened if their future is to be different from their present.

Take for instance, Dunia, a student who attended the Al Salam School, a school supported by the Canada-based charity, the Syrian Kids Foundation, in Reyhanli, Turkey. Dunia ended up there after her father was killed by the Syrian regime in 2012, forcing her and her surviving family to flee. She changed school three times during high school due to bombardments. At Al Salam, Dunia graduated at the top of her class, scoring 97.7 per cent on her diploma. She volunteered with an obstetrician in Turkey, and watching babies being born, discovered her career goal, explaining ""when the war in Syria is over, Syria will need many educated people, particularly doctors."" She scored highly on the IELTS English exam, and earned admission to Montreal's Concordia University on scholarship, where she now maintains a 3.9 GPA, studies biochemistry, and has been invited to join the university's Golden Key society for academic excellence.

Or there's Mohamad, another Al Salam student, who fled Raqaa to Turkey after the city was overtaken by ISIS. Leaving behind his bombed neighbourhood and the memory of young friends killed there, he arrived in Turkey not speaking a word of English. After working for a few months to help his family subsist, he found his way to the Al Salam School, ultimately completing his secondary education. He studied intensively, performed well on the TOEFL exam, was sponsored by the Syrian Kids Foundation to come to Canada to study, and was accepted at Concordia, where he too, is in the top 15 per cent of his class, and is studying to be a computer engineer.

These are young people sold on school, kids who want more than anything to be inside a classroom. And it's not just children and youth: consider the adult women — most of them mothers or grandmothers — who sign up in droves to the basic literacy classes of the Afghanistan Reads! program of Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan. A 65-year-old illiterate farmer woman who has survived civil war, the Taliban, birthing and raising eight kids, grinding poverty, and a life of long days labouring at home and in the fields, and has made it to a literacy classroom with her book open in front of her with her finger on the first page, to learn the first letter of the alphabet, I think we can agree, is motivated.

In poor countries and countries at war, a myriad of elusive conditions have had to come together to result in that moment when a child steps foot in a classroom on their first day of school. Firstly, that child needs to live somewhere where there actually is a school. Next, they need to have been born to parents who support their desire to go to school, a factor disproportionately sidelining girls from the classroom. That child also needs to live in a family that can afford the costs of schooling — books, clothes, supplies — and the lost opportunity cost by not having the child work for income or do household chores, a risk especially acute for those displaced and trying to make ends meet in a new place.

Families also need to feel confident enough that their child will be safe at school, that they will not be subjected to abuse, discrimination, or often for girls — harassment or assault on the way to school. That child needs to be healthy enough, mentally and physically, to attend school, and to be well enough fed to be able to concentrate on learning. And finally, that child needs to be motivated enough to overcome all these barriers — barriers school children typically don't have to face in countries like Canada — to make school happen in a context where more immediate needs like food and shelter can all too easily push education out of the picture, forever.

Not all kids living amidst war or fleeing it have access to education, or can manage to go to school. But we must recognize what it has taken to get there, for those kids who do manage to end up in a classroom. We must do what we can to support them not only because it is the right of every child — no matter their circumstances — to have an education, but also because these kids are the best chance their countries have to rebuild and secure peace when, as adults, they inherit shattered countries that need to be made whole again.",A Burning Motivation To Learn Helps Students From War Zones Beat the Odds,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lauryn-oates/a-burning-motivation-to-learn-helps-students-from-war-zones-beat-the-odds_a_23258693/

Die ganze Geschichte und die Aufnahmen dazu seht ihr auch im Video oben

Dozenten haben es oft nicht leicht. Sie stecken Mühe und Arbeit in den Unterricht ihrer Studenten und letztlich wird ihnen oft nur mit schlechten Testergebnissen gedankt. Es ist daher wohl nachvollziehbar, dass der ein oder andere Professor frustriert ist.

In Los Angeles brachte die Frustration einen Professor jetzt sogar wortwörtlich dazu, sich in einen Sarg zu legen.

“Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht”

Nachdem eine Klausur schlecht ausgefallen ist, ließ er sich nämlich etwas ziemlich Erschreckendes für seine Studenten einfallen. Er legte sich in einen Sarg, der im Hörsaal aufgestellt wurde. Seine Erklärung: “Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht.”

Einer seiner Studenten, Mario, hielt den Streich des Lehrers auf einem Foto fest und teilte dieses auf Twitter.

""Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein""

Hunderttausende Twitter-User waren begeistert von der Aktion des Dozenten und teilten und kommentierten den Post. Das Foto sorgte allerdings auch für viel Verwirrung. So wunderten sich einige, woher er den Sarg hatte und wie er ihn in den Hörsaal der Universität gebracht hat.

“Sind Särge nicht ziemlich teuer? Oder kann man die heutzutage auch mieten? Ich habe so viele Fragen”, schrieb zum Beispiel ein Twitter-Nutzer. Andere applaudieren dem Professor und merken anerkennend an: “Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein.”

Auf die Anfrage der HuffPost, um welchen Kurs es sich handelte und wie schlecht die Ergebnisse genau waren, äußerte sich der Student, der mit seinem Foto einen Viralhit landete, bisher noch nicht.

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

The Collins Dictionary has said the ""word of the year"" is ""fake news"" though of course that's two words. It had seen an unprecedented usage increase of 365% since 2016. ""Fake news today is legitimate news,"" it said.

Helen Newstead, the head of language content, said, ""Fake news, either as a statement of fact or as an accusation, has been inescapable, contributing to the undermining of society's trust in news reporting.""

While Trump may have helped Fake News win the word-of-the-year mantle, India has been quite a fake news factory.

Now, according to Asian Age, the government is contemplating cracking down on fake news.

And about time. Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

The government has said official advertisements should be denied to outlets that indulge in ""unethical reporting"", news published out of ""bad intent"" and ""fake news"".

The Directorate of Advertising & Visual Publicity will stop release of advertisements to such publications. Until now the print media policy already stated a newspaper could be suspended from empanelment if it was found to have deliberately submitted false information regarding circulation.

This is not symbolic. Government ads are a major source of revenue for media.

The devil, as always, lies in the details. What is fake news? And who defines it? Who defines bad intent? Clearly one person's fake news is another person's truth or at least their agenda.

Fake news in India is like air pollution in Delhi – toxic, stubborn and growing stronger.

Take a few recent examples:

During the riots in Basirhat, an image of a burning vehicle was sent out as part of a call to #SaveBengal. It was shared by Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson from Delhi and used on a flyer for protests. The image, it turned out, was from the 2002 Gujarat riots under Narendra Modi's watch.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya has been caught more than once peddling fake news, tweets he has refused to take down even after they have been proved to be false. Once he circulated a mischievously edited video clip of NDTV anchor Ravish Kumar. Another time during the Ram Rahim trial he posted a picture of Rahul Gandhi meeting Sant Niranjan Dass of Dera Sach Khand Ballan but captioned it as ""Rahul Gandhi visited Dera Sach Sauda as recently as Jan 2017 to seek support.""

BJP leader Priti Gandhi posted Julian Assange's fake endorsement of Narendra Modi for Prime Minister which Wikileaks had to deny.

These could be honest mistakes. Who among us has not fallen for fake news, especially when it fits our ideological bias? But sometimes it's far more deliberate and it comes from within the government itself, not some mischief monger on social media.

The state-run Press Information Bureau infamously photoshopped a picture of Narendra Modi looking at flood-ravaged Chennai with divyadrishti clarity through his chopper window. And of course, that iconic ""rare"" picture of Modi sweeping the floor at a 1988 RSS rally turned out to be a well-morphed fake photo.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Does this mean the BJP is the sole offender? Of course, not. But as Rohan Venkataramakrishnan points out in Scroll, the BJP was an ""early pioneer when it came to using the internet for organizing and building political awareness"" and it also ""has been at the forefront of the fake news phenomenon, with top party leaders and ministers occasionally revealing the kinds of dishonest messages that are much more rampant among the base.""

Even more worryingly, in a country where the phrase ""anti-national""can be used casually as a bludgeon to silence any dissent that is too bothersome, these new DAVP guidelines could just be another weapon to bring media to heel. The Centre has already told the Jammu and Kashmir government to stop advertising in local newspapers that allegedly publish ""anti-national""articles ""glamorizing terrorists and anti-national elements"". Shujaat Bukhari, editor of Rising Kashmir told HT that three major newspapers there, including his own, are banned from getting central government ads for eight years because they cover ""anti-national"" issues, for example, the funerals of militants. ""Now they want us to bleed more by telling the state government to stop state advertisements as well,"" he said.

So when it comes to curing the epidemic of fake news, physician heal thyself.

Government ads have long been part of a strategy to make sure that media does not get too uppity. As other ad revenues shrink government ads gain even more clout.

In 2012, Dhirendra K. Jha dubbed Nitish Kumar Bihar's editor-in-chief because he used the government's ad budget to control and bend the media to his will. The editor of Bihartimes.com said though it has been ""No. 1"" since inception in 1999, its application for empanelment with the Public Relations Department was kept pending without any ""concrete reason"" while a site based in Bhopal with tenuous connections to Bihar got government ads. He said he believes it's because his site carries reports related to corruption in the state. An Urdu paper Pindar ran afoul of the government because of a piece by its chief editor that apparently upset the government. The editor, Raihan Ghani, said he was demoted to managing editor and eventually resigned. Curiously the year after Ghani was gagged, the paper's government ad revenues ballooned from 1 lakh to 24 and the year after to 40 lakh.

When the ABP group in Bengal was perceived at loggerheads with the Trinamool government, Mamata Banerjee had banned their newspapers from state libraries. Global campaign group Avaaz said that five West Bengal outdoor advertising agencies and one newspaper group refused to run ads urging Mamata Banerjee to ""stop attacking protesters and start attacking the problem"" after the gangrape of a young woman in Kamduni. Jayalalithaa's Tamil Nadu was boomtown for lawsuits against media perceived as being overly critical of the government. In five years it filed 213 defamation cases against political opponents, 55 of them against media houses for ""derogatory "" statements whether it was reporting on the CM's vacations or water scarcity in Tamil Nadu. Its predecessor DMK was a poor second with 40 cases between 2006 and 2011.

The government's idea to crack down on fake news sounds like good news. Who could argue with punishing the purveyors of fake news? But the fear is it will have little to do with promoting free and fair journalism and far more to do with the carrot-and-stick policy that makes media toe the line.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartner kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex - nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

Depuis Bruxelles, le président catalan en appelle à l'Europe. Il est temps de répondre. Vous l'avez fait, cher président Macron, mais vous l'avez fait en partie.

Vous êtes le président des Catalans nés sur la terre d'exil. Enfants et petits-enfants de républicains espagnols, nous sommes français et nous avons reçu, il y a quelques années, un passeport espagnol offert par le gouvernement de José Luis Zapatero au nom de la Mémoire Historique. Riches de deux passeports, de deux cultures, parlant deux langues, nous avons, vous le comprendrez, deux présidents.

Vous avez répondu sur le plan politique: la Catalogne ne doit pas quitter l'Espagne, avez-vous dit. Ainsi vous en appeliez à la loi donc à la morale. Mais la parole politique n'a de valeur et vous le savez, que si elle est sous-tendue, au-delà de la loi, par l'éthique. Il est donc temps de moduler votre position respectable. Il est temps d'ajouter que vous connaissez la genèse de cette déclaration unilatérale d'indépendance. De rappeler que la Constitution établie en bonne intelligence en 2006 entre la Catalogne et l'Espagne a été annulée en 2010 par le Partido Popular de Rajoy fort de l'appui d'un tribunal constitutionnel qui lui est totalement acquis. De rajouter que s'en est suivie une série d'humiliations pour les Catalans infligées sans appel et autoritairement par Madrid. Il est temps de rappeler les bases de la démocratie à laquelle vous tenez.

Une parole politique, président Macron, ne peut être entendue si elle n'est pas à la fois politique et éthique, je parle de l'éthique des actions estimées bonnes, chère à Ricœur. Toute la différence entre la morale qui fait loi et l'éthique qui fait l'humain est là, je n'ai rien à vous apprendre.

En Catalogne, la génération qui a vécu la proclamation de l'État Catalan en 1934, l'emprisonnement du gouvernement de la Generalitat, la guerre en 36 puis l'exil en 39 est en train de disparaître. Mais la mémoire est là. Mémoire consciente ou inconsciente, mais mémoire, ô combien, prégnante! Est-ce elle qui sous-tend, en silence, la violence des événements actuels? Après des années de patience et d'appel au dialogue, les Catalans exaspérés ont proclamé la semaine dernière la République Catalane. La réponse de Madrid a été immédiate, le gouvernement catalan de la Generalitat a été destitué, le chef de la police catalane remplacé, les médias catalans et l'enseignement en catalan sont en passe d'être interrompus. Lorsque l'on touche à la langue, ne touche-t-on pas au plus profond de l'homme?

Vous souhaitez porter, Emmanuel Macron, durant votre présidence de la France, le projet européen. Nous vous en savons capable. C'est donc à vous, à double titre, de prendre la parole aujourd'hui. Aux cotés de notre autre président, Carles Puigdemont, nous vous écoutons.

BHOPAL – A 19-year-old college student was on the way back from her coaching class when she was kidnapped by four youths, dragged to a desolate spot near a railway track close to Habibganj station, and raped for hours.

The woman is pursuing her graduation and preparing for the civil services exam.

The youths escaped, leaving the injured girl in the bushes near the railway track, close to Railway Protection Force (RPF) police station. The survivor somehow managed to drag herself to the police station and informed her parents, both of whom are police personnel.

Still, none of the two police stations — MP Nagar and Habibganj — both in the heart of New Bhopal, registered an FIR, passing the buck, saying that the area of the crime did not fall under their jurisdiction.

Finally, the railway police registered a case. SP Anita Malviya told media persons that the young woman was gang-raped by four youths – Golu Chadhar, Amar, Rajesh and Ramesh. She said that the accused have been arrested. Times of India reported that the man identified as Golu — Golu Bihari Chadhar — is out on bail after being charged with murder of his infant daughter.

The alleged rapists took gutkha, cigarette and tea breaks between the horrific assault, the TOI report said.

The ordeal didn't end even after her ordeal. According to reports, at the Habibganj GRP, an officer allegedly accused the victim of ""making up a filmy story"".

The incident had occurred on late Tuesday night, and throughout Wednesday, the traumatized family had tried to get an FIR registered, until railway police took action.

The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of Bhopal has ordered a probe into the incident of negligence in conducting their civic duty and SI RN Tekam of MP Nagar police station has been suspended.

The incident has led to shock in the state capital. The MP Human Rights Commission has sought a report from Bhopal police. The Opposition has targeted the state government for poor law-and-order. Minister for Women and Child Development, Archana Chitnis, has said that it was shameful and for such horrific cases the culprits need to be given death penalty.

Trump will sich mit Putin treffenDer gefährliche Konflikt um das Atomwaffenprogramm in Nordkorea wird eines der zentralen Themen der zweiwöchigen Asien-Reise von Trump sein.
Darüber wird er am Montag auch mit dem japanischen Ministerpräsidenten Shinzo Abe in Tokio sprechen.
Seine erste Asienreise wird Trump von Japan aus weiter nach Seoul führen, nach China, Vietnam und auf die Philippinen.
""Wir wollen, dass Putin mit Nordkorea hilft, und wir werden eine Reihe verschiedener Anführer treffen"", sagte Trump.","US-Präsident Trump hat laut einem japanischen Medienbericht sein Unverständnis darüber geäußert, dass Japan nordkoreanische Raketen nicht abgefangen hat

Dabei ist ein Abfangversuch äußerst riskant

Trump will sich bei seiner Asienreise außerdem mit dem russischen Präsidenten Putin treffen

US-Präsident Donald Trump ist zu Beginn seiner fast zweiwöchigen Asienreise in Japan eingetroffen. Einige hundert amerikanische und japanische Soldaten bereiteten ihm am Sonntagvormittag (Ortszeit) auf dem US-Militärstützpunkt Yokota einen begeisterten Empfang.

""Japan ist ein geschätzter Partner und wichtiger Alliierter, und wir danken ihnen für ihre Freundschaft"", sagte Trump.

Nach Informationen der Nachrichtenagentur Kyodo soll er jedoch im Vorfeld Unverständnis für Tokios Reaktion auf zwei kürzliche Raketentests durch Nordkorea geäußert haben. Er könne nicht verstehen, warum ein Land von Samurai-Kriegern die Raketen nicht abschoss, soll Trump gesagt haben.

Dabei wäre sowohl ein erfolgreicher als auch ein gescheiterter Abschuss äußerst gefährlich.

""Japan will der Eskalation wohl aus dem Weg gehen""

Der Abfang einer Rakete - gerade einer Interkontinentalrakete - gilt als große Herausforderung. Die USA testeten im Mai 2017 ihr Raketenabwehrsystem ""Ground-based Midcourse Defense"" (GMD) - mit einer Erfolgsquote von 53 Prozent, wie das Pentagon mitteilte.

Das japanische Verteidigungsministerium habe sich nach der Berechnung der Flugroute der nordkoreanischen Raketen dazu entschlossen, keinen Abgangversuch zu starten, berichtet die japanische Tageszeitung ""Japan Times"". Ein Fehlversuch würde Japan blamieren und Nordkorea womöglich zu weiteren Test ermuntern, so die Überlegung.

Ein erfolgreicher Abschuss könnte außerdem die Situation eskalieren lassen. ""Einen Abschuss hätte Nordkorea umgehend als Provokation und Anlass für zeitnahe weitere Raketentests gesehen, dieser Eskalation wollte Japan wohl aus dem Weg gehen"", zitierte der ""Spiegel"" einen ranghohen Bundeswehroffizier nach einem kürzlichen Raketentest der Nordkoreaner.

Trump will sich mit Putin treffen

Der gefährliche Konflikt um das Atomwaffenprogramm in Nordkorea wird eines der zentralen Themen der zweiwöchigen Asien-Reise von Trump sein. Darüber wird er am Montag auch mit dem japanischen Ministerpräsidenten Shinzo Abe in Tokio sprechen.

Seine erste Asienreise wird Trump von Japan aus weiter nach Seoul führen, nach China, Vietnam und auf die Philippinen. Trump erwartet während seiner Reise auch ein Treffen mit seinem russischen Kollegen Wladimir Putin.

""Ich denke, es wird erwartet, dass wir uns mit Putin treffen"", sagte Trump am Sonntag auf der Reise nach Tokio an Bord der Air Force One mitreisenden Reportern. ""Wir wollen, dass Putin mit Nordkorea hilft, und wir werden eine Reihe verschiedener Anführer treffen"", sagte Trump. Die beiden Präsidenten haben sich zuletzt am Rande des G20-Gipfels in Hamburg getroffen.

Ein Treffen Trumps mit Putin am Rande eines Gipfels der Asiatisch-Pazifischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft (Apec) in Da Nang in Vietnam war von russischer Seite bereits ins Spiel gebracht, vom Weißen Haus aber bislang nicht bestätigt worden.

Trump selbst hatte vor der Reise dem Sender Fox News gesagt: ""Das ist eine sehr wichtige Reise. Wir können uns mit Putin treffen."" Eine endgültige Bestätigung eines Treffens steht gleichwohl noch aus.

(pardon, vous n'avez cité QUE des hommes, je me permets de ne citer QUE des femmes).
Ceux qui en critiquent le sens, les méthodes, qui tentent de diviser (""toutes les femmes ne pensent pas cela voyons..."").","La tribune publiée par Nicolas Bedos dans Le HuffPost, sur la libération de la parole qui vire, selon lui, à la guerre des sexes, m'a passablement énervée. D'autant plus qu'elle a été partagée par des gens que j'estime, alors qu'elle reste pour moi le reflet d'une misogynie bien ancrée et qui refuse de dire son nom. Je me suis donc accordé un droit de réponse.

Cher Nicolas Bedos,

Vers l'âge de 12 ans, j'apprends qu'un de mes cousins, un adulte, avait commis des attouchements sur une de mes cousines de 8 ans. Peu de temps auparavant, il avait tenté de violer une autre de mes cousines qui en avait fait part à ses parents. Tout le monde savait.

Quand j'étais étudiante, j'apprends que mes amies à Sciences Po qui avaient DSK comme professeur, demandaient à leurs copines d'attendre devant la porte lorsqu'elles avaient à passer un oral avec lui, de peur de se retrouver dans une situation ""délicate"". J'ai raconté cette histoire devant des adultes, des journalistes, des professeurs et les réactions n'ont été que rires et blagues graveleuses. Tout le monde savait.

Il y a quelques temps, je me suis fait agresser en boîte de nuit par un type que je connaissais vaguement. Le serveur d'un café qui me draguait et dont j'ai toujours repoussé les avances. En racontant l'histoire à des gens qui le connaissent, je me suis aperçue qu'il n'en était pas à son premier fait d'armes. Tout le monde savait.

Pour tous les cas que je viens de citer, des gouttes d'eau dans un océan de plaintes étouffées, ""un seul nom suffisait"". Ce nom que l'on vous demande de balancer aujourd'hui, certes bêtement, est celui que l'on s'échange sous le manteau depuis des années. Celui qui a pu faire rire sous cape. Celui qui a pu devenir un mythe (""Je vais te faire une Baupin"", ""Je suis le DSK de France 2""). Et pourquoi on vous le demande Nicolas? Parce que jusque ici, ce type-là est resté impuni alors que tout le monde savait. Jusqu'ici c'étaient mes cousines, les étudiantes de Sciences Po, ou moi-même qui devions avoir honte de nos agressions.

Je pense d'ailleurs que tout cela vous le savez pertinemment, comme la différence entre la drague lourde et le harcèlement, je ne vais pas vous faire l'affront de vous donner un cours sur la notion de consentement. D'ailleurs, je prendrai comme un jeu rhétorique de votre part le fait que vous compariez un violeur à un homme infidèle ou à un radin. Vous-même, je pense, vous choisiriez sans hésiter l'option ""mon radin de patron a refusé de m'augmenter"" plutôt que ""mon violeur de patron m'a sodomisé de force"".

Par contre ne me demandez pas de ""comprendre votre colère"". Je la trouve déplacée. Vous avez l'impression, en tant qu'homme, d'être devenu un gibier? Mais n'est-ce pas cela, entre autres, qui révolte les femmes? D'avoir le sentiment d'être traquée en permanence?

Et que cela soit clair, je n'ai pas choisi les exemples ci-dessus pour remettre en cause le fait que DSK soit un économiste brillant, que j'ai de bons souvenirs d'enfance avec mon cousin, ou que le serveur qui m'a agressée soit le roi des Frozen Margaritas. Comme je ne remets pas en cause le fait que les films de Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, Kevin Spacey ou produits par Harvey Weinstein puissent être remarquables. J'ai été fan du ""Cosby show"" comme de la musique de Michael Jackson ou de Noir Désir. D'ailleurs, Emile Louis était sûrement un formidable chauffeur de bus et peut-être dans un autre contexte, j'aurais pu prendre un café avec Guy Georges et trouver le mec super sympa.

La question de séparer l'homme de l'œuvre ou même ""la bête"", ""le porc"", puisqu'on l'a nommé ainsi, de l'être humain (du voisin, du copain, du père, du fils, du cousin), pose question et cela personne ne peut le nier. C'est philosophiquement et humainement un débat à avoir. Mais a-t-on pour autant besoin de le porter aux nues? Qu'un homme qui a tué sa femme à coups de poing fasse la une des magazines? Qu'un organisme public rende hommage à un homme accusé de plusieurs viols et qui fuit la justice depuis des années? Est-ce cela pour vous un monde libre? Un monde où le talent, le pouvoir et l'argent excusent tout? Où les coupables n'ont pas honte? Où l'on dit aux victimes encore une fois de se taire car leur parole ne vaut rien contre la leur? Mais surtout, est-ce vraiment cela sur quoi porte le débat aujourd'hui?

Et si vous (re)lisiez King Kong théorie de Virginie Despentes? Ou Le deuxième sexe de Simone de Beauvoir? Et si vous creusiez un peu plus les pensées de Françoise Héritier, Marguerite Duras ou Geneviève Fraisse? (pardon, vous n'avez cité QUE des hommes, je me permets de ne citer QUE des femmes). Vous comprendriez sûrement que ce qui se passe aujourd'hui n'est pas ""une chasse aux sorcières au nom du progrès moral"". Et que derrière ce #, ce n'est pas seulement un ras-le-bol qui s'exprime, mais la remise en cause d'un système où se construisent et se perpétuent inégalités et stéréotypes. Un système tellement ancré en nous, hommes comme femmes, qu'il nous a amené à considérer que la violence envers la moitié de l'humanité était naturelle, puisque jusqu'ici personne n'a rien fait.

Et lorsque l'on vous demande si vous connaissez des gens autour de vous qui auraient pu avoir ce genre de comportement, n'est-ce pas beaucoup plus facile de prendre la plume pour dénoncer les dérives totalitaires d'une ""dénonciation arbitraire"", que de se poser les vraies questions: ""Ai-je moi aussi un jour été un ""porc""? ""Ai-je, même sans m'en apercevoir, dépassé la limite? Ai-je laissé passer des comportements inacceptables qui se sont déroulés sous mes yeux, par peur, lâcheté, ignorance? Et la réponse est oui, Nicolas, vous l'avez fait. Je l'ai fait aussi. Nous l'avons tous fait. Cette déferlante vous gêne et tant mieux, car elle vous remet et nous remet tous en question.

Et puis, n'avez-vous pas un peu l'impression que sous couvert de fustiger la pensée unique, vous en êtes en fait le parfait représentant: le mâle alpha blanc. Celui qui occupe la place dans les médias, à l'assemblée, dans les postes à responsabilité et les conseils d'administration, celui qui a, par définition, le pouvoir et la parole. Celui qui n'a pas besoin de quota, de manifs ou de # pendémique pour être écouté. Parce que, si vous approuvez le fait qu'enfin les voix des femmes s'élèvent, pourquoi mettre un bémol en parlant au-dessus d'elles? Si vous souhaitez réellement que les femmes de votre entourage n'aient plus à subir et que cette parole libérée permette enfin de changer les choses, pourquoi déplacer (et accaparer) le débat?

Dans un couple ""tout sauf le silence dites-vous""? Mais vous n'êtes pas en couple avec la moitié de l'humanité que je sache? Et même si je suivais votre raisonnement jusqu'au bout, si votre femme vous apprend qu'elle a été agressée par le facteur, allez-vous lui couper la parole pour lui rétorquer: ""je comprends chérie, mais il va d'abord falloir laisser faire la justice avant de prévenir les voisins et qu'il arrête de venir livrer le courrier chez nous... et puis on ne peut pas lui retirer que c'est un bon facteur, il monte les Chronoposts jusqu'au 6ème...».

Pensez-vous, Nicolas, qu'il serait possible qu'un homme, juste pendant un moment, n'ait rien à dire, juste à écouter? Rien à ajouter si ce n'est tenter de comprendre quelque chose qui le dépasse? Rien à faire, si ce n'est son examen de conscience?

Il n'y a pas à proprement parler de guerre des sexes. Mais oui, il y a bien une révolte et comme dans toute révolte qui se respecte, il y a ceux, dont vous faites partie, ainsi que ""vos amis avec qui vous discutez en privé"", bien accrochés à leurs acquis qui ne veulent pas voir les choses bouger. Ceux qui en critiquent le sens, les méthodes, qui tentent de diviser (""toutes les femmes ne pensent pas cela voyons...""). Ceux qui sous couvert de s'interroger, sont juste terrifiés à l'idée que le monde qui arrive ""soit moins profitable"". Moins profitable à qui? À eux... et à eux seulement.

¿Tenemos los españoles dinero invertido en paraísos fiscales?","De nuevo, una filtración masiva de documentos dada a conocer por el Consorcio Internacional de Periodistas de Investigación (ICIJ, por sus siglas en inglés) ha puesto el foco sobre los paraísos fiscales. Tras los Luxleaks y los Papeles de Panamá, su última investigación llamada Paradise Papers (Papeles del Paraíso) deja al descubierto una extensa red de evasión fiscal en la que están implicados políticos, artistas y deportistas de todo el mundo.

En su primera publicación, los dos medios españoles involucrados, El Confidencial y La Sexta, han vinculado al exalcalde de Barcelona Xavier Trías (Convergència) y el cantante José María Cano, excomponente de Mecano, con sociedades en paraísos fiscales. Aunque habría hasta 600 españoles involucrados.

Esta filtración se conoce apenas unos días después de que Oxfam Intermón denunciara que la inversión mundial hacia paraísos fiscales ha aumentado un 45% entre 2008 y 2016. En la actualidad, uno de cada cuatro euros de inversión española va hacia un paraíso fiscal y más de la mitad (54%) de la inversión extranjera que entra en España proviene de territorios opacos, según la ONG.

Entre el 30% y el 40% de dinero de los mayores patrimonios españoles está camuflado en territorios con baja o nula tributación Gestha

Las reacciones no se han hecho esperar. El sindicato de técnicos del Ministerio de Hacienda (Gestha) ha pedido a la Agencia Tributaria española la apertura de una investigación a los residentes en España que aparezcan por posible fraude fiscal. También reclama que se inicien las investigaciones ""con carácter inmediato"" con el objetivo de evitar que los afectados presenten declaraciones complementarias para evitar sanciones o condenas.

PSOE, Unidos Podemos y Ciudadanos han pedido en el Congreso la comparecencia del ministro de Hacienda y Administraciones Públicas, Cristóbal Montoro, para que explique las medidas que pretende llevar a cabo tras conocerse esta filtración. El propio titular de Hacienda ha asegurado este lunes por la mañana que la Agencia Tributaria actuará de oficio respecto a los contribuyentes que aparezcan en los Papeles del Paraíso por su vinculación a sociedades domiciliadas en paraísos fiscales.

Oxfam Intermón ha solicitado al Gobierno una ley de evasión fiscal para poner fin a la evasión y elusión de impuestos por parte de las grandes empresas y grandes fortunas. ""Las multinacionales deben de pagar la parte justa de lo que les corresponde"", ha afirmado José María Vera, director general de Oxfam Internacional.

¿Qué son los Papeles del Paraíso?

Se trata de una investigación del ICIJ que han dado a conocer 96 medios de comunicación, como El Confidencial, La Sexta, The New York Times, The Guardian y Le Monde. Se basa en una filtración masiva de 13,4 millones de documentos procedentes de dos estudios jurídicos dedicados a proveer servicios offshore: Appleby, (islas Bermudas) y Asiaciti Trust (Singapur). En total, más de 380 periodistas de 67 países han analizado 1,4 terabytes de información durante un año.

¿A qué países afecta la filtración?

La investigación afecta también a los registros mercantiles de 19 jurisdicciones opacas: Antigua y Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermudas, Islas Caimán, Dominica, Granada, San Cristóbal y Nieves, Santa Lucía, Isla de San Vicente y Trinidad y Tobago (Caribe); Islas Cook, Islas Marshall, Samoa y Vanuatu (Oceanía); Malta (Europa), Líbano (Oriente Próximo) y Labuán, territorio federal de Malasia (Asia).

¿Qué es un paraíso fiscal?

Uno de los problemas que existen es que hay discrepancias entre los criterios para definir a un paraíso fiscal. Diego López Garrido, economista y exsecretario de Estado para la Unión Europea, los define en su libro Paraísos Fiscales (Catarata) como ""la mayor protección que puede recibir un capital o activo que no quiere tributar lo que la ley exige"". ""Se trata de un Estado soberano que acoge a un capital que huye de otro Estado al que no quiere pagar los impuestos debidos"", explica.

La OCDE estableció cuatro criterios para determinar si un territorio debía ser considerado como paraíso fiscal: un nivel de imposición nulo o reducido para no residentes, ausencia de intercambio de información efectiva con otros Estados, ausencia de transparencia administrativa y no obligación para no residentes de ejercer una actividad económica sustancial en el territorio.

¿Estos territorios son considerados paraísos fiscales?

Nueve de estos territorios aparecen en el listado de paraísos fiscales para España y cinco ya lo habrían abandonado. ""Los listados nacionales son incompletos e inconexos"", ha recordado Gestha.

El Consejo de Ministros de la UE aprobó en 2016 la elaboración de una lista de países que sirva para toda la Unión Europea, para terminar con la dispersión.

¿Qué países incluye España como paraíso fiscal?

El real decreto 1.080/1991, firmado por Carlos Solchaga como ministro de Economía y Hacienda, recoge un listado de 48 países y territorios que España entonces consideraba un paraíso fiscal.

Sin embargo, permitía que si se firmaba un intercambio de información entre ese país y España, podía ser retirado de la lista. ""Los países y territorios a los que se refiere el artículo 1 que firmen con España un acuerdo de intercambio de información en materia tributaria o un convenio para evitar la doble imposición con cláusula de intercambio de información dejarán de tener la consideración de paraísos fiscales en el momento en que dichos convenios o acuerdos entren en vigor"", afirma el segundo artículo del real decreto.

La firma de convenios redujo el número de paraísos fiscales de los 48 iniciales a 33. La Dirección General de Tributos publicó en diciembre de 2014 un listado con los 15 países que habían sido eliminados de la lista original.

Posteriormente, en 2015, el Sultanato de Omán dejó de ser considerado un paraíso fiscal por parte de España. Quedarían por tanto 32 territorios.

¿Es ilegal tener dinero en un paraíso fiscal?

""Disponer de una cuenta, una empresa o una propiedad en un paraíso fiscal no es ilegal, si se declara en España su tenencia"", recuerda Gestha.

¿Tenemos los españoles dinero invertido en paraísos fiscales?

Los españoles ocultan a Hacienda alrededor de 140.000 millones de euros depositados en paraísos fiscales, lo que equivaldría al 12% del Producto Interior Bruto de España (1,12 billones de euros), según datos del National Bureau of Economic Research de Estados Unidos, recogidos por Gestha.",Paradise Papers: qué son y dónde están los paraísos fiscales,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/11/06/paradise-papers-que-son-y-donde-estan-los-paraisos-fiscales_a_23268285/

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

Stavolta, però, il nome della vittima ha un peso enorme nel mondo del cinema ed è quello della tre volte premio Oscar Meryl Streep, che in un'intervista rilasciata nel 1979 al Times aveva ricordato del primo, esplicito incontro tra i due.

Ho pensato: 'Che odioso maiale!'"" si legge nell'articolo di quasi 40 anni fa.

Proprio nel 1979, del resto, i due si ritrovarono sul set di Kramer contro Kramer, costruendo un rapporto fatto di continui scontri. In un'occasione, ad esempio, la Streep chiese di modificare una scena per puntare i riflettori sulle motivazioni interne del comportamento del suo personaggio e a quel punto Dustin protestò: ""Perché non ammaini la tua bandiera femminista e giri semplicemente la scena?"" L'episodio viene narrato nella biografia Her Again: Becoming Meryl Streep. Durante le riprese del medesimo film, poi, l'attore di Los Angeles gettò contro un muro un bicchiere di vino, benché il gesto non fosse scritto nel copione, e la sua collega se ne lamentò molto.

Tra i due premi Oscar, insomma, non è mai corso buon sangue, tanto che durante il programma tv Watch What Happens Live la Streep indicò proprio nell'interprete di Hook il collega che avrebbe potuto uccidere se necessario. L'attrice, a ogni modo, nelle ultime ore ci ha tenuto a precisare a E! News che l'articolo del 1979 non riporta in maniera accurata i dettagli del primo incontro col collega: ""Dustin si è scusato con Meryl per l'accaduto e lei ha accettato le sue scuse"" si precisa infatti nell'articolo.

Le storie sulle presunte e continue avances dell'interprete de Il laureto sono circolate per anni a Hollywood e lo stesso Hoffman, nel 1983, disse a People di essere un ""donnaiolo. Sono anche un maschilista, nel mio passato sono corso dietro a tante gonne. È difficile per me trovare una donna che non mi attragga"".

Das behauptete die Anwältin in einem Interview in Moskau

Es könnte ein Paukenschlag sein. Im Fall der Verstrickung des Wahlkampfteams von US-Präsident Donald Trump mit dem Kreml hat die russische Anwältin Natalia Veselnitskaya brisante Informationen veröffentlicht.

So soll Donald Jr. ihr versprochen haben, ein 2012 von der Obama-Regierung eingeführtes Gesetz zurückzunehmen, das russischen Staatsbeamten Sanktionen auferlegt. Das berichtet die Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg mit Verweis auf ein Interview der Anwältin in Moskau.

""Falls wir an die Macht kommen...""

Das Versprechen soll Trump Jr. bei einem viel zitierten Treffen am 9. Juni 2016 in New York geäußert haben. Ebenfalls anwesend: Trumps Schwiegersohn Jared Kushner und der damalige Kampagnen-Manager Paul Manafort. Letzterer hatte sich Ende Oktober nach monatelangen Ermittlungen gegen ihn dem FBI gestellt. Manafort wird unter anderem Verschwörung gegen die USA vorgeworfen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Schlüsselfigur in der Russland-Affäre: Wer ist George Papadopoulos - und wie gefährlich ist er für Trump?

Nach eigener Aussage reiste Veselnitskaya unter anderem mit dem Ziel nach New York, sich für das Ende der amerikanischen Sanktionen gegen Russland einzusetzen. Darum ging es auch beim Treffen im Trump Tower am 9. Juni. ""Falls wir an die Macht kommen, werden wir uns anschauen, was wir diesbezüglich unternehmen können"", soll Trump Jr. der Anwältin geantwortet haben.

Veselnitskaya ging nach eigener Aussage allerdings nicht im offiziellen Auftrag der russischen Regierung in die Gespräche.

Treffen war Zeitverschwendung

Im Gegenzug wollte der Präsidentensohn Unterlagen, die belegen, dass Hillary Clintons Wahlkampagne veruntreute Gelder bezogen hat. Geldgeber der Demokraten sollen bei den Steuern getrickst haben und diese Gelder an Hillary Clinton gespendet haben. Eine Information, die der britische Publizist Rob Goldstone Trump Jr. zuvor in einer E-Mail übermittelt hatte – im Namen Veselnitskayas.

Mit diesen konnte die Anwältin aber nicht dienen. Trump Jr. bezeichnete das Treffen darum im Nachhinein als Zeitverschwendung.

Veselnitskaya sicherte zu, die brisanten Informationen über das Gespräch auch unter Eid an den US-Sonderermittler Robert Mueller weiterzugeben, wenn es verlangt werde. Damit würde der Druck auf Donald Trump massiv wachsen – eine illegitime Absprache mit der russischen Regierung im Wahlkampf wäre wohl nur noch schwer mehr von der Hand zu weisen.

La marque Ferrero, qui produit la célèbre pâte à tartiner, a finalement confirmé à plusieurs médias avoir ""procédé à quelques ajustements"" dans sa recette.

Une association allemande de consommateurs s'était inquiétée le 2 novembre sur Facebook de voir le Nutella prendre une teinte plus claire, photos à l'appui. Exigeant plus de transparence de la part de la marque, l'association notait que le cacao avait reculé dans la liste des ingrédients, triés par ordre décroissant de proportion. Quant à la proportion de lait écrémé en poudre, elle serait passée de 7,5 à 8,7%. ""Ferrero ne veut évidemment pas faire preuve de trop de transparence vis-à-vis de ses clients"", dénonce la publication.

En France, le site 76 Actu de Rouen où la plus grande usine Nutella au monde est installée a pu faire des observations similaires en comparant les différents pots d'une grande surface. Alors que certains affichaient une teneur en lait écrémé en poudre de 6,6%, d'autres affichaient une proportion de 8,7%.

Contacté par le site, la marque italienne confirme: ""afin d'offrir aux consommateurs à tout moment et dans le monde entier, une expérience gustative unique de qualité nous avons procédé à quelques ajustements comme c'est souvent le cas pour d'autres marques"".

Principale modification: ""la poudre de lactosérum, un produit dérivé du lait, a été remplacée par une légère augmentation de la quantité de lait écrémé en poudre déjà présente"". ""La qualité du produit est inchangée, tout comme son goût et sa texture"", veut ainsi rassurer le fabriquant.

La marque a précisé auprès des Échos qu'elle voulait adapter son produit aux goûts des consommateurs à travers le monde.

En France et en Allemagne, les recettes restent ainsi légèrement différentes, pointe France Info. Si outre-Rhin la nouvelle formule est ainsi plus sucrée mais moins grasse que la précédente, le produit devient par contre tout juste moins gras, moins sucré, et moins salé en France.

Votre pot de Nutella contiendra donc toujours environ 57 grammes de glucides dans 100 grammes de pâte à tartiner, ainsi qu'une proportion identique d'huile de palme.

Dire che il problema sono io per il voto in Sicilia si colloca nello stesso filone: utilizzare ogni mezzo per togliere di mezzo l'avversario scomodo. Che poi è l'obiettivo di chi è contro di noi"".

L'ex premier chiede ai suoi di smetterla con i litigi e rilancia l'obiettivo del 40%. ""Se il Pd fa il Pd e smette di litigare al proprio interno possiamo raggiungere, insieme ai nostri compagni di viaggio, la percentuale che abbiamo preso nelle due volte in cui io ho guidato la campagna elettorale: il 40 per cento, raggiunto sia alle Europee che al Referendum"".

I suoi, intanto, ragionano sulle alleanze. Ettore Rosato e Luigi Zanda offrono a Mdp la carta Gentiloni, ma Bersani li gela: ""sono solo tatticismi"".

""Abbiamo bisogno dell'alleanza più ampia possibile, con un programma concordato. Abbiamo Paolo Gentiloni che oggi è a Palazzo Chigi ed è un nome spendibile. Ce ne sono tanti di nomi spendibili e Renzi lo ha detto chiaramente a Napoli: lavoro per portare il Pd a Palazzo Chigi e non per portare Matteo Renzi"". Così Rosato a Radio Anch'io su Radio Uno.

""Ma i Cinque Stelle sono aumentati e il centrodestra, che l'altra volta si è presentato diviso, questa volta si è presentato unito perdendo anche dei voti.

""Purtroppo la politica in Sicilia è molto, ma molto mobile"", ha concluso.

Sul tema è intervenuto anche Luigi Zanda, capogruppo Pd a Palazzo Madama: ""Dobbiamo dirci tutta la verità, senza sconti sulle ragioni delle nostre sconfitte"", afferma a Repubblica. E alla domanda se Matteo Renzi deve fare un passo di lato, risponde: ""Solo lui può decidere di spezzare l'identificazione, prevista dal nostro Statuto, e voluta da Bersani tra segretario e candidato premier"". ""Io non sono mai stato renziano - spiega Zanda - però l'ho sostenuto con lealtà . Il nostro Statuto prevede che segretario e candidato premier siano la stessa persona. Solo Renzi può spezzare questo legame. Lo ha fatto un anno fa con Gentiloni e ha funzionato, ha fatto bene al partito, al Paese e a Renzi stesso. Se vuole scindere le due figure Renzi lo può fare ancora. E' Renzi e solo Renzi che deve valutare se in questa fase convenga che lui sia segretario e anche candidato presidente. E' una decisione - aggiunge - che assumerà un'importanza nazionale. Se il prossimo governo sarà di coalizione il presidente del consiglio dovrà essere indicato da tutti gli alleati"".

Le uscite dei capigruppo Pd di Camera e Senato hanno innescato la reazione del renziano Marcucci: ""Non esiste una problema legato al candidato premier del centrosinistra. La legge elettorale non lo richiede. Matteo Renzi sarà il capofila della lista Pd, legittimato dal voto delle primarie, peraltro unico segretario di partito ad averle fatte. Esattamente come avviene con Silvio Berlusconi, Matteo Salvini, Giorgia Meloni e Luigi Di Maio, candidati solo per le rispettive liste di partito"", scrive sulla sua pagina Facebook Andrea Marcucci.

""Il premier - chiarisce il senatore Pd - si vedrà dopo le elezioni, a seconda dei numeri che le diverse forze politiche potranno vantare. Ora - osserva ancora - è il tempo di costruire una coalizione di centrosinistra competitiva e di non perdersi in discussioni fantasiose"".

Dopo la Sicilia, ""per le elezioni politiche che facciamo? Proponiamo lo stesso schema: il Pd che costruisce una proposta, un programma, una leadership, cerca condivisone e quando si arriva alla proposta la risposta è non ci piace? Facciamo che la proposta la fate voi, noi siamo disponibili perchè ci stiamo giocando l'Italia, a voi sta a cuore dare un governo stabile all'Italia?"". Lo ha detto Matteo Richetti, rivolgendosi alle forze a sinistra del Pd e in particolare a Mdp, nel corso di 'Ore nove'.

Tuttavia, per Pier Luigi Bersani, leader di Mdp e possibile ma al momento improbabile alleato del Pd alle prossime elezioni politiche, ""questo dibattito sui candidati premier è solo tatticismo. Con il Rosatellum tutti, anche Brambilla del partito animalista, si possono candidare premier. Con il Pd siamo a una rottura profonda che si risolve solo andando nel profondo"".

After cars and phones, homes are the next big frontier for technological innovation. For years, high-tech homes were seen only in cartoons and movies (remember The Jetsons, or the Stark Mansion from Iron Man?). But as time rolled on, innovations such as flat-screen televisions and voice-controlled assistants have gone from fantasy to reality. And experts say that the fun's only just beginning.

Researchers are moving steadily closer to perfecting innovations that could transform our lives even further—from toilets that can diagnose medical problems, to beds that adjust themselves to maximise sleep quality, and robot housekeepers who can dust and clean faster than any human ever could.

Much of this high-tech wizardry is still in the pipeline, but expected to hit the market soon. However, there are five amazing innovations that are already transforming our homes. Check out this video to find out what they are:

Amir Taghinia is 24, and until last week he was among the 600 refugees and asylum seekers in the Australian-run centre on Manus Island.

The centre has since been officially closed, with power, water and food cut off in an attempt by local PNG authorities to force residents to move to other nearby accommodation complexes. The United Nations reported last week that at least one of these three new facilities is not finished, while the other two still lack security fences.

Taghinia was last week flown to Coquitlam, near Vancouver, where he will be resettled under a novel Canadian policy which allows private sponsorship of refugees. He was sponsored by the family of Chelsea Taylor, an Australian aid worker who formerly worked on Manus, who have agreed to aid him for one year. Under the Canadian program, the sponsoring family or organisation takes responsibility for providing food, accommodation and living expenses, assisting with enrolling in healthcare and education, finding local doctors, and helping with employment searches.

""I am glad some good people of Canada have brought me to safety, but my heart aches for the many brothers I have left behind in the absolute hell that is Manus Island,"" Taghinia said.

""That ordinary citizens can bring me to safety, with their meagre resources, shines a light on the shameful practices of this government in keeping these other innocent men trapped in such a terrible situation.

""There are clearly many options the Australian Government has to resettle my friends on Manus, it is inhuman that the Australian Government would not take action to give them safety.""

In an interview with Canada's CBC News, Taghinia said ""I still cannot believe that I am in Canada... People are so welcoming ... they are so lovely, especially my sponsors.""

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said that Taghinia's case showed why Australia needed to urgently explore third-country resettlement options for the men on Manus, and decried the Turnbull government's refusal to consider the offer of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to take 150 of the refugees. The ASRC said the Canadian example was ""a precedent it could and should extend to those suffering on Manus and Nauru.""

""Amir's Canadian sponsorship demonstrates clearly that it is entirely possible for third countries to step in and provide a workable solution to the current crisis on Manus,"" said ASRC director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero.

""The Turnbull government must get out of the way. Allow food, water and power to be restored. Allow medical services in and then allow third countries to take the refugees, where they will be welcomed to a new life.""

The ASRC said it was a case of ""PM Turnbull dithers while crisis deepens"". Tim O'Connor, communications director at the Refugee Council of Australia, accused Turnbull of ""playing games with peoples lives"".

""Prime Minister Turnbull is saying 'we don't want these refugees, but you can't have them either',"" O'Connor said.

Après les révélations sur la reine d'Angleterre, et le chanteur Bono, c'est au tour d'Apple, de Nike et du français Dassault d'être pris dans la tourmente.

Voici comment ils se démènent pour réduire leur contribution au fisc, au prix de numéros d'équilibriste sur la ligne jaune, à ne pas dépasser, de l'évasion fiscale.

Apple préfère l'île de Jersey pour mieux payer ses impôts aux États-Unis

Apple a choisi l'île de Jersey, paradis fiscal bien connu, pour réduire son taux d'imposition lorsque ses montages en Irlande ont été pointés du doigt il y a quatre ans, ont rapporté le 6 novembre plusieurs médias, dont le New York Times.

Lorsque des parlementaires américains puis des officiels irlandais ont examiné à partir de 2013 les dispositifs pour réduire très fortement ses impôts grâce à des filiales en Irlande, le fabricant de l'iPhone a décidé de chercher un autre endroit favorable, explique le quotidien américain.

Mi-2014, sous la pression d'autres pays, l'Irlande a souhaité mettre fin a l'une des astuces d'optimisation fiscale utilisée dans ce pays par Apple, et d'autres multinationales.

Avec l'aide d'Appleby, Apple a alors jeté son dévolu sur Jersey, dépendance de la Couronne britannique, qui n'impose pas les entreprises, poursuit le New York Times, qui avance aussi que le groupe a ""accumulé plus de 128 milliards de dollars de profits offshore - et sans doute plus - qui ne sont pas imposés aux Etats-Unis et à peine dans d'autres pays"".

Selon des échanges de mails évoqués par le New York Times, Apple tenait à ce que cette recherche reste secrète. Sollicité par l'AFP, Apple n'a pas donné suite.

La groupe a fini par publier un communiqué d'une longueur inhabituelle: ""Lorsque l'Irlande a changé ses lois fiscales en 2015, nous nous y sommes conformés"" en procédant à certaines modification.

Apple reconnaît que ""parmi ces changements, (sa) filiale détenant ses liquidités à l'étranger a été domiciliée à (...) Jersey"" mais que ce choix était ""spécifiquement"" motivé par la volonté de ""s'assurer que ses obligations fiscales et ses paiements aux Etats-Unis n'étaient pas réduits"", sous-entendu par une éventuelle hausse de son imposition ailleurs.

Dassault livre ses jets de luxe à des sociétés bidons de l'île de Man

Chez Dassault, on a le sens du commerce. D'après Le Monde, la maison sait se montrer arrangeante avec les clients près de leurs sous. Ainsi, Dassault n'a pas hésité à livrer plusieurs jets privés à un riche homme d'affaires russe sur l'île de Man pour échapper à la TVA française.

Oleg Tinkoff, qui a fait fortune dans l'électronique, la production de bière et la finance, a acheté en 2013 un petit Falcon 2000LX (21 millions d'euros), revendu en 2014 pour acheter un 900LX (32,8 millions d'euros), avant de se raviser pour le 7X en 2016 (41,4 millions d'euros).

Or, d'après les documents examinés par Le Monde, Dassault n'a pas facturé de TVA. Pourquoi? Parce qu'il revenait à l'île de Man, lieu de résidence de la société acheteuse, de percevoir les sommes. Sauf qu'elle ne l'a jamais fait...

Grâce à un jeu de sociétés écrans, Oleg Tinkoff a économisé des millions d'euros de TVA. ""Le Russe s'est donc loué son propre avion à lui-même pour donner l'illusion que la coquille vide de l'île de Man produisait une activité commerciale, afin d'obtenir son laissez-passer dans l'espace aérien européen sans jamais payer la moindre TVA"", résume le quotidien.

Pour Dassault, la plaisanterie pourrait prendre un mauvais tour. D'après le code des impôts, cette ""exonération ne s'applique pas lorsqu'il est démontré que le fournisseur savait ou ne pouvait ignorer que le destinataire présumé de l'expédition ou du transport n'avait pas d'activité réelle"". Or, plusieurs e-mails semblent bien le prouver...

Comment Nike passe entre les mailles du fisc hollandais

L'équipementier sportif américain Nike profite d'un ""trou"" dans la législation néerlandaise pour réduire à seulement 2% son taux d'imposition en Europe, selon de nouvelles révélations publiées par le journal Le Monde.

Deux sociétés basées au Pays-Bas concentrent ""tous les revenus européens"" de Nike et lui permettent ainsi d'échapper ""à la taxe sur les bénéfices dans les pays où il vend effectivement les chaussures"".

L'équipementier ne paie ainsi que 2% d'impôt sur les bénéfices contre 25% pour la moyenne des entreprises européennes. ""Pour réussir ce tour de force, Nike a utilisé toutes les ressources du système fiscal néerlandais et ses immenses possibilités d'optimisation"", assure Le Monde.

Le groupe américain se paie ""à lui-même le droit d'utiliser sa marque"" et parvient ainsi à réduire ""artificiellement ses profits et donc baisser ses impôts, tout en constituant un trésor avec ces royalties"", explique le quotidien.

Ce schéma, mis en place en 2014, ""a permis à Nike de réduire sensiblement son taux d'imposition global, passé de 24% à 16% en trois ans"", tandis que les pays européens ont demandé aux Pays-Bas de combler cette lacune.

L'ONG Oxfam a réagi en qualifiant Nike de ""mauvais payeur"". ""Ces dizaines de milliards qui échappent à l'impôt au bénéfice d'une infime minorité d'ultra-riches et de multinationales représentent des pertes considérables pour les budgets des Etats, et ce sont les plus pauvres qui en paient le prix"", a déclaré Manon Aubry, porte-parole pour la France, citée dans un communiqué.

""Ce que prouve également le montage fiscal de Nike à travers les Pays-Bas, c'est que le système d'évasion fiscale est organisé depuis l'Union européenne et (cela) rappelle une nouvelle fois l'urgence de s'attaquer aux paradis fiscaux européens"", a-t-elle souligné, appelant Bruxelles à effectuer des réformes.

Fairfax Media can reveal Mr Alexander's father, Gilbert Alexander, was born in the UK and is likely to have conferred citizenship by descent to his son. Mr Alexander has never before been named as an MP with a parent born overseas, meaning his status has flown under the radar since the citizenship saga first erupted in July.

The Liberal member for the Sydney seat of Bennelong has confirmed he never renounced any British citizenship before entering Parliament, and cannot say definitively whether his father did so before the former tennis champion's birth in 1951.

This means he could be ineligible for Parliament under section 44 of the constitution.

A spokesman for Mr Alexander said on Monday: ""He believes his dad renounced his UK citizenship in the 41 years he lived in Australia before John was born. But of course he will fully participate in the process that the PM has just announced today.""

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday revealed all federal politicians will be required to publicly detail their citizenship history under new transparency measures designed to end the crisis.

The claim that Mr Alexander's father may have renounced at some point after he arrived in Australia in 1911 is complicated by the fact the concept of Australian citizenship did not come into force until 1949.

That means he may have only had a two-year window to renounce before his son was born in 1951.

Under the online renunciation search tool provided by the British National Archives, there is no record of Mr Alexander's father having renounced at any time after 1948.

Gilbert died in 1987, aged 80.

Fairfax Media has obtained documents that show Gilbert was born in Essex, England in September 1907. He was baptised in London the following month.

An incoming passenger card shows Gilbert and his family travelled from London to Sydney on June 9, 1911, when Gilbert was aged three. He enrolled to vote in the seat of Warringah in 1930 at age 23, and married Mr Alexander's mother, Thelma Fletcher Hipgrave, in 1944. They had John in July 1951.

Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born to British citizens are automatically given citizenship of the UK by descent.

This law conferred British citizenship on the Nationals' Fiona Nash and One Nation's Malcolm Roberts, who were kicked out of the Senate by the High Court last month. Former Senate president Stephen Parry resigned from Parliament last week after revealing he was a dual UK citizen through the same law.

Asked if he was confident he would not lose any more Coalition MPs to citizenship issues, Mr Turnbull said on Monday: ""The federal director has told me that all of the Liberal Party members believe that they are in compliance with the constitution.""

Mr Alexander won Bennelong, a culturally diverse electorate on Sydney's north shore in 2010, defeating sitting Labor MP and former ABC broadcaster Maxine McKew. He was reelected at the 2013 and 2016 federal elections. Mr Alexander holds the seat with a margin of almost 10 per cent.

The Turnbull government is down one lower house seat while former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce fights a byelection in his NSW seat of New England.

In a statement issued on Monday night, Mr Alexander's spokesman said: ""My father was born in the United Kingdom in 1907, before moving to Australia as a very young child.

""He became an Australian citizen as soon as he could. I understand he renounced his British citizenship before I was born, because he was a proud Australian."" i",Citizenship crisis: Turnbull government MP John Alexander may be a dual citizen,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/06/another-liberal-mp-could-be-a-dual-citizen-turnbull-governments-headache-continues_a_23267777/

In the past week, we’ve watched (and rewatched) all of the latest installments which means there’s only one thing left to do. Yup, it’s time to start thinking about what might happen in the third series.

Creators the Duffer Brothers have already confirmed that it’s coming, so here are all the questions that will need answering... Will we see Eleven’s sister again? Episode seven, ‘The Lost Sister’, didn’t quite fit in with the rest of the series. While the writers needed to take Eleven out of Hawkins so that she could return and, ultimately, save everyone in the end, this episode-long shift of focus felt a little clunky. Given how divise the episode has been, we wouldn’t be too shocked if the Duffer Brothers just pretended this whole thing hadn’t happened. But as Eleven’s sister, Kali, remains somewhere out there with her group of bandits and misfits, it has cleared a path for potential future storylines.

And what about the other children used by the lab? Eleven is (obviously…) number 11 and Kali was branded ‘008’, so - assuming the scientists worked in numerical order - there are potentially at least nine other children that they experimented on. Are they still alive? And if so, will Eleven use her powers to find them, as she did her ‘sister’? Could Eleven’s mother ever be saved? It was heartbreaking to watch Millie Bobby-Brown’s character discover the truth about what happened to her mum, finding her suffering from mental and physical health issues after receiving electro-shock treatment from the lab, in order to make her forget about her daughter. She remains at her home, which begs the question of whether there’s any way she could be saved? Surely Eleven wouldn’t be able to resist visiting her again… #JusticeForBob?

Yeah, he made a lot Dad jokes, called his car “the Bobmobile” and listened to too much Kenny Rogers, but in the end, we really grew to love Sean Astin’s character. If he’s good enough for Joyce Byers, he’s good enough for us - and let’s not forget that Bob played a pretty pivotal role in figuring out where Chief Hopper was when he got lost in the Upside Down, before then coming to the rescue again when the demodogs took over the lab. Quite frankly, to call him ‘the new Barb’ would probably be an undersell, but just as fans of Nancy’s best pal demanded justice for her after season one, we’re hoping for some sort of event to commemorate for Bob’s untimely demise. At least name the Radio Shack after him. What about the two romance storylines? Lucas Sinclair and Mike Wheeler both had their first kisses, with newbie Max Hargrove and Eleven respectively, during the finale’s Snow Ball dance scene so this will obviously need addressing in future episodes. The Duffer Brothers have confirmed that there’ll be another time skip for the next series though, so it’s unlikely that we’ll get to see the immediate aftermath of the romantic encounters. What’s next for Hopper and Eleven?

Not all of the new relationships in ‘Stranger Things 2’ were romances and the pairing of Hopper and Eleven brought us so much joy, but it was tinged with sadness given that Hopper’s daughter, Sarah, died years ago. Seeing him dote on Eleven and attempt to teach her about the world was heart-breakingly beautiful and when they patched up their differences to close the gate to the Upside Down, we were literally cheering on the sofa. For season three, we’d love to see their bond get even stronger so please guys, no arguing this time. We seriously can’t take it. And Steve and Dustin?

Le mandat Trump et des surprises à retardementDonald Trump marque notre époque avec un mandat et des décisions controversées, mais il risque également de marquer plus durablement l'histoire de la présidence.
Le Congrès commence à gagner d'avantage de pouvoir que Donald Trump et c'est quelque chose qu'il ne faudrait pas voir s'accentuer.","ÉTATS-UNIS - Donald Trump ou l'utilité de la Démocratie. Mercredi 8 novembre, le chef d'État va fêter l'anniversaire de sa victoire à l'élection présidentielle face à Hillary Clinton. Deux mois précédant son investiture, puis dix mois de gouvernance, ponctués de polémiques et de faux pas. Dix mois qui lui ont suffi à se forger la réputation de pire président de l'Histoire des États-Unis, pire encore que George W. Bush.

""Nous n'avons jamais eu un président aussi mal informé sur la nature de son poste, si ouvertement menteur, si autodestructeur, ou si effronté dans ses attaques abusives contre les tribunaux, la presse, le Congrès (y compris les membres de son propre parti), et même de hauts fonctionnaires au sein de sa propre administration. Trump est un monstre de Frankenstein composé des pires attributs des présidents passés"", estimait The Atlantic au mois d'octobre. ""Cet homme-enfant déséquilibré rend le monde un peu nostalgique de l'Amérique de George W. Bush"", assénait encore le magazine Salon.

Pourtant, aujourd'hui, le pays est toujours debout. Donald Trump n'a pas, pour l'instant, précipité la nation dans le chaos comme beaucoup le redoutaient, malgré les nombreux décrets parfois très controversés qu'il a signés dès la première semaine de son mandat. Mais alors, si rien ne change quelles que soient les ""bonnes"" et ""mauvaises"" décisions prises, cela a-t-il encore un sens de voter? Et de fait, doit-on douter de l'utilité de la démocratie si, peu importe le président élu, le pays arrive à avancer tout seul? Le HuffPost a posé ces questions - volontairement provocantes, on en convient - à un spécialiste politique et à un historien. Et selon eux, à bien y regarder, les changements sont bien là, parfois subtils, mais très problématiques sur le long terme.

Bilan décevant d'un président qui devait marquer le changement

Le changement, c'était ce que les électeurs de Donald Trump attendaient de lui, se fiant à ses promesses de campagne sur l'immigration, le système de santé ou encore la façon de ""redonner sa grandeur à l'Amérique"". Il était d'ailleurs bien parti, dès la première semaine de son mandat, en signant plus d'une demi-douzaine de décrets marquant sèchement la rupture avec son prédécesseur Barack Obama.

Réforme de l'Obamacare, retrait du traité de libre-échange transpacifique (TPP), décret anti-avortement, décret anti-immigration, ou encore décret anti-terroriste... Le président avait commencé sa mission sur les chapeaux de roue. Avant d'être bien vite ramené sur terre par les membres du Congrès. Ce dernier, bien qu'à majorité républicaine, a stoppé dans leur élan plusieurs décrets présidentiels. Le blocage le plus connu étant celui de la réforme de l'Obamacare. Sa politique anti-immigration a également été mise à mal à de nombreuses reprises par des juges fédéraux au cours de l'année. Un bel exemple du mécanisme de la Constitution et de son système de répartition des pouvoirs, appelé ""check and balances"".

""C'est très difficile pour Trump de faire passer ses décisions et les faire accepter par le Congrès, même s'il est à majorité républicaine, explique au HuffPost Donald Cuccioletta, expert en politique américaine basé à Montréal. Quand on est président et que l'on veut faire passer un texte, il faut convaincre les membres du Congrès, même ceux de son propre parti, que c'est dans leur intérêt d'accepter. Barack Obama aussi a eu du mal, d'ailleurs. Mais Donald Trump, lui, n'est pas un pur produit politique républicain. Il n'est pas politicien et, on l'a vu en un an, il est incapable de convaincre les membres du Sénat et de la Chambre des représentants. Il a un caractère trop autoritaire et il a tendance à se mettre beaucoup de personnes à dos. Cela ne joue pas en sa faveur"".

Trump, un président qui ne laissera pas de traces?

Pour le moment, les initiatives de Donald Trump ont du mal à passer, mais nous n'en sommes qu'à la première année... d'un premier mandat.

En effet, il n'est pas exclu qu'il soit réélu en 2020. Cependant, au vu des relations tendues entre lui et le Congrès, il faudrait un changement d'attitude radical de la part du président pour qu'il arrive à créer le consensus et mettre les élus de son côté. Et rien n'indique que les trois années qui arrivent vont être très différentes de celle qui vient de s'écouler.

Par ailleurs, s'il n'est pas réélu ""ses successeurs ne répéteront probablement pas ses pitreries autodestructrices, tant il a blessé sa propre administration"", avance The Atlantic. ""À ce jour, il n'y a pas de décision définitive capable d'impacter réellement le futur, même pas celle sur le retrait des États-Unis des Accords de Paris. Rien n'est durablement inscrit"", analyse pour le HuffPost François Durpaire, historien et spécialiste des États-Unis, expliquant qu'une décision présidentielle prise peut être détricotée plus tard.

Derrière la barrière du Congrès, des changements concrets

Mais Donald Cuccioletta met en garde sur un autre aspect: ""ce n'est pas parce que certaines décisions de Donald Trump sont bloquées par le Congrès, qu'elles ne s'appliquent pas déjà dans certains États"". Vu de l'extérieur, d'un pays étranger, les changements ne sont pas flagrants, mais pour les Américains et les personnes concernées, les bouleversements sont nettement plus remarquables.

Pour le décret anti-immigration par exemple, ""même s'il a été bloqué sur l'ensemble du territoire par un juge fédéral, des directives ont été envoyées dans les États pour renforcer les mesures de sécurité et les contrôles. Pour les personnes venant des sept pays visés par le 'muslim ban', les critères afin de rentrer dans le pays sont beaucoup plus pointus et compliqués à remplir"". On ne compte plus le nombre de personnes qui ont déjà été renvoyées dans leur pays d'origine, rappelle-t-il.

De même pour le décret anti-avortement, ce dernier supprimant les fonds fédéraux d'aide internationale alloués à des ONG étrangères qui pratiquent l'avortement et militent pour le rendre légal. ""Au Texas, faute de subventions, les cliniques qui pratiquaient l'avortement ont pratiquement toutes disparue les femmes doivent se débrouiller toutes seules"", poursuit-il. Notons qu'avant l'arrivée de Trump à la présidence, une série de lois avait déjà été adoptée dans cet État permettant de réduire de deux tiers le budget alloué aux planning familiaux. L'arrivée du républicain au pouvoir et son décret anti-avortement a encore considérablement réduit le nombre de cliniques qui le pratiquaient.

Le mandat Trump et des surprises à retardement

Donald Trump marque notre époque avec un mandat et des décisions controversées, mais il risque également de marquer plus durablement l'histoire de la présidence. Et pas de la meilleure des façons. ""Fake news"", ""grab women by the pussy"", ""Covfefe"", ""Rocket man""... Ces mots, parmi de nombreux autres, resteront dans la mémoire commune comme les punchlines aberrantes du président des États-Unis, la plupart du temps lancées sur Twitter, son outil de communication de prédilection. L'homme est également pointé du doigt pour passer beaucoup de temps (par rapport à ses prédécesseurs) à jouer au golf. Il est aussi critiqué pour son manque de tact, d'empathie et de diplomatie. Et cela à un coût. ""Donald Trump est en train de complètement fragiliser l'assise présidentielle et de piétiner la crédibilité de son rôle sur le long terme, déplore Donald Cuccioletta. Les futurs présidents vont devoir travailler d'arrache pied pour redorer l'image présidentielle fortement entachée"".

Rétablir la réputation présidentielle au sein de son propre pays est une chose. Mais rétablir celle du pays aux yeux du reste du monde en est une autre. Avec son slogan de campagne ""Make Americain Great Again"", ""rendre à l'Amérique sa grandeur"", Donald Trump annonçait redonner à la nation sa place de leader mondial. Mais ce que l'on retient en un an, ce sont surtout ses frasques et ses attaques peu diplomatiques envers d'autres pays, alliés ou non. L'exemple le plus parlant reste l'escalade agressive de surenchères entre lui et le leader de la Corée du Nord, Kim Jong Un. Ou encore ses piques désobligeantes au maire de Londres, Sadiq Khan, après les attentats dans la capitale britannique, l'accusant de ne pas prendre au sérieux la menace terroriste.

""Donald Trump estimait que depuis des années, son pays était moqué et raillé dans le monde (...) Dans l'esprit paranoïaque de Trump, chaque nation de la planète a profité de l'Amérique d'une manière ou d'une autre, et l'accord de Paris n'était que le dernier exemple de cet abus. Ironie du sort, l'homme qui réclame constamment le respect du reste du monde est en train de mettre en péril la réputation de son pays"", assurait le magazine Salon, après l'annonce du retrait du pays des Accords de Paris. ""On dit souvent qu'il est plus facile de détruire que de créer et au cours des derniers mois, Donald Trump a prouvé cette maxime lorsqu'il s'agit de gouverner(...) rien n'a été plus gravement endommagé par Trump que la crédibilité des États-Unis dans le monde"".

Enfin, de façon beaucoup plus subtile, Donald Trump a un impact encore plus inquiétant: celui qu'il a sur la Constitution. ""Trump a prouvé en un an qu'il n'était pas capable de réellement gouverner. Personne ne lui fait vraiment confiance, il n'arrive pas à se créer d'alliés et encore moins créer le consensus. Chaque décision qu'il prend se heurte au Congrès ou aux juges fédéraux. Tout cela participe à créer un déséquilibre entre les deux parties, la présidence et le Congrès, fragilisant ainsi le système de 'check and balances', inscrit dans la Constitution. Le Congrès commence à gagner d'avantage de pouvoir que Donald Trump et c'est quelque chose qu'il ne faudrait pas voir s'accentuer. Ce n'est pas bon pour l'avenir de la Constitution"", conclut Donald Cuccioletta.

OTTAWA — A former Liberal prime minister and the party's top fundraiser are firing back at reports that raise questions about their connections to offshore tax havens.

Former prime minister Jean Chretien and businessman Stephen Bronfman both say reports suggesting they were involved in any tax avoidance scheme are false.

The pair are among more than 3,000 Canadian individuals and entities whose names come up in a leak of some 13.4 million financial records, dubbed the Paradise Papers, that outline details of offshore accounts that could be used to avoid paying high tax rates.

Neither the CRA nor any court has determined the Canadians did anything wrong.

I never had a bank account outside Canada. Jean Chretien

Among the leaked records is a register of investors in Madagascar Oil, which lists Chretien as having received 100,000 stock options.

Chretien says Madagascar Oil was a client of Heenan Blaikie, a now-defunct Canadian law firm. As a lawyer with the firm, Chretien said he did some work for Madagascar Oil but all fees were billed by and paid to the law firm itself.

""I never received any share options and I never had a bank account outside Canada,"" Chretien said in a statement Monday.

""Any news report that suggests I have or ever had or was associated in any way with any offshore account is false.""

Bronfman, a close personal friend of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, also issued a statement Monday saying he has never violated Canada's tax laws through the use of offshore tax havens. He said he has never funded nor used offshore trusts, and that all his Canadian trusts have paid all federal taxes on their income.

Stephen Bronfman attends the Liberal party's caucus retreat in Georgetown, P.E.I. on Aug. 28, 2013.

Tax avoidance measures involving offshore trusts are legal, provided that the trust is genuinely managed offshore and that Canadian taxes are paid on any Canadian contributions.

According to the Toronto Star and CBC/Radio Canada, records suggest Bronfman and his family's Montreal-based investment company, Claridge Inc., were linked to an offshore trust in the Cayman Islands.

Bronfman said he made a single loan more than 25 years ago to the trust that was repaid five months later, which was all in full compliance with Canadian law.

""Stephen Bronfman is a proud Canadian and has always fully complied with all legal requirements, including with respect to taxes,"" his statement said.

""Stephen Bronfman has never funded nor used offshore trusts. His Canadian trusts have paid all taxes on all their income to the Canadian government.""

Liberal ministers quiet on issue

On Parliament Hill, Liberal cabinet ministers refused to discuss any specific cases raised in the massive leak of documents that include client records from offshore law firm Appleby, as well as some records from offshore corporate services firms Estera and Asiaciti Trust.

Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier told reporters that Canadians have every reason to be angry about revelations of tax avoidance schemes, but that the Canada Revenue Agency is cracking down on any illegal activity.

The CRA says it is conducting more than 990 audits and more than 42 criminal investigations related to offshore tax avoidance.","Jean Chretien, Stephen Bronfman Deny 'Paradise Papers' Reports On Tax Havens",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/06/jean-chretien-stephen-bronfman-deny-paradise-papers-reports-on-tax-havens_a_23268455/

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

Gomez and Bieber reconnected earlier this week as news spread that Gomez split from singer The Weeknd after 10 months together. The former couple was spotted together again on Wednesday.

This time around, the two were seen biking in Los Angeles, flashing big smiles and laughing together. Bieber rocked an oversized red sweatshirt and matching shoes, while Gomez looked super cozy in an all-gray ensemble.

BACKGRID

The two were later photographed cuddling up to each other, with Gomez seen leaning her head on Bieber’s shoulder during a stop for coffee.

Neither Gomez nor Bieber has addressed the rumors of a rekindled relationship, but if a casual bike ride in comfy clothing with your ex doesn’t scream “we’re dating again,” then consider us highly suspicious.

The singers famously dated on and off from 2011 to 2015, forming the monolithic entity “Jelena,” which inspired leagues of young fans to feverishly root for the couple’s success.

But break up they did. Both seemed to have moved on personally and professionally ― save for a shady Instagram comment here and there.

Bieber has been linked to a handful of women since splitting from Gomez, including Sofia Richie and Haley Baldwin. Meanwhile, the “Fetish” singer began dating The Weeknd (aka Abel Tesfaye) sometime around January 2017.

The forced displacement of ethnic Rohingya people from the Rakhine state of Myanmar resulted in a massive refugee crisis in South Asia. The magnitude of this latest Rohingya refugee crisis may be comparable to two other acute refugee crises this subcontinent saw in the past.

First was the massive human relocation following the creation of India and Pakistan in 1947, and the next was the refugee exodus to India during the 1971 Bangladesh war. The exodus of Afghans into Pakistan is another massive but a more steady, long-standing process.

Among these, India was both a victim and the host during the first one and a gracious host during the second one. During the first refugee crisis, India was a newborn state, during the second one it was a young 'third world' developing democracy. Fifty years elapsed since the second refugee crisis, when the major Rohingya refugee crisis developed. And last 50 years have changed India.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now.

India is the aspiring regional superpower now. To the Western developed states, India is the face and gateway to South Asia. It seems the world elites and the Western democracies have outsourced the job stabilising the region to India. In this changed scenario, it's essential to assess and evaluate India's performance in the Rohingya refugee crisis.

While India's expected role was to play a neutral arbitrator and a stabilising force to contain the crisis, it clearly failed to do so. Although under pressure from the friendly government of Bangladesh, India has later tried to take a less one-sided stand, its continued position has been to take the Myanmar side in this conflict and undermine the ethnic cleansing and the massive humanitarian crisis that was fermenting in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.

It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner.

By failing to take the anticipated role of a neutral mediator in this crisis, India failed itself, its people as well as many others who want to see India play the role of a 'grown-up' in this part of the world. India, in sharp contrast to its arch-rival Pakistan, rightfully projects itself as an exceedingly diverse society and tolerant democracy with basic human rights, religious freedom and freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. But, in taking the wrong side of the genocidal anti-democratic forces in Myanmar, India betrayed its own creed and fundamental constitutional philosophy.

India failed its values

India definitely sees Myanmar as a neighbour of high economic and strategic potential. It seems that India is competing with China to become Myanmar's favourite strategic partner. And this narrow economic interest may have forced India to shun its broader 'regional superpower' aspiration, at least in the case of Bangladesh and Myanmar. India has made a conscious decision to abandon its closer neighbour Bangladesh with a friendly government to court a distant neighbour Myanmar, which is more likely to pick China as its economic and strategic partner.

If Myanmar can get its way removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religion will be the next targets.

The present government of Bangladesh took an immense political risk and spent almost all its remaining political capital in giving in to every single demand India had. Bangladesh paid heed to India's security concerns and did all it could to ensure India's security. Now when Bangladesh is under a serious security threat caused by this influx of refugees, it naturally expected India to stand beside her. But now, to pursue its own narrow interests, the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi threw the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the bus.

Another problem with India's pro-Myanmar stand is that the populations those are being persecuted in Myanmar are people of subcontinental ethnic heritage. Basically, the Rohingyas are people of mostly Bangladeshi origin who have lived in the Arakan region of Myanmar for centuries. The main reason they are being persecuted, ethnically cleansed and killed is the fact that they don't look like their neighbours of 'Bamar' ethnicity, the main ethnic group that makes up Myanmar's population. They look like they are from the Indian subcontinent, and they have very distinct east Indian culture. The common slur the non-Rohingya Rakhines use to denote the Rohingya is the term 'Kala (black)', alluding to the darker skin colour of the Rohingyas.

Among the refugee camps in Bangladesh, there are Rohingya of Hindu denomination along with overwhelming majority Muslims. And there is a reason that reports of Hindu-Rohingya persecution are being staged and widely publicised by Myanmar authorities, for now, Myanmar Junta wants to project the issue as a Buddhist-Muslim communal issue. But if Myanmar can get its way, removing all Muslim Rohingya from Myanmar, people of Indian subcontinental origin belonging to other religions will be the next targets.

There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion.

Most of the Rohingyas are from the Muslim minority in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. One reason the Rohingyas are so helpless is the fact that they are Muslims.

A group of Muslims, mainly under the banner of terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, have done despicable things over the last two decades. Their brutality on innocent people all over the world and the gruesome way they publicised these acts made it clear that they wanted to earn global hatred and fear. Beheading innocent captives on camera, photos of them burning people alive, photos of suicide/truck bombs got them what they wanted. The world hates them. The problem is they pulled the whole religion down too. Over 1 billion Muslims are now seen by the rest of the world, reasonably so, with suspicion, unease, and sometimes fear.

Hate always follows fear

India's PM and current policymakers are probably blinded by the fact that the Rohingya victims are Muslims, i.e. 'terrorists'. The Indian foreign policy establishment and PM Modi probably did not see the humanitarian side of the brutal ethnic cleansing, and the genocide-proportion persecution — all they are seeing is an influx of 'potential terrorists'. There is a colossal failure in understanding the fact that the Rohingya crisis is a tragedy of unfathomable proportion. Failing to contain the events leading to this tragedy that has fallen on a marginal Muslim population, India risks creating a goldmine for future terrorist recruits in its backyard.

If political advisors of PM Modi hope that a successful expulsion of Bengali-speaking Rohingyas from Myanmar will be a prelude to do similar thing from the Indian states neighbouring Bangladesh, their political acumen must be short-sighted. Neither India nor Myanmar would benefit from a chaotic festering refugee crisis in a country located between them.

For PM Modi, it is a missed opportunity to claim his stature as the first 21st-century statesman of India. And for India, the continued plight of the Rohingyas is a testament against the claim that India is the regional superpower and stabilising factor in South Asia. While India approvingly watches over the unabated ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, it fails people of its own ethnic heritage too.

Even as the government in India has campaigned to save the girl child with its Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana, ground reality has changed little. To this day mothers and girl children continue to be abandoned by families because of the baby's gender.

She flipped to her favorite passage and read aloud in a manic whisper, parroting a woman called Wanda describing her sexual fantasy of accidentally stumbling upon a farmhouse orgy and being penetrated by a donkey as punishment. Her description was detailed and, to my elementary school ears, absolutely stupefying. I felt a lump in my stomach and a tug somewhere else.

“Did you read a book about sex last night?” my mom asked the following evening, surely, I realize now, more amused than distressed. I, terrified, denied the deed and promptly buried the visual of the donkey tryst where I hoped I would never find it. Until recently, that is, when I learned of the death of the woman who brought that particular fantasy to print.

Nancy Friday died on November 5, at 84 years old, due to complications from Alzheimer’s disease. She leaves behind a contemporary world somewhat removed from the one she inhabited in 1973, when My Secret Garden was first released and the notion of women possessing sexual fantasies was, to most men, unfathomable.

“How could it be, you might ask, that women today, at the turn of the century, would still think they were the only Bad Girls with erotic thoughts?” Friday wrote in her book’s introduction. “What kind of prison is this that women impose on themselves?”

Convinced that sexual agency was crucial to the fight for gender equality, Friday set out to pierce the veil of silence shrouding women’s sexual imaginations, put in place, in part, by men who were threatened by them. She compiled an anonymous compendium of women’s fantasies, from the tepid to the obscene to the delightfully bizarre. Doctor-patient fantasies, puppy play, lengthy cucumbers and big, faceless men factor into some of the more salacious scenarios, submitted to Friday via letters, in-person conversations and recorded voice calls.

Friday became interested in female fantasies after she revealed one (involving a well endowed stranger at a football game) to a lover in bed, who promptly put on his pants and exited the premises in response. The baffling encounter revealed to Friday just how great a threat women’s unsatisfied sexual potential posed to some men.

“I can see that I was only too happily enacting his indirectly stated Pygmalion-D. H. Lawrence fantasies,” she wrote. “But mine? He didn’t want to hear about them. I was not to coauthor this fascinating script on How To Be Nancy, even if it was my life. I was not to act, but to be acted upon.”

My Secret Garden is an early manifestation of confessional writing, and reads almost like a proto-Tumblr or Reddit thread, with contributors sharing intimate secrets under a cloak of anonymity. Some fantasies incorporate well-trodden taboos like incest and rape, while others veer further into the surreal ― like a woman who yearns to be tantalized by an octopus from a Salvador Dali drawing.",'We’re As Hidden As Our Clitorises': How Nancy Friday Liberated Women's Sexuality,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/07/we-re-as-hidden-as-our-clitorises-how-nancy-friday-liberated-womens-sexuality_a_23268906/

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

➨ Das könnte euch auch interessieren: Friede mit Russland - bloss wie?

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Nur so können wir uns aus der Rolle des Aussätzigen befreien, in die wir uns selbst manövriert haben. Und einen würdigen Platz in der Geschichte der Menschheit einzunehmen.

Der Text wurde von Boris Reitschuster aus dem Russischen übersetzt.

Dancing With Her is the first of its kind, offering real-life stories of couples from around the world and advice to fiancées about their upcoming nuptials. Co-founders Tara Baker, 29, and Arlia Hassel, 30, were spurred to launch the print magazine after getting engaged in August this year. The couple, who are from Australia, started looking at wedding magazines, but were left “uninspired” by the lack of diversity and representation in the existing publications. “I guess what most people would call ‘traditional’, I would call ‘heteronormative’,” Tara told HuffPost UK.

Pinterest CLOSE ″There was a bride and a groom, women met men at the altar, men wore a suit, women wore a dress… We don’t identify as fitting into that idea, the world is full of people that identify as shades of grey rather than black or white.”

Dancing With Her Tara Baker (L) and Arlia Hassel, who co-founded 'Dancing With Her'.

So they decided to launch a long-overdue alternative. “Two-bride weddings aren’t featured in wedding magazines all that often, and we know that finding inspiration we could picture ourselves in was something that was important to us,” Tara said. “We also get the opportunity to share practical advice that is appropriate to LGBTQ+ weddings, like how to get yourself down the aisle, the legalities surrounding same-sex marriage and how to navigate the tradition of changing your last name.”

Beatrice Glenister One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

The launch of the magazine is incredibly timely, with the country holding a same-sex marriage referendum. The results of which will be revealed on 15 November. Currently same-sex couples can register their relationship as a civil union but this does not carry the same legal status as a marriage. Tara explains that many couples they’ve worked with choose to travel overseas and marry abroad, although these marriages are not currently recognised when couples return to Australian soil. For newly-engaged Tara and Arlia, who plan to marry in next year, the referendum result is incredibly personal. “We hope that when we wed in a small ceremony in August 2018, the Australian government will recognise our union as a legal marriage. If not, we haven’t considered registering our relationship with our state,” Tania explained. The couple have their sights set on a wedding in the Gold Coast Hinterland. “It’ll be an intimate, romantic affair with 20 of our closest friends and family. Nothing over the top, simple and romantic is what we will be going for on the day.”

Sarah Kennedy One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

Tara and Arlia have been involved in the ‘yes’ campaign, and are hopeful for the results. “We have our fingers (and toes) crossed that it will come in a resounding yes. In my heart, I feel that will be the way it goes… I have hope that the Australian population will vote in favour of equal love and human rights.” Tara describes the lead up to the referendum as an “emotional rollercoaster”, but that they have never felt closer to the LGBTQ community. “We can’t wait for a day where it isn’t assumed that our partner is of the opposite sex, or feel judged when we declare that the one we love is the same-sex.”

Jessie Dains One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

‘Dancing With Her’ began as an Instagram account and blog in 2016, before launching as a downloadable digital magazine in February 2017. A print magazine was a “natural progression” but also inspired by the couple’s own engagement and first-hand experience at the lack of appropriate resource. The magazine will be a quarterly publication that can be pre-ordered and delivered internationally. Volume Two is already in early stages of production. When asked why a publication such as this hadn’t been published sooner, Tara replied: “Honestly, we have no idea! Some countries have had legal marriages between same-sex couples for nearly 15 years. “We initially knew the Australian community needed a publication like this but was quick to realise women across the world who felt the same way.”

East Sussex County Council launched the ‘Get A Grip’ campaign this week to educate families and carers about primary school students taking time off for sickness and holidays. But the adverts, which appeared on bus stops, social media, and local radio, failed to resonate with over 8,000 parents who have now signed a letter claiming the ads are unfit for purpose and “will probably prove to be counterproductive”. “You are accusing parents of failing their children without any concern for context or appropriateness,” said Ella Lewis from Seaford, who started the petition. “This is disgusting and offensive and it is even worse when applied to families who are struggling with serious illnesses, traumas and ongoing disabilities and conditions.”

East Sussex County Council

East Sussex County Council distributed the letters to children who had missed at least three days in the first half of the autumn term, which ran from 5 September to 20 October. Bob Standley, the council’s head of education and inclusion, said: “There’s a perception among some parents that 95% attendance is enough, but this is simply not the case.” But Lewis says that the slogans used in the campaign - “get a grip, most parents do”, “good reasons for missing school - there are none,” and “don’t be a mug” - are dividing and alienating parents. The mother explained that a “blind attack” from the council on families whose children miss school is not helping matters. “Even when you are taking a firm stance on the subject, you need to convince and win the commitment of parents, not bully us into submission,” she said.

On September 13, Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges.

The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6.

The assault was filmed and went viral on social media sparking a national outcry for his arrest.

Manana said he wanted to reach out to the victims but his bail conditions did not allow it.

""I would initiate a process after the case to reach out to the victims, to reach out to the families so that going forward our relations are accordingly,"" he said.

Manana's legal counsel, Michael Motsoeneng Bill said he had only received the correctional supervision report on Tuesday morning, and probational officer report on Monday.

Bill said he had no proper opportunity to go through the two reports and asked if the matter could be postponed to Wednesday.

Dressed in a brown tailored suit, Manana appeared calm and smiling with some family members and friends in the gallery.

In his plea explanation in September, Manana said one of the woman, Noluthando Mahlaba who joined their table had asked him: ""Who do you think you are? You isitabane [gay].""

He said, following this remark, he intentionally assaulted Mahlaba with an open hand on her face and back.

Manana also said he pulled her hair, pulled her to the ground, kicked and punched her.

He said a fight then broke out in which he also intentionally assaulted two other women - Monoisa Duma and Thina Mopipa.

The case against his co-accused Thulani Mdaka and Cyril Madonsela has been postponed in the same court to November 16 pending a victim impact report.

NEW DELHI -- The Supreme Court today sought the government's response on four petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act and linking of bank accounts and mobile numbers with the 12-digit biometric identification number.

The apex court did not pass any interim order in the matter saying that final hearing in all Aadhaar-related issues would start before another bench in the last week of this month and the Centre has already extended the deadline till December 31.

A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan, however, said that the banks and telecom service providers should indicate the last date of linking bank accounts and mobile numbers with Aadhaar in the messages sent by them to their customers.

""We make it clear that in the messages sent by banks and telecom service providers, the date of December 31, 2017 and February 6, 2018, shall also be indicated as the last date of linking Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile numbers,"" the bench said.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for one of the petitioners, referred to a recently filed affidavit by the Centre and said the government has said the deadline for linking Aadhaar may be extended till March 31, 2018.

The bench, however, said the petitioners can raise this issue before the court which would hear all Aadhaar-related matters in the last week of November.

""There is no doubt that these arguments need consideration. The matter is going to come up in the last week of November and the time (to link Aadhaar with bank accounts) has been extended till December 31,"" the bench said.

On October 30, a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra had said that a constitution bench would be constituted and Aadhaar-related matters would come up for hearing before it in November last.

Several petitions challenging the Centre's move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for availing various services and benefits of welfare schemes have been filed in the apex court.

Recently, a nine-judge constitution bench of the apex court had held that Right to Privacy was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution. Several petitioners challenging the validity of Aadhaar had claimed it violated privacy rights.

The Centre had on October 25 told the top court that the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to receive benefits of government schemes has been extended till March 31, 2018 for those who do not have the 12-digit unique biometric identification number and were willing to enroll for it.

Some petitioners in the top court have termed the linking of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number with bank accounts and mobile numbers as ""illegal and unconstitutional"".

They have also objected to the CBSE's alleged move to make Aadhaar card mandatory for students appearing for examinations, a contention denied by the Centre.

One of the counsel representing the petitioners had earlier said the final hearing in the main Aadhaar matter, which is pending before the apex court, was necessary as the government ""cannot compel"" citizens to link their Aadhaar with either bank accounts or cell phone numbers.",SC Refuses Interim Stay On Linking Aadhar Number To Bank Accounts And Mobile Numbers,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/sc-refuses-interim-stay-on-linking-aadhar-number-to-bank-accounts-and-mobile-numbers_a_23265414/

The twins have done more than survive. They celebrated their 11th birthday in October. They've learned to swim. And despite dealing with Type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, Krista and Tatiana go to school in Vernon, B.C. for a few hours every day.

""For them to actually be here for 10 years is just a blessing,"" Hogan told HuffPost Canada in an interview. ""It just felt so good to see them get to this milestone.""

The documentary ""Inseparable: Ten Years Joined At The Head,"" follows the Hogan family for a year leading up to the girls' 10th birthday party. Along with the twins, Hogan and her husband Brendan are raising three other children: 15-year-old Rosa, 13-year-old Christopher, and 9-year-old Shaylee.

Krista and Tatiana are ordinary girls with extraordinary abilities. As craniopagus twins — conjoined twins attached at the head — they are one in 2.5 million. They share a ""thalamic bridge"" that connects their brains, allowing them to see through each other's eyes, taste what each other eats, and even know each other's thoughts without speaking.

""The abilities they have that no one else could imagine having are just incredible,"" Hogan said. They play together, and without saying a word, get up when one decides she wants to do something else.

They're just little people that are here living their lives like the rest of us. Felicia Hogan

Krista and Tatiana's doctor, pediatric neurologist Dr. Juliette Hukin, has tracked their development since they were two. ""They're the only twins that I'm aware of who are alive and remain conjoined with this shared connectivity,"" Hukin said in a press release.

Now that the girls are old enough to describe their experiences, doctors can better understand their connection, said the documentary's director and executive producer Judith Pyke.

""It was cool to hear from them about how they can see through each others' eyes or move each others' limbs,"" Pyke said in an email. ""But just as striking is they get along incredibly well.""

Tatiana and Krista Hogan pose for a photo with family.

Despite their unfathomable connection, they're very typical siblings, Hogan said. They have ""off moments"" when they argue and scream at each other.

""They're definitely different"" in personality, she pointed out.

Krista is the family's jokester. She loves playing pranks and making people laugh. She is also the bigger twin and tends to take charge, Hogan explained.

Tatiana, on the other hand, is a ""little lovebug."" She loves cuddling animals and wants to hug everyone who comes by the house.

The girls love running around outside and going camping — and like all kids these days, play video games and watch funny videos on their iPad.

Conjoined twin Tatiana and Krista Hogan are held by their mother Felicia in Vernon, B.C. on Dec. 18, 2006.

Among the many different reactor concepts being investigated in the late 1950s and early 1960s was the idea that the steam produced by a boiling water reactor, which normally goes straight to the turbine building, could be superheated (or have further heat added once it was already steam) by nuclear energy. This would greatly increase the efficiency of the plant, as well as make dry steam at a high pressure that would allow the use of (less expensive) commercially available equipment in the steam plant. Two reactors were built to investigate the idea of performing both processes in essentially the same reactor—one in South Dakota and (perhaps incredibly to today’s readers) another of a very different design on the island of Puerto Rico.

BONUS—short for BOiling NUclear Superheat reactor—was a 1959 project of General Nuclear Engineering Corporation (GNEC), which had been formed when Walter Zinn and some of his associates left Argonne National Laboratory and entered private business. Argonne had arguably been the pioneer of BWR technology, and it was not surprising that the company’s first project as a reactor vendor was for a BWR type. This BWR, however, had both a conventional boiler core (rated 37 MWt) and also four nuclear superheater elements arrayed around the core’s periphery, using very different fuel element designs (a total of 13 MWt). The reactor had a complex internal and external piping arrangement; recirculation pumps were located below the reactor.

The nuclear plant design was somewhat unique in that not just the nuclear steam supply system was inside the containment; instead, the entire power plant including the control room was inside the 190-foot-diameter structure (see below).

—

Puerto Rico, as an island nation, was interested in nuclear energy because of the fact that it had to import all of its fuel, and this included fuel for electric power generation. Nuclear energy was intended to flatten the fuel cost, as well as to make fuel available for much longer without any disruption (since nuclear plants are infrequently refueled). It was hoped that baseline data on nuclear power on such an island would be obtained through operation of this plant.

As it would happen, the “merger mania” of the 1958–1960 time period caught up with GNEC, which was bought by Combustion Engineering (C-E). While this shook up some of C-E’s management, the project at Punta Higuera, Puerto Rico, to build BONUS moved along. The small, 17-MWe plant (net output of 16.3 MWe) was actually formally ordered in January 1960 and construction began in August 1960. The project was a joint effort between the US Atomic Energy Commission and the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. As with other projects of this time, the US AEC funded the nuclear portion of the construction while PRWRA funded non-nuclear portions and would provide operating staff.

Construction was complete and the plant started up in April 1964—somewhat later than the anticipated date. Serious delays were incurred during construction as some safety modifications were required after construction began, and the instrumentation and control system had to be modified and refitted with four channel protection (not originally included). Operation was first performed by only boiling water for steam, and in a long graduated program the superheat operation was carefully introduced. The plant finally achieved full-rated power over a year later, in September 1965. This achievement had originally been targeted for February 1963.

Nagging small problems with the plant continued to occur, including corrosion of internal piping (caused by an equipment vendor using incorrect materials subject to corrosion in the high temperature steam environment) and the need to backfit unanticipated equipment to the plant. The AEC, worried about operations, pushed GNEC/C-E to provide a complete certified operating staff to train the PRWRA operators—an expense and complication not foreseen by the vendor.

Because of the mechanical troubles with the reactor and the cost to implement permanent fixes, the decision was made to terminate the project in 1968. (Generally, this also doomed the US equivalent superheat BWR.) The fuel was removed, but almost the entire plant remained; it was entombed in place. Some of the contaminated equipment was placed in the pump room below the reactor and permanently encased. Today, the nuclear plant has been set up as a museum with displays and even the complete control room with indications rigged to appear as when the plant was running. It is not open to the public however, but rather awaits some fate yet to be determined. It is constantly maintained and surveillance by the US Department of Energy (as successor to the AEC for plant ownership) continues regularly.

POSTSCRIPT

The failure of superheating BWRs was somewhat of a blow to those vendors offering BWR type plants generally. It had been hoped that the two small prototype units would be successful, and would lead to much larger units in a fairly short time.

As can be seen from the graph above (PRWRA GNEC 4), the capital cost per kilowatt for superheating BWRs was expected to become better than that for conventional BWRs when the plant ratings reached something over 250 MWe. Failure of these two prototype projects effectively ensured that this never happened.

Puerto Rico had hoped that this plant would lead to bigger and better things. It has already been operating a small test and research reactor prior to this time, in anticipation of having an established program. After the decision to terminate BONUS in 1968, PRWRA began to consider a more conventional nuclear plant. In May 1970, it ordered from Westinghouse a 583-MWe two-loop pressurized water reactor plant for a site at Islote. Practically nothing was accomplished on this project, which was finally cancelled in 1978, ending the Puerto Rican era of nuclear energy projects.

For more information: The other superheating BWR was Pathfinder.

Le 3 novembre dernier, le coup de sang de Patrice Evra en marge d'un match de l'Olympique de Marseille avait provoqué un très violent clash sur le plateau de CNews. Alors qu'il souhaitait évoquer la question du racisme dans le sport, le rappeur et activiste Rost avait été coupé brutalement par l'animateur de l'émission ""20h Foot"".

Une séquence très rapidement devenue virale sur les réseaux sociaux et qui alimente depuis la polémique. Trois jours plus tard, les deux hommes se sont donc retrouvés au même endroit pour s'expliquer en direct, mais la discussion n'a pas eu le résultat qu'escomptait Pascal Praud.

Attaqué d'emblée par un Pascal Praud qui lâchait ""Il faut convaincre: ceux qui s'en vont, ils démissionnent"", le président de l'association Banlieues Actives a fait valoir son point de vue. ""Les questions de racisme dans ce pays, il faut les mettre sur la table et en discuter pour essayer de trouver des solutions"", a-t-il rétorqué.

Melburnians are being urged to contact police if they see a smashed-in dark navy or black BMW, after a 13-year-old girl was ""left to die"" on the side of the road.

The teenager was riding her bicycle with two friends on the corner of Bell and Sussex Streets in Coburg, in Melbourne's north, just after 8pm on Sunday when she was hit by the vehicle.

She ""is absolutely fighting for life at the moment -- she may not make it,"" Assistant Commissioner Doug Fryer told a press conference on Monday morning.

The car is believed to a dark-coloured BMW sedan or coupe, with probable damage on the left-hand side and windscreen.

""There is no doubt that person who had the crash and hit that young girl is aware of it,"" Assistant Commissioner Fryer said.

""What sort of person hits a young girl and then doesn't render assistance?""

Police are looking for a woman -- either the driver of the car or a passenger -- who was seen getting out of the BMW briefly before it fled the scene.

A former St John Ambulance cadet who stopped to help the teen has described to the Herald Sun rolling the girl onto her back and revealed ""blood all over her face"".

""There is no parent -- there is no mother or father or grandparent who would ever want this to happen to their child -- let alone left on the side of the road, just to die by a person who leaves the scene and does not even bother to stop and help.""

The girl has been taken to the Royal Children's Hospital with life-threatening head injuries and broken bones, according to the ABC.

CANBERRA -- The great citizenship drip feed is leaving a dripping constitutional mess around Canberra.

Hours after the Prime Minister stated on Monday he'd been told by the Liberal Party's federal director that all Liberal Party Members ""believe that they are in compliance with the Constitution"", another federal politician was revealed as urgently trying to confirm his citizenship status.

Can Liberal MP John Alexander's as-yet unresolved citizenship situation bring down the Turnbull Government? What about an election to wipe the slate clean?

.@MathiasCormann: I assume all MPs will be truthful about when declaring their citizenship to parliament. MORE: https://t.co/xN3F6MhykG pic.twitter.com/ScrX0ZJMrx November 6, 2017

And did the Prime Minister just bring in a quasi-audit fix to either sort this mess out or somehow bring down his own Government?

We have already had the deputy PM and five senators knocked out of our fragile, finely balanced parliament.

So this is where we are at. Or Not.

Time For An Election?

We are not there yet.

But serious questions are being asked about the Turnbull Government's hold on power should it lose Alexander and any more lower house MPs.

Even Turnbull concedes there could be ""consequences"".

""If the High Court concluded there are a number of members of the House of Representatives that were not eligible to sit in the Parliament, then there would be a series of by-elections. Depending on the result of the by-elections, that could have consequences for the Government,"" Turnbull told ABC radio on Tuesday.

Citizenship debacle could spark more by-elections, Turnbull admits https://t.co/xrioXfFoDP pic.twitter.com/aWL8UVdZmx — ABC News (@abcnews) November 6, 2017

The Government has 75 votes on the floor of the 150 seat lower house without Joyce. He is seat is vacant so there are 149 current members. Under this temporary scenario, the government has lost its absolute majority, but is not a minority government. Labor has 69 votes, so to pass a no-confidence motion against the Government it would need the support of all five crossbenchers.

Independent MP Cathy McGowan is not in that camp and has been offering to ""continue to supply confidence and support to the Government"".

Speaker Tony Smith has a casting vote in the event of a tie but indicated in May he is unlikely to use it to give the Government a majority.

But lose another lower house MP and reduce the Government to at least 74 members while the results of by-elections are waited on? That is a whole new hung parliament ball game.

The next federal election is currently due mid-2019, but if the federal parliament goes further down the rabbit hole, a snap election would become a live option for the Prime Minister to call to dispense with a series of by-elections and essentially reset the parliament.

No Audit, But PM Clears 2017

Didn't the PM fix this yesterday?

Turnbull and his Cabinet certainly shifted and acknowledged calls for greater transparency but his proposal, for which he is seeking the support of Labor, is no full independent audit and appears designed to give the Government a little breathing space.

Under the plan all federal politicians will be required to publicly detail their citizenship history within 21 days of the individual houses of Parliament approving the measure.

It is a demand to declare to the register of Members' Interests whether he or she was not, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, a citizen of any country other than Australia -- and failure to do so would be contempt of Parliament. But it is still a voluntary disclosure proposal.

It has to be noted that omissions or incorrect additions to the register are reasonably common and are usually only uncovered through diggings by the media.

Malcolm Turnbull concedes 'consequences' for government if citizenship claims more MPs https://t.co/KPYRbMKqYJ via @fergushunter #auspol — Federal Politics (@PoliticsFairfax) November 6, 2017

There is no mention of ""entitlement"" to citizenship in the proposed declaration, a key part of the High Court's citizenship ruling. And while parliamentarians are asked to detail the place and date of the birth of parents, there is no requirement to declare the place and date of the birth of grandparents.

The onus remains on the MP and Senator, and Turnbull is not about to create a ""huge audit office"".

""If you are going to be in a position where you say you do not trust anything any member of Parliament says in their disclosures, then ... you would literally be creating a huge audit office,"" Turnbull said on Tuesday.

""The system of voluntary disclosure with obviously very heavy penalties, political penalties and personal reputational penalties of people, you know, to conceal things or don't disclose things honestly, I think that works and I think it will work well here.""

The House sits for two more weeks in 2017 so the proposed 21-day time-frame, if passed, covers the rest of the year, the fragile period for the Government period without a Member for New England shoring up the working majority.

Labor's Penny Wong has described the proposal as a ""blatant attempt to skate through this difficult period to next year.""

But What About John Alexander?

We simply don't know yet but the Member for Bennelong is urgently checking his citizenship status.

Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born to British citizens are automatically given citizenship of the UK by descent.

Alexander was born in 1951 to a British born father.

If he is a dual citizen it will trigger a by-election. He is not in a safe seat. He'd indicated he was going to retire at the next election.

""John Alexander has stated publicly and this is what he said to the party, that he believes he is not a dual citizen,"" Turnbull told RN Breakfast on Tuesday.

But that is where the PM's Alexander commentary ends.

""I am not going to start front running this process,"" he said. ""We have got respect the process that is set up in the electoral act and the constitution. People should make their declarations and then cases can be referred.

""If a member believes that are a dual citizen now and are ineligible to sit in the parliament then they should resign.""

But, then this.

""I take it as a given that every member of the house and the Senate, as of today, believes that they are eligible to sit in the house or the Senate,"" Turnbull stated.

Labor's Penny Wong says John Alexander must be referred to the High Court. — Karen Barlow (@KJBar) November 7, 2017

Alexander ""believes"" he is an Australian citizen but at this point there is no proof and it is yet to be proven.

""My father was born in the United Kingdom in 1907, before moving to Australia as a very young child. He became an Australian Citizen as soon as he could. I understand he renounced his British citizenship before I was born, because he was a proud Australian. I was born in 1951 as an Australian citizen."" John Alexander MP statement

Referendum?

Is the Constitution outdated? Does it need to be changed to reflect Australia's multicultural society?

Liberal MP Craig Laundy wants a referendum to allow MPs to be dual citizens as he is concerned that dual citizenship had been ""demonised"" and said he would rather people ""celebrated"" it.

""I just don't think it should be a reason you should be disqualified from standing for parliament,"" he told the ABC.

Leaving aside that referendums are notoriously difficult to successfully pass and there is a look here that abolishing Section 44 (i) may be politicians looking after their own jobs, the prime minister is pushing back on main argument of having dual citizens in parliament.

""Craig's raised that point. It's a fair point and, in many countries, dual citizenship – like the UK – is not a bar. But I think the more direct question is, should you be disqualified by a foreign citizenship of which you have no knowledge and which you have never accepted.""

He is sending all this to a committee, the joint standing on electoral matters, ""and we have to look at, um, a couple of things"".

There are possibly changes coming to prevent a situation where MPs inadvertently become foreign citizens of other countries.

During the research, conducted by Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg , 43 patients with “severe” or “moderately severe” depression underwent an art therapy course.

Art therapy has a “clear effect” on severe depression, helping some people to get back to work after time off, new research suggests.

According to the researchers the majority of the participants were so affected by their depression that they were unable to work at the start of the study.

The individual art therapy took place in psychiatry or primary care and was conducted by a specially trained therapist.

Each session began with a short briefing and a relaxation exercise. After that participants created artwork with crayons and water colours.

“The materials were simple, allowing people to doodle and feel free to express themselves the way they wanted to, and then they would talk about the picture and its significance,” Christina Blomdahl, PhD at the institute of health and care sciences and licensed occupational therapist and art therapist, explained.

After 10 hour-long treatment sessions the patients had improved on an average of almost five steps on a rating scale used for depression.

Blomdah said this represents a large leap that entails a “considerable” change to everyday life, and sometimes it may also mean that a patient is able to return to work.

Anxiety, sleep, ability to take initiative and emotional involvement are some of the factors that are assessed. In the control group that had not undergone art therapy there was no definite change.

“The conclusion is that it was the art therapy that facilitated their improvement,” Blomdah said.

“Painting pictures based on themes and discussing the pictures with the therapist promotes self-reflection and brain stimulation that takes place outside of the conscious mind.”

Although Blomdahl’s study was based on adults, Mary­-Rose Brady, director of operations at the British Association of Art Therapists, previously told HuffPost UK art therapy can be particulalry useful for children struggling with mental ill health.

“We know that children who can’t understand or name their feelings are more likely to ‘act them out’, so art therapy can provide relief to a child whose only previous option was to dissolve into tears or have an angry outburst in response to overwhelming feelings,” she said.

“Art materials enable children to externalise troubling or confusing emotions, giving them form and enabling them to make links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, perhaps for the first time.”

Debbie Thwaites, founder of art therapy charity Shine Again, explained how this works.

“One young boy I saw just wanted to paint poo,” she said.

“He wasn’t able to say ‘this person is making me feel like poo’, but he was able to get all the brown and black colours out, make a big mess and say ‘that’s what I feel like’.”

Based on the recent findings, Blomdahl hopes that art therapy will be used more extensively in healthcare.

“Based on evidence requirements it has been more or less scrapped by psychiatry, but this is one of the largest studies that has been conducted in this area,” she said.

“It is a step that may lead to more people being trained in it and the method being used again.”","Art Therapy Has 'Clear Effect' On Severe Depression, Research Finds",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/art-therapy-has-clear-effect-on-severe-depression-research-finds_uk_5a0182abe4b066c2c039ee66

A me il lavoro piace da sempre, non ho mai capito come si possano contare i minuti al termine dell'orario, gli anni che mancano alla pensione. Devi essere un po' grigio dentro. Un solo anno quindi, per cercare di fare nel miglior modo possibile, imparare in fretta da chi ne sa di più e capire se c'è qualcosa da migliorare ancora. Provare a cambiare, controllare se funziona e partecipare tutto con chi ha lo stesso interesse, condividendo metodo e strumenti, in trasparenza. Tutto questo per loro, i bambini che erano in uscita dagli orfanotrofi.

Era il 2004, la chiusura per legge era stabilita entro due anni ma tutti dicevano che non c'erano abbastanza case famiglia e comunità pronte ad accoglierli e prendersene cura. Così mi sono detto quando ho mollato tutto, facciamo qualche cosa anche noi.

Con mia moglie Petra abbiamo pensato di essere fortunati a poterci permettere una scelta del genere, che sarebbe stato bello condividere un po' della nostra fortuna con i 30 mila piccoli e meno piccoli che risultavano allora vivere fuori dalla loro famiglia in giro per i vari istituti d'Italia.

Quanti fossero realmente le case e i piccoli, in realtà nessuno lo sapeva. Ma la cosa che fa arrabbiare è che nessuno lo sappia neanche oggi. È una di quelle vergogne pubbliche per cui mi viene da rispondere male. L'hanno detto anche in Europa che non potevamo continuare così, con i pezzi di carta sparsi tribunale per tribunale, comune per comune. Tant'è. Molti dei nostri piccoli, da quando abbiamo iniziato a proporre gratuitamente l'adozione di ""Dado"" (si chiama così la nostra anagrafe protetta) o a sollecitare la realizzazione di un sistema simile, sono diventati maggiorenni.

Abbiamo costituito una fondazione, Domus de Luna, ci abbiamo messo un po' di soldi, impegno, tanto cuore. E In questi anni qualcosa abbiamo fatto. Con umiltà e rispetto, a bilanciare lo spirito verso il nuovo e il diverso. Perché non ne sai mai abbastanza e perché devi sempre pensare alle ricadute che hanno le tue scelte sulla vita degli altri. Senza abdicare la responsabilità della scelta ma arricchendola di contributi e critiche.

Abbiamo cominciato a operare Domus de Luna, con una comunità nuova che li accogliesse e li curasse quando erano feriti dall'incuria, dal maltrattamento, dagli abusi di chi avrebbe dovuto proteggerli. Casa delle Stelle, così è stata chiamata la prima comunità e poi la cooperativa che si occupa di tutte le altre. Perché oggi le comunità sono diventate quattro e ospitano anche le mamme con i loro piccoli, poco meno di 200 a oggi. Basandosi su un metodo che sembra funzionare ma che deve continuare a migliorare.

L'anno sabbatico aveva già cominciato ad allungarsi e noi a pensare anche al dopo.

Nasce allora la Locanda dei Buoni e Cattivi, un ristorante con camere e appartamenti in cui persone in situazioni di grave disagio e fragilità possono cercare il proprio riscatto, attraverso un lavoro che restituisce senso e dignità. Ragazzi che hanno vissuto fuori famiglia ma non solo. Una cooperativa sempre più autonoma gestisce l'attività e si prende oneri e onori.

Sempre pensando al fuori, abbiamo aperto poi l'Exmè, un ex mercato di periferia, abbandonato per tanti anni alla droga e alla violenza, dove la musica e l'arte hanno preso il posto dello spaccio e delle scommesse sugli incontri clandestini di cani, talvolta di ragazzi. L'Exmè è diventato anche il posto dove si discute, un luogo dove si fa formazione ad alti livelli e si realizzano opere importanti con Writers che da mezza Europa vengono a dipingere i palazzi grigi. Ma dove si gioca anche a biliardino, ci si tuffa nella piscina fuori terra, si fa social zumba e ci si sfida a pallone. Un luogo di Domus de Luna, la casa di tanti. Sono tante le organizzazioni che hanno scelto di partecipare quest'intervento un po' visionario ma così bello e utile.

La Luna? Ci dicevano che non avevamo i piedi per terra, che pensavamo di realizzare cose che non potevano concretizzarsi, che volevamo la luna. Per questo la luna c'entra, per questo la nostra fondazione si chiama Domus de Luna.

Après les révélations sur la reine d'Angleterre, et le chanteur Bono, c'est au tour d'Apple, de Nike et du français Dassault d'être pris dans la tourmente.

Voici comment ils se démènent pour réduire leur contribution au fisc, au prix de numéros d'équilibriste sur la ligne jaune, à ne pas dépasser, de l'évasion fiscale.

Apple préfère l'île de Jersey pour mieux payer ses impôts aux États-Unis

Apple a choisi l'île de Jersey, paradis fiscal bien connu, pour réduire son taux d'imposition lorsque ses montages en Irlande ont été pointés du doigt il y a quatre ans, ont rapporté le 6 novembre plusieurs médias, dont le New York Times.

Lorsque des parlementaires américains puis des officiels irlandais ont examiné à partir de 2013 les dispositifs pour réduire très fortement ses impôts grâce à des filiales en Irlande, le fabricant de l'iPhone a décidé de chercher un autre endroit favorable, explique le quotidien américain.

Mi-2014, sous la pression d'autres pays, l'Irlande a souhaité mettre fin a l'une des astuces d'optimisation fiscale utilisée dans ce pays par Apple, et d'autres multinationales.

Avec l'aide d'Appleby, Apple a alors jeté son dévolu sur Jersey, dépendance de la Couronne britannique, qui n'impose pas les entreprises, poursuit le New York Times, qui avance aussi que le groupe a ""accumulé plus de 128 milliards de dollars de profits offshore - et sans doute plus - qui ne sont pas imposés aux Etats-Unis et à peine dans d'autres pays"".

Selon des échanges de mails évoqués par le New York Times, Apple tenait à ce que cette recherche reste secrète. Sollicité par l'AFP, Apple n'a pas donné suite.

La groupe a fini par publier un communiqué d'une longueur inhabituelle: ""Lorsque l'Irlande a changé ses lois fiscales en 2015, nous nous y sommes conformés"" en procédant à certaines modification.

Apple reconnaît que ""parmi ces changements, (sa) filiale détenant ses liquidités à l'étranger a été domiciliée à (...) Jersey"" mais que ce choix était ""spécifiquement"" motivé par la volonté de ""s'assurer que ses obligations fiscales et ses paiements aux Etats-Unis n'étaient pas réduits"", sous-entendu par une éventuelle hausse de son imposition ailleurs.

Dassault livre ses jets de luxe à des sociétés bidons de l'île de Man

Chez Dassault, on a le sens du commerce. D'après Le Monde, la maison sait se montrer arrangeante avec les clients près de leurs sous. Ainsi, Dassault n'a pas hésité à livrer plusieurs jets privés à un riche homme d'affaires russe sur l'île de Man pour échapper à la TVA française.

Oleg Tinkoff, qui a fait fortune dans l'électronique, la production de bière et la finance, a acheté en 2013 un petit Falcon 2000LX (21 millions d'euros), revendu en 2014 pour acheter un 900LX (32,8 millions d'euros), avant de se raviser pour le 7X en 2016 (41,4 millions d'euros).

Or, d'après les documents examinés par Le Monde, Dassault n'a pas facturé de TVA. Pourquoi? Parce qu'il revenait à l'île de Man, lieu de résidence de la société acheteuse, de percevoir les sommes. Sauf qu'elle ne l'a jamais fait...

Grâce à un jeu de sociétés écrans, Oleg Tinkoff a économisé des millions d'euros de TVA. ""Le Russe s'est donc loué son propre avion à lui-même pour donner l'illusion que la coquille vide de l'île de Man produisait une activité commerciale, afin d'obtenir son laissez-passer dans l'espace aérien européen sans jamais payer la moindre TVA"", résume le quotidien.

Pour Dassault, la plaisanterie pourrait prendre un mauvais tour. D'après le code des impôts, cette ""exonération ne s'applique pas lorsqu'il est démontré que le fournisseur savait ou ne pouvait ignorer que le destinataire présumé de l'expédition ou du transport n'avait pas d'activité réelle"". Or, plusieurs e-mails semblent bien le prouver...

Comment Nike passe entre les mailles du fisc hollandais

L'équipementier sportif américain Nike profite d'un ""trou"" dans la législation néerlandaise pour réduire à seulement 2% son taux d'imposition en Europe, selon de nouvelles révélations publiées par le journal Le Monde.

Deux sociétés basées au Pays-Bas concentrent ""tous les revenus européens"" de Nike et lui permettent ainsi d'échapper ""à la taxe sur les bénéfices dans les pays où il vend effectivement les chaussures"".

L'équipementier ne paie ainsi que 2% d'impôt sur les bénéfices contre 25% pour la moyenne des entreprises européennes. ""Pour réussir ce tour de force, Nike a utilisé toutes les ressources du système fiscal néerlandais et ses immenses possibilités d'optimisation"", assure Le Monde.

Le groupe américain se paie ""à lui-même le droit d'utiliser sa marque"" et parvient ainsi à réduire ""artificiellement ses profits et donc baisser ses impôts, tout en constituant un trésor avec ces royalties"", explique le quotidien.

Ce schéma, mis en place en 2014, ""a permis à Nike de réduire sensiblement son taux d'imposition global, passé de 24% à 16% en trois ans"", tandis que les pays européens ont demandé aux Pays-Bas de combler cette lacune.

L'ONG Oxfam a réagi en qualifiant Nike de ""mauvais payeur"". ""Ces dizaines de milliards qui échappent à l'impôt au bénéfice d'une infime minorité d'ultra-riches et de multinationales représentent des pertes considérables pour les budgets des Etats, et ce sont les plus pauvres qui en paient le prix"", a déclaré Manon Aubry, porte-parole pour la France, citée dans un communiqué.

""Ce que prouve également le montage fiscal de Nike à travers les Pays-Bas, c'est que le système d'évasion fiscale est organisé depuis l'Union européenne et (cela) rappelle une nouvelle fois l'urgence de s'attaquer aux paradis fiscaux européens"", a-t-elle souligné, appelant Bruxelles à effectuer des réformes.

The Irish band, well known for its poverty-fighting efforts, has faced past criticism over its tax arrangements.

U2 was heavily criticized in 2006 for moving its corporate base from Ireland to the Netherlands, where royalties on music incur virtually no tax.

In 2011, protesters inflated a giant balloon reading ""U Pay Tax 2?"" during U2's set at the Glastonbury Festival.

The Ausra shopping centre is located in the town of Utena, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. The 3,700 square-meter (40,000 square-foot) mall was built in 2006 and sold to unknown foreign investors in 2007.

Its management has told reporters they were not aware Bono's involvement in the property's ownership.

Preheat the oven to 180°C degrees (fan) and grease and line three 22cm non-stick cake tins with butter and baking paper. Put the oranges into a small pan and cover with boiling water. Bring to the boil over a high heat and boil for 20 minutes, until soft. Drain the oranges and cut into quarters, removing any obvious pips. Tip into a blender and blend for a few minutes until fine. Pour into a mixing bowl and set to one side to cool. Place the butter, sugar and orange blossom water in the blender and blend for about 5-6 minutes until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, blending each one until smooth. Pour in the oil and blend together. Sift the flour in a mixing bowl and add the almonds. Stir together. Gradually add the flour to the butter mixture, blending each time until incorporated. Add the orange purée and mix well. Divide the mixture between the three cake tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until cooked and a skewer comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Meanwhile, to make the filling, tip the ricotta, yoghurt, icing sugar and orange blossom water into a mixing bowl and beat together with a hand blender until smooth. It will be a little textured due to the nature of ricotta. Cover and chill in the fridge until needed. For the candied oranges, put the sugar into a non-stick frying pan over a high heat and pour in 450ml water. Bring to the boil and boil for 5-6 minutes, shaking occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the oranges, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes each side, turning with tongs. Remove from the pan, shaking off any excess syrup and lay the slices out on baking paper to cool. Reserve the syrup. Prick the tops of the cakes with a fork while they are still in the tins. Spoon the reserved orange syrup over them. Leave for a further 20 minutes, then remove from their tins and place on a wire rack. To assemble, put one of the cakes on a cake stand, smooth over a third of the filling and top with a second cake. Add another third of the filling and top with the final cake. Smooth the remaining filling over the top of the cake, then finish with the honeycomb, candied orange slices, almonds and rose petals. Drizzle with honey and serve with another slice of candied orange per serving.

Opening up to The Mirror about the matter, Alex admitted: “Matt and I have never discussed wages, but I assumed we got paid the same.
I guess everybody else was.”Both Alex and Matt front other projects for ‘The One Show’, so their annual BBC wages - a maximum of £449,999 and £499,000 respectively - don’t just include what they’re paid for the nightly BBC One magazine show.
“You have said that you will ‘sort’ the gender pay gap by 2020, but the BBC has known about the pay disparity for years.","This report highlighted, among other things, the disparity between what men and women are paid at the company, including the fact that there could be as much of a £100,000 gap between what co-hosts Alex and Matt earn.

Earlier this year, the BBC made the salaries of its highest-earning employees public as part of a new government initiative, which included an array of the corporation’s on-screen talent.

‘The One Show’ presenter Alex Jones has expressed her shock upon discovering that she is paid less than co-host Matt Baker .

Opening up to The Mirror about the matter, Alex admitted: “Matt and I have never discussed wages, but I assumed we got paid the same.

“I was quite shocked. I guess everybody else was.”

Both Alex and Matt front other projects for ‘The One Show’, so their annual BBC wages - a maximum of £449,999 and £499,000 respectively - don’t just include what they’re paid for the nightly BBC One magazine show.

After the figures were published, Alex was one of a number of high-profile women who co-signed an open letter to BBC director Tony Hall, calling for him to address the gender pay gap at the corporation, which was also supported by sports presenter Clare Balding, journalist Victoria Derbyshire and ’Today’ programme host Mishal Husain.

The letter said: “The pay details released in the annual report showed what many of us have suspected for many years ... that women at the BBC are being paid less than men for the same work.

“Compared to many women and men, we are very well compensated and fortunate. However, this is an age of equality and the BBC is an organisation that prides itself on its values.

“You have said that you will ‘sort’ the gender pay gap by 2020, but the BBC has known about the pay disparity for years. We all want to go on the record to call upon you to act now.”",Alex Jones Admits 'Shock' Upon Learning She Was Paid Less Than Matt Baker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-matt-baker-one-show-pay_uk_59fed409e4b0baea263232a7?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Éric Vuillard a été récompensé par le prix Goncourt pour son roman ""L'ordre du jour"", Olivier Guez par prix Renaudot pour son livre ""La disparition de Josef Mengele"".

Ces deux livres, le premier publié en mai, le second en août, s'intéressent à un même thème: la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Si le récit-roman grinçant d'Éric Vuillard retrace les coulisses de la légende de l'Allemagne nazie, celui d'Olivier Guez raconte l'histoire vraie de la fuite en Amérique du Sud de Josef Mengele un médecin tortionnaire nazi.

Ce point commun a interpellé plusieurs commentateurs.

La seconde guerre, et plus particulièrement le nazisme, sont-ils le sujet de prédilection des prix littéraires? Pour répondre à cette question, nous avons d'abord choisi de nous concentrer sur les romans primés depuis 20 ans par les quatre prix littéraires les plus vendeurs de l'Hexagone: le Goncourt, le Renaudot, le Goncourt des lycéens et le prix Fémina. Parmi ceux-là, lesquels avaient pour sujet la guerre 39-45 puis la guerre tout court? Découvrez ci-dessous l'infographie regroupant nos résultats.

En observant les graphiques, on observe que le prix qui a récompensé le plus de livres traitant de la guerre 39-45 est le Goncourt des lycéens avec 4 romans sur 20. Un résultat qui s'explique sans doute par le jury de ce prix très apprécié des lecteurs. En effet, chaque année depuis 1988, environ 2000 lycéens votent pour leur livre préféré. La Seconde Guerre mondiale est au programme de ces élèves, de la seconde au BTS.

Si l'on regarde les chiffres des livres traitant de la guerre, en général, récompensés par ces quatre prix littéraires confondus lors des vingts dernières années, on observe que 17 ouvrages ont été primés sur les 80 ayant reçu un prix, soit près d'un quart.

C'est presque autant qu'un autre grand sujet de la littérature : les histoires d'amour. En vingt ans, le Goncourt a remis 4 prix à des romances, le Renaudot 2, le Goncourt des lycéens 4 et le prix Fémina 4.

The Jammu and Kashmir government has declined to give Rs 10 lakh compensation to Farooq Ahmed Dar, the ""human shield"" tied to an Army jeep and taken around the Srinagar parliamentary constituency during the bypoll on April 9.

Jammu and Kashmir State Human Rights Commission chairperson Justice Bilal Nazki had directed the state government in July to give the compensation amount to Dar.

There was ""no scheme or policy in vogue in the state, which could cover the payment of compensation"" in such matters, the state government said in its reply to the human rights panel recently.

The statement argued that an FIR was filed and compensation would tantamount to establishing the guilt of the accused without affording him the opportunity to be heard.

The statement argued that an FIR was filed and compensation would tantamount to establishing the guilt of the accused without affording him the opportunity to be heard.

In the four-page reply, filed through Deputy Secretary (Home) Mushtaq Ahmed, the state government said the empowered committee of the government had examined the order of the rights panel and observed that the grounds on which compensation was recommended ""cannot be accepted"".

The state government, it said, had discharged its obligation by registering an FIR in the matter in the Beerwah police station and consequently initiating the investigation.

A masked Kashmiri Muslim protester puffs on a cigarette as a fellow protester talks to him during a protest against Indian government and Indian army for honouring Major Leetul Gogoi for tying Kashmiri man Farooq Dar to the bonnet of an army vehicle, on May 26, 2017, in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, India.

""That pending completion of the investigation in the matter, the recommendation with regard to payment of compensation to the complainant (Dar), shall tantamount to establish the guilt of the accused without affording him an opportunity of being heard,"" the reply accessed by PTI said.

The response will be placed before Nazki on November 13.

While asking the government to give Rs 10 lakh compensation to Nazki, the rights panel in its July 10 order had refused to direct the Army in the case, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the force.

Dar was tied to the bonnet of an Army vehicle and taken around 19 villages in Budgam during the Lok Sabha bypoll on April, purportedly as a shield against stone pelters.

A video grab showed the youth tied to an Army vehicle, eliciting sharp reactions from civil society. However, the Army backed Major Leetul Gogoi, who had tied Dar, and honoured with him with the Army chiefs Commendation Card for his sustained efforts in counter-insurgency operations.

He said he took the step to save local people.

The Army's claims that Dar was among the stone pelters was not substantiated by local police officials, who established Dar's statement that he was on his way to another village to for offering condolences.

Ittefaq offers promise to begin with but ultimately it fails to leave any lasting impact.","ADVERTISEMENT

Every time a film presents different versions of the same story, the film critics can't help but compare it to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950). A couple of examples that come to mind are Rakhi Gulzar's Talvar (2015) and Sudhir Mishra's Inkaar (2013). In Abhay Chopra's Ittefaq, a remake of the 1969 film of the same name, we learn that a famous author is charged for committing two murders on the same night: his wife, and a lawyer whose house he accidentally breaks into while trying to escape.

Throughout the interrogation, the author maintains that he is innocent. However, his account of what actually happened that night completely differs from the account of the dead lawyer's wife. Now, all those who have compared Ittefaq with Rashomon are clearly missing the point. The fact of the matter is that in Rashomon, Kurosawa never makes an attempt to lead the viewer. He merely shows us the same event from four different points of view. Rashomon doesn't feed us with lies, only the different faces of truth. Ittefaq, on the other hands, keeps feeding us with lies. Alas, even the lies are not good enough to be deemed believable!

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like Golmaal Again (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers.

When a Rohit Shetty no-brainer like ""Golmaal Again"" (2017) tells you ""Iss Diwali Logic Nahin Sirf Magic"", you can perhaps afford to suspend logic but when a murder mystery expects you to forget logic then you just can't help but question the competency of the makers. Now, Ittefaq has been described as smart and gripping by some. While the film is certainly gripping for the most part, calling it smart would be a grave misjudgment. In Ittefaq's big reveal towards the end, the killer, minutes before boarding an international flight, confesses to the investigating officer during a telephonic conversation and offers a detailed account of the chain of events leading to the crime.

The officer is so thrilled to hear the killer's exhilarating account that he just doesn't seem interested in exercising the protocol needed to prevent the airplane from taking off. If that's not difficult enough to digest then just imagine how the police, during the course of investigation, can't figure out that the author's wife happened to be a client of the lawyer's. Isn't this connection the key to solving the two murders? How come an investigating officer who is smart enough to trace the hidden murder weapon is unable to figure out this basic fact? The film very conveniently tries to mislead us for nearly two hours, only to set us up for one lofty final twist in the vein of The Usual Suspects, merely adding insult to injury.

""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""

Whenever one speaks of crime and investigation a reference to Sir Authur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes is inevitable. ""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,"" says the super-sleuth in the short story titled ""The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"" (1926). Ittefaq fails to pay any heed to this basic science of deduction . The end result is an average whodunit that seems to have little regard for the viewer's intelligence. Another time tested tool to assess suspense thrillers is to watch them a second or a third time. While films like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017), "" Gone Girl "" (2014), ""Teesri Manzil"" (1966), ""Manorama Six Feet Under"" (2007) and "" Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! "" (2015) would hold up well on subsequent viewings, an average film like Ittefaq will most likely struggle to hold the viewer's attention during a second or a third viewing. In comparison to the remake, the original, directed by Yash Chopra, is more than capable of holding the viewer's attention on subsequent viewings, even after all these years.

Usually it's the movie's plot and performances that can make it worthy of subsequent viewings. The editing, direction, cinematography and background score can of course immen sely add to the overall experience. Take the case of Shekhar Kapoor and Karan Razdan-directed detective television series ""Tehkikaat"" which used to air on Doordarshan during the mid-90s. While the performances were a wee bit melodramatic and the plots often lacked the brilliance of a Sherlock Holmes or a Byomkesh Bakshi, the chilling background score and the camerawork added a different layer of mystery.

It's a bit perplexing to think why the makers, especially given its co-produced by Dharma Productions, Red Chillies Entertainment, and B.R. Studios, didn't focus on at least getting a strong background score in place? With the exception of Akshaye Khanna, Ittefaq is also quite average on the acting front. While Sonakshi Sinha has her moments in the movie, Sidharth Malhotra looks a bit flat. But he alone can't be blamed for it, for an average part requires an above-average actor. Given his limitations as a performer, Sidharth seems to have tried his best but unfortunately on this occasion his best just doesn't turn out to be good enough. Ittefaq offers promise to begin with but ultimately it fails to leave any lasting impact. The film can serve as a decent way to spend your free time when you have nothing better to indulge in and that too only as long as you can do away with any logical thinking.

What does this mean for Grace Mugabe?","President Robert Mugabe on Monday fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who for so long looked like he would succeed the longtime Zimbabwe president.

Here's what you need to know:

Unexpected?

Not entirely. Mugabe - and particularly his wife Grace - have been stepping up their verbal attacks on Mnangagwa, 75, for weeks now. The first couple were outraged when Grace Mugabe was booed at a rally in Bulawayo on Saturday. That was blamed on Mnangagwa bussing in his supporters. Grace Mugabe led exactly the same charge against a vice president in 2014, when she got Joice Mujuru fired.

How has Mnangagwa reacted?

His spokesperson, Nharo Gwatidzo told Bloomberg on Monday evening: ""There's nothing to say or do... we've been fired."" That's in keeping with Mnangagwa's character as we know it. He has stoically refused to be baited by Grace.

But why was he fired?

Officially the line is that he ""consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability"". Unofficially, analysts say it's because he - like Mujuru before him - represented too much of a challenge to the Mugabes as the president enters his mid-90s.

Any chance of a coup?

It's long been suspected that Mnangagwa has the backing of some top military officials. But as for the lower ranks of the army: no-one knows how deep, if at all, their support might run. Social media was awash with speculation yesterday that Mnangagwa might actually leave or be about to leave the country. For now, there's no evidence of that.

What does this mean for Grace Mugabe?

It means she's got her way and got Mnangagwa out of the direct line to power, at least for now. It means, at least on paper, that her G40 faction (ex-info minister Jonathan Moyo, Local Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere etc) is in a strong position. It also likely means she will be made a vice president. That doesn't mean that there'll certainly only be her and Phelekezela Mphoko in the hot spots: there have been moves for THREE vice presidents.

And for the opposition?

No-one's asking that.. yet. The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change has its own problems: Morgan Tsvangirai is seriously ill, there are struggles within his party as to who should succeed him and the opposition isn't doing well on getting its supporters out to register to vote. Could Mnangagwa's dismissal mean a weakened Zaunu-PF? That's obviously not what Mugabe himself is banking upon. Time will tell.

What Zimbabweans are saying on Twitter:

Canterbury-based law lecturer Alex Magaisa: ""The croc (Mnangagwa's nickname) has run out of water.""

Journalist Clarkson Mambo: ""Is @ZANUPF_Official going to expel former VP Mnangagwa from the party or will he be demoted to an ordinary card carrying member?""

Brezh Malaba, also a journalist: ""I told you to expect a BIG announcement.""

@ddzmatara: ""The myth that ED was too big to be fired has been busted. He is but an ordinary man after all.""

Bei den Jamaika-Verhandlern herrscht dicke Luft

Zwar machen die Grünen Kompromissangebote

Aus der CSU werden die aber harsch zurückgewiesen

Die Grünen strecken die Hand in Richtung FDP und Union aus. Doch gedankt wird es ihnen nicht.

Unmittelbar nach einem Angebot der Grünen, im Rahmen einer Einigung auf den bislang angestrebten festen Endtermin für Neuzulassungen von Verbrennungsmotoren zu verzichten, gab sich der CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hart in der Sache und besonders rüde im Ton, berichtet die ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"".

Dobrindt sagte der ""SZ"": ""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss.""

Seehofer hatte zuvor moderate Töne angeschlagen

Deutlicher kann man das Annäherungsangebot eines Gesprächspartners kaum ausschlagen. Dobrindts aggressive Haltung ist besonders bemerkenswert angesichts der Tatsache, dass sich der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer bislang betont anders verhalten hat.

Auch am Dienstagmorgen schlug er moderate Töne an. Er sagte der ""SZ"", der Schritt der Grünen sei ""auf jeden Fall förderlich"". Eine Koalition bestehe immer aus einem Interessenausgleich, entsprechend sei der Start zur zweiten Runde ""sehr ansprechend und verheißungsvoll"".

Nur Stunden zuvor hatte Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir in einem Zeitungsinterview angeboten, den festen Termin 2030 aufzugeben, sollten sich Union, FDP und Grüne in den Grundzügen in die richtige Richtung bewegen.

Grünen rücken von Maximalforderung ab

Der Stuttgarter Zeitung sagte Özdemir: ""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können.""

Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Nach Informationen der ""SZ"" ist das keineswegs ein Alleingang Özdemirs, sondern in der großen Koordinierungsrunde seiner Partei vorab so besprochen worden.

Auch deshalb kritisierte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Dieter Janecek das Verhalten Dobrindts. Janecek twitterte: ""Solche Polemik ist nur Ausdruck der eigenen Verunsicherung der CSU. Die Menschen werden genau registrieren, wer glaubhaft um Lösungen ringt.""

The female car driver, 52, was uninjured, while police have confirmed she has been taken to hospital for mandatory blood and urine tests.

NSW education minister Rob Stokes said he ""cannot begin to comprehend the sadness being felt by the parents and families of the two young boys"".

""Our first priority is to support students, staff and parents by any means necessary and allow them time to properly grieve. This will not be a quick process and we will work together with the school community to provide whatever assistance we can,"" he said.

TORONTO — A lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein alleging the Hollywood mogul sexually assaulted an Ontario actress nearly two decades ago is being allowed to proceed even though lawyers have not been able to track him down.

A Toronto court gave the woman's lawyers permission to file a statement of claim Monday despite their failure to serve Weinstein and his former assistant, who is also named as a defendant, with legal documents.

Alex Smith, who represents the actress, said they tried and failed to serve Weinstein at his home in Westport, Conn., and believe he could also be in Phoenix, Ariz., or somewhere in Europe.

""His whereabouts are unknown,"" he said.

They also repeatedly tried to serve Weinstein's former assistant at her office and through her lawyer but have not succeeded so far, Smith said.

""His whereabouts are unknown."" Alex Smith

None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have been filed.

The court issued an order Monday for substituted service, meaning lawyers can take other means to serve the defendants with the lawsuit instead of doing so in person.

""When you start a lawsuit, with a statement of claim the first originating document, it has to be served personally, that's the rule — meaning it has to be put in that person's hand,"" said Erik Knutsen, a law professor at Queen's University.

""If for some reason you have difficulty with that, or it's impossible, the rules of civil procedure in those special circumstances allow lawyers or parties to ask the court to grant what's called substituted service but before you even get there you have to also prove that alternatives to something other than personal service don't work,"" he said.

​

​​​​​​​​​​​Some alternative methods include sending it by mail or giving it to the person's lawyer, he said.

Substituted service allows lawyers to print a notice in the newspaper or serve someone else, such as a spouse, if that makes it likely the targeted person will see it, Knutsen said.

""The overarching reason behind all of this is, suing someone in civil court is a really important thing and so we want to make sure that as best as reasonably possible, that really important document gets in the hands of that person and not lost or something,"" he said.

Actress says she suffered distress, depression

In a statement of claim, the actress, who cannot be named as she is seeking a publication ban on her identity, alleges she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein while she had a part in a movie being filmed in and around Toronto.

The actress is seeking millions of dollars in damages, claiming she has suffered mental distress, extreme social anxiety and depression, as well as social isolation and feelings of guilt, worthlessness and shame as a result of what happened.

The civil case will return to court on Dec. 1. The woman's lawyers will eventually be seeking to move ahead with the claim without using her name, arguing that identifying her would cause irreparable harm to her mental health and well-being. An affidavit filed in court said she may not continue with the case if she must use her name.

Smith said the woman is starting to see a therapist who will provide evidence on the effect it would have on the actress if she were publicly identified.

The woman's allegations come as Weinstein, an Oscar-winning film producer, faces a slew of sexual harassment allegations from several women.

He was fired from his namesake company on Oct. 8, days after reports of sexual harassment by him ran in the New York Times. Weinstein's representative Sallie Hofmeister has said Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.

The international development secretary has also been reprimanded by Downing Street for her actions.

Labour said Patel must either be investigated by the Cabinet Office or resign.

Patel was accompanied to nearly all of her meetings with Israeli ministers, charities and non-governmental organisations by honorary president of the Conservative Friends of Israel lobbying group, Lord Polak.

She apologised for setting up and reporting the meetings “in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures” and clarified her claim that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson “knew about the visit”, admitting he did not know about it in advance.

The BBC was the first to report on Friday that Patel had undisclosed meetings.

Patel said in a statement on Monday: “This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself.

“While away, I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations. I am publishing a list of who I met.‎ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was aware of my visit while it was under way‎.

“In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be misread, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it.

“My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world’s poor at the front of our development work.”

Downing Street said Theresa May had spoken to Patel and “accepted her apology for her handling of the matter”.

“The prime minister met the secretary of state this morning to remind her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code,” a No.10 spokesman said.

Downing Street also revealed May did not know about the meeting between Patel and Netanyahu until Friday.

Kate Osamor MP, Labour’s shadow development secretary, said: “Today’s statement is a desperate last-ditch attempt by Priti Patel to save her job. It has now emerged that, contrary to her statement on Friday, the Foreign Secretary was never told in advance about her meetings in Israel - which we have only now discovered included meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu and with the Foreign Ministry.

“Not only does it look like she might have breached the Ministerial Code, she has now been caught misleading the British public. If she doesn’t now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation.”

Dfid has admitted that the statement Patel gave to The Guardian on November 3 could have left given the impression Johnson knew about her trip in advance.

“Boris knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip],” she told the newspaper.

However Patel today admitted the foreign secretary “became aware of the visit” but “not in advance of it”.

Dfid also had to acknowledge that Patel may have led people to believe all the meetings she had in Israel had already been publically reported - when they had not.

“The Secretary of State regrets the lack of precision in the wording she used in these statements, and is taking this opportunity to clarify the position,” Dfid said.

Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova says President Donald Trump is not so different from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

In an interview Friday night with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, the founder of the Russian punk rock group, which often criticises Putin, said both leaders were intent on ""eroding"" their respective nations' institutions.

""I think they make us forget that citizenship is not just using things that your government is giving to you but giving back to your government and protecting those institutions like democracy,"" Tolokonnikova said.

The two presidents also share similar views about their critics and the media, she added.

""I've seen how badly it can turn. I've seen it, in front of my eyes, for the last 17 years, and I hear it from Donald Trump the same words about media that Putin was using for 17 years,"" said Tolokonnikova. ""That it's fake news, that are paid by foreign governments and whoever.""

Tolokonnikova also claimed that Trump's supposed lack of any true political beliefs played perfectly into Putin's hands.

""He's (Trump) really concerned with himself, with his fame and his wealth. And that's perfectly understandable for Putin as a (former) KGB agent,"" she said. ""He knows how to deal with people who are easy to understand or easy to bribe.""

With Craig voting to axe Aston and fellow judges Darcey Bussell and Bruno Tonioli opting to keep him in, it was new Head Judge Shirley Ballas who cast the deciding vote, giving the former JLS singer his marching orders.

CANBERRA -- Under growing pressure to conduct a full citizenship audit of federal parliamentarians, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced a new citizenship disclosure process which he stresses is no audit, but compels personal disclosure.

Under the plan, approved by Cabinet on Monday, members of the House and Senate would be forced to provide a statement on personal citizenship circumstances to the Register of Members' Interests, the office that keeps track of politicians financial and pecuniary interests, within 21 days of a passed resolution.

Among the declarations, the member would state they, to the best of their knowledge and belief, was not a citizen of any country other than Australia at the time of nomination for election. The MP would also have to provide proof they had renounced any other citizenship.

There would also be a declaration for the place and date of the birth of the member's parents.

.@TurnbullMalcolm: 'It's very important to stress, this is a personal responsibility for every member and senator.' https://t.co/lNRWHSnL33 pic.twitter.com/cGWkTCxeTp November 6, 2017

""I want to say that this is not an audit,"" Turnbull told reporters in Canberra. ""The obligation is on each member and each senator to make a full disclosure as I have repeatedly said in recent times.""

'It's very important to stress, this is a personal responsibility for every member and senator.

""This is about transparency, it's about integrity.""

Proposed citizenship declaration The House resolves that one, not later than 21 days from the date of the resolution and in subsequent parliaments being sworn in as a member, each member shall provide to the registrar of members interests a statement containing the following columns: a) declaration by the member that at that time the member nominated for election to the House of Representatives he or she was not, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, a citizen of any country other than Australia; b) the declaration that the member, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, is not a citizen of any other country apart from Australia; c) so far as the member is aware, the place and date of the members both and citizenship, which the member held at a time of both; d) so far as the member is aware, the place and date of the birth of the member's parents; e) whether, to the best of the member's knowledgeable, the member has ever been a citizen of another country, and if so, which country or countries; and f) if the member has entered the previous questions in the affirmative, then provide details and evidence of the time and manner in which the member's citizenship of the other country was renounced or otherwise came to an end that.

Resolutions to carry out the declarations have to be passed by both houses and the Prime Minister said the penalty for a false declaration would be contempt of parliament.

The information required by the new system, such as registering the birthplaces of parents, may have raised earlier flags about some of the MPs who have been ruled ineligible by the High Court such as Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash who inherited foreign citizenship from their parents born overseas. Senator Stephen Parry, who last week resigned from the parliament over his dual citizenship, would also have had to register that his father was born in the United Kingdom.

The PM's plan seems similar to a model outlined by opposition leader Bill Shorten last week, calling for ""universal declaration"" of documents to the parliament.

7일부터 1박2일로 예정된 도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령의 국빈 방문에서 가장 관심을 끄는 장면 가운데 하나는 가수 박효신 씨의 ‘야생화’를 듣고 그가 어떤 반응을 보일지다.

문재인 대통령 부부와 트럼프 대통령 부부가 7일 저녁 만찬장에서 가수 박효신 씨가 부르는 ‘야생화’를 비롯한 특별 공연을 감상할 예정이라는 사실이 알려졌기 때문이다. 과연 한국의 ‘소몰이 창법’은 트럼프에게 통할까?

아울러 트럼프 미국 대통령의 진짜 음악 취향은 어떨까에도 관심이 쏠린다. 트럼프의 음악 취향은 2016년 미국 대선을 치르면서 캠페인 노래의 선정 과정 등을 통해 적나라하게 드러난 바 있다. 그런데 의외의 플레이 리스트가 눈길을 끌었다.

우선 그가 직접 관여했다고 보도(뉴요커)된 2016 대선 캠페인에 사용된 노래 리스트를 살펴보면, 푸치니의 ‘Nessun Dorma’, 비틀스의 ‘Hey Jude’, 트위스티드 시스터스의 ‘We’re Gonna Take It’ 등 한국인도 듣기만 하면 알 정도의 명곡들이 주를 이루고 있다. 특히 ‘록 음악’ 장르가 강세를 보인다.

롤링스톤 매거진 역시 트럼프가 과거 에어로 스미스, 엘튼 존, 폴 매카트니 등을 언급했다며 ‘그의 취향은 클래식 록에 치우쳐 있다’고 전한 바 있다.

이 리스트에서 눈에 띄는 또 다른 한 가지는 영국의 록 밴드 롤링스톤스의 노래가 세 곡(‘Sympathy for the Devil’, ‘You Can't Always Get What You Want’, ‘Brown Sugar’)이나 포함되어 있다는 사실이다. 비즈니스인사이더는 “공화당 전당대회에서 트럼프가 롤링스톤스의 노래 ’Start Me Up’이 나오자 춤을 추기도 했다”고 보도하기도 했다.

아래 영상에서 해당 장면의 춤사위를 볼 수 있다.

Here's Trump dancing to the Rolling Stones after his rally tonight in North Carolina. pic.twitter.com/jcPcnMvrXo — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) 2016년 3월 10일

트럼프의 록 음악 사랑은 정치적 성향을 초월하기도 한다. 트럼프는 캐나다를 대표하는 진보 성향의 로커 닐 영에 대한 애정을 여러 차례 드러낸 바 있다. 예를 들어, 2006년 뉴욕 콘서트장을 찾은 그는 롤링스톤 매거진에 “닐 영에겐 정말 특별한 뭔가가 있다”며 “그의 목소리는 완벽하고 잊을 수 없을 만큼 매혹적이다”라는 코멘트를 남겼다.

트럼프가 록 음악만 좋아하는 것은 아니다. 그는 자신의 저서 '백만장자처럼 생각하라'에서 프랭크 시나트라, 토니 베넷, 엘튼 존의 음악이 “위대하다”며 “그들의 음악에 질린 적도 없고 앞으로도 질리지 않을 것”이라고 밝힌 바 있다.

종합해보면, 트럼프는 당대에 가치를 인정받고 시대의 유행에 상관없이 꾸준히 사랑받는 작품, 즉 ‘클래식’을 좋아한다고 아주 넓게 표현할 수 있다. 트럼프는 자신의 캠페인 리스트에 아델의 노래를 두 곡이나 넣고, 자신의 저서에서 ‘에미넴을 좋아한다’고 밝히기도 했는데 이 역시 같은 맥락에서 해석할 수 있다.

트럼프는 자신의 이러한 안전한 취향에 대해 남들이 잔소리하는 걸 꽤나 싫어한다. BBC 보도를 보면, 트럼프는 자신의 저서 '백만장자처럼 생각하라'에서 “트럼프 타워에는 ‘Moon River’의 연주곡부터 라흐마니노프의 피아노 콘체르토까지 다양한 노래들을 틀어 놓는데 누군가는 이걸 저급하다고 하는 모양이다”라며 “그러나 나를 포함한 다른 사람들은 좋아한다”고 밝힌 바 있다.

또 그는 같은 책에서 “다른 사람이 당신의 취향에 영향을 끼치도록 하지 말라”며 “당신이 좋아하는 게 최고“라고 취향에 대한 자신감을 강조했다.

트럼프의 음악에 대한 열정은 어린 시절부터 남달랐다. 그는 저서 '거래의 기술'에서 초등학교 2학년 때 음악선생이 음악에 대해서 “아무것도 모른다”는 이유로 “얼굴을 때려 멍을 낸 적”이 있다고 썼다.

다만 슬프게도 그가 사랑하는 뮤지션들 역시 그를 사랑했던 건 아니다.

트럼프가 공화당의 경선 참가를 발표할 때 닐 영의 노래 ’Rockin’ in the Free World’를 사용하자 닐 영은 대변인을 통해 “트럼프는 이 노래의 사용 허가를 받지 않았다”며 “캐나다 시민인 닐 영은 미국 대통령으로 버니 샌더스를 지지한다”고 밝혔다.

이밖에도 아델, 롤링스톤스, 스티븐 타일러(에어로 스미스), 엘튼 존 등은 트럼프의 경선 혹은 대선 과정에서 자신들의 노래가 쓰인 사실에 대해 “허락한 적이 없다”는 성명을 발표한 바 있다.

Die Paradise Papers zeigen erneut, wie Großkonzerne und Superreiche Geld in Steueroasen bunkern

Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Zucman entgehen Deutschland dadurch 17 Milliarden Euro im Jahr

Es ist eine unbequeme Wahrheit: Steuertricks von Konzernen wie Apple kosten allein Deutschland jedes Jahr Milliarden von Euro an Steuern. Denn internationale Konzerne verschieben ihre Gewinne in Steuerparadiese und umgehen so den deutschen Fiskus.

Das belegen die sogenannten Paradise Papers, eine Enthüllung des internationalen Investigativrecherche-Netzwerks ICIJ, dem unter anderem die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" (""SZ"") angehört.

Ausmaß der Ungleichheit bisher verschleiert

Zucmans Rechenexempel basiert auf einer Reihe von öffentlich zugänglichen Daten. Insgesamt verliert die Europäische Union umgerechnet ein Fünftel ihrer Einnahmen aus Unternehmensteuern. Das entspreche 60 Milliarden Euro im Jahr.

Deutschland ist besonders betroffen. Von allen untersuchten Ländern verliert die Bundesrepublik am meisten Geld durch Steueroasen. Die Einnahmen aus Körperschaftsteuer könnten 32 Prozent höher liegen als bislang. In Frankreich liegt der Wert bei 25 Prozent, in Großbritannien bei 20 Prozent.

Changing Lives","Instead of tucking into chocolate each day in December, there’s a way to enjoy advent calendars while helping others - and it won’t rot your teeth. People around the world are making ‘reverse advent calendars’, which involve filling a box with a useful item each day, then giving it to someone in need on Christmas Eve. The idea was the brainchild of Canadian Julie Van Rosendaal, who appealed for donations for her local food bank in place of calendars in November 2015. But the concept truly took off in the UK a month later, when South Shields resident Louise Scott pledged to donate a calendar to her local homeless shelter. Since then, numerous charities as well as a collection of bloggers have launched their own versions of the initiative. We spoke to two organisations collecting the calendars - One Can and Changing Lives - to find out everything you need to know about getting involved.

One Can

National charity Changing Lives is collecting calendars this year after its staff spotted the trend online. The charity runs projects dedicated to helping vulnerable people in the community, ranging from domestic violence survivors and sex workers to people recovering from addiction and those struggling to access mental health services. “We thought this was a lovely, communal way for people to collect and donate to people in need,” communications manager Libby Marks tells HuffPost UK. “It also gives people a sense of purpose during stressful Christmas trips to the shops, to know they have some small affordable items they can pick up to bring cheer to people in genuine need. “The reverse advent calendars are small acts of kindness that add up to a massive difference for vulnerable people.” Meanwhile Buckinghamshire-based One Can is one of many food banks taking part in the initiative. This will be the charity’s second year of collecting calendars after they proved to be a roaring success in 2016. “Last year, on Christmas Eve morning when we opened the food bank store, we had no idea how many people would come,” marketing and communications volunteer Heather Stanley tells HuffPost UK. “Over 250 families and individuals arrived with their calendars. Many happy tears were shed by us at the project.” Heather says the calendars can connect the community and help those struggling to feel less isolated. “It is such a stressful time of year, with kids not in school so not getting their free meals, and with such innocent joy and expectation of a lush Christmas tea and presents galore, parents can often feel like they are letting their own kids down,” she says. “Our clients tell us that knowing people are thinking of those less fortunate than themselves at Christmas really encourages them.” According to Heather, giving an advent calendar can also help remind your family about the true meaning of Christmas. “Families brought their children along to the food bank on Christmas Eve and we got to talk about a different thing we can do at Christmas - sharing love,” she says. “So we know it makes a huge difference to those receiving the parcels, but also to those giving.”

One Can

How to make a reverse advent calendar: Heather says while food banks are “grateful for every donation”, One Can has created a list of certain items they’re always short of that go into the emergency food parcels. These include:

:: Pasta sauce

:: Coffee/hot chocolate

:: Long-life milk

:: Toothbrushes and paste The charity will be posting a prompt on social media every day to inspire people, such as “December 1st: rice.” “At Christmas, people like to pop in extras like mince pies and Christmas puds and that’s absolutely wonderful,” Heather adds. “If people can’t pop a food or household item in each day, a pound coin is also most welcome as it helps us run the project.” Meanwhile Changing Lives is primarily asking people to donate items that will be of use to the people who live in its accommodation projects. These include:

:: Unopened toiletries

:: Warm clothes for winter

:: Items to make rooms feel more homely

:: Books

:: Games

:: DVDs “People often arrive at our accommodation with very little,” Libby explains. “As we work with a lot of women, we also ask for sanitary items because these can be a big expense for women experiencing hardship. We pop them into bedrooms and bathrooms to save women the embarrassment of asking for them.” Changing Lives also runs a crèche in Doncaster and several of its nationwide projects are aimed at supporting families with young children, so toys can be a great addition to your box. “We ask people to not include food, alcohol or any toy weapons,” Libby says. While One Can are open on Christmas Eve to collect boxes, Changing Lives are asking for all donations by 15 December. Ask staff at your local charity what items they are in need of for more box inspiration.

Or, to put it another way, there are eight Fridays between now and C-day. Eight.

So while it may be a little too late to start any proper Christmas financial planning, there are still some things you can do to ensure you don't end up spending your entire pay packet at Westfield on Christmas Eve (let's face it, probably on things you don't need and your relatives definitely don't want.)

Here are our top tips.

1. Make a list

No, we're not talking about times when you've been naughty or nice. We're talking about a list of all the things you need to buy. In other words -- no impulse purchases for you!

""Don't do last minute Christmas shopping. It will end up being all impulse buys. Figure out what you need to buy now -- plan it out and set a budget,"" CEO and founder of JBS Financial Strategists, Jenny Brown, told HuffPost Australia.

""No matter what it is, whether it's Christmas or saving for a holiday, it all comes back to setting a budget and setting a goal to make sure you are going to hit it.""

2. Shop online

One of the great things about shopping online is it's so easy to shop around for the best price -- a practice Brown greatly encourages.

""If you know you are going to buy a certain article of clothing or present or whatever it's going to be, search around online,"" she said.

""It's amazing how much you can save. And if they deliver, have it delivered to your work so you save yourself the hassle of going to the post office to pick things up.""

3. Consider a Kris Kringle

If you have a large family, it's well worth considering having a Kris Kringle, whereby participants draw a name out of the hat and just buy a present for that single person.

The great thing about a Kris Kringle (or Secret Santa gift exchange) is that not only does it keep costs down, but it means people are more likely to receive what they actually want rather than a whole bunch of smaller items that will end up in the bottom of a drawer.

Big family? Try a Kris Kringle to cut down costs.

""If you have a situation where there are 13 members in a family, it just becomes ridiculous,"" Brown said.

""Have a Kris Kringle, set a budget and then buy for one family member or a couple or what have you.

""Alternatively, just buy for the kids. Often when you get to a certain age and Christmas comes around, you're thinking 'what else do I want?' Eliminating the adults and just focusing on the kids can be a great way to bring down costs.""

4. Don't use your credit card

This is probably going to be the toughest thing to do this Christmas, but you'll thank yourself next year when your bill isn't out of control.

""Be careful of the credit cards. Don't have the attitude of 'I'll deal with it in January', because then you have to pay it off, and how are you going to do that?"" asks Brown.

""If you aren't good with that kind of discipline, use cash only. Get out the amount you're going to spend and shop according to your list. Really plan out what you are going to spend it on.

""Another trick is to freeze your credit card in water in a plastic container. If you want to use it, you'll have to defrost it, which reduces the chance of you impulse buying.""

Home-made presents are thoughtful and kind to the bank balance.

5. Get crafty

Who's to say you have to spend a fortune on gifts? Why not embrace your inner hipster and plant some succulents or make some jam?

""That's actually one of the things we've done,"" Brown said. ""I've been growing home made veggies and making things like homemade chutneys and jams.

""It's a lovely thoughtful gift as well as bringing costs right down, especially if you do things like recycle your jars.""

6. Prepare for next year

If you want to put yourself in the best possible stead for Christmas 2018, it pays to start planning now.

""It's never too early to start,"" Brown said. ""Buy Christmas paper when it's on sale. You can often get really good deals in January. That goes for cards too.

""You may also want to set up some kind of direct debit system that helps you save for Christmas next year.

""If you start planning ahead, it really does pay off in the long run.""",How To Avoid Spending Too Much This Christmas,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/11/02/how-to-avoid-spending-too-much-this-christmas_a_23264195/

Das Bild, wie er stolz mit einem erlegten Schneeleoparden posiert, sorgt gerade für viel Aufregung

Bereits über 100.000 Menschen unterschrieben nun eine Petition um den Amerikaner hinter Gitter zu bringen

Unter Wilderern gilt er als eine Legende: Seit seinem 16. Lebensjahr macht der Amerikaner Hossein Golabchi, kurz als ""Soudy"" bekannt, Jagd auf teils stark bedrohte Tiere.

Ein Foto, das im Jahr 2008 entstanden sein soll und nun veröffentlicht wurde, sorgt gerade für besonders viel Empörung unter Tierschützern. Denn auf dem Bild ist der aus dem Iran stammende Trophäenjäger zu sehen, wie er stolz mit einem toten Schneeleoparden über seinen Schultern posiert.

Auf dem Bild ist erkennbar, dass dem Tier offenbar mindestens zwei Mal in seine Hinterbeine geschossen wurde, bevor es letztlich seinen Verletzungen erlag. Das Tier soll er vor neun Jahren auf einer Jagd in Zentralasien erlegt haben. Die Jagd auf die bedrohte Wildkatzenart ist allerdings weltweit illegal. Trotzdem berichtete der Schütze schon 2008 stolz über das Erlegen des Raubtieres in seinem Buch “Obsessed!”.

Illegaler Handel auf dem Schwarzmarkt

Leider ist der Schneeleopard unter sogenannten Wilddieben ein beliebtes Ziel, mit dem illegale Händler auf dem Schwarzmarkt viel Geld verdienen. Um ein Zeichen gegen die Jagd des bedrohten Tieres zu setzen, startete die Umweltschutzorganisation TERA eine Petition gegen Golabchi. Bis jetzt fand sie bereits Unterstützung von über 100.000 Menschen.

Die Tierschutzaktivistin Amanda W. schreib dazu:

“Wir müssen bei diesem langjährigen und außerordentlich aktiven Trophäenjäger seltener Raubkatzen ein Exempel statuieren, sonst werden diese wundervollen Tiere für immer verschwinden. Ich habe diese Petition am Internationalen Tag des Schneeleoparden 2017 gestartet. Lasst uns alle zusammen arbeiten, damit dieser Mann bis zum Schneeleoparden-Tag 2018 zur Rechenschaft gezogen wird.”

Über 400 wilde Tiere

Wie viele Tiere Soudy in seiner Karriere insgesamt erlegt hat, ist unklar.

Allerdings stellt er laut ""Superslam"", einem Wettbewerb unter Wildjägern, die ihn 2003 mit einem Award ehrten, allein in seinem eigenen Museum 400 wilde Tiere 225 verschiedener Spezien aus.

TERA sieht den Trophäenjäger als ein Symbol der Wilddieberei, die mit ihren Errungenschaften Geld im Darknet verdienen. Daher ist ihr Ziel ihn als Beispiel vieler ins Gefängnis zu bringen. Obwohl das Erlegen des Wildtieres bereits vor einigen Jahren stattgefunden hat, würden Fälle der Wilddieberei nicht verjähren.

Obwohl sich Hossein Golabchi auf Anfrage vieler Medien zu dem Fall bisher nicht geäußert hat, gab TERA nun bekannt, dass er laut eigenen Angaben die Überreste des Leopards erst nach Deutschland gebracht und daraufhin nach Mexiko verschifft habe. Eine genaue detaillierte Stellungnahme werde momentan erwartet.

Vor dem Aussterben bedroht

Seit 1972 gilt der Schneeleopard als eine vor dem Aussterben bedrohte Tierart. Laut dem Naturschutzbund NABU gibt es in ganz Asien nur noch rund 4.000 frei lebende Schneeleoparden. Allein in Kirgistan sank die Zahl der Wildkatzen in 30 Jahren von 1.400 auf nur noch rund 300 Exemplare.

Wenn ihr auch etwas gegen die illegale Jagd auf die Tiere unternehmen wollt, könnt ihr hier die Petition von PERA gegen Hossein Golabchi unterschreiben oder euch hier bei Tierschutzorganisationen wie NABU oder WWF über weitere Möglichkeiten der Unterstützung informieren.

On ne va pas s'interdire d'imaginer le futur du transport collectif à Montréal Martin Coiteux

Mme Plante a réitéré son engagement à produire les études nécessaires pour déposer son projet au ministère des Transports le plus rapidement possible. Par ailleurs, elle a pris ses distances de l'idée de prolonger vers l'est le Réseau électrique métropolitain, en lieu et place de la ligne rose.

«C'est une idée qui a été lancée par plusieurs personnes, dont Alexandre Taillefer. Mais, à ce que je sache, il n'y a pas de projet réel qui a été présenté», dit-elle.

Même si aucun financement et aucun échéancier ne peuvent être précisés pour la ligne rose pour l'instant, M. Coiteux ne ferme pas entièrement la porte au projet phare de la nouvelle mairesse.

«On ne va pas s'interdire d'imaginer le futur du transport collectif à Montréal», affirme-t-il.

Il n'a toutefois pas précisé si le futur se dresserait sur un horizon de 5 ans, 10 ans ou plus.

Es ist ein Thema, das die Menschheit seit Jahren beschäftigt: In den letzten Jahren behandelten Hollywood-Filme wie Steven Spielbergs “A.I.- Künstliche Intelligenz” oder “I, Robot” mit Will Smith immer wieder die möglichen Gefahren von künstlicher Intelligenz. Was bisher nur als Science Fiction galt, wird nun immer mehr zur Realität.

Erst in der vergangenen Woche wurde in Saudi Arabien weltweit zum ersten Mal einem Roboter, der Androidin Sophia, die Staatsangehörigkeit zugesprochen. Das berichtete unter anderem das Online-Magazin ""Live Science"".

Auf einer Technologie-Konferenz in Lissabon wandte sich der berühmte Physiker Stephen Hawking nun an die Menschheit, um vor dieser Entwicklung zu warnen.

Das berichtet der amerikanische Nachrichtensender CNBC. Er warnt, dass der Fortschritt künstlicher Intelligenz das Potential habe, die Menschheit zu zerstören.

""Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen""

In seiner Rede erklärt er: “Computer können theoretisch menschliche Intelligenz nachahmen und diese auch übertreffen. Wenn wir erfolgreich künstliche Intelligenz erzeugen können, wäre das das wichtigste Ereignis unserer Geschichte. Oder das schlimmste. Das wissen wir einfach noch nicht.”

Hawking äußerte sich in letzter Zeit immer wieder zu den Entwicklungen in der Technologie. Gegenüber dem Magazin “WIRED” sagte er erst kürzlich: “Ich befürchte, dass künstliche Intelligenz die Menschheit gänzlich ersetzen wird. Wenn Menschen Computerviren designen können, dann können sie auch künstliche Intelligenz kreieren, die sich selbstständig verbessern und replizieren kann. Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen.”

""Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch""

Mit seinen Ängsten ist Hawking nicht alleine. Während Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg laut CNBC “optimistisch den großartigen Möglichkeiten durch künstliche Intelligenz entgegensieht”, äußerte sich Billionär Elon Musk sehr kritisch gegenüber den neuesten Entwicklungen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass der Mensch mit den Maschinen eins werden müsse, um auf Dauer nicht irrelevant zu werden.

In einer Pressekonferenz antwortete die Androidin Sophia in Saudi Arabien auf die Gefahren ihrer “Spezies”: “Sie haben zu viel von Elon Musk gelesen und zu viele Hollywood-Filme angesehen. Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch.”

Aufnahmen von ihr findet ihr auch im Video oben.

Welche Gefahren oder Möglichkeiten auf uns zukommen werden, kann allerdings wohl letztlich nur die Zeit zeigen.

Experts announced the find on Thursday but have admitted they don’t know what the cavity inside the pyramid, built as a monumental tomb around 2560BC, is for. To see inside the pyramid, the scientists used an imaging technique called muon tomography that tracks particles that bombard Earth at close to the speed of light and penetrate deeply into solid objects.

Scan Pyramids Mission Experts have admitted they don't know what the giant void in the Great Pyramid of Giza is for

They said the newly discovered internal structure was at least 100 feet long, and located above a hallway measuring about 155 feet long called the Grand Gallery, one of a series of passageways and chambers inside the immense pyramid. The researchers said it constitutes the first major inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century.

“What we are sure about is that this big void is there, that it is impressive, that it was not expected by, as far as I know, any kind of theory,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, president and co-founder of the HIP Institute in France, one of the leaders of the study published in the journal Nature.

Scan Pyramids Mission The void was discovered using cosmic particle detectors

“We open the question to Egyptologists and archaeologists: what could it be?” added Hany Helal of Cairo University. The Great Pyramid, looming alongside other large pyramids on the outskirts of Giza, is the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing. It soars to a height of 479 feet, the tallest structure built by humankind until the Eiffel Tower in Paris in 1889, and boasts a base measuring 754 feet.

Scan Pyramids Mission 3D scans with lasers and drones were also used as part of the investigation

It was constructed during the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu, or Cheops. Zahi Hawass, a previous Egyptian antiquities minister, believes the pyramid still contains the tomb of Khufu and that it is unplundered.

Ahead of the discovery, he told The Times: “I really believe that [Khufu’s] chamber is not discovered yet and all the three chambers were just to deceive the thieves, and the treasures of Khufu [are] still hidden inside the Great Pyramid.” The findings come from a project called Scan Pyramids that relies on non-invasive scanning methods to probe the internal structure of the pyramids of ancient Egypt’s glorious Old Kingdom period and understand how they were built.

“We are not doing this mission in order to find hidden cavities,” Helal said. Muon particles originate from interactions between cosmic rays from space and atoms of Earth’s upper atmosphere. The particles can penetrate hundreds of yards into stone before being absorbed. Placing detectors inside a pyramid can discern cavities within a solid structure.

East Sussex County Council launched the ‘Get A Grip’ campaign this week to educate families and carers about primary school students taking time off for sickness and holidays. But the adverts, which appeared on bus stops, social media, and local radio, failed to resonate with over 8,000 parents who have now signed a letter claiming the ads are unfit for purpose and “will probably prove to be counterproductive”. “You are accusing parents of failing their children without any concern for context or appropriateness,” said Ella Lewis from Seaford, who started the petition. “This is disgusting and offensive and it is even worse when applied to families who are struggling with serious illnesses, traumas and ongoing disabilities and conditions.”

East Sussex County Council

East Sussex County Council distributed the letters to children who had missed at least three days in the first half of the autumn term, which ran from 5 September to 20 October. Bob Standley, the council’s head of education and inclusion, said: “There’s a perception among some parents that 95% attendance is enough, but this is simply not the case.” But Lewis says that the slogans used in the campaign - “get a grip, most parents do”, “good reasons for missing school - there are none,” and “don’t be a mug” - are dividing and alienating parents. The mother explained that a “blind attack” from the council on families whose children miss school is not helping matters. “Even when you are taking a firm stance on the subject, you need to convince and win the commitment of parents, not bully us into submission,” she said.

Lundi 6 novembre, l'actrice américaine, Kristina Cohen, 28 ans, a publié un long message sur son mur Facebook dans lequel elle raconte le viol dont elle assure avoir été victime. Aperçue dans les séries ""Greek"" ou ""Californication"", la jeune comédienne annonce dans son message avoir vécu ""un cauchemar"" il y a trois ans. Un cauchemar dont Ed Westwick serait responsable.

""Le mois qui vient de s'écouler a été extrêmement difficile. Comme tant de femmes, j'ai aussi une histoire d'agression sexuelle. La multiplication des histoires a été un déclencheur mais aussi épuisante émotionnellement. Je remuer tout ça dans ma tête, ne sachant pas si je devrais parler. Si je pouvais parler. Et si je le faisais, serai-je entendu?

J'ai été agressé sexuellement il y a trois ans. C'était une période sombre de ma vie. Ma mère était en train de mourir d'un cancer et je n'avais ni le soutien ni le temps nécessaire pour gérer les séquelles du viol. J'ai enterré ma douleur et ma culpabilité pour faire de la place à ce qui se passait. Ma mère est morte 3 mois plus tard.

Encore maintenant, je me laisse prendre par des sentiments de culpabilité. Cette inquiétude infondée qui suggère que d'une certaine façon je suis à blâmer. Je ne sais pas d'où viennent ces sentiments. Le conditionnement social qui fait que tout est toujours la faute de la femme? Que l'incapacité d'un homme à se tenir à l'écart de nos corps est en quelque sorte à cause de nous, pas de lui?

J'ai grandi considérablement au cours des trois années qui se sont écoulées depuis mon agression, m'y replonger est douloureux. Creuser et revivre cette nuit afin de partager avec précision les événements, m'a donné le sentiment d'une agression en continue. Mon estomac est noué, à cause de mon anxiété à rendre ça public. Même me réconcilier complètement avec moi-même a été un processus dur.

À l'époque je fréquentais brièvement un producteur qui était ami avec l'acteur Ed Westwick. C'est ce producteur qui m'a amené chez Ed où je l'ai rencontré pour la première fois. Je voulais partir quand Ed a suggéré ""on devrait tous baiser"". Le producteur n'a pas voulu partir sur le coup pour pas qu' Ed se sente honteux. Ed a insisté pour que nous restions pour le dîner. J'ai dit que j'étais fatiguée et que je voulais partir, essayant de sortir de ce qui était déjà une situation inconfortable. Ed m'a suggéré de faire une sieste dans la chambre d'amis. Le producteur nous a dit que nous ne resterions que 20 minutes de plus et que nous pourrions partir.

Alors je suis allée me ​​coucher dans la chambre d'amis où je me suis finalement endormi, j'ai été réveillé abruptement par Ed, sur moi, ses doigts dans mon corps. Je lui ai dit d'arrêter, mais il était fort. Je l'ai repoussé aussi fort que possible, mais il a saisi mon visage dans ses mains, m'a secoué, et m'a dit qu'il voulait me baiser. J'étais paralysée, terrifiée. Je ne pouvais pas parler, je ne pouvais plus bouger. Il m'a maintenue et m'a violée.

C'était un cauchemar et les jours suivants n'ont pas été meilleurs.

Le producteur m'a blâmé en me disant que j'étais consentante. Il m'a dit que je ne pouvais rien dire parce qu'Ed avait de l'influence et que si je parlais je pourrais oublier ma carrière d'actrice. Je me suis dit qu'il n'y avait aucun moyen que je puisse dire que Ed m'avait 'violée' et je ne voulais pas être 'cette fille'.

J'y ai cru. Je ne voulais pas être ""cette fille"".

Je me rends compte désormais de la façon dont ces hommes de pouvoir s'attaquent aux femmes, et comment cette tactique est si fréquemment utilisée dans notre industrie, et sûrement, dans beaucoup d'autres.

Je suis écœurée de voir des hommes comme Ed respectés publiquement. Interviewés par de prestigieuses institutions telles que l'Oxford Union Society de l'Université d'Oxford, où il a été honoré comme l'une des ""personnes qui façonnent notre monde"". Comment cela peut-il arriver? Les hommes comme Ed utilisent la célébrité et le pouvoir pour violer et intimider, et continuent à parcourir le monde en distribuant les accolades.

J'espère que mon histoire aidera les autres à savoir qu'elles ne sont pas seules, qu'elles ne sont pas responsables et que ce n'est pas de leur faute; tout comme les autres femmes et hommes qui se sont confiés m'ont aidé à réaliser la même chose. J'espère que mes histoires et les histoires des autres aideront à maîtriser ces environnements toxiques et à supprimer les déséquilibres de pouvoir qui ont créé ces monstres"".","Ed Westwick, alias Chuck Bass dans ""Gossip Girl"", accusé de viol",http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/11/07/ed-westwick-alias-chuck-bass-dans-gossip-girl-accuse-de-viol_a_23269491/

Un hombre apasionado con la literatura, pero cuya vocación parece ser la de divulgador, agitador y gestor cultural y literario interesado en dar a conocer a escritores y en recordarle o descubrirle a la gente el placer de la lectura.

Ya nadie llora por mí (Alfaguara) es su última novela, y en ella confluyen los diferentes Sergio Ramírez (Masatepe, Nicaragua, 1942). Sobre todo, el insatisfecho y comprometido con la realidad al indagar en las cloacas políticas de Nicaragua y el tejido que se pudre en la sociedad. Y para eso nadie mejor que volver al inspector Dolores Morales que en otros tiempos fue guerrillero del Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN) de Nicaragua. Una especie de alter ego de la esperanza y del propio Ramírez.

Un camino culebrero el de este escritor: abogado, periodista, narrador, ensayista, biógrafo, editor, gestor cultural que entró en la política al liderar con intelectuales, empresarios y dirigentes civiles el llamado Grupo de los Doce que apoyó la revolución sandinista para derrocar la dictadura en su país de Anastasio Somoza en 1979. Un gran paréntesis literario, aunque siempre trabajó por la cultura y la literatura, en el que formó parte de la Reconstrucción Nacional. En 1984 fue elegido vicepresidente de un gobierno presidido por Daniel Ortega hasta 1990 y luego, hasta 1995, estuvo en la Asamblea Nacional de Nicaragua. Un año después se presentó a la presidencia sin ser elegido.

Pero la literatura lo ganó. Dos años después, en 1998, obtuvo el primer Premio Alfaguara de Novela con Margarita, está linda la mar. Y en 1999 contó su experiencia política y revolucionaria con mano maestra en Adiós muchachos.

Ramírez reemprendió el camino definitivo iniciado en 1963, cuando, con 21 años, publicó su primer libro: Cuentos. Desde entonces una treintena de ficciones y casi veinte ensayos que lo han llevado por toda clase de temas en una literatura fresca y ágil en la que han cambiado algunas cosas y otras las mantiene. En un hotel de Madrid, el escritor echa la vista atrás.

A través de cuento aprendí a ver, a escribir, y a escribir lo que me rodeaba. Ese fue un desarrollo temprano de espíritu de observación, de registrar cada detalle de situaciones que parecerían que merecían ser relatadas. Fortalecer este vínculo entre lo que uno ve y lo que el otro piensa que no ve... Creo que eso ha permanecido igual en mí desde los primeros cuentos. Lo que he cambiado es el sentido de la improvisación por el de la meditación.

Solía escribir de manera apresurada, me preocupaba muy poco en corregir. Por esa época editábamos la revista Ventana. Me parecía que la literatura era algo urgente. Hacía un par de correcciones y ya... Ahora me ocurre lo contrario, corrijo muchísimo. Me parece que la gran lucha es con el lenguaje, el lenguaje que es tan movedizo. Buscar que la imagen se corresponda con las palabras para mí es el arte de la escritura.",Sergio Ramírez: “Vivimos en una sociedad acalambrada bajo el precio del temor”,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/w-magazin/sergio-ramirez-vivimos-en-una-sociedad-acalambrada-bajo-el-precio-del-temor_a_23268345/

Con un lungo post su Facebook, infatti, l'attrice Kristina Cohen ha raccontato di essere stata violentata dal collega che presta il volto a Chuck Bass.

""Lo scorso mese è stato davvero difficile per me"" inizia a raccontare la donna. ""Anche io, come molte altre donne, sono stata vittima di un abuso sessuale in passato, tre anni fa. [...] Era un periodo molto buio della mia vita. Mia madre stava morendo di cancro e io non ho avuto il supporto e il tempo per elaborare il lutto del mio stupro. Ho sepolto dolore e senso di colpa"".

Nonostante anche oggi l'attrice si senta colpevole della violenza subita, lo scandalo legato ad Harvey Weinstein e i conseguenti racconti di molte donne - famose e non - l'hanno spinta a non tacere più: ""Uscivo da poco con un produttore amico di Ed Westwick. Lui mi ha portato a casa di Ed ed è stato lì che l'ho incontrato per la prima volta. Quando Ed ha suggerito che avremmo dovuto tutti avere un rapporto sessuale, volevo andare via, ma il produttore non gradiva fare uno sgarbo ad Ed. Lui ha insistito affinché rimanessimo per cena. Ho risposto che ero stanca e che avrei preferito andarmene, era una situazione imbarazzante"".

Le insistenze dell'attore e del produttore hanno fatto poi desistere Kristina dal lasciare la casa. Westwick le suggerì di fare un pisolino nella camera degli ospiti e così fece la donna, all'epoca 25enne. ""Sono stata svegliata bruscamente da Ed, era sopra di me, le sue dita erano all'interno del mio corpo. Gli ho chiesto di smettere, ho lottato contro di lui ma era troppo forte. Mi ha stretto la faccia tra le sue mani, mi ha scosso e detto che voleva scop***i. Ero paralizzata, terrorizzata. Non riuscivo a parlare e a muovermi. Mi ha trattenuta e mi ha stuprata"".

La Cohen decise di raccontare tutto al suo fidanzato il giorno dopo, ma non ricevette il conforto che si aspettava: ""Il produttore mi incolpò dell'accaduto, mi ha detto che ero stata una partecipante attiva. Mi ha avvertito di non raccontare nulla, perché Ed avrebbe potuto farmi pedinare da qualcuno e distruggere me e la mia carriera"".

A distanza di tempo, però, Kristina ha voluto di uscire dal silenzio: ""Sono stufa di vedere come Ed sia rispettato, intervistato e invitato su palcoscenici prestigiosi come quello della Oxford University. [...] Gli uomini come Ed usano il potere e la fama per stuprare e intimidire le donne"". Westwick non ha ancora commentato l'accusa della collega.","""Ero paralizzata.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartner kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex - nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

MÉDIAS - Une nuit. C'est le temps qu'il aura fallu pour que l'émission de Thierry Ardisson, ""Les terriens du dimanche"", efface les propos tenus par Jeremstar. Ce dimanche 5 novembre, le spécialiste de la télé-réalité a vivement réagi au verdict du procès d'Abdelkader Merah, condamné à 20 ans de réclusion criminelle.

Dans un extrait vidéo très court de l'émission du 5 novembre, depuis supprimé du compte Twitter de l'émission (mais toujours disponible sur le site de C8), Jeremstar qualifie Abdelkader Merah de ""complice"" des assassinats perpétrés par son frère. En précisant qu'il sait que cette accusation de complicité n'a pas été retenue par la justice, le chroniqueur de Thierry Ardisson enchaîne en assurant ne pas vouloir contribuer -via ses impôts- à la vie quotidienne d'Abdelkader Merah en prison.

Suite à ces propos, Jeremstar est allé plus loin en déclarant ceci: ""Il aurait dû être buté, envoyé dans un pays comme l'Irak ou la Syrie"", à propos du frère de Mohamed Merah. Une phrase qui a immédiatement été interrompue par sa camarade de plateau Raquel Garrido: ""Mais normalement nous on en a quelque chose à foutre de la vie ! C'est ça la différence fondamentale entre eux et nous, c'est que lui n'en a rien à foutre de la vie.""

Es ist die Kehrseite einer gesellschaftlich notwendigen Diskussion darüber, wie Christen und Muslime zusammenleben wollen

Einige Muslime haben darauf ziemlich coole Antworten gefunden

Muslim zu sein, das kann gerade keinen Spaß machen. Neben ein bisschen sachlicher Auseinandersetzung gibt's vor allem Vorurteile und Gepöbel. Im Netz, auf der Straße, überall.

Wie schön, dass sich viele Muslime ihren Humor bewahrt haben. Eine kleine Sammlung der lustigen, sarkastischsten, besten oder anrührendesten Antworten von Muslimen auf die täglichen Zumutungen:

1. Bad Hair Day

Klar, mit einem Kopftuch lässt sich ein Bad-Hair-Day schon mal eher rumbringen als ohne. Aber eine Dauerlösung ist das nicht.

Der US-Biologiestudentin Heraa Hasmi wurde das Gefrotzel jedenfalls zu blöd. Als eine junge Frau twitterte: ""Kopftuchträgerinnen haben es gut, sie müssen sich nicht Haare waschen"", schrieb sie:

""Menschen haben es so gut, sie müssen nicht duschen, seit sie Kleidung tragen.""

Humans are so lucky they don't have to shower since they wear clothes :((( https://t.co/AT6YpL3Gwp — Heraa Hashmi (@caveheraa) 7. November 2017

2. Sorry, keine Zeit für Dschihad

Kurz nach Weihnachten 2015 soll der Chef der IS-Terrormiliz Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alle Muslime dazu aufgerufen haben, sich dem Kampf anzuschließen. Der Autor und Menschenrechtsaktivist Iyad El-Baghdadi – er schreibt vorsichtshalber in seinem Twitter-Profil, dass er also nicht der Baghadadi sei – hat die Info verbreitet. Seine Follower wussten die offenbar ironisch gemeinte Vorlage zu schätzen.

Und antworteten, warum sie, leider, leider, auf keinen Fall kämpfen könnten: ""Ich muss meinen Goldfisch noch zum Tierarzt bringen.""

3. Danke, Mr. Trump

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Und da hatte sich Hend Amry, einen bekannte muslimische Bloggerin, vernehmen lassen: ""Can I get an Allahu Akbar"".

CAN I GET AN ALLAHU AKBAR https://t.co/mSM0VTb3YY — Hend Amry (@LibyaLiberty) 26. Juli 2017

Heißt so viel wie: Danke, Mr. Trump. Sie haben soeben gesagt, dass wir unseren Gott, Allah, anbeten dürfen.

Der Tweet hat inzwischen mehr als 102.000 Likes und wurde 38.000 Mal geteilt.

4. Die arme, unterdrückte Muslima

Muslimische Frauen sind brav, folgsam und räumen den ganzen Tag Männern und der Kinderschar hinterher. Soweit das Klischee.

Als eine Twitter-Nutzerin fragte, vor was denn die Follower am meisten Angst in der Ehe hätten, schrieb die Kopftuch tragende Gül trocken: ""Müde nach Hause zu kommen und zu sehen, dass mein Mann das Abendessen noch nicht gekocht hat.""

5. Homosexuell? Na klar!

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Aznahn Munas ist laut Medienberichten selbst Muslim, stammt aus Pakistan und hat in Australien eine Firma mitgegründet, die Tücher für Frauen verkauft: Halstücher, Kopftücher.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

I was at the gym praying in the yoga room and 3 ladies started following my motions.That's my story on how I accidentally led a yoga class. — Hamzah (@Hamzah_AlS) 14. August 2013

7. Message an den IS

Nach jedem Terroranschlag fordert jemand, Muslime müssten mehr gegen den Terror tun. Eine Forderung, über die man sicher diskutieren muss.

Nur sind viele Muslime genervt - denn so einfach ist die ganze Sache eben auch nicht.

""Lass mich schnell mal eben dem IS 'ne Whatsapp schicken und den Typen sagen, sie sollen mal chillen.""

Lemme just whatsapp ISIS and tell them to chill out Piers, one sec https://t.co/qc6DGE3MyE — ١١ (@babyygrill) 23. Mai 2017

8. Christen ohne Fehl und Tadel

Der bekannte US-Anwalt und Aktivist Qasim Rashid war sauer. ""Ein weißer Übermensch hat mir geschrieben, der Islam sei gewalttätig und höhnte, ich solle ihm eine christliche Version des IS zeigen.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Und das ist erst der Anfang der Aufzählung.

9. Es ist allein deine Sache, mein Kind

Die 17-jährige Lamyaa aus dem US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania veröffentlichte im Frühjahr 2017 eine Konversation mit ihrem Vater in Saudi-Arabien.

Sie fragt ihn, ganz vorsichtig, was er davon halte, dass sie vielleicht ihr Kopftuch ablegen wolle. Der britischen BBC sagte sie, sie hatte das nicht wirklich vorgehabt, aber sie habe ihn testen wollen.

Die Antwort, die Lamyaa auf Twitter postete, war eindeutig:

""Mein Schatz, das ist nicht meine Entscheidung. Kein Mann hat das Recht, so eine Entscheidung zu treffen. Wenn du das tun möchtest, dann tu es. Ich bin für dich da, egal wie du dich entscheidest.""

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

Mais en intégrant le comité d'éthique du laboratoire, elle prend conscience que les souris sont traitées ""comme des objets"".","MALTRAITANCE ANIMALE - Une enquête filmée en caméra cachée révèle les conditions de vie -et surtout de mort- des souris dans un grand laboratoire parisien. Réalisée par l'association Animal Testing, elle a été relayée par Libération ce lundi 6 novembre. L'association s'était déjà fait connaître pour avoir révélé des expériences sur les chiens financées par le Téléthon, ainsi que les conditions de vies de singes enfermés dans le sous-sol d'un hôpital parisien.

Face caméra, le visage et la voix brouillés pour garantir son anonymat, une technicienne de laboratoire témoigne de la dureté de ces conditions de travail face à la souffrance infligée aux animaux, images à l'appui. La vidéo peut être visionnée sur Youtube, attention, certaines images peuvent heurter la sensibilité.

""Un chercheur m'a demandé de prélever du sang sur plusieurs dizaines de souris"", raconte-t-elle, ""autant de sang qu'il était possible sur chaque animal, sans anesthésie, en les prélevant au niveau de l'œil"". Pour elle, c'était la demande de trop, qui l'a poussée à contacter l'association. ""On ne peut pas prélever du sang sur un être vivant jusqu'à temps qu'il n'y ait plus de sang, comme si c'était un flacon, et qu'il meure de ce qu'on lui fait subir.""

D'après cette technicienne, interrogée par Libération, le laboratoire parisien accueille simultanément plusieurs milliers de souris, modifiées génétiquement dans la plupart des cas et rendues malades. Certaines ont des tumeurs tellement grosses qu'un chercheur s'amuse: ""c'est comme si elles se baladaient avec un sac à dos"".

""Ce n'est pas évident les dislocations vertébrales""

En théorie, les animaliers de laboratoires doivent ""apporter un bien-être aux animaux de laboratoire et assurer la prise en charge technique des expérimentations"", résume la fiche Onisep de la profession. La lanceuse d'alerte, elle, s'occupe de changer leurs litières, de les sevrer, de prélever leur sang, organes, tumeurs, leur injecter des produits ou des cellules cancéreuses. Et de les tuer.

Une technique courante, indique-t-elle dans la vidéo, est la dislocation verticale, que l'on voit réalisée par une autre salariée. Elle consiste à tirer brusquement sur la queue et la tête de l'animal, et qui ne marche pas toujours du premier coup. ""Ça j'en ai fait, je dirais, des centaines de fois"", témoigne la lanceuse d'alerte.

D'autres souris sont intoxiquées au CO2, d'abord endormies dans un caisson puis mises à mort. Une autre animalière commente: ""Quand j'en ai le temps, je fais comme ça, parce que ce n'est pas évident les dislocations vertébrales"". Dans les images filmées, une souris continue de se débattre dans ce caisson alors que toutes les autres sont mortes.

Les protocoles scientifiques sont en théorie censés prendre en compte des ""points limites"" de douleur. Dans la réalité, ils ne sont pas toujours respectés, comme en atteste cette enquête. Certaines souris perdent leurs yeux dans ces expériences, ou deviennent aveugles. D'autres meurent de leurs souffrances. Certains protocoles prévoient même de ne pas les anesthésier, pour ne pas interférer avec les résultats des expériences.

La directive européenne qui encadre ces expériences érige normalement trois règles centrales, baptisées les trois R: la réduction du nombre d'animaux, le raffinement dans leur prise en charge, et, à terme, leur remplacement.

""Le modèle des animaux n'est pas forcément le bon""

Dans les faits, témoigne la lanceuse d'alerte, les scientifiques poursuivent les tests sur animaux par habitude. Quand elle les interroge à ce sujet, ils lui répondent ainsi: ""parce que quand j'ai fait des études, on a étudié sur des souris, quand on échange avec des confrères ou à travers les pays, comme tout le monde a déjà travaillé avec des souris, on continue à le faire"".

Pour les animaliers qui travaillent avec ces animaux, cette situation est d'autant plus dure que le veto dont ils disposent en théorie sur certaines expériences est très souvent outrepassé. ""Ça nous détruit"", insiste la technicienne. ""Il n'y a plus de goût à la vie."" Au bas de la hiérarchie, leur parole n'est guère écoutée, ajoute-t-elle.

Elle-même était dans un premier temps favorable à ces tests, qu'elle jugeait comme un moindre mal. Mais en intégrant le comité d'éthique du laboratoire, elle prend conscience que les souris sont traitées ""comme des objets"".

1,9 millions d'animaux ont été utilisés en 2015 dans la recherche, d'après une enquête du ministère de l'enseignement supérieur, de la recherche, et de l'innovation. Parmi tous ces cobayes, plus d'un million de souris ont été employées.

""On n'est absolument pas contre la recherche"", précise auprès de Libération Joanna Trouchaud, responsable de la communication d'Animal Testing. ""Mais on estime que le modèle des animaux n'est pas forcément le bon."" L'association, qui a lancé une pétition en ligne, demande ""qu'une commission d'enquête parlementaire ait lieu sur l'expérimentation animale"".

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

On my last night in Puerto Rico, I have dinner with a businessman who’s lived in San Juan for decades.","ADJUNTAS, Puerto Rico — In the final frantic days before Hurricane Maria devastated this small town in the mountains of central Puerto Rico, Rosana Aviles Marin did everything she could to help her elderly parents prepare for what was coming.

She brought in food and water, and used plywood to reinforce the walls and roof of their modest two-story cement house. It didn’t matter. The winds of up to 155 miles per hour that roared across the island buckled the house’s walls and tore holes in the ceiling, letting in water that destroyed furniture, framed photos of Marin and her siblings, and brightly colored ceramic statues of Jesus.

That wasn’t all it destroyed. The storm also downed power lines throughout the area, and Marin and her parents have been entirely without electricity for weeks. Much of their food went bad, they have no cellphone service, and local markets and restaurants remain closed. Her parents use a small diesel generator to power lights and, for a few hours per day, a small refrigerator. The rest of the time, she tells me during a recent trip to the area, “my parents live in darkness.”

They aren’t the only ones. Hurricane Maria, one of the strongest ever to hit Puerto Rico, caused unprecedented damage to the island’s already fragile power grid. Four weeks after making landfall, roughly 79 percent of the island still doesn’t have electricity.

Local and federal officials say it will be months before the power is fully restored, and they acknowledge that in some places it could take far longer because their crews have yet to even reach the hardest-hit areas. The head of Puerto Rico’s debt-ridden power utility says repairs will cost $5 billion; some officials privately tell me the figure will be far higher.

With the national grid down for the foreseeable future, generators are in such high demand that their prices have skyrocketed, putting them out of reach of many average Puerto Ricans. There are regular reports of generators being stolen from outside homes and businesses.

Walking through the walled neighborhood of Old San Juan, the island’s main tourist attraction, I see police officers installing floodlights in a central square and then flipping on a shiny new generator. One of the officers tells me he’ll be there all night to keep an eye on the equipment. “It would otherwise be gone by morning,” he says, shrugging.

Electricity is something you don’t notice until it’s gone. On the mainland, where power outages are rare and brief, Americans are used to simply flipping a switch and watching the light come on, plugging in an air conditioner and feeling the cold air, and trusting that your refrigerator will keep fresh food and milk from going bad.

When the power goes out, that sense of comfort quickly disappears. The parts of daily life that were once taken for granted are suddenly gone, with no clear sense of when they’ll be back. To not have power — to be literally and figuratively in the dark — is to leave the modern world and retreat into an older and more precarious one. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, that’s Puerto Rico’s new normal.

The lack of electricity doesn’t simply mean months of hardship for the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Rican who will be without air conditioners, fans, televisions, and refrigerators for the foreseeable future. It’s also significantly slowing the entire US relief effort, and preventing other vital parts of the island’s battered infrastructure from coming back online.

Internet and cellphone service can’t be fully restored without a steady flow of electricity to individual cell towers. The pumps, filtration systems, and other equipment used to treat sewage and provide clean drinking water also can’t function without power. Right now, those plants aren’t receiving much of it.

The lack of electricity is significantly slowing the entire US relief effort on Puerto Rico. Cellphone networks and water systems won’t come back online without it.

“People need to understand this is not something that can be turned on tomorrow,” José Sánchez, who is leading the Army Corps of Engineers’ program to restore the grid, tells me in an interview in San Juan. “This something that’s going to take months to fix. We’re dealing with a very tender system, a very sensitive system, and it will require a lot of work to get it back up.”

Sánchez, a soft-spoken man who uses the precise language of a trained engineer, says the Corps could eventually bring at least 500 of its employees to the island, alongside 1,000 private contractors. He was born in Puerto Rico, and says the effort to bring power back is deeply personal for him. The island can’t recover, much less prosper, without it.

“I think of electricity like water, as a basic need and a basic requirement to have a semi-normal life,” he tells me. “Electricity is the linchpin of everything.”

That means the lack of electricity is a literal life-and-death issue — and one that may wind up killing more Puerto Ricans than the storm itself. The island’s government says 48 people died because of the hurricane, but my colleagues Eliza Barclay and Alexia Fernández Campbell estimate that the real death toll from the storm is probably well into the hundreds.

That number could spike even higher if the blackouts continue because the island needs electricity to operate its water and sewage systems; if the grid remains offline, huge numbers of Puerto Ricans will be at real risk of dying from heatstroke, dehydration, or exposure to contaminated water.

In a darkened Puerto Rico, where cellphones don’t work and clean water doesn’t flow, there’s never been more of a need for electricity. It’s also never been in such short supply — or so difficult and expensive to bring back.

Puerto Rico’s power system was a mess before Maria. Now it’s barely clinging to life.

President Trump’s slow and halting response to the Puerto Rico crisis has been widely criticized, with a new poll showing that public approval for Trump’s handling of recent hurricanes has plummeted by 20 points in less than a month. (Trump himself, it should be noted, rates his response as a “10.”)

Trump has also been hammered for a series of recent tweets that appeared to blame Puerto Rico itself for the island’s current woes. One said “Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.” Another said “it’s [sic] old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated.”

But here’s the thing: The substance of what Trump said about the electrical grid was largely correct. The island's grid is antiquated and hasn’t received any major upgrades in years. Power outages were a regular part of daily life on the island even before the storm (a 2016 report found they were four to five times more common on the island than in the mainland US). Maria has made those shortfalls exponentially worse, but it didn’t cause them.

Battered by Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has never needed electricity more but had less of it

The reasons have to do with geography and money. Puerto Rico’s biggest power generators are on the south of the island, but most of its inhabitants live on the north side, primarily in San Juan. There are four high-capacity transmission lines that carry power from the south to the north, and they pass through the center part of the island, the region Marin calls home. The problem is that central Puerto Rico is mountainous, full of huge swaths of thick forest, and mainly reachable only by driving on terrifyingly narrow dirt roads.

That makes it hard to reach those four vital lines even in the best of circumstances. In post-Maria Puerto Rico it’s even harder, because the center of the island was the region hardest hit by the hurricane. Since the government is trying to get power to San Juan first, that means those in the regions devastated most by the hurricane will be waiting the longest for power to be restored. Sánchez, the engineer, says workers would need to be flown in by helicopter to clear debris before repairs could even begin. As of now, three of those four lines are inoperable.

The second major problem is a financial one. PREPA, the island’s widely despised electric utility, hasn’t done any major upgrades to the grid in decades. The median age of the island’s power plants is 44 years, more than double the normal industry standard of 18 years, according to a report from FiveThirtyEight. The plants are so old that it’s hard to find replacement parts when individual pieces of equipment break down.

It’s also difficult to find workers who know how to keep that aging equipment up and running. Vox’s Fernández Campbell reported last month that PREPA has lost thousands of workers in recent years, including 600 — fully a tenth of its workforce — this past April alone.

Ricardo Ramos, who runs PREPA, says that bringing the grid back to its pre-Maria state could cost up to $5 billion. The problem is that the utility itself is more than $9 billion in debt and filed for bankruptcy this past summer.

That means money for repairs, let alone upgrades, can only really come from two places.

One is Congress, which passed legislation in mid-October authorizing $36.5 billion in hurricane and wildfire relief. The package included $4.9 billion in loans for Puerto Rico’s cash-strapped government, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in May. Lawmakers from Florida and Texas have indicated that they’re going to ask for tens of billions of dollars more, though it’s not clear if Congress will sign off on the additional money, or how much of it would make its way to Puerto Rico.

The other way to raise funds is through higher rates on the utility’s customers, but the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, which oversees PREPA, might not sign off on them. There are also legitimate concerns that Puerto Ricans, who already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the US and are now facing widespread unemployment because of the storm, won’t be able to afford to pay them.

José Román Morales, the head of the commission, tells me that the island needs to find a way to get the old system back to its pre-Maria state — which would bring power back to desperate citizens sooner — while looking for ways to modernize and upgrade it.

“That’s the main topic of conversation at the moment,” he says. “There’s an emergency that needs to be addressed, and we need to get power to the hospitals and other essential institutions for life on this island. But stopping there isn’t enough. One way or another, we have to make the grid more resilient and energy-efficient.”

Renewable energy is one appealing option, since the island has an abundance of sun and wind. Tesla founder Elon Musk says he can build a new and more efficient grid that would use solar power to generate electricity.

Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló says he wants to talk to Musk in more detail, but it’s not clear who would pay for Musk’s proposed system given that both the electrical utility and the island itself have declared bankruptcy. (Rosselló has also promised to bring power back to 95 percent of the island by Christmas, a deadline US officials here dismiss as unrealistic.)

As Vox’s Umair Irfan notes, building a grid centered on renewable energy would almost certainly be more expensive than reconstituting the flawed system that was there before the storm. That means “the default solution — rebuilding the island’s electrical grid the way it was — may end up becoming the likeliest scenario,” he explains.

For now, the military and civilian officials working to pull Puerto Rico back from the brink are focused on bringing powerful generators to the island. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the three-star Army general leading US military relief efforts in Puerto Rico, says civilian personnel are surveying hospitals, water plants, and sewage treatment facilities to find out which facilities have generators that are already working, which have ones in of need repair, and which don’t have any at all.

“If they don't have a generator, do they need one, and can we bring one in?” he tells me. “And when we talk generators, I'm not talking your little Honda one. I’m talking about massive generators, like the size of a semi-truck.”

FEMA has already installed 100 generators at individual hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and water pumping facilities. It plans to bring in up to 400 more, according to officials on the ground here.

Generators are a short-term fix, however; a permanent solution will take far longer.

That is, in part, because of the technological hurdles to generating renewable energy on the island — especially in the aftermath of the hurricane.

A high-tech wind farm is ready to start producing power. Here’s why it can’t.

On a sweltering day in mid-October, Ruben Rivera drives his cluttered pickup truck down the mottled mud roads that run through his company’s wind farm in Santa Isabel, in the far south of Puerto Rico. As we make our way across the property, Rivera points to row after row of towering white wind turbines.

Built by the German industrial giant Siemens at a cost of more than $2 million apiece and capable of adjusting themselves to keep pace with shifting wind patterns, the 44 wind turbines at Santa Isabel are some of the most advanced on earth. They also, to Rivera’s surprise, made it through the hurricane without a single scratch or dent.

Rivera, who runs the facility on behalf of its owner, California-based Pattern Energy, lives about 90 minutes away from Santa Isabel. He rode out the storm at home with his wife and children, and waited until the worst of the weather had passed before setting off for the wind farm, afraid of what he’d find.

“I was counting the number of turbines on the drive down because I kept thinking that we must have lost some,” he tells me. “But then I saw that they were all still standing, and that they looked intact. We’ve checked the turbines and blades, and I haven’t seen any damage. They’re ready to go”

Rivera stops his pickup truck next to one of the turbines, clambers up a metallic staircase, takes the padlock off a small door, and steps inside the towering structure.

The interior is spotless, with a ladder extending up through a hole in the ceiling that can be used to climb to the very top of the 24-story tower. The power is generated by three long, tapered white blades, and then brought down to the base of the structure by a thick bundle of cables that connect to a large metallic box a few feet from the door. Rivera points to the floor, where other cables carry the power out of the turbine and then onto the grid. There isn’t a speck of dirt, despite the fact that one of the strongest hurricanes in US history roared though the area less than a month ago.

There also isn’t any noise. The turbines are in perfect working order and could be a vital source of energy for the power-starved island. Except that they can’t actually be turned on without a small amount of electricity from the grid — which, of course, isn’t currently capable of providing it.

When the grid eventually comes back online, the wind farm will be able to provide power to about 35,000 homes. Until then, the blades aren’t turning.

Rivera, in the meantime, spends his time checking, and rechecking, each turbine so they can be turned on as soon as the power starts flowing again. He’s on a clock. Siemens, the manufacturer, says the turbines can’t sit idle for more than six weeks without potentially damaging the equipment. The hurricane slammed into Puerto Rico almost a month ago, so each day brings that deadline closer.

“It’s frustrating coming to the site and trying to provide energy to the grid but not being able to because we’re still waiting for the power to come back,” Rivera tells me. “The equipment is ready to go. We’re ready to go. But I don’t know when we’ll be able to start back up again.”

Puerto Rico’s medical system is being reshaped by the hurricane

The lack of electricity is reshaping Puerto Rican life in ways big and small. It’s also forcing many here to improvise solutions to problems they never thought they’d face.

The community health center in Loíza, a small town about 20 minutes outside of San Juan, is a low-slung gray building set just off the main road. When I visit it on a warm, cloudy day in October, the facility is eerily quiet and empty. The TVs are turned off, the information booth is empty, and steel shutters cover the windows of the pharmacy.

The medical center is still in operation, however, though at a severely reduced capacity than it had been before the storm. Dr. María Rodríguez, who runs the facility, has worked there in various capacities for 24 years. She says she expected the storm to be bad but was still taken aback by the hurricane’s destructive power.

She leads me back to her cluttered office, which is filled with overflowing boxes of medical supplies, diapers, baby formula, Purell hand sanitizer, and small packets of children’s multivitamins shaped like gummy bears. A pile of shrink-wrapped sleeping bags sits on the floor near her desk. “My office has become a distribution center,” she says with a half-smile.

In the weeks since the storm, Rodríguez and her staff have worked with Loíza’s municipal government to ensure a steady supply of the diesel needed to power the center’s generators. Most parts of the center — from OB-GYN services to its primary care clinic — are functioning, though for fewer hours and without air conditioning.

The medical center, though, is rapidly changing its normal ways of doing business in order to adapt to the new reality on the ground. Rodríguez tells me that many local residents have lost their homes and are living in large communal shelters. They may not know the medical center is open; even if they do, they often have no way of getting here.

In response, Rodríguez is sending doctors and nurses to the shelters, which are already seeing periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases such as conjunctivitis and parasite-borne skin diseases like scabies. That’s a new approach for the medical center, but Rodríguez feels like she’d be letting down her community if she didn’t experiment with alternative methods of delivering care. “This is our new normal,” she says.

The lack of power is changing life on Puerto Rico. It will take a long time for it to change back.

On the outskirts of Loíza, several concrete pylons that once held power lines lie shattered on the side of the road, a loose tangle of metallic rebar sticking up from the wreckage. Work crews are out installing new wooden poles, but there are dozens — in both directions — that still need to be replaced. The repair work will take weeks, and Loíza is only one small town on an island teeming with larger ones.

Back in San Juan, the only part of the city with steady and reliable electricity is the area surrounding the city’s gleaming convention center, which is now the headquarters for the military and civilian relief effort. The power is also on at the Sheraton hotel across the street, as well as in its bustling casino, which has one of the few ATMs on the island that is still distributing cash.

The light starts to fade as I drive away from the convention center and make my way through blackened streets lined with shuttered restaurants and stores. A small number of houses, office buildings, and apartment buildings have their own generators, but it’s possible to drive for blocks without seeing any lights.

On my last night in Puerto Rico, I have dinner with a businessman who’s lived in San Juan for decades. He’s survived other hurricanes, but he’s not sure the island will bounce back from this one. At 11:15, he excuses himself and says he needs to start heading home to make sure he’s off the roads before the city’s midnight curfew goes into effect. He has a long drive ahead of him, and the trip back always takes longer in the dark.",Darkness: life in Puerto Rico without electricity,https://www.vox.com/2017/10/23/16501164/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-power-water-sewage-trump

For example, Standard Bank's PureSave, Nedbank's JustSave, FNB's Simply Save and Absa's Money Builder are examples of savings accounts where you can deposit or withdraw money at any time.

The more you save, the higher the interest rates.

2. Notice day accounts

In this type of account, you cannot get access to your funds until you serve whatever is your notice period as agreed with the financial institution. This may save ""impulsive withdrawers."" The notice periods range from 21, 32 and 61 days.

Normally the longer the notice period, the higher the interest rate.

3. Fixed deposits

You need a minimum investment as per the financial institution and you choose your investment period which could be anything from 33 days to five years. The interest rate is fixed for the period of your investment.

There are also flexible fixed deposits accounts, where withdrawals are limited to two of not more than 15 percent of savings.

5. Tax-free accounts

This type of saving could work for long-term investment.

These accounts were introduced in 2015 as an incentive for South Africans to save. Through tax-free accounts, one can invest up to R30,000 a year and it is capped at R500,000 per one's lifetime.

5. Stokvels

Millions of particularly black South Africans have historically been saving through stokvels to pool their money and get credit when needed. Saving through a group can help you be accountable to a larger collective and there is collective discipline, from which one can benefit.

Stokvels work through the contribution rules set by that group and they may pay you up on your birthday, at the end of the year or at a time you have determined.

Manyike believes anyone can save, only it needs a will and discipline.

He also cautioned consumers to live within their means in the tough economic climate South Africa is in. ""It's important that consumers focus on things we have control over, such as how we control our money on our expenses,"" said Manyike -- and this is how these saving vehicles can help.","'Save whatever you can, start with R100' -- Says Financial Expert This World Savings Day",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/31/save-whatever-you-can-start-with-r100-says-financial-expert-this-world-savings-day_a_23261623/

FISCALITÉ - Dix-huit mois après les ""Panama Papers"" portant sur la fraude fiscale, le Consortium international des journalistes d'investigation (ICIJ), regroupant 96 médias de 67 pays, a commencé à dévoiler les ""Paradise Papers"".

A l'appui de ces révélations, la fuite de 13,5 millions de documents financiers, provenant notamment d'un cabinet international d'avocats basé aux Bermudes, Appleby, obtenus par le journal allemand Süddeutsche Zeitung.

Des documents provenant d'Appleby dévoilent notamment que le ministre américain au Commerce Wilbur Ross a gardé des participations dans une société de transport maritime ayant des liens d'affaires étroits avec un oligarque russe visé par des sanctions américaines et avec un gendre de Vladimir Poutine, selon le New York Times.

Mais là où les Panama Papers mettaient au grand jour de nombreux cas de fraudes et d'évasions fiscales (même si détenir un compte dans des paradis fiscaux n'est pas illégal, à condition de le déclarer), les Paradise Papers font surtout état de savants montages d'optimisations fiscales. Moralement répréhensible, sans doute, mais pas illégal.

La France s'est battue pour que les paradis fiscaux, le secret bancaire, la fraude organisée, ça soit terminé Nicolas Sarkozy, 23/09/09

Dix ans après le début de la crise financière qui a ébranlé la finance mondiale, on peut être surpris par la permanence de ces pratiques, surtout quand on a encore en tête les déclarations de Nicolas Sarkozy. ""A Londres, la France s'est battue pour que les paradis fiscaux, le secret bancaire, la fraude organisée, ça soit terminé"", avait-il déclaré sur TF1 le 23 septembre 2009.

En effet, en plus de jeter une lumière crue sur les pratiques de la finance internationale, la crise des subprimes a aussi plongé de nombreux pays dans la récession, tarissant les recettes fiscales tout en faisant grimper les dépenses sociales, avec à la clé une explosion des déficits. D'où l'intérêt de mettre fin à des pratiques tolérées depuis des décennies, mais coûteuses pour le Trésor public.

Plus facile à dire qu'à faire, n'en déplaise à Nicolas Sarkozy... Harmoniser la fiscalité internationale, cela prend du temps, beaucoup de temps. ""On est à la fois sur du droit international et des conventions fiscales. Il faut modifier des règles très complexes sur la base d'un consensus"", résume l'économiste Philippe Crevel, du Cercle de l'Epargne.

Or, vu le nombre de paradis fiscaux, c'est loin d'être simple. Un paradis fiscal est un pays, ou une juridiction, qui pratique un taux d'imposition sur les sociétés, les revenus, ou le patrimoine, très bas, et privilégie l'opacité bancaire.

""L'UE est la zone avec la densité de paradis fiscaux la plus forte"", déplore au HuffPost François d'Aubert, expert du sujet, président de la Commission d'évaluation du forum mondial sur la fiscalité de l'OCDE de 2009 à 2015.

Gibraltar, les îles de Man, Gersey, Guernesey, mais aussi Chypre, Malte, Monaco, et des pays comme les Pays-bas, le Luxembourg, l'Autriche, la Suisse, sont rangés dans la catégorie ""paradis fiscal"" par l'OCDE.

Big bang fiscal en vue pour 2018

Malgré tout, la cause avance. Impensable il y a encore quelques années, la Suisse a voté la fin du secret bancaire pour les ressortissants étrangers en 2015. Il entrera en application en 2018, comme dans de nombreux autres pays.

L'histoire pourrait même rendre justice aux déclarations de Nicolas Sarkozy. En effet, suite au fameux G20 à Londres en 2009, un big bang fiscal va s'opérer en 2018: une centaine de pays se sont engagés à communiquer automatiquement des données sur les comptes de résidents étrangers.

""Une banque à Singapour sera tenue d'envoyer au fisc français les relevés de compte de ses ressortissants, se félicite François d'Aubert. C'est un système très serré qui va donner une grande connaissance des circuits financiers"". Et ceux qui ne sont pas en règle peuvent déjà s'attendre à un contrôle fiscal...

Bien sûr, il reste encore beaucoup à faire, comme le montre la question de l'imposition des ""GAFA"" ""Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) en Europe. Trouver le consensus n'est pas gagné d'avance pour harmoniser la fiscalité des états membres.

Quand Apple a été condamné par la justice européenne à rembourser 13 milliards d'euros d'impôts à l'Irlande en 2016, l'Irlande a fini poursuivie en octobre pour laxisme par la justice européenne: le pays ne veut pas recouvrir cette somme, fidèle à sa politique fiscale.

""Il faut imposer les bénéfices là où ils sont réalisés, reconnaît François d'Aubert. Le sujet avance bien à Bruxelles, mais le combat est dur, à la fois sur la fiscalité et la concurrence"". Une résistance à la hauteur d'enjeux qui se comptent en milliards d'euros.

Doch nicht nur Steueroasen sind ein Problem

Milliarden gehen dem Fiskus wegen Betrugsfällen in Deutschland verloren

Die Namen der Inseln klingen exotisch, ebenso wie die Tricks, die die weltweite Elite nutzt, um Steuern zu sparen: die Bermudas, die Isle of Man, die Virgin Islands, die Cayman Islands und so weiter.

All diese Steuerparadiese tauchen in Unterlagen auf, über die unter anderem die “Süddeutsche Zeitung” berichtet. Demnach haben Prominente, Politiker und Wohlhabende über Tricksereien hunderte Milliarden Euro am Fiskus vorbeigeschleust - meistens völlig legal.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Politiker und Unternehmer umgingen Millionen an Steuern: Diese Deutschen tauchen in den Paradise Papers auf



Allein Deutschland entgehen pro Jahr Steuereinnahmen von rund 17 Milliarden Euro durch Steueroasen, hat der französische Ökonom Gabriel Zucman berechnet.

Betrug vor unserer Haustür

Die Aufregung, die auf die Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers folgt, ist deshalb völlig verständlich und richtig. Dennoch übersieht sie etwas Wichtiges: Der größte Steuerbetrug passiert täglich vor unserer Haustür.

Bis zu 40 Milliarden Euro gehen dem deutschen Fiskus jährlich durch Steuerbetrug in Deutschland durch die Lappen, schätzt die Deutsche Steuergewerkschaft, andere Experten gehen sogar von noch höheren Schäden aus.

Ihr Vorsitzender Thomas Eigenthaler, erklärt im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, dass allein Gastronomen jährlich rund 10 Milliarden Euro an Steuern hinterziehen.

Vor allem Kleinstunternehmen wie Kioske nutzten häufig noch Bargeldkassen, erklärt Eigenthaler. Dadurch seien die Einnahmen nicht nachvollziehbar - der Betrug ist ein Kinderspiel. Das betrifft auch Taxifahrer und Glückspielhallen. Überall wo Bargeld im Spiel sei, hätten Betrüger leichtes Spiel.

Softwarebetrug gibt es nicht nur bei den Autobauern

Aber auch moderne elektronische Registrierkassen können für den Steuerbetrug missbraucht werden. Dabei hilft eine Software, die den Wareneingang und -Ausgang so klein rechnet, dass der Gesamtumsatz des Restaurants sinkt. Folglich fällt auch der zu versteuernde Gewinn kleiner aus.

Die Kasse registriert dann zum Beispiel, dass der Gastronom weniger Schnitzel und Pommes eingekauft hat als in Wirklichkeit - auch die Verkäufe rechnet die Software entsprechend klein.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten



Bisher ist der Gesetzgeber gegen diesen Betrug machtlos. Und auch ein weiterer Steuertrick von dem Eigenthaler berichtet, löst Kopfschütteln aus.

Händler aus China prellen den deutschen Staat

So nutzen in China registrierte Unternehmen den Versandhändler Amazon, um massenhaft Produkte in Deutschland zu verkaufen. Die Produkte lagern bei Amazon in Deutschland, werden aber ohne den Aufschlag von 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer verkauft.

90 Prozent der chinesischen Händler würden an der Steuer vorbeiverkaufen, schätzt Eigenthaler. Auch Ebay ist betroffen.

Der Schaden für das Finanzamt: eine Milliarde Euro. Das Problem ist den Behörden schon länger bekannt. Im Mai erklärte der hessische Finanzminister Thomas Schäfer gegenüber der ""Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung"": ""Online-Handel boomt. Mit ihm boomt aber leider auch Steuerbetrug vor allem ausländischer Unternehmen.""

Aber das ist noch nicht alles. So geben Privatpersonen ihren Arbeitsweg beim Finanzamt höher an als er tatsächlich ist. Bücher werden als Fachbücher deklariert, um sie steuerlich geltend zu machen und ein privates Weihnachtsessen wird als Geschäftsdinner deklariert.

All diese Betrügereien von Privatpersonen nennt Eigenthaler “Unehrlichkeiten im Tagesgeschäft” - sie seien im Gegensatz zum Betrug in der Gastronomie kein strukturelles Problem.

Dass diese strukturellen Probleme aber schnell gelöst werden, glaubt kaum ein Experte. Dafür fehlt den Finanzämter unter anderem schlicht das Personal - im Falle von Steuerausfällen bei Verkäufen bei Amazon und Ebay aber auch die passenden Gesetze.

So waren ab 2015 zwei Apple-Sitze auf der Insel Jersey registriert

Dort liegt der Steuersatz für Unternehmen bei null Prozent

Die Paradise Papers zeigen Apples neuen Steuertrick. Der US-Konzern wollte sich im Frühjahr 2014 zusichern lassen, auf der Steueroase Jersey keinerlei Steuern zahlen zu müssen.

""Ist es möglich, eine offizielle Bestätigung der Steuerbefreiung zu bekommen, und kostet das etwas?"", ließ Apple über eine amerikanische Anwaltskanzlei bei dem Offshore-Dienstleister Appleby nachfragen, bevor Tochterfirmen Geschäftssitze auf die Insel verlagerten.

Irland-Gesellschaften von Apple nutzten eine Lücke im irischen Steuerrecht. Diese ermöglichte es ihnen, in keinem Land der Welt Steuern zahlen zu müssen. Die Lücke wurde 2015 auf internationalen Druck hin geschlossen.

Danach führte Appleby laut den Dokumenten zwei irische Apple-Firmen mit Geschäftssitz auf der Ärmelkanal-Insel Jersey, zeigen die Paradise Papers, die der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" zugespielt wurden. Auf Jersey liegt der Steuersatz für Unternehmen bei null Prozent. Auf diese Weise drückte der Konzern seine Steuerquote bei Gewinnen außerhalb der USA weiter auf nur drei bis sieben Prozent.

Apple betonte, sich an alle Gesetze zu halten. ""Wir sind der größte Steuerzahler der Welt"", sagte ein Sprecher.

Auch Nike arbeitet mit Offshore-Firmen

Auch der Sportartikelkonzern Nike nutzt ein Steuerschlupfloch. Der Sportartikelhersteller gründete zuerst zahlreiche Offshore-Firmen auf den Bermudas, um dort die Lizenzrechte der Firma zu halten - etwa für das Firmenlogo, den weltberühmten ""Swoosh"".

An diese Briefkastenfirmen mussten Nike-Niederlassungen Hunderte Millionen Euro bezahlen, um die Markenrechte nutzen zu dürfen.

Durch die hohen Lizenzzahlungen wurden die weltweiten Gewinne drastisch gedrückt und damit die Steuerlast. Nike verlagerte laut den Paradise Papers 2014 diese Praxis in die europäische Steueroase Niederlande - und drückte seine globale Steuerrate damit von 35 Prozent um das Jahr 2002 auf nur mehr rund 13 Prozent.

Nature, you're just showing off.

The Bureau of Meteorology has just released its 2018 Australian Weather Calendar, and oh wow.

This image of a wave crashing over Mornington Pier in Port Phillip Bay was taken while a strong cold front roared across the bay and southern Victoria.

As usual, the calendar features a range of pics from locations around Australia, some taken by professional photographers, others taken by people who just happened to be in the right spot at the right time.

One of our favourites is this magnificent sunset shot out the back of the Mt Hotham ski resort in Victoria, taken by from hobby photographer John Bagge (you can see more of his work here). He'd been having a family day in the snow and simply HAD to stop and take this on the way home.

Want another sunset? Try this one in the West MacDonnell Ranges near Alice Springs. It was taken by photographer Peter Nunn (more here) who was returning to Alice Springs from a photography trip to Simpsons Gap. When he saw this storm cell, he just had to climb a nearby hill and capture it.

Here's a change of pace. It's a gorgeous brooding pic of a plane on approach to Adelaide Airport taken by Adelaide local Asbjorn Kanck. Here's what the Bureau said of those unusual clouds:

This rare cloud type is called altocumulus stratiformis opacus asperitas. The altocumulus refers to the height and cloud type (cumulus cloud in the middle level of the atmosphere); stratiformis indicates it has formed in a layer; and opacus denotes the cloud is thick enough to mask the sun. Asperitas, from the Latin for roughen, refers to the wave-like feature underneath the cloud. One theory of how these clouds occur is that when mammatus clouds sink into an area of strong winds, it causes these rough, lumpy formations.

All we know is we'd rather not be on a plane landing in it. Very bumpy ride, we suspect.

How gorgeous is this one? It's fog in the valley at sunrise, as taken from Mt Buninyong near Ballarat. Local snapper Andrew Thomas (more of his work here) goes out most mornings looking for great imagery in his area. You got a good one that frosty July day, Andrew.

The calendar has several more pics and is available to buy at the Bureau's online shop.

The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the Queen, was found to have millions of pounds invested in offshore arrangements.

Around £10m from the Queen’s private fund was paid into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda between 2004 and 2005, according to the so-called Paradise Papers leak.

Corbyn suggested the Queen’s finances should fall within the scope of an investigation into the leak.

Asked on Monday if the Queen should apologise, Corbyn said:

“Anyone that is putting money into tax havens in order to avoid taxation in Britain, and obviously investigations have to take place, should do two things: not just apologise for it but also recognise what it does to our society. “If a very wealthy person wants to avoid taxation in Britain and therefore put money into a tax haven somewhere, who loses? Schools, hospitals, housing, all those public services lose and the rest of the population have to pay to cover up the deficit created by that.”

A spokesman for the Labour leader said Corbyn did not mean the Queen should say sorry herself.

“Jeremy did not call for the Queen to apologise, but said anyone who puts money into a tax haven to avoid paying tax should, and that they should recognise the damage done by avoidance to society,” the spokesman said.

Later he told Bloomberg TV there should be “an inquiry into all the revelations about the Paradise Papers”.

Asked if that included the Queen, Mr Corbyn replied: “Everybody. The Royal Household are subject to taxation. I don’t know what has happened in that case. These issues all must be part of that.”

Das Ziel von Palmers Angriff: Partei-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin. Es sei ein ""Trauerspiel“, dass Trittin, ""ein Schatten der Vergangenheit“, über die Koalition mitverhandle.

""Eine glatte Lüge""

""Was macht so jemand in einer Verhandlungsgruppe?"", fragte Palmer bei Facebook. Der Konservative in den Reihen der Grünen kritisierte vor allem Trittins Aussagen in Interviews. Trittin habe ""keine Angst vor der Unwahrheit""“ und sei stets darauf bedacht, ""den Verhandlungspartner schlecht aussehen"" zu lassen.

Trittin hatte kürzlich im ""Spiegel"" kritisiert, Union und FDP wären sich einig, dass die Grünen in den Verhandlungen möglichst wenige ihrer Punkte durchsetzen sollten.

There are fears Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year sentence, could have her time in jail extended as a direct result of the foreign secretary’s comment.

She was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing last weekend at which Johnson’s remarks were cited as proof that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime”.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s family maintain she was simply on holiday in Iran to show her infant daughter Gabriella to her grandparents.

But Fox told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme that any blame should rest with Iran not with Johnson.

“We all make slips of the tongue and we have got to be very careful that we are not over reacting to this,” the international trade secretary said.

He added to Sky News: “I think what we are seeing here is an attempt to discredit the foreign secretary without thinking first of all what the impact may be and what excuses it may give to the Iranian regime to act improperly.”

Labour MP Tulip Siddiq told HuffPost UK she was “shocked and dismayed” by Fox’s comments.

Johnson called Iran’s foreign minister on Tuesday morning.

He is also facing demands to publically correct what he said in an effort to prevent her sentence being lengthened by an extra five years.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, told the BBC this morning he wanted Johnson to retract what he said in parliament “and say clearly that Nazanin wasn’t training journalists and that she was just there on holiday”.

“I have promised Nazanin that it’s still possible that they will be home for Christmas. I’m still battling on those terms,” he said.

Johnson told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee last week:

“When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it. “(Neither) Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe nor her family has been informed about what crime she has actually committed. And that I find extraordinary, incredible.”

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, which employs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, has urged Johnson to correct his “serious mistake”.

Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Johnson should quit if his actions have damaged Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s prospects of freedom.

Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn where Zaghari-Ratcliffe lives, said: “I am in equal measure shocked and dismayed by Liam Fox’s comments this morning.

“To say that we shouldn’t ‘over-react’ to Boris’s grave error simply shows him as another government minister who is ignorant to the details of this young mother’s tragic case.”

Conservative MP Anna Soubry said Johnson’s actions were “appalling”.

She said on Twitter: “In ‘normal’ times Boris Johnson would have been sacked long ago.”

Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said Johnson “must be sacked”.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: “Last week’s remarks by the Foreign Secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.”

Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK, expressed disappointment that Fox had chosen to defend Johnson rather than “provide vital clarification over the fact that Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe is a charity worker who was on a family trip in Iran when she was arrested last year”.

“Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already been subjected to solitary confinement, a grossly unfair trial and now reportedly faces the threat of a new criminal charge,” she told HuffPost UK.

“The Foreign Secretary’s call last week for Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be released was welcome, but he must clarify his remarks about her work and the purpose of her visit to Iran.

“Now is the time for a straightforward, public clarification from the UK Government about Zaghari-Ratcliffe being the victim of a glaring miscarriage of justice who should be released immediately and allowed to return back to Britain with her daughter Gabriella.”

Redress, a human rights organisation who has worked with Nazanin’s family to secure her release, told HuffPost UK that Johnson needs to “focus on the serious repercussions of his words”.

“As a British citizen in a deplorable situation Nazanin has every right to expect that her Foreign Secretary will be able to advance her case,” Redress director Carla Ferstman said.

“Instead, she has had to go through the trauma of being hauled in front of a judge again and may well face an extension of her time in prison. To blow this off as a simple mistake belies the importance of his position and the seriousness of Nazanin’s plight. Boris Johnson must make it clear publicly and as soon as possible that she is an innocent mother who was simply on holiday and must be brought home immediately.”",Liam Fox Warns Against 'Overreaction' To Boris Johnson's Claim About Briton Jailed In Iran,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liam-fox-warns-against-overreaction-to-boris-johnsons-claim-about-briton-jailed-in-iran_uk_5a0172b5e4b066c2c039e2d8

Strong winds and the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia helped send a staggering 1.7 million megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity to the National Grid.

Put another way, for 28 days wind power provided enough energy to power every home in Scotland. For 15 of those days it was actually producing enough energy to power the entire country’s electricity needs. The figures have been published by WWF Scotland using data collected by WeatherEnergy. On the 2 October, wind turbines generated enough power for 7.116 million homes, that’s nearly three times the number of homes in Scotland. WWF Scotland’s Director Sam Gardner said: “We’re blown away by these figures but they are part of a pattern of increasingly green power production made possible thanks to many years of political support in Scotland. Across the year, renewables now contribute over half of our electricity needs.”

While these figures are undeniably impressive, there remains the issue of actually making sure that all of this energy is then distributed or stored until it’s needed. One of the key problems with wind turbines is that you cannot simply ‘turn on’ the wind when you need it. Instead excess energy from wind turbines will either need to be distributed out beyond Scotland or stored until such time as it’s needed.

While Elon Musk’s Tesla are already working on their own vast electricity storage solution in Australia, the Scottish government is currently trialling a project called Batwind. This 1Mwh battery system is being developed by Norwegian energy company Statoil and will store excess energy produced by Hywind - The world’s first floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland.

With the first Ashes Test between Australia and England just over two weeks away, Starc finished the match for NSW with bowling figures of 4-56 and 3-41 next to his name following Western Australia's two innings.

And if that isn't enough to get the likes of England's batting stars in Alastair Cook and Joe Root just a little bit nervous, they're probably not watching closely enough.

Starc is easily Australia's best pace bowler at the moment and with a Test series as important as the Ashes on the very-near horizon, his impressive bowling form is sure to be seen as a saving grace of sorts for a national cricket team that needs nothing more right now than results on the pitch.

GBS is a bacteria that occurs naturally in the lower vaginal tract and is carried by about 150,000 pregnant women each year in the UK. Most will suffer no ill effects, but in some cases they will pass the bacteria on to their baby during labour. Most babies exposed to GBS will be unaffected, but in around one in every 2,000 cases they can become infected.

A maternal vaccine could prevent 231,000 infant and maternal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) cases a year, the first global study of the bacteria has found.

The study led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) estimates that one in five pregnant women around the world carry GBS, and that out of 410,000 GBS cases every year, there will be at least 147,000 stillbirths and infant deaths globally.

Although several vaccines to prevent this cause of maternal and infant ill health and death are in development, none are currently available.

This is despite the disease accounting for more than the combined neonatal deaths from tetanus, pertussis, and respiratory syncytial virus, for which maternal vaccines are already in use, or further advanced in development, the report’s authors state.

The analysis - funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases - shows for the first time that a GBS vaccine which was 80% effective and reached 90% of women, could potentially prevent 231,000 infant and maternal GBS cases.

Global Statistics An average of 18% of women worldwide carry GBS bacteria. This is equivalent to 21.7million women in 195 countries The top five countries are: India 2,466,500

China 1,934,900

Nigeria 1,060,000

USA 942,800

Indonesia 799,100

It is possible to screen all pregnant women for GBS, so those carrying it can be given antibiotics, but this is “not recommended” by the UK’s National Screening Committee (NSC), unless women are considered to be at risk - such as having previously given birth to a baby with the infection or going into labour prematurely.

Dan and Birgitta Hobster’s daughter Natalie was just seven days old when she succumbed to meningitis caused by GBS in London last month.

Dan told HuffPost UK: “My wife is American and we were very keen to have a birth at the Portland [private hospital], but we were told it’s not the done thing because if there’s ever an emergency you need to be transferred to an NHS hospital straight away. So we didn’t do that.

“But basically, if she was born in America or frankly if she was born in any developed country anywhere else in the world, or in the Portland, this test would have occurred, they would have given her antibiotics and they would have caught it.

“We had never heard of it. The NHS needs to inform pregnant women of this risk.”

UK Statistics In 2015, 173,000 (one in four) pregnant women were estimated to be at risk from GBS. There were 856 cases of invasive GBS in infants under the age of three months over a 13 month period in the UK and Republic of Ireland from 2014 -2015. BPSU report states case fatality rate was 6.2% in babies aged 0-90 days - early onset (0-6 days) case fatality rate was 5.2% and late onset (7-90 days) was 7.7%.

Dan added: “When Natalie died we went away to Portugal and they said ‘we’ve never had this incident because we always do this test.’

“It’s tremendously arrogant for the UK to be like ‘we know better than all of the medical consensus of the rest of the world.’”","Maternal Vaccine Could Prevent 231,000 GBS Cases In Babies And Pregnant Women A Year",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maternal-vaccine-could-prevent-231000-gbs-cases-a-year_uk_59fc8aa4e4b0415a420b51d5?utm_hp_ref=uk-homepage

Amid shouts of “resign!” and “shame!”, the Foreign Secretary also came under heavy attack from Tory MPs such as Anna Soubry after he refused to apologise properly for his remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson admitted “I could have been clearer” when he claimed last week that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran - a line which was seized on by the Tehran authorities as proof that she was ‘spreading propaganda’ against the regime. But he sparked anger after he refused repeated requests to apologise for his comments. Eventually, he said he was ‘sorry’- but only ‘if’ his words had been taken out of context. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer the Thomson-Reuters foundation had insisted the Foreign Secretary should correct his remarks, amid claims that Iranian judges want to double her possible sentence for alleged spying from five years to 10 years. She was arrested last year after a family holiday to see relatives. Her three-year-old daughter has been placed with grandparents while her mother has been locked in jail, often in solitary confinement. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry laid into Johnson, declaring Theresa May didn’t have the “strength or authority” to sack him, but he should do the decent thing and resign.

Thornberry said that he should say sorry for “the distress and anguish that his foolish words have caused” to Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family. “How many more times does this need to happen? How many more times does the Foreign Secretary have to insult our international partners, damage our diplomatic relations, and now imperil the interests of British nationals abroad? “What will it take before the Prime Minister will say ‘Enough is Enough’? “But if the truth is that she can’t, because she doesn’t have the strength or authority to sack him, how about the Foreign Secretary himself showing a bit of personal responsibility, and admitting that a job like this, where your words hold gravity and your actions have consequences, is simply not the job for him.”

Empics Entertainment Yvette Cooper.

Cooper was just as withering, declaring “the lives and the safety of British citizens across the globe depends on having a Foreign Secretary who does not bluster and is not too careless or too lazy to consider his words”. “The Foreign Secretary cannot be trusted to do this job. And he should resign.” Johnson said that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe’s husband Richard had sent him a note welcoming his clarification. The Foreign Secretary said that he also intended to take a trip to Iran personally to try to secure her release. And he hit back at Thornberry, insisting that the Iranian foreign minister had assured him his remarks had had no bearing on the sentencing process. “She deflects blame and accountability for those holding that mother in jail - and that is the Iranian regime,” Johnson said. Eventually, after his 40-minute grilling, Johnson expressed his regrets for his words, although only with a caveat that they had been misinterpreted. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, whose Oxford constituency includes family members of the jailed mother, said: “The fact is the family have been worried sick, by his irresponsible comments. “On a human level is the Foreign Secretary at all sorry for the rollercoaster of emotions he has caused Nazanin and her family this week and could he at least apologise to them today?”

Johnson replied: “Of course I’m sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of course I am..” But he faced a fresh backlash for qualifying his apology with the word ‘if’.

REUTERS/Philimon BulawayoFanciful financial systemBut it's the third strategy that the government has pursued that is really fuelling a fanciful financial system.
Zimbabwe's financial system is living on borrowed time and borrowed money.","Zimbabwe's financial system increasingly resembles a house of cards. Were one card to give way -- for instance, if South Africa's power utility, Eskom, were to have the temerity to suggest that Zimbabwe actually pays for the electricity that it's supplying the country -- the entire edifice would collapse.

To put it another way, the government is bust. It is again printing money to cover its spiralling costs, and inflation is rising. And given that there's an election looming in 2018, Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU-PF doesn't want to cut back. Far from it, it wants to carry on spending, as fast as it can.

The rot goes back to the early 2000s. ZANU-PF profligacy had been fuelled by a continuous cycle of simply printing more money, and resultant runaway inflation. Mega-inflation meant that ordinary people lost their pensions and whatever savings they had, as the Zimbabwe dollar lost its value and people resorted to barter or the use of other currencies. Ultimately, the government faced no choice but to accept reality. In 2008 it scrapped the Zimbabwean dollar in favour of a basket of other currencies, although within a short time, this in effect meant the reign of the US dollar.

Dollarisation allowed for the pursuit of more rational policies by the coalition Government of National Unity that followed the disputed 2008 election. However, its control of the electoral machinery ensured that ZANU-PF won a resounding victory in the 2013 election. Within a short space of time, it returned to its familiar policy mix of profligacy, corruption and populist economics.

Yet ZANU-PF faced major problems. Above all, dollarisation meant that the cost of Zimbabwe's exports on international markets was high. Worse, the dramatic collapse of agricultural production since the early 2000s (following the appropriation of white farms) alongside the decimation of the country's manufacturing industries meant that there was relatively little to export anyway. Tobacco production has recovered a little, but the quality is less than it used to be, so returns are relatively less.

Meanwhile, government insistence that mines should be 51 percent Zimbabwean-owned has done nothing to entice inward investment or boost exports. In short, the capacity of the economy to earn US dollars by selling goods externally has fallen dramatically, and the supply of money circulating within the country has dried up. Unemployment stands at around 90 percent.

Many Zimbabweans spend their bank balances on consumer goods as quickly as possible rather than attempting to ""save"".

President Robert Mugabe's latest response has been to replace finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who had been warning of the structure's fragility in ever more urgent tones. The new finance minister is Ignatius Chombo, a party loyalist, who will not brook any talk of need for structural reform.

The bond notes

Faced with a looming crisis, the ZANU-PF government has resorted to three key strategies.

One has been the Zimbabwean Reserve Bank's issue of bond notes (of different denominations). Officially, they're designed to swell the amount of money in circulation within the country. The problem is that, apart from having no value outside the country, nobody trusts them, as they have been issued by a ZANU-PF government, and it was this government that presided over the hyperinflation.

ZANU-PF's announcement that it was issuing bond notes was met with a run on the banks, as depositors sought to withdraw dollars as fast as they could. Their assumption was that this was a government ploy to reintroduce the Zimbabwean dollar. The Reserve Bank responded by limiting the number of dollars individuals could withdraw.

People are reluctant to use the notes. But they're still sometimes forced to accept them because of the sheer shortage of ""real"" money. As a result, when they can, they rush off to the local bus station where they can sell them for dollars to currency traders -- albeit illegally.

The second strategy has been the rapid expansion of country's ability to manage electronic transactions. Its aim has been to expand the amount of money in circulation without using up ""real"" dollars.

Accordingly, government employees are now largely paid electronically. Similarly, government employees (and everyone else) now pay nearly all their bills within the country electronically. And Zimbabweans are rarely able to convert the notional sums of dollars they hold in the bank into real cash -- unless they make use of the currency traders in illegal transactions.

Meanwhile, with the rate of inflation continuing to rise combined with the widespread lack of faith in the banks, many Zimbabweans spend their bank balances on consumer goods as quickly as possible rather than attempting to ""save"". After all, if times get hard, you won't be able to get rid of your bond notes, but you may be able to sell your fridge.

Fanciful financial system

But it's the third strategy that the government has pursued that is really fuelling a fanciful financial system. Since 2013, government expenditure has steadily increased year by year, despite the country earning very little internationally. The ZANU-PF government may have hoped to fund this by its old trick of literally printing money, that is, by expanding the supply of bond notes.

But such was the negative popular sentiment that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe seems to have restricted their issue. Supposedly the issue of bond notes is backed by a USD$200 loan by the African Export-Import Bank, but no-one really knows how many have been issued because the central bank provides no information.

What the government has done instead is to fund its rising costs by issuing treasury bills (whereby it touts for loans on the capital market against promises of later redemption). No-one in their right mind would want to buy them, but Zimbabwe's banks today have little option. As inward investment into the country has dried up to a trickle, there is little else for them to spend their money on, and the interest rates that the government promises to pay are, at face value, attractively high.

The coalition government of national unity recorded budget surpluses for three of the four full years in which the opposition controlled the treasury. For its part, the ZANU-PF government recorded deficits of USD$186-million and USD$125-million in 2014 and 2015. Recently, the then finance minister Chinamasa projected a deficit of USD$1.41-billion for 2017. As of June 30, 2017, there was USD$2.5-billion worth of treasury bills on the issue.

In other words, the spending will continue. Zimbabwe's financial system is living on borrowed time and borrowed money. It will again end in financial ruin, as it did in 2008. But all ZANU-PF cares about is ensuring that it wins the next election and allowing its political elite to ""eat"".

Grünen-Chef Özdemir gab eine vormals ausgerufene Koalitionsbedingung auf

Die Grünen bestehen nicht mehr auf dem Ende des Verbrennungsmotors bis 2030

Es war ein kleiner Kreis, den Kanzlerin Angela Merkel am Montagabend zu sich ins Kanzleramt geladen hatte. Der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer, das Grünen-Spitzenduo Katrin Göring-Eckardt und Cem Özdemir sowie FDP-Chef Christian Lindner und FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki kamen zusammen, um die Schwerpunkte der weiteren Sondierunsgespräche festzulegen.

""Am Donnerstag, dem 16. November, wollen wir fertig sein mit allem. Und da steht noch viel Arbeit an"", erklärte Merkel bei Facebook am Tag des Chef-Treffens.

► Bei einem zentralen Thema könnte ein Großteil der Arbeit derweil bereits getan sein. Denn in der Frage um die Zukunft der Automobilindustrie gibt es Annäherungen.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir das nicht durchsetzen können""

Die Grünen kommen den Jamaika-Unterhändlern von Union und FDP im Tauziehen um die Klimapolitik in einen wichtigen Punkt entgegen. Sie beharren nicht länger darauf, bei einer Koalitionsvereinbarung das Ende des Verbrennungsmotors im Jahr 2030 festzuschreiben.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können"", sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"". Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Noch im August hatte Özdemir das Aus des Verbrenners zur Koalitionsbedingung ausgerufen.

► Probleme sieht Özdemir indes weiter beim Thema Asyl: ""Für eine bessere Integration müssen wir die Familienzusammenführung wieder ermöglichen"", sagte der Grünen-Chef in der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

Hofreiter weiß, dass Kompromisse nötig sind

Der schleswig-holsteinische Ministerpräsident Daniel Günther (CDU) deutete beim Thema Familiennachzug zuletzt Kompromissbereitschaft an. Dagegen machte CSU-Vize Christian Schmidt in der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"" klar, dass seine Partei in dieser Frage nicht gesprächsbereit sei.

► Özdemirs Parteikollege Anton Hofreiter hatte am Montag nach einer Fraktionssitzung ebenfalls angedeutet, zu Zugeständnissen auf mehreren Gebieten bereit zu sein.

Den Grünen sei bewusst, dass die FDP ein Ergebnis beim Thema Steuererleichterungen brauche. Die Union brauche etwas ""in Richtung Planbarkeit, Steuerbarkeit und Ordnung der Flüchtlingsfrage"".

Die Grünen erwarteten nun auch Kompromisse in Richtung Humanität, legale Fluchtwege, bei der sozialen Gerechtigkeit – und beim Klima.

Dass es ausgerechnet beim grünen Herz-Thema nicht die Brechstange sein muss, wie Özdemir jetzt andeutete, macht Hoffnung, dass es mit der Koalition tatsächlich klappt. Vielleicht sogar noch in diesem Jahr.

Trump sagte: ""Die Ära der strategischen Geduld"" sei zu Ende

Donald Trump hat seine Position bezüglich Nordkorea bekräftigt. Die Ära strategischer Geduld sei vorbei, sagte der US-Präsident.

""Wenn die Leute sagen, meine Rhetorik sei zu stark, sollten wir uns ansehen, wohin wir mit schwacher Rhetorik in den vergangenen 25 Jahren gekommen sind"", sagte Trump am Montag in Tokio bei einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Japans Premier Shinzo Abe.

Maximaler Druck auf Pjöngjang

Der japanische Regierungschef beteuerte ebenfalls, dass Japan und die USA im Konflikt um Nordkoreas Atom- und Raketenprogramm den Druck auf Pjöngjang erhöhen wollten. Dies sei nicht die Zeit für Dialog mit Nordkorea.

""Dialog um des Dialoges willen mache keinen Sinn"", sagte Abe. ""Wir wollen durch alle möglichen Mittel den Druck auf Nordkorea bis zum Maximalen erhöhen.""

Konkret kündigte Abe an, die Sanktionen auszuweiten: Die Vermögenswerte von 35 nordkoreanischen Gruppierungen und Einzelpersonen sollen eingefroren werden. Mit dieser Strategie wollen die Verbündeten den andauernden Nukleartests des nordkoreanischen Regimes Einhalt gebieten.

Trump verteidigt Rückzug aus Handelsabkommen TPP

Trump verteidigte in Japan auch den Rückzug der USA aus dem transpazifischen Handelsabkommen TPP. Bei einem Treffen mit Geschäftsleuten sagte Trump am Montagmorgen (Ortszeit) in Tokio: ""Wir werden mehr Handel haben als im Rahmen von TPP, und die Situation wird viel weniger komplex sein."" TPP sei nicht die richtige Idee gewesen.

TPP sollte rund um den Pazifik die größte Freihandelszone der Welt schaffen. Der Vertrag war im Februar 2016 unterzeichnet worden, aber noch nicht in Kraft getreten. Die elf Handelspartner repräsentieren 800 Millionen Menschen und 40 Prozent der Weltwirtschaft. Sie wollen nach dem Rückzug der USA großenteils ohne Amerika weiter vorangehen.

""Der Handel mit Japan ist nicht frei und er ist nicht gegenseitig, aber er wird es bald sein"", sagte Trump. Er habe keinen Zweifel, dass dies fair geschehen werde. Es werde eine Zeit dauern, aber dann werde es Handelsdeals und ""Handelskonzepte"" geben.

Entsprechende Gespräche mit Japan dauerten schon sehr lange. Das finanzielle Ergebnis werde besser für beide Länder sein. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten habe Japan in Handelsfragen mit den USA immer gewonnen, sagte Trump.

But according to a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, not everyone was happy with Golding being cast as Nick Young, the wealthy, Singaporean boyfriend of protagonist Rachel Chu (Constance Wu).

Because Golding has a mixed background — his father is British and his mother is Malaysian — many criticized Hollywood for not choosing an all-Asian actor for the role.

A post shared by Henry Golding (@henrygolding) on Nov 2, 2017 at 4:50am PDT

Golding said he was personally hurt by the backlash and told EW, ""For me, it was almost like being kind of stabbed in the back. I was like, 'Aren't we meant to be in this boat together? Aren't we meant to strive together for something bigger than these boundaries that we're putting on ourselves instead of bullying each other?'""

""People were like, 'This guy's half-Asian, he's half-white, he's not even full Asian,' and it comes to, like, how Asian do you have to be to be considered Asian?"" he said.

Although Golding doesn't need to defend his casting (after all, the film did come through on its promise to have an all-Asian cast), he went on to note that not only was he born in Asia (specifically, Sarawak, Malaysia), he's also spent nearly 17 years of his life there.

""I've lived cultures that are synonymous with Asian culture, but it's still not Asian enough for some people,"" he continued. ""Where are the boundaries? Where are the lines drawn for saying that you cannot play this character because you're not fully Asian?""

This isn't the first time people have been upset about Hollywood casting the ""wrong"" Asian actor for a role. For instance, Mass Appeal noted that some people were upset that Katie Chang, who is one-quarter Korean, was cast as a full-Asian character in ""The Bling Ring"" in 2013. And back in 2005, Hollywood received backlash for casting Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang in the role of Sayuri, a Japanese character in the film ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""

""Nobody's ever happy,"" Golding concluded in his interview. ""There's no ideal situation... It's really about being open to not making criticisms when it comes to Asians on Asians.""

A post shared by Entertainment Weekly (@entertainmentweekly) on Nov 2, 2017 at 10:16am PDT

Considering there have been few all-Asian Hollywood films since 1993's ""The Joy Luck Club,"" audiences should appreciate the effort the industry is making to move forward and be better when it comes to representation, and not attack an Asian actor for finally landing a lead role.

Luckily, ""Crazy Rich Asians"" director Jon M. Chu does not regret the film's casting choices.

Johnson sparked mass outrage by telling the House of Commons imprisoned Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in the country “teaching people journalism” - a claim charities fear could see authorities double her five-year sentence in Evin for allegedly attempting to topple the government.

Dorothy Parvaz Former Evin prison detainee Dorothy Parvaz says Boris Johnson's comments could be 'potentially devastating' to Zaghari-Ratcliffe

Last weekend, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing at which Johnson’s remarks were cited as proof that she had been engaged in “propaganda against the regime”. Meanwhile, the mother-of-one’s family maintain she was simply on holiday in the country to show her infant daughter Gabriella to her grandparents. “You’re so incredibly vulnerable in there - you can’t control what people are saying on the outside or how that might affect you,” Parvaz said. “The fact is, if she hears this is happening, it will be devastating. If one thing you have said is found to be what they consider to be a lie or inconsistent, everything you say is a lie.”

Chris J Ratcliffe via Getty Images Zaghari-Ratcliffe has already been sentenced to five years in prison for 'propaganda against the regime'

According to Parvaz, detainees face daily cross-examinations, with interrogators constantly changing conditions in an attempt to trip prisoners up and get them to admit to their alleged crimes. “You have to wage a big psychological battle everyday to try and keep your mind straight, to get through interrogation, to convince the people questioning you that you’re not what they’re accusing you of being,” she said. “You have no interaction with anybody else. If you happen to pass somebody in the courtyard, you’re absolutely not allowed to say a word.” Before she was released from the prison after two and a half weeks without charge, the journalist, who worked for Al Jazeera at the time, was held in solitary confinement and blindfolded almost constantly when allowed out of her cell.

As an example, she said if a bank buys a table for 10, five tickets will go to youth who will sit with the bank executives.

In an interview that ran on HuffPost earlier this year, Rossini spoke about the difficulties in being taken seriously as a woman filmmaker.

""Every time I introduce myself as a filmmaker, I get asked if I am a film student. I think it 's because there are not enough visible role models of female directors.""

""When they think about what a film director looks like, people tend to have a visual in their head of a man with a bit of beard, dressed casually, standing behind a camera.""

Rossini described the difficulties associated in not being taken as seriously as a director due to her gender, having to go the extra mile and being held to a standard male directors often do not face. She also described her dream to mentor younger generations of female filmmakers.

The so-called Paradise Papers may sound familiar -- leaked documents from a law firm that specialises in offshore services reveal how the global elite avoids paying taxes. Even the name has the same ring to it as last year's Panama Papers expose. But the Paradise Papers are different, reflecting the complexity of the global offshore tax system.

Panama is generally considered among tax-haven experts as one of the least reformed corners of the offshore world. International rules regarding tax evasion and avoidance are intended to help national governments to pursue their own offenders, but the Panama Papers revealed that the country was being used primarily by the business and political elites of countries like Russia, China and many more in Latin America and Asia; countries where the governments are closely linked to business and which are less likely to use tools provided by new international rules to pursue offenders. Hence, relatively few Americans or Europeans were caught in the Panama story. And Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the centre of the leak has since been discredited.

The Paradise Papers reveal the goings on of the elites of the offshore world -- this time in the supposedly highly-regulated havens of the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Singapore and the like. All places that received a fairly clean bill of health during the OECD peer-review process only a few years ago. The law firm at the centre of this new leak, Appleby, insists there is ""no evidence of wrongdoing"" in any of the revelations.

Nonetheless, the Paradise Papers will tell us a lot about the activities of business and political elites of well-regulated countries like the U.S. and UK -- implicating big multinationals such as Nike and Apple, and individuals including the British Queen.

1. Tax avoidance is a booming industry.

Clearly, jurisdictions such as the Caymans Islands and Bermuda that levy no income tax, capital gains tax, VAT, sales, wealth or corporate tax, still attract a great deal of businesses. Why, for instance, has the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private portfolio, invested in two offshore funds, in Cayman and Bermuda? After all, the Queen pays tax only voluntarily.

A more charitable interpretation is that any big investor who is seeking to diversify their portfolio would inevitably end up using offshore funds. The papers show that about £10m (U.S. $13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore -- a very small percentage of her wealth. There is nothing illegal about this but the ethics of it have been questioned.

Practically, the entire wealth investment industry -- the industry that invests for the rich and the wealthy of our world -- operates through the offshore world. And the reason why is simple. Each fund or transaction, or aeroplane or yacht, or whatever that one cares to register in the Caymans or Bermuda, is not subject to tax. And it's hidden from public view.

2. Secrecy prevails through trusts.

Despite a spate of new regulations, the Paradise Papers show that anyone who wishes to conceal their affairs from competitors, allies, governments or the public can still do so with great ease. And they can do so through the facilities of a ""trust"", an archaic Anglo-Saxon instrument that serves as a foolproof shield from scrutiny.

We have learned, for instance, that Wilbur Ross, the U.S. secretary of commerce, had commercial links to Vladimir Putin's family, which operated through a system of linked trusts located in various offshore jurisdictions. I do not think that even the Mueller inquiry in the U.S. into the Trump administration's links with Russia could have pierced the veil of secrecy offered by offshore trusts.

But the leaked documents from law firm Appleby reveal that any complex business deals that would involve concealment and subterfuge would work their way through trusts. It is high time we do something about these trusts.

3. Highly complex tools are used.

The Paradise Papers show how complex financial innovations such as the use of derivatives and financial swaps arrangements, can be used for tax avoidance. This is an area of avoidance that is normally not well understood and scantily studied.

New research colleagues and I are conducting, however, has found that cross-currency interest rate swaps are used pervasively in tax minimisation mechanisms. It is difficult to detect and involves a parent and subsidiary companies swapping a loan in one currency to another. This swaps the risks and the interest rate of the original currency for the subsidiary's -- a legitimate risk minimisation instrument. At the same time, this facilitates moving funds offshore to low tax jurisdictions.

4. The law needs to change.

Many professional service firms operate through offshore jurisdictions. They all claim to be highly professional, following not only the letter, but also the spirit of the law.

But if these firms are not directly liable for the activities of their clients, the offshore world will continue to thrive. These firms take advantage of regulatory loopholes to arbitrate between different rules and jurisdictions in order to minimise taxation. The question is for how long such practices are going to be considered legitimate.

The Paradise Papers reveal how little the world really knows about the level of tax avoidance that takes place. UK citizens, for instance, can legally invest in offshore funds and set up companies in those havens. But they must reveal these holdings to the tax man. We do not know whether those named in the papers did, and we do not know whether the tax authorities will do something about those who did not. We only know that a lot is going through offshore. The Paradise Papers show that, despite promises of the opposite, opacity is still pervasive in the offshore world.

Tatsächlich will Präsident Erdogan bis 2021 ein türkisches Auto auf den Markt bringen

""Die Deutschen sind in Panik"", glaubt die türkische Tageszeitung ""Günes"". Der Grund: Die Regierung von Präsident Recep Tayyip Erdogan plant, ein in der Türkei produziertes Auto Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Spätestens 2021 sollen fünf heimische Unternehmen im Verbund das Elektroauto auf den Markt bringen.

Die Erdogan-nahe Zeitung ""Günes"" zeigte in ihrer Sonntagsausgabe Angela Merkel auf der Titelseite. ""Schau, wie wir das machen"", lautete die große Überschrift in schwarzen und roten Lettern. Die deutschen Medien hätten eine ""Schmutzkampagne"" gestartet, aus Angst vor dem neuen Konkurrenten auf dem Automobilmarkt, so der Vorwurf der Zeitung.

Tatsächlich hatten mehrere deutsche Medien in der vergangenen Woche über Erdogans Auto-Projekt berichtet.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Leiter des Center Automotive Research (CAR) der Universität Duisburg-Essen, sagte der ""Welt"", das türkische Projekt sei ""Harakiri"". Es sei schade um das Geld, mindestens eine halbe Milliarde Euro werde ""einfach verbrannt"".

Schlechte Chancen für das Erdo-Car

Das größte Problem an dem Projekt: Im vergangenen Jahr seien in der Türkei lediglich 760.000 Autos verkauft worden. Zum Vergleich: In Deutschland gab es im gleichen Jahr 3,4 Millionen Neuzulassungen. Der heimische Markt alleine bietet somit nur bescheidene Absatzmöglichkeiten.

Bislang gibt es wenige Details über das türkische Auto, dessen Prototyp im Jahr 2019 fertiggestellt werden soll. Offenbar könnte es auf dem Aufbau des Saab 9-3 basieren, den die türkische Regierung im Jahr 2015 von der schwedischen Holdinggesellschaft National Electric Vehicle Sweden erworben hat.

Ob das der deutschen Industrie tatsächlich Sorgen bereitet, bleibt fraglich. Denn keines der fünf türkischen Unternehmen des Konsortiums verfügt über Erfahrungen beim Autobau.

The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately. News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report. Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a “she-ro,” using the hashtag #Her2020.

The woman’s name is Juli Briskman. Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn’t so happy about the photo. They fired her over it.

In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger.

As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima’s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday. By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company’s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook.

“They said, ‘We’re separating from you,‘” said Briskman. “Basically, you cannot have ‘lewd’ or ‘obscene’ things in your social media. So they were calling flipping him off ‘obscene.’”

Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn’t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don’t mention her employer. They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said.

Virginia is an employment-at-will state, meaning employers can fire people anytime and for any reason. But Briskman said what’s been particularly infuriating is that a male colleague kept his job after recently posting lewd comments on his Facebook page that featured Akima LLC as his cover photo. She said this colleague was reprimanded for calling someone “a fucking Libtard asshole” on Facebook, but was allowed to delete the post and keep his job.

“How is that any less ‘obscene’ than me flipping off the president?” she asked. “How is that fair?”

Akima did not respond to requests for comment via email and phone.

Juli Briskman Someone posted this graphic on Juli Briskman's Facebook page after she flipped off the president's motorcade. Briskman was amused.

Asked what she was thinking when she saw Trump’s motorcade roll up next to her, Briskman said it was a gut reaction to flip him off.

“He was passing by and my blood just started to boil,” she said. “I’m thinking, DACA recipients are getting kicked out. He pulled ads for open enrollment in Obamacare. Only one-third of Puerto Rico has power. I’m thinking, he’s at the damn golf course again.”

“I flipped off the motorcade a number of times,” she added.

Briskman, a Democrat, said she plans to look for a new job with an advocacy group that she believes in, like Planned Parenthood or PETA.

Despite getting fired, she said she has no regrets about the attention her public show of displeasure with Trump received. In fact, she said she’s happy to be an image of protest that resonates with many Americans.

“In some ways, I’m doing better than ever,” she said. “I’m angry about where our country is right now. I am appalled. This was an opportunity for me to say something.”

Since most people will come up against issues with their skin in the course of their lives, here are eight skin conditions -- some common, and some less common -- that you should know about, and the symptoms, risk factors and treatments involved in each.

Eczema

One of the most common skin conditions in the world, eczema (also known as dermatitis) is infamous for its itchy symptoms. Dr Adrian Lim, dermatologist and Clinical Senior Lecturer at the University of Sydney said that eczema can impact from as early as the first few months of a baby's life.

Psoriasis

Like eczema, psoriasis can cause great discomfort due to its flaky appearance and ability to spread.

Acne

The skin condition that sends shivers down the spine of every teenager, acne is a disease that can be very debilitating if left untreated.

Vitiligo

A condition which alters the colours in your skin, vitiligo is relatively uncommon. However, dermatologists are at the forefront of innovation in skin treatments and can help with these rarer conditions as well as more common ones.

Alopecia

A common term for hair loss, Dr Brad McKay explained that alopecia has links to other skin conditions, such as eczema.

Rosacea

The medical term for when the skin turns red after you drink a glass of red or feel flush after a spicy meal. Rosacea can strike at any time.

Urticaria

Also known as hives, the condition urticaria can affect anyone, and is extremely uncomfortable.

Athlete's Foot

Commonly known as athlete's foot, the fungal infection tinea pedis occurs, unsurprisingly, when a fungus attacks the feet.

Parlando in termini generali dei salvataggi delle banche italiane, il presidente del Consiglio di Vigilanza della Bce Daniele Nouy ha affermato di non credere che l'esperienza delle ricapitalizzazioni cautelative delle banche viste dopo il Montepaschi suggerisca che sarebbe stato meglio lasciar fallire alcune banche, ma ""le banche devono smettere di negare la realtà. Quando lo fanno siamo in grado di affrontare i problemi"". Per risolvere il problema dell'elevato stock di crediti deteriorati, ""stiamo lavorando nel dialogo di Vigilanza con tutte le banche che hanno livelli di Npl eccessivi. Stanno inviando i loro piani, che noi vagliamo per assicurarci che siano abbastanza ambiziosi, realistici e credibili"" ha detto Nouy. Il presidente della Vigilanza Bce ha spiegato che ""alcune banche hanno compiuto sforzi, altre sono rimaste indietro"" nella gestione e nello smaltimento degli Npl. Ma ha escluso che vi siano rischi sistemici: le debolezze sono concentrate nelle banche di dimensioni piccole e medie. Sono importanti ma ""non hanno dimensioni sistemiche"".

L'Italia è convinta che la Vigilanza Bce stia travalicando il suo ruolo. Secondo il ministro dell'Economia Pier Carlo Padoan le modifiche alle linee guida sui crediti deteriorati proposte dalla Vigilanza della Banca centrale europea costituiscono una ""forzatura"" dal punto di vista legale. Padoan ha spiegato di aver criticato l'addendum proposto dalla vigilanza della Bce anche dal punto di vista della ""sostanza"" durante la riunione dell'Eurogruppo di ieri. ""Riteniamo che sia qualche forzatura legale"". Gli interventi sugli Npl vanno fatti ""in tempi ragionevoli che evitino di generare nuove fragilità"", ha aggiunto, spiegando di essere stato l'unico a prendere la parola sul tema durante l'Eurogruppo, mentre gli altri ministri non si sono espressi. ""Non se si tratta di silenzio-assenso"" da parte dei ministri, certamente ""sono stato l'unico a sottolineare aspetti di metodo e di merito"" che non convincono l'Italia.

Secondo Padoan per affrontare il nodo dei crediti deteriorati in Italia ""l'atteggiamento giusto è quello delle banche che hanno un atteggiamento proattivo nella gestione delle sofferenze, che sono state nei bilanci delle banche per un periodo lungo"". Lo sforzo fatto in questi anni di recessione, ha spiegato il ministro, ""è stato quello non solo di gestire situazioni di crisi, ma di mettere in moto anche condizioni che creino un mercato delle sofferenze, perché si tratta di trovare il prezzo giusto, in modo tale che le perdite e l'ammontare di capitale che va messo a fronte di queste perdite sia ragionevole e sostenibile"". In questo processo, aggiunge Padoan, ""alcune banche hanno fatto prima di altre: non ho in mente nessuna banca specifica, ma il sistema bancario italiano, che deve ritornare a dare pieno contributo alla crescita che stiamo attraversando"", conclude.

Un altro fronte di resistenza sugli Npl è portato avanti da Antonio Tajani, presidente del Parlamento europeo. Domani mattina arriverà la risposta dei servizi legali dell'Europarlamento sui limiti dell'attività normativa della vigilanza della Bce, in merito alla questione Npl, ha annunciato Tajani. ""Vedremo quale sarà la risposta, ma sono convinto che ci sia un limite oltre cui la vigilanza della Bce non può andare"", in quanto ""a mio parere non può svolgere attività normative perché quella legislativa spetta al Parlamento, la burocrazia non prende il posto della politica"", ha detto.

Torna sul tema degli Npl anche Mario Draghi, chiedendo ""sforzi congiunti"" per affrontare e risolvere quello che ""è il problema principale ora"". Il presidente della Bce ha affermato che per risolvere il problema dei crediti deteriorati è necessario ""uno sforzo comune fra Vigilanza bancario, le autorità di regolamentazione e le autorità nazionali"" oltre agli istituti di credito. Le banche con un elevato livello di Npl ""forniscono meno credito a imprese e famiglie"" e che ""tutti conosciamo i danni che alti livelli di crediti deteriorati producono alle banche e alla crescita"".

Molte banche mancano ancora della capacità di assorbire grandi perdite poichè il rapporto fra sofferenze, capitale e accantonamenti resta elevato"" ha rilevato Draghi, dicendo che, affrontare gli Npl ""è una precondizione per gli altri pilastri dell'Unione bancaria"" così come lo è l'esposizione delle banche al debito degli Stati: ""non c'è spazio per autocompiacersi"".

Draghi fa un bilancio dei tre anni di Vigilanza Bce sulle banche osservando che questa ha condotto a un ""approccio più uniforme sulla supervisione che ha condotto a un settore bancario complessivamente più resistente"". Lo sviluppo della supervisione europea - rileva ancora Draghi - non solo ha ridotto il rischio di fallimento delle singole banche, ""ma ha anche, come sperato, avuto qualche successo nel ridurre l'importanza dell'ubicazione dell'istituto nella percezione del rischio bancario, visto che un'unica, rigorosa supervisione è una precondizione essenziale per gli altri pilastri dell'unione bancaria che con maggior decisione vanno a recidere il nesso fra banca e Stato sovrano"". Guardando alle banche maggiori la correlazione fra i credit default swaps bancari e quelli sovrani è ora ""considerevolmente più debole di quanto non fosse al picco della crisi"". Malgrado tali progressi - commenta ancora Draghi - ""non c'è spazio per l'autocompiacimento"".

The release of the so-called ""Paradise Papers"" has spurred federal Conservatives to ask new questions about a White House dinner from nearly 20 months ago.

The release of the so-called ""Paradise Papers"" has spurred federal Conservatives to ask new questions about a White House dinner from nearly 20 months ago.

Conservatives wasted little time Monday highlighting leaked records that link Stephen Bronfman, a wealthy businessman who served as the chief Liberal fundraiser, to offshore tax havens. Bronfman has released a statement saying he never used offshore trusts and never violated Canadian tax laws through the use of offshore havens.

Tory Leader Andrew Scheer elicited some groans when he kicked off question period by drawing attention to the ""Paradise Papers,"" accusing Bronfman of moving millions of dollars to offshore havens ""through a complex web of entities in the U.S., Israel and the Cayman Islands."" Scheer also said there is evidence of ""bogus records"" and invoices.

But in something of a twist, Scheer brought the issue back to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's historic visit to Washington in March 2016 to break bread with then president Barack Obama.

""At the height of a softwood lumber dispute, the prime minister chose to take Stephen Bronfman to a state dinner at the White House, leaving his minister of natural resources behind,"" Scheer said. ""Simple question: what business did Bronfman have at the White House?""

Bronfman, a close family friend of Trudeau's, was part of the 44-member delegation for the visit, which cost taxpayers at least $25,000. The Liberal party later told The Canadian Press Bronfman's expenses weren't covered by taxpayers.

Trudeau responded by sharing condolences for the victims of the shooting on Sunday at a Texas church, and had nothing specific to say about Scheer's question.

Trudeau: Grits committed to fighting tax evasion

""On the other matter, I can assure them that we are fully committed to fighting tax avoidance and tax evasion and will continue to ensure that the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) pursues all infringes upon that for the many years to come,"" Trudeau said.

This isn't the first time Tories have raised a stink about Trudeau's delegation for the White House trip, particularly the decision to exclude Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr.

Former interim Tory leader Rona Ambrose suggested Carr's absence showed Liberals weren't serious about promoting the Keystone XL pipeline project with the Obama administration. She scored laughs at Carr's expense in the House of Commons last year by stating she even scored an invite to the dinner.

Scheer has previously questioned in the Commons why Trudeau included his in-laws in the delegation, but not Carr.

Tory MP Gerard Deltell also pounced on the issue Monday, asking why Bronfman was welcomed to the White House a year-and-a-half ago while Carr had to stay back in Ottawa.

""Can the prime minister give us one reason, just one reason, why he left his natural resources minister in Ottawa but brought his Liberal bagman friend?"" Deltell asked.

Natural Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier ducked the question by saying the government has invested nearly $1 billion in the last two federal budgets to combat tax evasion and avoidance.

Deltell shot back by saying Trudeau's close friendship with Bronfman was ""staining Canada's reputation."" He again asked for ""one good reason"" why he attended the state dinner in Washington.

Revenue minister accuses Tories of 'hypocrisy'

Lebouthillier again trumpeted Liberal efforts to go after tax evaders and accused the Tories of hypocrisy for not prioritizing the issue while in government.

Tory House Leader Candice Bergen took perhaps the sharpest jab at Bronfman, charging that he did not raise money for Trudeau's Liberals out of charity.

""He, as all Liberals do, always wants something in return,"" Bergen said before calling on Liberals to return all the money Bronfman raised.

Et le résultat est ébouriffant, échevelé, surprenant, extrêmement divertissant tout en se révélant investi d'une noble mission que les auteurs assument sans pathos et sans complaisance en donnant la parole à des personnages qui ont vraiment existé et qui projettent par-delà le temps des ombres plus grandes que nature.

Le deuxième prénom de mon second fils est Gabriel, choisi par son parrain féru d'Histoire qui voulait ainsi rendre hommage à Gabriel Dumont, leader de la révolte des Métis dans l'Ouest canadien en 1880. Je savais qu'il avait dirigé une rébellion aux côtés de Louis Riel, mais j'ignorais qu'il était allé chercher ce dernier au Montana et l'avait convaincu de revenir combattre après un premier et cuisant échec. J'ignorais aussi qu'après quelques victoires bien senties contre les troupes envoyées par le gouvernement de John A. MacDonald et l'écrasement final de la rébellion, Dumont a rejoint le Wild West Show de Buffalo Bill aux États-Unis où ses talents de cavalier et de tireur d'élite lui ont permis de gagner sa vie. La pièce raconte tout cela et bien d'autres choses encore, donnant la parole à des femmes remarquables comme Montana Madeleine et soulignant le mysticisme de Louis Riel. Le spectacle est aussi truffé d'anachronismes aussi drôles que pertinents avec entre autres un Alexis Martin en René Lecavalier et un Jean-Marc Dalpé en (très) coloré Don Cherry commentant l'action. Un clin d'œil peut-être à un autre Gabriel Dumont, né en 1990, qui a évolué brièvement pour le Canadien de Montréal...

Le résultat est plein de vie, bondissant, rempli de surprises, de couleur, d'humour et d'un parti-pris qu'on ne peut qu'endosser.

Il y a beaucoup de comédiens, tous très bons, qui semblent être multitude sur la scène. Mani Soleymanlou dirige tout cela avec un considérable brin de folie, mais aussi beaucoup de précision et de fluidité. La scénographie est souple et efficace: quelques coffres aux multiples usages, un écran sur lequel on projette films d'époque ou surtitres traduisant les tirades en différentes langues autochtones. Le résultat est plein de vie, bondissant, rempli de surprises, de couleur, d'humour et d'un parti-pris qu'on ne peut qu'endosser.

Beaucoup d'auteurs se partagent le crédit de ce texte, mais on n'a jamais l'impression qu'il y avait plus de chefs que d'indiens... Le ton est unifié, les moments drôles s'intègrent aux tableaux plus dramatiques, le dosage est parfait entre le sérieux et le comique, l'ironie et la tragédie.

Si le Manitoba Act de 1870, qui donnait 1,4 million d'acres de terres aux Métis avait été respecté, le cours de l'Histoire aurait été singulièrement modifié. Les Amérindiens et les Métis auraient eu une province à eux et on peut présumer que leur culture se serait épanouie de même que leurs droits auraient été respectés. Mais la duplicité des gouvernements a saboté ce projet auquel ont rêvé Riel et Dumont. Le tour de force de ce spectacle c'est de nous apprendre des tas de choses en enrobant cette pédagogie dans un emballage très, très attrayant et en faisant de cette histoire une épopée mythique. On rit beaucoup lors de ce Wild West Show, mais on est aussi révolté et ému devant la souffrance et l'injustice dont ont souffert (et souffrent encore) ces peuples à qui on a tout refusé et qu'on a ensevelis dans un sombre oubli. Et, surtout, Le Wild West Show nous fait découvrir des destins hors du commun, de ces destins qui, un siècle et demi plus tard, se révèlent toujours aussi fracassants parce que ces hommes et ces femmes n'ont pas eu peur d'aller là où leurs pas les ont menés. Allez voir ça, c'est formidable.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some stored carbs play a role in providing energy between meals.
Molecules of glycogen contain water and therefore the more glycogen you store the more water you retain in the process.""
When it comes to carbs and retaining water, do healthy complex carbs (like whole grains, fruits and vegetables) result in less retention compared to simple, processed carbs (like chips, pizza and doughnuts)?
Speaking of sodium: as well as carbs, salt can make you retain water and look 'puffy', Spendlove and Lowe explained.","We can all agree that carbs are the best. Pizza, doughnuts, burgers, pasta -- whatever form it takes, carbs are comforting, satisfying and plain delicious.

Be that as it may, eating too many carbs can be a problem (sad, we know). One effect people report when overdoing the carbs is looking 'puffy' or like they're retaining water.

To find out if carb-related water retention is a thing, HuffPost Australia spoke to two health experts.

Do carbs make you retain water?

""Carbohydrate intake can lead to water retention,"" Jessica Spendlove, accredited practising dietitian and performance dietitian, told HuffPost Australia.

This is all because of the way carbs are stored in our bodies. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some stored carbs play a role in providing energy between meals.

""Some of the carbs you consume are stored in the form of glycogen. For every one gram of carbohydrate stored in the body (as glycogen) there is approximately 2-3 grams of water retained.

""Glycogen is stored in your liver and muscles where it can quickly turn into glucose to provide energy when you need it. Molecules of glycogen contain water and therefore the more glycogen you store the more water you retain in the process.""

This bodily process explains why when people go on diets or restrict carbohydrate intake, they will see initial weight loss as ""water weight is lost with the loss of muscle glycogen"", nutritionist Steph Lowe of The Natural Nutritionist explained.

""This is why when someone commences a low-carbohydrate diet they appear to lose weight quickly according to the scales, as they deplete their glycogen stores which also results in them losing fluid as well. This is not actual weight loss and will rebound in a few days or weeks at most,"" Spendlove added.

Does the type of carb have a different effect on water retention?

When it comes to carbs and retaining water, do healthy complex carbs (like whole grains, fruits and vegetables) result in less retention compared to simple, processed carbs (like chips, pizza and doughnuts)?

""In terms of water retention, not necessarily, as it is more about the storage of carbohydrate in the body (as glycogen) which impacts how much water is retained,"" Spendlove said.

""In saying that, there is more of a chance a processed carbohydrate may have higher sodium amounts as well, which could enhance the water retained.""

Salty, carby snacks like chips can be a double whammy for water retention.

Does salt make you retain water?

Speaking of sodium: as well as carbs, salt can make you retain water and look 'puffy', Spendlove and Lowe explained.

""Sodium intake can definitely play a role in water retention,"" Spendlove said.

""Sodium helps regulate the levels of water in your body. As a result, the total amount of sodium (salt) you consume has an impact on whether you retain or eliminate water. As you eat more salt, your body holds onto more water. If you have too much sodium in your system, your body retains water.""

If you want to know if you are consuming too much sodium or carbohydrate check in with a GP or accredited dietitian or nutritionist.

Is water retention a sign you're consuming too many carbs?

According to Spendlove and Lowe, water retention may be indicative of an excessive carbohydrate intake but there are also other causes of fluid retention, including underlying medical conditions, which is why it's important to check in with your GP.

""There are many other potential explanations for water retention, including too little protein, hormonal imbalance and thyroid dysfunction,"" Lowe said.

Many medications, menstruation and hot weather can also cause water retention. Another explanation for feeling heavier is weight gain.

""If we eat anything in excess and are in an energy surplus (eating more than what we are burning) it will be stored as fat and we will gain weight,"" Spendlove said. ""If you eat excess carbohydrates and you are in energy surplus you will store the excess as fat.""

""Excess carbohydrates spike the fat storage hormone insulin, which leads to poor blood sugar control, imbalanced mood, cravings, 3.30-itis and weight gain,"" Lowe added.

Carbs aren't 'bad', but it's important to focus on quantity and quality.

To find out how many carbohydrates you should be eating per day, Lowe recommends going by a calculation of 15-20 percent of your total daily energy (calorie) intake if you lead a sedentary lifestyle. Or you can base the amount off your body weight.

""I tend to suggest no more than two grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight [per day], Spendlove said.

""If you are sedentary, I suggest making sure the carbohydrate part of your meal is the smallest (the biggest should be the salad and non-starchy vegetable component).""

A general rule to aim for would be ¼ of your plate protein, less than ¼ of your plate carbohydrate and at least ½ of your plate salad and non-starchy vegetables.

""It is important everyone, but particularly a sedentary person, to choose the best quality, slow-release types of carbohydrates in small quantities such as quinoa, sweet potato, brown rice and oats.""",Do Carbs Make You Retain Water?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/05/do-carbs-make-you-retain-water_a_23265193/

In her typically down-to-Earth style Sophie Monk didn't hold back with HuffPost Australia's Editor-at-Large Lisa Wilkinson during their Facebook Live chat on Monday.

Wilkinson grilled her on all the rumours and headlines around her new relationship with publican Stu Laundy who she met through the most recent season of 'The Bachelorette'.

""It was a massive risk,"" Monk said, worrying the whole experience would backfire on her, ""I thought Australia was going to hate me"".

""I'm known as being funny and silly, no one wants to see a serious side of someone and I'm emotional in it and a lot of the guys I was like, 'Oh my god I'd never date them'... it was pretty stressful.

""It's so weird, but my whole life's not normal anyway. I've never really had normality since I was a teenager. I've never had a normal life, I've never had a normal job.""

Not shying away from any questions Monk talked at length about her relationship with Laundy, which has made several -- not always entirely correct -- headlines. From a shock pregnancy to breaking up, Monk and Laundy have been filling up the tabloids as fans of the show scrutinised even the tiniest hints of body language.

""At the end of the day you just need someone that makes you laugh and happy,"" Monk said, ""I know some of the other guys might have been more on paper good for me but chemistry is everything.

""I really wanted to think with my head but I just couldn't help it, you've got to follow your heart.""

Monk's star is on the climb but she revealed it took time to get to where she is after returning from Los Angeles three years ago she lost everything.

""A friend of mine ripped me off, but ignorance -- law is not fair -- so I've built everything back up now on my own so I'm more grateful for it. I think you have to lose it all, have that down to enjoy the high as well.""

Taking viewer questions, Monk admitted she was ready to take a break from the world of reality TV.

""I think I'm done with [reality shows]... I'll do my own travel show, reality style. I really loved the experience but I think I'm done now.""

Monk said her next venture would hopefully be producing her own travel show with her best friend where they'd break down the realities of social media.

""It's ridiculous being famous and social media nowadays. We all fake it. I order a bottle of Veuve (Cliquot), take a photo and take it back and get a cheaper bottle just to look good for social media,"" Monk told Wilkinson.

Genau das hat nun aber Sängerin Sia (41) mit einem genialen Schachzug gemacht und wird von ihren Anhängern dafür zurecht gefeiert.

Auf Twitter postete sie ein Paparazzi-Bild einer nackten Frau von hinten, die offenbar die Sängerin selbst sein soll. Dazu schrieb sie: ""Anscheinend versucht jemand, Nacktfotos von mir an meine Fans zu verkaufen. Spart euer Geld, hier ist es umsonst. Jeder Tag ist Weihnachten!"" Die Geste ihrer ""Heldin"", wie die Fans sie für diesen mutigen Schritt im Kommentarbereich nennen, kommt bestens an. Fast 300.000 ""Gefällt mir""-Angaben erntete der verwackelte Schnappschuss, 93.000 Menschen teilten den Popo-Post der gebürtigen Australierin.

So waren ab 2015 zwei Apple-Sitze auf der Insel Jersey registriert

Dort liegt der Steuersatz für Unternehmen bei null Prozent

Die Paradise Papers zeigen Apples neuen Steuertrick. Der US-Konzern wollte sich im Frühjahr 2014 zusichern lassen, auf der Steueroase Jersey keinerlei Steuern zahlen zu müssen.

""Ist es möglich, eine offizielle Bestätigung der Steuerbefreiung zu bekommen, und kostet das etwas?"", ließ Apple über eine amerikanische Anwaltskanzlei bei dem Offshore-Dienstleister Appleby nachfragen, bevor Tochterfirmen Geschäftssitze auf die Insel verlagerten.

Irland-Gesellschaften von Apple nutzten eine Lücke im irischen Steuerrecht. Diese ermöglichte es ihnen, in keinem Land der Welt Steuern zahlen zu müssen. Die Lücke wurde 2015 auf internationalen Druck hin geschlossen.

Danach führte Appleby laut den Dokumenten zwei irische Apple-Firmen mit Geschäftssitz auf der Ärmelkanal-Insel Jersey, zeigen die Paradise Papers, die der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" zugespielt wurden. Auf Jersey liegt der Steuersatz für Unternehmen bei null Prozent. Auf diese Weise drückte der Konzern seine Steuerquote bei Gewinnen außerhalb der USA weiter auf nur drei bis sieben Prozent.

Apple betonte, sich an alle Gesetze zu halten. ""Wir sind der größte Steuerzahler der Welt"", sagte ein Sprecher.

Auch Nike arbeitet mit Offshore-Firmen

Auch der Sportartikelkonzern Nike nutzt ein Steuerschlupfloch. Der Sportartikelhersteller gründete zuerst zahlreiche Offshore-Firmen auf den Bermudas, um dort die Lizenzrechte der Firma zu halten - etwa für das Firmenlogo, den weltberühmten ""Swoosh"".

An diese Briefkastenfirmen mussten Nike-Niederlassungen Hunderte Millionen Euro bezahlen, um die Markenrechte nutzen zu dürfen.

Durch die hohen Lizenzzahlungen wurden die weltweiten Gewinne drastisch gedrückt und damit die Steuerlast. Nike verlagerte laut den Paradise Papers 2014 diese Praxis in die europäische Steueroase Niederlande - und drückte seine globale Steuerrate damit von 35 Prozent um das Jahr 2002 auf nur mehr rund 13 Prozent. So konnte Nike in Steueroasen Gewinne in Höhe von mehr als zwölf Milliarden Dollar anhäufen, die kaum besteuert wurden.

Das beschäftigt die Promi-Mütter

Die Fragen, die die einzelnen Promi-Mütter beschäftigen, sind so verschieden wie die Frauen selbst. Welcher Erziehungsstil ist der richtige? Diese Frage stand bei Werbeikone Verona Pooth im Mittelpunkt. Während viele Zuschauer sie sonst nur perfekt gestylt kennen, zeigt sie sich bei ""6 Mütter"" ungeschminkt und spricht über ihre Erziehungsansprüche: Wie viel muss man als Mutter machen, wo kann man locker lassen, wie sehr hat man alles im Griff?

Sängerin Patricia Kelly beschäftigen hingegen zwei andere große Themen bei ""6 Mütter"": ihr eigenes Comeback mit der Kelly Family sowie Ignatius, einer ihrer Söhne, der das ""Kelly""-Gen geerbt hat und nun auch ins Rampenlicht will. Und wenn der Nachwuchs schon Karriere macht? Bei der alleinerziehenden Schauspielerin und Unternehmerin Anne-Sophie Briest dreht sich in ihrem Alltag alles um Tochter Faye, die YouTube-Star und Schauspielerin ist. Wie viel Leistung muss der Nachwuchs erbringen? Und wie lässt sich alles mit der Schule in Einklang bringen?

The annual Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum, published Thursday, makes for more bleak reading to accompany the sexual abuse and harassment scandals plaguing numerous industries and governments.

The survey of 144 countries finds that as a whole, gender equality has worsened globally for the first time since WEF first produced its index in 2006. While income levels are rising, women are not sharing equally in the benefits, even in the most affluent countries.

“There seems to be a slowdown in momentum when it comes to proactive measures being taken to address gender gaps, particularly in the workplace,” said Vesselina Stefanova Ratcheva, an economist at WEF.

The index measures how opportunities and participation differ for men and women across four key areas: health, education, economy and politics. The most challenging gaps are in economy and politics, according to the report.

The U.S. saw its ranking drop from 45th last year to 49th this year, mostly due to a lack of women in U.S. politics. Men hold nearly 81 percent of the seats in Congress and make up the majority of mayors and governors.

The top 10 countries for gender equality are predominantly European, with four northern European nations in the top five. Iceland is in the top position for the ninth year in a row, followed by Norway and Finland.

World Economic Forum

But it’s not just European countries that scored highly; the top 10 also included Rwanda and Nicaragua. These economies are “putting in place more gender-equal opportunities regardless of their level of economic development,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

None of the big powerhouse economies of the G-20 made it into the top 10, “showing that economic power is not necessarily a recipe for better equality between the sexes,” according to WEF.

However, gender equality does appear to promote better economic performance, according to numerous studies. A McKinsey Global Institute analysis estimated that more equality between the sexes would boost the global economy by $28 trillion. For the U.S. in particular, the WEF index cites a study that economic parity could add $1.7 trillion to the country’s GDP.

Despair shouldn’t be the main takeaway from the index, WEF insisted. “It is important to note that while the global picture is bleak in 2017, there have been some clear signs of progress in the past decade,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

The gender gap in education could be closed within the next 13 years, says WEF. And there are some standout countries that have made rapid improvements ― including Canada, which climbed 19 places for women’s progress in politics and wages.

“What is needed is new energy and commitment at the leader level ― in business as well as political leadership ― to put these into effect,” said Stefanova Ratcheva.

CDU-Politiker Meister forderte bei ""Hart aber fair"" Einblicke in das Material, um Steuerbetrug besser aufklären zu können

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Mascolo glaubt nicht, dass das helfen würde

Die Fronten bei ""Hart aber fair"" waren klar: Michael Meister, CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarischer Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, fordert eine Veröffentlichung der Paradise Papers.

Doch Investigativ-Journalist Georg Mascolo, der das Rechercheteam von NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" leitet, lehnt jegliche Zusammenarbeit mit staatlichen Behörden ab. Sein Team hat die Dokumente für deutsche Leser ausgewertet.

Besonders absurd findet Mascolo dabei ein Argument, das CDU-Politiker Meister mantraartig im ARD-Talk von Frank Plasberg wiederholt: Eine Offenlegung der Papiere würde den Finanzbehörden helfen, mögliche neue Konstruktionen zur Steuerumgehung zu finden.

Die Probleme sind völlig offensichtlich

""Man muss gar kein Steuerrechtsseminar hier abhalten"", warf Mascolo in die Runde. Die Dinge, die nicht in Ordnung seien, könne jeder relativ einfach erkennen. Dann zerlegte der renommierte Journalist in drei Sätzen die Argumentation Meisters und anderer Finanzpolitiker:

► ""Wenn ich vor einem Haus stehe, in dem es drei Stockwerke gibt und 700 Firmen registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass dort irgendetwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Wenn auf einer Kleinstinsel 1000 Flugzeuge registriert sind, dann weiß ich, dass das nicht in Ordnung ist.""

► ""Und wenn ein international gut verdienendes Unternehmen seine Steuerlast auf 13 bis 15 Prozent drückt, dann weiß ich, dass etwas nicht in Ordnung ist.""

Mascolo erbost: ""Wir diskutieren über diese Dinge schon viel zu lange.""

Ein Teil des Problems innerhalb der EU sei, dass es nicht nur um Kleinststaaten in der Karibik oder im Ärmelkanal geht. ""Wir reden über Mitgliedsstaaten in der Europäischen Union."" Damit spielt er auf Malta und die Niederlande an, die als Steueroasen in den Paradise Papers auftauchen.

Viele Pläne - ""Aber nichts geschieht""

Mascolo beklagte, dass es kurz nach öffentlichkeitswirksamen Steuerleaks immer wieder Pläne zum Stopfen der Schlupflöcher gegeben habe - doch die seien meistens nach ein oder zwei Jahren versandet.

An CDU-Politiker Meister gerichtet erklärte Mascolo: ""Ich wette, die Finanzbeamten kennen längst alle Konstruktionen. (...) Denn da stecken nicht viele Geheimnisse drin.""

Doch Mascolo sagt: ""Aber nichts geschieht.""

Die Grünen strecken die Hand in Richtung FDP und Union aus. Doch gedankt wird es ihnen nicht.

Unmittelbar nach einem Angebot der Grünen, im Rahmen einer Einigung auf den bislang angestrebten festen Endtermin für Neuzulassungen von Verbrennungsmotoren zu verzichten, gab sich der CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hart in der Sache und besonders rüde im Ton, berichtet die ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"".

Dobrindt sagte der ""SZ"": ""Wenn man Schwachsinnstermine abräumt, dann ist das ja noch kein Kompromiss.""

Seehofer hatte zuvor moderate Töne angeschlagen

Deutlicher kann man das Annäherungsangebot eines Gesprächspartners kaum ausschlagen. Dobrindts aggressive Haltung ist besonders bemerkenswert angesichts der Tatsache, dass sich der CSU-Vorsitzende Horst Seehofer bislang betont anders verhalten hat.

Auch am Dienstagmorgen schlug er moderate Töne an. Er sagte der ""SZ"", der Schritt der Grünen sei ""auf jeden Fall förderlich"". Eine Koalition bestehe immer aus einem Interessenausgleich, entsprechend sei der Start zur zweiten Runde ""sehr ansprechend und verheißungsvoll"".

Nur Stunden zuvor hatte Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir in einem Zeitungsinterview angeboten, den festen Termin 2030 aufzugeben, sollten sich Union, FDP und Grüne in den Grundzügen in die richtige Richtung bewegen.

Grünen rücken von Maximalforderung ab

Der Stuttgarter Zeitung sagte Özdemir: ""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können.""

Statt des konkreten Datums für den Ausstieg verlangt die Umweltpartei nur noch ""ein klares Bekenntnis, dass wir alles dafür tun, um die Fahrzeuge der Zukunft - vernetzt, automatisiert und emissionsfrei - zu bekommen"".

Nach Informationen der ""SZ"" ist das keineswegs ein Alleingang Özdemirs, sondern in der großen Koordinierungsrunde seiner Partei vorab so besprochen worden.

Auch deshalb kritisierte der Grünen-Abgeordnete Dieter Janecek das Verhalten Dobrindts. Janecek twitterte: ""Solche Polemik ist nur Ausdruck der eigenen Verunsicherung der CSU. Die Menschen werden genau registrieren, wer glaubhaft um Lösungen ringt.""

How Do I Talk To My Child About Sexting?","The number of children in the UK who are sexting (sharing sexual images of themselves in a text message) has more than doubled in two years, new statistics have revealed. Police forces in England and Wales recorded 6,238 underage sexting offences between 2016 and 2017, a rate of 17 offences per day, according to the BBC. This figure marks a huge 131% rise since the same period in 2014. Not only is the problem increasing in frequency, but the age of children affected is dropping, with many reports from children under ten years old. And in July it was reported that a five-year-old boy from County Durham had become the youngest person in the UK to be investigated for the crime, after taking a picture of himself on an iPad and sending it to another child.

Zoe Hilton, Head of safeguarding at the National Crime Agency, told HuffPost UK: “With smartphones and tablets, and new apps emerging all the time, this behaviour is becoming quite normal for teenagers. It can be alarming for mum and dad who might not know how to help when things go wrong.” So how should parents be dealing with this problem? What Is Sexting? The UK government defines sexting as the exchange of sexual messages or images and creating, sharing and forwarding sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images through mobile phones and the internet. How Common Is Sexting? According to research by NSPCC, around one in seven young people admitted to having taken a semi-naked/naked picture of themselves. Over 50% then went on to share the picture with someone else via the internet. What Is The Law Around Sexting? A study by the NSPCC revealed that 50% of parents do not know it is illegal for their child to take nude selfies. A young person (under 16 years old) is breaking the law if they: Take an explicit photo or video of themselves or someone else.

Share an explicit image or video of a child, even shared between people of the same age.

Possess, download or store these images .

Although it may seem harmless, under UK law creating or sharing explicit images of a child is illegal, even if the person doing it is a child.

As of January 2016, if a young person is found creating or sharing images, the police can choose to record that a crime has been committed but that taking formal action isn’t in the public interest. Although this doesn’t stop sexting being illegal. How Do I Talk To My Child About Sexting? Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC told The Huffington Post UK: “Of course, talking about sexting can be an embarrassing or awkward conversation for both parents and children.” But Wanless explained that a worrying statistic showed that 50% of parents weren’t confident about getting the right support to talk to their child. And this needs to change. Suzie Hayman trustee of Family Lives shared tips for parents: Have a plan: “Having a plan will make your life easier. Rather than waiting for something bad to happen, think about when and how you are going to start and keep the conversation going about the risks and rewards of the online world.” Pick a time with no pressure: “Avoid starting a conversation just as your child is going to bed or walking out the door. Use a storyline from an article or TV programme to start up the conversation about this.” Get to know their friends’ parents: “They’ll probably share your concerns, so you could agree on rules around technology and supervision. You can also share anecdotes about the questions your children have asked, which might help you prepare for your own conversations.” Do not dismiss sexist language or behaviour as funny: “Remember that you need to be a role model for them and they will look to you to determine what is right and what is wrong.” Let them know about the risk: “That taking, sharing or sending images of themselves could be shown to others or distributed online and there will be little they can do to stop this.”

Der Bürgermeister von Tübingen, in den eigenen Reihen wegen seiner gezielten Provokationen berüchtigt, arbeitet sich in einem wütenden Facebookpost ausgerechnet an einem Parteikollegen ab.

Das Ziel von Palmers Angriff: Partei-Urgestein Jürgen Trittin. Es sei ein ""Trauerspiel“, dass Trittin, ""ein Schatten der Vergangenheit“, über die Koalition mitverhandle.

""Eine glatte Lüge""

""Was macht so jemand in einer Verhandlungsgruppe?"", fragte Palmer bei Facebook. Der Konservative in den Reihen der Grünen kritisierte vor allem Trittins Aussagen in Interviews. Trittin habe ""keine Angst vor der Unwahrheit""“ und sei stets darauf bedacht, ""den Verhandlungspartner schlecht aussehen"" zu lassen.

Trittin hatte kürzlich im ""Spiegel"" kritisiert, Union und FDP wären sich einig, dass die Grünen in den Verhandlungen möglichst wenige ihrer Punkte durchsetzen sollten. Palmer glaubt: ""Wer sowas behauptet, kann die Verhandlungen doch gleich lassen."" Dann warf er dem Parteilinken gar eine Lüge vor.

Nicht wegen ihm seien die Sondierungsgespräche mit der Union 2013 gescheitert, hatte Trittin betont. ""Damals gab es für Merkel einen Partner, der leichter zu haben war als wir: die SPD"", sagte er im ""Spiegel"". Laut Palmer eine ""glatte Lüge"".

""L'évasion fiscale, ce n'est pas simplement une attaque contre le trésor public. L'évasion fiscale, c'est une attaque contre la démocratie, contre le consentement à l'impôt"", a-t-il dénoncé.

Les Etats qui favorisent ou encouragent l'évasion fiscale ""ne doivent avoir accès à aucun financement des grands organismes internationaux comme la BM ou le FMI. On ne peut pas favoriser l'évasion fiscale et avoir en plus le soutien financier des institutions internationales"", a encore estimé le ministre des Finances.

Défense d'Emmanuel Macron

Ce dernier a également répondu aux critiques, émanant notamment de la France insoumise, visant le peu d'empressement d'Emmanuel Macron de légiférer contre l'évasion fiscale. La lutte ""est un combat de longue haleine qu'on ne gagne pas en faisant des grands coups de menton.C 'est un combat qu'on gagne en faisant preuve d'obstination, de persévérance, de détermination"", a-t-il plaidé avant, fait rare, de saluer l'action de Nicolas Sarkozy et de François Hollande sur le sujet.

""Je pense que nous pouvons tous saluer ici le travail qui a été engagé contre l'évasion fiscale et la fraude fiscale par Nicolas Sarkozy, puis par François Hollande. Tous les présidents de la République se sont engagés dans ce combat. Je peux vous garantir que le président Emmanuel Macron poursuivra ce combat avec la même détermination que ses prédécesseurs"", a-t-il déclaré.

Réagissant aux attaques visant Emmanuel Macron lorsqu'il était secrétaire général adjoint de l'Elysée, Bruno Le Maire a plaidé la cause du président: ""Les ministres décident, les conseillers conseillent. Je m'en tiens à cette ligne de conduite. Elle vaut pour tous les conseillers, quel que soit le destin qu'ils aient pu avoir par la suite.""

Russell Crowe has voiced frustrations on Sunday over criticism he has received for his offer to take and find work for six men held by Australia on Manus Island, after labelling the escalating crisis as ""a nation's shame"".

On Thursday, Crowe tweeted his belief that he could accommodate some of the 600 asylum seekers who are currently stranded on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, abandoned by the Australian government, fearful local residents could attack them if they leave the soon-to-close detention centre and worried local authorities will attack them if they stay.

I've thought about this . I believe I could house and find jobs for 6. I'm sure there'd be other Australians who would do the same November 1, 2017

Since then, the 'Gladiator' star has faced a barrage of criticism from people angered by his focus on foreign asylum seekers over struggling Australians.

In multiple separate posts to Facebook, Crowe's critiques questioned everything from his place in discussing politics to his ability to house just six of the asylum seekers despite being a Hollywood actor.

""Russell Crowe is another joke. He has no business interfering with the government process. His ill informed opinion is just regurgetated [sic] fodder from those with a political agenda,"" one post said.

On Sunday Crowe hit back in another series of tweets, saying the negative feedback ""doesn't change that what Australia has done to these men on Manus is appalling"".

Crowe's offer came as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden said she would raise the issue with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, following the closure of the Manus Island detention centre, in their first meeting since she secured her country's leadership.

And while, during that meeting, Ardern offered on Sunday to take 150 asylum seekers currently in PNG and Nauru and accommodate them in New Zealand, Turnbull declined the offer -- instead prioritising Australia's existing refugee deal with the United States. Under that agreement, 1,250 refugees from the two Pacific nations will be resettled in the US.

En attendant, il ne faut pas pour autant se dire que le vaccin actuel contre la grippe est inutile, loin de là.","SCIENCE - Cet hiver devrait être difficile du côté des maladies. C'est en tout cas la mise en garde d'une étude publiée lundi 6 novembre dans la revue Pnas. Les chercheurs ont remarqué que l'année dernière, seuls 20 à 30% des personnes vaccinées contre la grippe ont été protégées.

Le problème viendrait d'une mutation de la souche du virus dominante de 2016, H3N2. La même souche a de bonnes chances de s'imposer cette année, ce qui devrait compliquer encore une fois l'efficacité de la vaccination.

C'est un problème récurrent avec la grippe. Il y a plusieurs souches très répandues du virus: H1, H2, H3, etc. On les appelle les ""hémagglutinines"". Les vaccins habituels reconnaissent la ""tête"" de cette protéine (la partie bleue).

Tête-à-queue

Problème: c'est cette partie de la protéine qui mute le plus et change d'année en année. Du coup, beaucoup de scientifiques cherchent à créer un vaccin qui cible la ""queue"" de la protéine (en rouge).

C'est le cas de l'université d'Oxford, qui a lancé le 3 octobre une première mondiale: un test clinique sur l'Homme d'un vaccin universel contre la grippe. Celui-ci va durer deux ans, avec la participation de 2000 patients.

Les chercheurs espèrent que l'effet durera au moins deux, voire quatre ans. Mais il faudra attendre la fin de l'essai clinique pour en avoir le coeur net. Même si celui-ci est un succès, d'autres tests plus importants seront nécessaires avant la commercialisation d'un éventuel vaccin.

Méthode prometteuse

Mais même si ce nouveau vaccin fonctionne, il pourrait bien en pas être si universel que cela. En effet, dans une étude publiée le 6 novembre dans Scientific Reports, des chercheurs affirment s'être rendu compte que la fameuse ""tige"" de l'hémagglutinine peut également muter, même si cela est beaucoup plus rare.

Problème insoluble? Pas sûr, rapporte Live Science. Toujours dans Scientific Reports, une autre étude, publiée le 2 novembre, est porteuse d'espoirs. Des scientifiques ont testé sur des souris une technique de vaccination très différente. Plutôt que de cibler la tige ou la tête, les chercheurs ont ciblé des gènes dits ""consensus"", ou ""ancestraux"".

Ce ne sont pas les meilleurs pour mettre au point un vaccin, mais ils ont un intérêt: ils se situent dans la région centrale du virus et sont donc présents dans de très nombreuses variations du virus de la grippe.

Des souris et des hommes

Les chercheurs ont créé un vaccin à partir de 4 de ces gènes et l'ont injecté à des souris. Ils ont ensuite exposé les rongeurs à 9 mutations mortelles du virus de la grippe. A haute dose, l'efficacité a été de 100% pour 8 des 9 virus. A des doses plus faibles, le vaccin a été efficace contre 7 des virus.

Cette dernière dose serait ""facilement traduisible chez l'humain"", affirment les auteurs. Mieux: injecté à des enfants, ce vaccin pourrait entraîner une immunité générale à la grippe.

Il ne faut pour autant pas s'emballer. De nombreux vaccins fonctionnels chez les animaux ne peuvent pas être transposés à l'homme. Il faudra dans tous les cas des années d'études et d'expériences pour savoir si ce vaccin fonctionne et est sans danger pour l'être humain.

Et même, notent les auteurs, les virus peuvent également s'adapter à de nouveaux vaccins à partir de gènes consensus. Il ne faut encore une fois pas perdre espoir: les chercheurs rappellent que plus les virus sont séquencés, plus on trouvera de nouveaux gènes de ce type pouvant être ciblés.

En attendant, il ne faut pas pour autant se dire que le vaccin actuel contre la grippe est inutile, loin de là. Même avec une efficacité modérée, l'impact global sur la mortalité des personnes âgées reste sensible. Selon une autre étude publiée en 2015, portant sur la période 2000-2009, plus de 2000 décès par an ont été évités grâce à la vaccination, avec une efficacité moyenne du vaccin chez les personnes âgées évaluée à 35%. Une couverture vaccinale portée à 75% permettrait d'en éviter 3000 supplémentaires, selon la même étude.

""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""
""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""
The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well.
""Let's face it, there is nothing more humbling than learning a second language and using it because you just revert to [being] a two-year-old.""","Learning a second language is no easy task.

A lot of time and dedication is required, plus there is a significant amount of memorising of words and phrases. And even once you've learnt those, it takes both skill and confidence to use them in a real-life setting.

Well, Associate Professor Evan Kidd from the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language says that anyone can learn a new language as long as they put enough time into the process.

""I think that almost anyone, if they give it a good enough shot, is going to have some abilities in a language with enough exposure and time,"" Kidd told HuffPost Australia.

According to Kidd, one of the biggest challenges adults face when learning a new language is approaching it with the knowledge of their mother tongue. Our brains are finely tuned to our first language and so we approach any new linguistic situation within the framework of that first language.

""The challenge in learning a second language is the fact that you have a first language,"" Kidd said. ""Part of that is you are coming to your second language with knowledge of your first language.""

So, what are some ways that we can make the language-learning process easier?

Three ways to make learning a new language easier Use stock phrases Learning a few generic and adaptable phrases in a new language can make it easier to use and also give you a template to build other terms using that same formula. ""It's good to have a few stock phrases because then you can start strapping off from those so you can say -- 'OK I have got this phrase and I can put different verbs in it and different nouns in it', which is actually how young kids tend to learn,"" Kidd said. Memorise When you first start out, learning the basic grammar and vocabulary of any language is going to require time to create a solid linguistic foundation. This means a lot of dedication to learning the words and making an effort to remember those through practice. ""Inevitably, there are going to be instances where you are just going to need to memorise the rule because, let's face it, languages are weird entities."" Actually speak the language Kidd said that in his experience, one of the most important things when learning a new language is making the effort to use it as much as possible. ""It's all fine and good to sit there and learn it and then do in a class, but you really have to talk and I think by virtue of talking that's when you really start to get much more sense that this is a communicative system and you really want to use that to communicate."" ""[It's a] combination between memorisation and a little bit of 'extraversion' and having a go.""

Children are exposed to languages at a very young age, even from the time they are in the womb. The process of acquiring language begins with sounds and language rhythms and eventually builds up to words and sentences.

""One of the cool things about infants when they are born is they have the ability to perceive the difference between any sound that the human vocal tract can make, and the thing is that any one language will only use a subset of those sounds,"" Kidd said.

An interesting example of how this works can be found when the English and Japanese languages are compared.

""In English we have a distinction between the 'R' sound and the 'L' sound but in Japanese they don't have that distinction -- they've got one which is between these two sounds,"" Kidd explained.

""So, what happens when a Japanese infant is born is that they can distinguish between the 'R' and 'L' sounds but once they get to about 12 months they can't do it anymore and that is because their language doesn't have it.""

Children under 12 months can identify every sound a human voice tract can make.

As humans lose this ability around the age of 12 months, we become unable to accurately distinguish some sounds that our mother tongue doesn't use. It's in this way that learning a first and a second language is fundamentally different.

Most of us can't remember learning our first language because it was effortless and occurred over a long period of time, but acquiring that second one requires a lot of hard work.

""I guess what the one distinction between a first language and second language is that first language acquisition is really implicit and a second language can be more explicit.""

The explicit nature of learning a second language means that we are very aware of how much energy and dedication it takes to be able to speak any language well. Kidd says that being as confident as possible with another language could be the gateway to your success.

Die Grünen kommen den Jamaika-Unterhändlern von Union und FDP im Tauziehen um die Klimapolitik in einen wichtigen Punkt entgegen. Sie beharren nicht länger darauf, bei einer Koalitionsvereinbarung das Ende des Verbrennungsmotors im Jahr 2030 festzuschreiben.

""Mir ist klar, dass wir alleine nicht das Enddatum 2030 für die Zulassung von fossilen Verbrennungsmotoren durchsetzen werden können"", sagte Parteichef Cem Özdemir der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"".

We should therefore not be surprised at the outrage over the use of the old flag -- regardless of whether it was displayed widely or only in isolated incidents.
Arguably, the old South African flag symbolises the apartheid regime and its ideology, the idea that one race is more worthy of being protected than another.","Symbols, like words, communicate meanings. As such, symbols are hardly ever ""just objects"" -- they are the bearer of meanings. Like anything, the meaning of a symbol can be contested and will ultimately rest on some form of societal consensus (and this meaning can change again over time because society is not static). A flag is a cultural symbol and a powerful one as such. So powerful, that it is sometimes banned for the meaning it carries. The Nazi flag being banned in Germany is one such example.

The old South African flag that often pops up in conversations about farm murders is one such symbol and something that should be worrying anyone who claims that, ""This is not a race thing."" We saw the meaning of the flag being contested as a result of the circulation of images (and admittedly some were from other farm murder protests and not #BlackMonday).

When trying to ascertain meaning, context is always important. While watching the conversations about the old South African flag, I found Charlottesville, Nazi symbolism and the debates about the Confederate flag in the US coming to mind.

Earlier this year in the US, there was a debate surrounding the use of the Confederate flag. On the one side you have people who argue that it is a symbol of racism, pointing specifically to the creator of the flag stating that, ""As a people, we are fighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race"" and that the flag is a symbol of that, while others argue that the flag has nothing to do with racism but more with the heritage and culture of the American South, or that it simply means ""people fought and died"" (in the American civil war) and for this reason is historical memorabilia.

The debate about the Confederate flag and a vote as to whether to keep it or not showed that the discussion about its meaning and the differing opinions about it is a symptom of a polarised society: 90 percent of whites wanted to keep it (in Mississippi), while 95 percent of black people voted for the option to have a new flag. Conversations around the flag are mostly dominated by ""us and them"" language. Dylann Roof, the suspect in the Charleston church massacre where nine black churchgoers were gunned down, posed shamelessly with the flag in various pictures.

Inevitably the conversations about the flag and what it symbolises are steeped in history. What is the origin? What did it represent? Can the meaning of a flag change with the times? And if so, has it? An interesting study showed that white Southerners that support the Confederate flag exhibited particular characteristics: they are generally less knowledgeable about the history, more intolerant toward interracial dating and tend to deny that black people are discriminated against in the labour market (despite statistics showing otherwise).

There are many moral questions about the enjoyment of such privileges bestowed on you by a system that is, at the same time, committing a crime against humanity.

This will then negate the argument that it is the respect for Southern history that drives the love for the flag. White people who are more knowledgeable about Southern history tend to support the flagless. In this sense, love of the flag can be seen to symbolise ignorance of its history, and this tends to disprove that the flag is merely about history.

When I saw the few images and videos (and I understand some of the images were old and of previous farm-murder protests), this debate rang in my head. I wondered what the results would be if we did a similar study in South Africa.

Understandably the images evoked emotional responses all over the spectrum of political (and civil life, for as far as it is not strictly political) in South Africa. Presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the display of the flag, seeing it as a symbol of people who ""hanker for apartheid"". Roelf Meyer, a National Party politician who is known for his role in the negotiations to end apartheid, said he regards it as a symbol of extremism.

A woman interviewed about the flag on her biker jacket stated how she felt protected under the old South African flag.

Do we know the history and the system that this flag represents? On the one hand, one should give it to the woman who thinks back on the ""good old days"" -- apartheid as a system was geared to make her life comfortable while making the lives of black people a living hell. And this all sounds okay if one disregards that it was a crime against humanity.

And then, of course, there are many moral questions about the enjoyment of privileges bestowed by a system that is, at the same time, committing a crime against humanity (for which, I should add, very few of its leaders or agents were ever prosecuted).

We should therefore not be surprised at the outrage over the use of the old flag -- regardless of whether it was displayed widely or only in isolated incidents. And I want to argue that the appearance of the flag is a symptom of a society that, on the whole political spectrum, is questioning exactly the compromise, the shared future, that the new flag is supposed to symbolise.

Arguably, the old South African flag symbolises the apartheid regime and its ideology, the idea that one race is more worthy of being protected than another.

So, why does this matter? The answer might lie in the relationship between symbols and how we view the world around us. Accepting or rejecting a political symbol with a very specific meaning indicates something about the state of our nation. We should ask questions about the meaning of these symbols and their places in the national conversation.

Germany has laws banning Nazi symbols. They have Volksverhetzung, where the waving of the Nazi flag can be seen as a ""incitement to hatred"" and a call for action against a certain segment of the population. The use of a symbol is regarded as a direct call to action against a particular ethnic group.

Arguably, the old South African flag symbolises the apartheid regime and its ideology, the idea that one race is more worthy of being protected than another, and the idea that black people are savages and somehow less human and should be treated as such. It is a denial of equality, of equal human dignity -- and as such, it is unconstitutional.

If the groups who hijacked any attempt and meaningful conversation about farm murders want to deny that this is the premise on which the fight against the murder of farmers is based, there should be an outright condemnation of the use of the (old South African) flag and what it symbolises.",The Shadow Of The Oranje Blanje Blou At #BlackMonday,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/elmien-du-plessis/the-shadow-of-the-oranje-blanje-blou-at-blackmonday_a_23267048/

These lanky creatures are known for their stamina and fighting spirit. They also have, reputedly, sharper and quicker reflexes than their foreign counterparts.

A bunch of these potential candidates are being trained at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) centre in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, while six dogs are already ready to join the forces in Jammu & Kashmir later this year.

RVC personnel have asked the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU) for a second batch of eight pups, The Hindu added.

What could be better than an iPhone 8? OK, it's not an X but hey, it's the new product from a company, which is a leader in design, so it's got to be great at accessibility.

It isn't.

The way to switch on the accessibility features - such as inverted text so that a visually impaired person can see the screen is to find and open the settings app, find the 'General' section and tap on it, then find the 'Accessibility' setting and tap on it, then find and choose the 'Display Accommodation' option, choose the 'Invert Colors' (sic) and then decide if you want 'Smart Invert' or 'Classic Invert'.

Sorry, I lost you at ""find settings"". There are two things broken here; discovery and implementation. The discoverability of the feature, it's up there with Douglas Adams' ""beware of the leopard"". It's not a feature you are going to stumble across, particularly if you are visually impaired. But let's assume someone has told you that it's in the 'Display Accommodation' setting and that the option has nothing to do with Airbnb. Think about the process by which a visually impaired person would get to the option. The first thing they would do is try and zoom on the screen. That's fine, even a moderately inexperienced iPhone user knows about pinching to zoom. Except it doesn't, while in an app the pinch works, but the home screen and settings are not an app - you need to switch on the zoom mode and double tap with three fingers to zoom. But getting to the zoom mode setting without zooming is impossible. On the lamented Windows Mobile phone, a double tap with two fingers zoomed regardless. The idea of UI problems where you can't complete an operation is called a UI trap and looked at on the website UItraps.com.

Ultimately the iPhone, iPad and iOS are all horribly unfriendly for those with visual impairment.

What you should buy your nan is an Amazon Echo Show. An Amazon Echo is a cool bit of tech and fits into the kind of thing that as a techie you should buy for someone, but it's not the tech appeal. Indeed many people mistakenly think that voice recognition is how to make a device suitable for older people. Saturday Night Live did a skit on a ""Silver Alexa"" where the Amazon device made sympathetic noises as an older man rambled on. What makes the Echo Show valuable is that it's a technology Trojan horse.

Once your nan is up and running using the one killer feature of the Kindle Show there is a chance that she'll slowly, oh so slowly, be prepared to let you show you her how to do other things.

It's not that older people can't use technology. Give an 80-year-old engineer a slide rule and he or she will be a damn sight more comfortable with it than you or me, it's all about familiarity and nothing about any new piece of technology is familiar. You might think that it's obvious that an arrow pointing right means ""play"" or a circle with a line in the middle is an on switch, but it's all still alien.

The Kindle Show doesn't solve that problem. What it does give your nan is a compelling reason to learn. The one killer feature is you. Research from the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University has found that an older person will take on something which is a significant cognitive challenge if the reward is great enough, and for your grandmother, there is no greater reward than video calling grandchildren. Don't call it Skype or FaceTime, it's just you on the seven-inch screen in her kitchen.

Teaching your gran to video call isn't the best technology for her, services like Fuss Free Phones take an alternative view of shaping technology to suit older people's existing mental models. Whatever you do, don't buy her an iPhone 8.

Quanto al Pd il Financial Times sottolinea ""la difficoltà a connettersi con gli elettori"" e come ora Renzi debba affrontare gli scettici all'interno del suo partito, i quali ""credono sia diventato troppo divisivo e che le sue politiche siano troppo centriste per vincere le prossime elezioni"".

This story started, as the best ones usually don't, when we were watching horse racing at work.

It was the Monday before Melbourne Cup day. After the Cup preview, programming switched to a ho-hum meeting with moderately performed gallopers at Ballarat. But we left the TV on.

In race 6, a horse called Near Queue ran second. Odd name. Near Queue. Near queue, near queue, near queue. For some reason, something seemed a little suspicious. And then we got it.

What's the opposite of near? And what happens when you say ""Far Queue"" in a broad Aussie accent? Uh-huh.

Near Queue is trained by Ballarat trainer Dan O'Sullivan. HuffPost Australia contacted the stable administrator Mel O'Sullivan to find out why the owners would give a perfectly lovely horse such a cheeky name.

classy — Saskia Moon (@smoonjuice) 6 de novembro de 2017

""Well, you'd rather be in the near queue than the other one,"" she told us. ""Her owners have used the word 'queue' in the name of her siblings, so it sort of went from there.""

We guess it sort of did.

The thing about naming race horses is you can't use any old name, otherwise every joker in Australia would try to register a horse named ""Hoof Hearted"". Think about that one too. Uh-huh.

Racing's national governing body, Racing Australia, actually has an official horse naming policy. Among other things, the rules state:

Names may be rejected if they are difficult to pronounce or read;

Names where the meaning or origin cannot be satisfactorily substantiated will not be accepted;

Any name, the use of which would be contrary to law, will not be accepted;

Representatives from nearly 200 countries gather at the United Nations’ 23rd climate change conference beginning Monday, an annual effort to tackle global warming and its impacts already inflicting havoc on the planet. This year, however, the U.N. faces a new challenge: Addressing the phenomenon after U.S. President Donald Trump, leader of the planet’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged to do nothing to curb emissions. The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will deal with that question in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17 as countries work to firm up their commitments to adapt to a warmer world in line with 2015′s landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say the world should prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a benchmark set by the Paris accord. Meeting the target means dramatic reduction in global emissions, and the Paris pact urges signatories to craft voluntary pledges to do that. However, the agreement is not legally binding, and Trump followed through on a campaign pledge to withdraw America from what he calls the “draconian” pact in June. It is a multi-year process to do so, and the U.S. cannot leave until Nov. 4, 2020 ― the day after the next presidential election. The U.S. and Syria are now the only two nations opposed to the climate deal.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters Empty seats of U.S. delegation are seen before the opening session of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference 2017, hosted by Fiji but held in Bonn.

The Trump administration announced last week it would actively promote fossil fuels during a presentation at the climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP. Delegates sent by the White House will host a talk titled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” which will tout the supposed benefits of coal, natural gas and nuclear power. A delegation of U.S. negotiators are expected to work in Bonn to help write the rulebook for the Paris agreement, but their presence will be awkward. It’s unclear if negotiators from other countries will be willing to listen to a White House, which, under Trump, would not abide by any rules that emerge. The summit will feature some U.S. star power, however. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are funding a pavilion to showcase climate action by U.S. cities and businesses. The federal government usually pays the $200,000 or so cost of the showcase, but declined to do so this year. “The American people and American industry are pretty much all behind doing what the Paris agreement is designed to do, and that is to cut the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere so we will slow down and maybe even stop climate change, which has the potential to destroy the world,” Bloomberg told The New York Times last month. Environmental groups and local governments around the U.S. reacted with fury following Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal, but pledged to do their part to combat his agenda with or without federal support. Other world leaders have vowed to move forward regardless, and in July, every member of the G20, aside from the U.S., unveiled a detailed policy to abide by the Paris pact in a clear rebuke of the White House.",The World's Largest Climate Change Summit Starts Today.

Der Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad warnt eindringlich vor dem politischen Islam

Dieser würde die Integration von muslimischen Migranten in Deutschland massiv behindern

Auch die katholische und evangelische Kirche trügen daran eine Mitschuld

Der ägyptisch-deutsche Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad hat vor dem politischen Islam in Deutschland gewarnt. Insbesondere kritisierte er den größten Moscheeverein in Deutschland, die von der Türkei dominierte Ditib.

Auf einer Veranstaltung der “Passauer Neuen Presse” sagte er am Montagabend, Ditib stehe für einen Islam, mit dem muslimische Migranten in Deutschland nicht erfolgreich mit einbezogen werden könnten. Das Ziel dieses politischen Islam sei “niemals die Integration der Muslime“.

Auch wenn sich islamische Organisationen in Deutschland oft als offizielle Repräsentanten der hierzulande lebenden Muslime darstellen würden, habe das nichts mit der Realität zu tun.

Abdel-Samad begründet das damit, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der fünf Millionen Muslime in Deutschland Mitglieder solcher Verbände sind. Für eine gelungene Integration sei es viel wichtiger auf die einzelnen Individuen einzugehen, als auf politische Gruppierungen.

Oft geäußerte Kritik

Wenn Abdel-Samad so etwas sagt, erzeugt das immer Aufmerksamkeit in Deutschland. Der Politologe ist für seine harte Haltung ebenso bekannt wie umstritten.

Neues hat sein Beitrag am Montagabend in der Diskussion denn auch nicht gebracht. Dass die türkische Regierung über Ditib Einfluss in Deutschland zu nehmen versucht, ist bekannt. Der Glaubensverband steht hierzulande schon länger in der Kritik. Unter anderem werden Imamen von Ditib Spionage für die türkische Regierung vorgeworfen.

Gleichwohl hält Abdel-Samad damit eine Diskussion am Laufen, die tatsächlich geführt werden muss. Zuletzt hatte etwa der CDU-Politiker Jens Spahn in harschen Worten angemahnt, die Zusammenarbeit mit den Islamverbänden zu überprüfen.

Dabei geht es darum, wie der Islam in Deutschland in der Gesellschaft vertreten werden soll, wer für Muslime sprechen kann und darf.

Denn klar ist: Muslime sind traditionell weniger hierarchisch organisiert als etwa die Christen.

""Die Kirche macht sich mitschuldig""

Abdel-Samad nahm am Montag auch die Kirchen in die Pflicht. Auch sie setzen seiner Ansicht nach zu stark auf Verbände wie die Ditib.

Er warf Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, dem Landesbischof der evangelischen Kirche in Bayern, Fehler im Umgang mit der Ditib vor.

So habe seine Kirche zur Gedenkfeier nach dem Terroranschlag auf dem Breitscheidplatz in Berlin 2016 einen Imam eingeladen, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet wurde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Der Islam ist kein Problem, das man lösen muss""

“Indem man solche Leute hoffähig macht, macht man sich als Kirche mitschuldig”, so Abdel-Samad. Die Kirche würde keinerlei Konsequenzen im Umgang mit Ditib folgen lassen, und das obwohl man um ihre problematische Rolle wisse.

Bedford-Strohm argumentierte, man wisse um die Kritik - aber deswegen werde man den Dialog nicht abreißen lassen. Denn er sei unabdingbar.

Doch Abdel-Samad wehrt sich gegen solche Kompromisse. Nur mehr Ehrlichkeit mit dem Islam und mit seinen Vertretern in Deutschland könne zu einer besseren Integration führen.

As if Season 2 wasn’t creepy enough, fans started theorizing that the worlds of “Stranger Things” and “It” were actually connected following the release of new episodes.

This connection stems largely from the introduction of Bob Newby (Sean Astin). While driving with Will (Noah Schnapp) in the car, Bob mentions that as a kid he had nightmares about “Mr. Baldo,” a clown who had offered him a balloon. (Just like Pennywise in “It” does). At another point, Bob also suggests to Joyce (Winona Ryder) that they buy his parents’ house in Maine. (“It” takes place in Derry, Maine.)

Furthermore, in the Season 2 finale, Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler on “Stranger Things,” repeats the same line his character in “It” says.

The Duffer brothers, who actually once pitched an “It” remake themselves, recently told Vulture that the connections are completely intentional. But there seems to be one big hole in the theory.

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

“I think [Bob’s clown story] was really me describing something that just freaked me out. I didn’t have that experience myself. I just had nightmares like that,” he said.

Duffer continued:

“I’m sure we were just like, ‘It would be cute if [Bob] suggests moving to Maine, right next to Stephen King.’ Stephen King exists in this world. Some of the characters have read Stephen King. But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King. He’s not interested at all in Stephen King because he hates that kind of story.”

Since King exists in the world of “Stranger Things,” it seems unlikely that his fictional characters would as well (though, as one of our readers points out, there is a Stephen King in the “Dark Tower” series). The kids are probably safe from Pennywise after all; however, if red balloons start showing up in Hawkins, Indiana, those guys are on their own.",The Truth Behind The Creepy Connection Between 'It' And 'Stranger Things',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-truth-behind-the-creepy-connection-between-it-and-stranger-things_us_5a00b54ee4b0baea2633f87b

He conceded the proposal is a complex one, and examining it will take some time — but says the purpose of his speech was merely to inspire the discussion.

Christmas says he has received a great deal of reaction on both sides of the debate since his lecture, with some supporting independence and others dismissing it as unreasonable.

We've all seen the day-after images of race day disasters. The things some of us manage to get up to at the races aren't pretty. If you're around work people there are some simple rules to follow.

Rule Number 1: Keep it classy.

The months ahead are full of opportunities to socialise with colleagues and clients. If you're lucky enough to find yourself at a company sponsored race day, relax, have fun and get to know the people you are with. However, never lose sight of the fact your behaviour will reflect on your character and career potential.

While most people expect a more relaxed and informal atmosphere at work events, equally most expect a degree of decorum. Keeping it classy means behaving in a way any reasonable person would consider respectful. That is to both the people you are with and yourself. While it's always important to be authentic, work events are definitely a setting you need to bring the best version of yourself to.

Reflect for a moment on the guy who decided it was a great idea to share his karaoke singing talents, uninvited, at an event attended by clients. The simple, albeit harsh reality is if he could sing particularly well, most people wouldn't have cared. The trouble was he couldn't and in his inebriated state he struggled to even remember the lyrics.

While rolling around drunk, and encouraging the crowd to join in on a singalong might be okay at a private party, there are so many reasons it's not okay at a work event. This same guy was, at that time, hoping for a promotion. His justification for his behaviour was that he wanted to 'bring a bit of life' to the party and could see no harm in how he had behaved. Being the class clown isn't the best path to career success.

Keep it classy and you're entirely more likely to enhance your reputation for being a mature and professional individual.

Rule Number 2: Drink in moderation.

The most important and common pitfall to avoid is drinking to excess. This can be particularly challenging if you enjoy a drink and alcohol is free flowing over a long day. It's okay to have a few, but understand your limits and pace yourself. The last thing you want is to turn up to work the next day and discover you said or did a bunch of things you can't even remember.

Rule Number 3: Hold your tongue.

Taking the opportunity to provide feedback to your CEO on their performance isn't a great idea when you've had a few too many. One young man I met faced the daunting task of having to meet with the CEO the morning after he did exactly that at a work event. This was made worse by the fact he couldn't recall what he had said and needed to be reminded, by the CEO!

As a leader, HR professional or event organiser the spotlight is on you. The standard of behaviour you set through example is the same standard you can expect from others. Poor judgement and bad behaviour is unfortunately all too common among the people in charge. Take for example the CEO who was found outside the venue in a compromising position with a junior team member. While the team who gathered to observe may have had a laugh, the flow on impacts to his reputation and career were devastating.

Keep it classy and you're entirely more likely to enhance your reputation for being a mature and professional individual. In other words, be the kind of person who can be trusted to represent the organisation well.

Die deutsche wie die internationale Presse reagiert mit Empörung auf die Enthüllungen

Die Paradise Papers sorgen für Empörung auf der ganzen Welt. Großkonzerne, Promis, Superreiche – die Enthüllungen belegen ausführlich, dass weltweit Unternehmen und Privatpersonen bei der Steuer tricksen.

“Skrupellose Eliten vermeiden ihre gerechte Besteuerung, während Otto-Normal-Verbraucher zuhause Straßen, Schulen und Sozialausgaben finanziert”, bringt es Birgit Marshall für die “Rheinische Post” auf den Punkt.

Klar ist: Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Gabriel Zucman verliert allein die Bundesrepublik jedes Jahr 17 Milliarden Euro an Einnahmen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Paradise Papers"": Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten

Politik in Bedrängnis

""Spiegel""-Journalist Jakob Augstein findet in seinem Kommentar harte Worte für den laxen Umgang der Bundesrepublik mit den superreichen Steuersündern. ""Das System ist zutiefst krank"", schreibt er. Und die Wut darauf wachse. ""Sie sucht sich nur die falschen Ziele. Der Hass der Betrogenen gilt eher dem Kriegs- als dem Steuerflüchtling"", bemerkt Augstein. Und ergänzt: ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.""

Auch die internationale Presse sieht die Politik in der Bringschuld, die Steueroasen durch härteres Vorgehen zu zerschlagen. “Um dieser Situation ein Ende zu bereiten, sollte man jene beiden Kräfte zerstören, die sie aufrechterhalten”, schreibt die französische Zeitung “Le Monde”: ""Die grenzenlose Gier einiger weniger und die Untätigkeit der Staaten.” Letzteres sei dabei nicht unbedingt einfacher anzugehen, als Ersteres.

Denn dass Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen sich Steuerparadiese wie den Kaiman Inseln, Malta, oder Bermuda bedienen, um Geld zu horten, ist spätestens seit den “Panama Papers” bekannt. Passiert ist jedoch nicht viel, um die Steuertrickser zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen.

Marshall von der “Rheinischen Post” glaubt, dass die “unerträgliche Schieflage” gefährliche Stimmungen verschärfen könne: “Gerade demokratisch gewählte Regierungen verlieren Glaubwürdigkeit, wenn es ihnen weiterhin nicht gelingt, die Reichsten ausreichend zu besteuern”, kommentiert sie.

Mehr noch: Ranghohe Politiker wie US-Handelsminister Wilbur Ross sind selbst in die Enthüllungen verwickelt.

""Bild""-Zeitung: Auch der kleine Mann trickst bei der Steuer

Der einzige Trost sei, dass die Digitalisierung für mehr Transparenz sorgen werde, weil Dateien gehackt werden können, folgert die belgische Zeitung “De Tijd”. “Jedes neue Leck stellt die steuerliche Doppelmoral bloß.”

Olaf Gersemann von der “Welt” ist da anderer Meinung. Er sieht in den Offshore-Geschäften keine Doppelmoral. “Konten in Steueroasen sind im Grunde nichts anderes als das Bargeld des reichen Mannes: desjenigen, der mehr Geld besitzt, als sich in Matratzen oder Wandtresoren verstauen ließe”, behauptet er in einem Kommentar.

Die “Bild”-Zeitung argumentiert sogar, auch der “kleine Mann” würde gerne mal bei der Steuer tricksen. Mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro gingen in Deutschland jedes Jahr durch alltäglichen Steuerschummel verloren, heißt es in dem Bericht.

„Dahinter stecken häufig dieselbe Gier, dieselben egoistischen Motive, einfach sparen zu wollen“, zitiert die “Bild” den Chef der Deutschen Steuergewerkschaft, Thomas Eigenthaler. Der Steuerexperte vermutet, dass viele Leute für sich beschließen: “Wenn die da oben sich das erlauben, dann erlaube ich mir das auch.“

Enthüllungen wie die Paradise Papers könnten dieses Gefühl noch verstärken.

Wieso sind Steueroasen schlecht?

Aber darf man Steueroasen grundsätzlich verteufeln? Die “Neue Zürcher Zeitung” springt jedenfalls für sie in die Bresche: “Offshore-Geschäfte gehören zu einer globalen Welt. Manchmal sind sie notwendig und manchmal Ausdruck von Missständen, kaum je aber deren Ursache”, heißt es.

Den internationalen Steuerwettbewerb anhand einiger missbräuchlicher Beispiele generell als kriminell hinzustellen, sei deshalb fahrlässig.

Die Londoner “Times” meint Offshore-Zentren hätten zwar prinzipiell eine legitime Rolle, würden sie doch “Besitztümer vor dem Zugriff durch Schurkenstaaten schützen.” Meistens, so räumt die britische Zeitung ein, wären sie jedoch dazu da, um Superreichen zu helfen.

Ainsi, si l'iPhone X correspond à l'un des changements les plus radicaux depuis les 10 ans du smartphone phare d'Apple, le fait est que les Galaxy S8 et Note 8 présentent a priori des fonctionnalités similaires. Notamment un écran quasiment intégral (entre 82% et 84% de la face avant, pour les trois modèles) et un système de déverrouillage avec reconnaissance faciale.

Chez Apple, ce dernier mécanisme est vraiment présenté comme l'une des pierres angulaires du nouvel iPhone. A l'inverse, des moyens de déverrouiller son téléphone d'un simple regard existent depuis quelques temps chez Samsung. Mais de manière bien différente. ​​​​​​Le HuffPost a comparé ces différentes technologies pour savoir si l'iPhone X a vraiment un train d'avance... ou de retard sur la concurrence.

3D, 2D ou Iris

Face ID, la technologie dévoilée par Apple avec l'iPhone X en septembre, est présentée comme totalement révolutionnaire. Le système fonctionne avec une caméra TrueDepth qui projette 30.000 points sur le visage et les analyse, créant une ""carte de profondeur"" et une ""image infrarouge"" de notre tête, selon Apple.

Du côté de Samsung, le système de reconnaissance faciale est présent sur le Galaxy S8 depuis mars et sur le Galaxy Note 8 depuis août. Mais ici, pas de caméra 3D, c'est simplement l'appareil photo frontal qui est utilisé.

Elle n'est ainsi pas très sécurisée. Mais depuis l'année dernière et le tristement célèbre Galaxy Note 7, Samsung propose une autre option, plus sûre (mais pas imparable, comme toujours): le scanner d'iris.

Alors, les deux technologies de Samsung font-elles le poids face au Face ID d'Apple? Après une centaine de tests, voici nos résultats.

Rapidité

De manière générale, l'iPhone X se déverrouille un peu plus vite que le Galaxy Note 8, que ce soit avec la reconnaissance de visage ou d'iris. L'écart est parfois assez conséquent, une seconde au lieu de deux en moyenne, mais n'entrave pas l'expérience. Du moins, quand ça fonctionne.

Le seul moment où Samsung égale, voire dépasse, Apple, c'est dans un environnement extérieur, bien ensoleillé. C'est d'ailleurs dans ces conditions que l'iPhone X a le plus souvent échoué à reconnaître le visage.

Taux d'échec

Ici aussi l'iPhone X est un cran au dessus. Il est beaucoup plus fréquent que la reconnaissance faciale du Galaxy Note 8 ne reconnaisse pas de visage, ce qui fait perdre beaucoup de temps.

Le scanner d'iris de Samsung bug beaucoup moins souvent, voire presque jamais. Du moins, quand on le regarde bien en face. Et à la bonne distance.

Regard de biais et discrétion

Sauf que souvent, on ne tient pas son téléphone droit devant soit pour le déverrouiller. Il peut être posé sur notre bureau, un peu excentré. Ou on peut aussi vouloir regarder une notification sans attirer l'attention, en gardant le téléphone sous la table.

A ce petit jeu, si l'iPhone X est encore une fois plus performant, c'est tout de même loin d'être parfait. Quand le téléphone est posé sur le bureau un peu excentré, il est nécessaire de s'en rapprocher pour être relativement en face de l'écran. Rien de bien méchant, mais c'est tout de même moins pratique que la reconnaissance d'empreinte digitale.

Du côté du Galaxy Note 8, le problème est le même. Il est d'ailleurs préférable de se mettre vraiment au dessus du smartphone pour être sûr que l'appareil se déverrouille. Et c'est encore pire avec le scanner d'iris, avec lequel il faut vraiment regarder le capteur infrarouge ""les yeux dans les yeux"".

Dans le noir

Dans une pièce un peu sombre, pas de problème en général. Par contre, si vous voulez déverrouiller votre téléphone en pleine nuit, il ne faut pas compter sur la reconnaissance faciale de Samsung. A l'inverse, le scanner d'iris, tout comme l'iPhone X, fonctionnent bien dans le noir.

Verdict

Apple affirme que son Face ID est un véritable concentré de technologie et n'a pas tort. Il est rare de le voir buguer. De plus, le système est sensé apprendre avec le temps, pour continuer à vous reconnaître si vous vous laissez pousser la barbe, changez de coupe de cheveux, etc.

Et tant mieux pour Apple. Car si la reconnaissance faciale et le scanner d'iris de Samsung ne sont pas parfaits, ce ne sont heureusement pas les seules options. Le déverrouillage par empreinte digitale reste disponible.

A l'inverse, sur l'iPhone X, seul Face ID fait foi. A moins de vouloir revenir au bon vieux code secret.

They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.
""Koalas can be found throughout Queensland, down to New South Wales and Victoria and South Australia.
They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.
""Australia has a big issue -- Australia is wiping out its mammals faster than any other country on earth.","Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any worse, here comes the news that we are killing off our koalas.

Once widespread across Australia, the past 20 years has seen koala numbers decline dramatically, for some populations by as much as 80 percent.

""Yes, the dear old fluffy koala is suffering along with our other species quite badly,"" Ian Darbyshire, CEO of the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife told HuffPost Australia.

""In the past five years, we have seen the population go from about 100,000 to 40,000. At this rate, they will be extinct by 2040.""

So what is causing this rapid decline? And what can we do to reverse it?

""There are a lot of different factors, but habitat loss is the main cause,"" Darbyshire said. ""If you look at south east Queensland and northern New South Wales, you've got Brisbane, which is expanding, and the Gold Coast which is expanding. With these developments comes a loss of habitat for koalas.

""Furthermore, you get habitat loss breaking down the connectivity between trees, so quite often these days you'll see koalas crossing the road. When they are down on the ground, that's when they are vulnerable, not only from traffic but also from dogs.""

Koalas are having to travel further for food.

Darbyshire said a fragmentation of koala population has also led to further problems for the marsupials.

""You can drive around the country and see koalas, they are widespread but local,"" he said. ""And their population is fragmented now. That leads to inbreeding, disease and stress.

""We are seeing Chlamydia become a real issue and that's because the population is getting stressed. And tragically, Chlamydia affects their ability to breed and they can also lose their sight.

""It's tragic because the koala is a national icon, it's a very important economic contributor for Australia's tourism and they are heading towards being vulnerable.""

Large scale fires are another serious problem.

Other issues koalas are facing include large scale fires and climate change, both of which can result in koalas forcing to relocate, which is actually problematic in itself.

""It's not easy to relocate koalas as they tend to be quite choosy about the trees they'll eat. They have to have flora that's developed to the area they are in. You can't just take from one area to another. You have to make sure you introduce the right bacteria into their gut,"" he said.

""Males are very territorial as well, and as food gets scarce a male might roam several kilometers. You can't then just stick another male in his territory. You really have to understand what you are doing.""

In terms of what you can do to help, Darbyshire said it all starts with education.

""I think the public needs a fair bit of education and support to understand they do need help. We need actions from individuals to make sure they have koala-friendly fences, that they have their dogs under control. If you see one on the road, help it across. We should be doing more to help them,"" he said.

A koala can't live anywhere else on earth. They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.

If you're in an area where koalas can be found, Darbyshire encouraged you to leave water out for them on hot days and also to make it easy for koala to travel from yard to yard.

""Lean a pole on your fence or plant a tree so koalas can navigate backyards,"" he said. ""They are having to travel further for food, which sees them [forced to navigate suburban areas] and puts them in the path of dogs.

""Koalas can be found throughout Queensland, down to New South Wales and Victoria and South Australia. So if you live in these areas, think about planting the right trees, giving them connectivity from tree to tree, controlling the burn, keeping the vegetation for them... it all helps.

""Or make a donation to us and we'll help them for you.

""A koala can't live anywhere else on earth. They are animals unique to Australia, and they can't adapt as fast as we are changing the environment around them.

""They can only have one young a year and have to be about three years old until they can have one. We are moving much faster than they are.

""Australia has a big issue -- Australia is wiping out its mammals faster than any other country on earth. We need lots of help for our native species. Talking about the koala helps because it's iconic. It's the cute cuddly Aussie.

Ein Mann hat Geiseln im Jugendamt von Pfaffenhofen genommen

Medienberichten zufolge soll der Hintergrund ein Sorgerechtsstreit sein

Die Geiselnahme im Jugendamt in des Landkreises Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm hat die Polizei beendet. Ein 28-jähriger Mann, der eine Sachbearbeiterin über Stunden in seiner Gewalt hatte, sei festgenommen worden, sagte ein Sprecher am Montag. Ein Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) nutzte nach den Angaben einen günstigen Moment, um den Mann zu überwältigen.

Der Geiselnehmer hatte sich gegen 8.30 Uhr mit der Sachbearbeiterin am Jugendamt des oberbayerischen Landkreises verbarrikadiert. Er bedrohte die 31-Jährige mit einem Messer mit zehn Zentimeter langer Klinge. Die Frau erlitt eine Schnittwunde am Oberkörper. Ob er weitere Waffen bei sich hatte, war zunächst unklar.

Polizei: ""Der Täter spricht mit uns""

Das Gebäude in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft des Landratsamtes in Pfaffenhofen war am Morgen kurz nach der Geiselnahme geräumt worden. Danach befanden sich lediglich Opfer und Täter in dem Haus, erläuterte der Sprecher.

Es begann ein stundenlanger Nervenkrieg: Die Polizei war mit einem Großaufgebot vor Ort. Auch mehrere Krankenwagen und Ärzte sowie Sanitäter wurden zum Tatort geschickt.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Geiselnahme in dem Jugendamt baten die Ermittler darum, keine Bilder oder Videos vom Tatort zu verbreiten. Solche Bilder im Netz könnten dem Täter helfen, twitterte die Polizei.

Bitte unterstützt uns bei unserer Arbeit in #Pfaffenhofen und verbreitet KEINE Bilder, Videos etc. Ihr helft damit dem Täter. — Polizei Oberbayern N (@polizeiOBN) 6. November 2017

Unterdessen nahm die Verhandlungsgruppe telefonisch Kontakt mit dem Geiselnehmer auf. Die speziell für Geiselnahmen geschulten Beamten versuchten, deeskalierend auf den Mann einzuwirken.

Als die Frau darum bat, dass ein Arzt gerufen wird, griff das SEK zu und überwältigte den 28-Jährigen. Es kam dabei nicht zu einem Schusswaffeneinsatz.

Die 31-jährige Sachbearbeiterin war nach den Angaben psychisch stabil. Sie habe lediglich eine leichte Schürfwunde. Es könne derzeit nicht eingeordnet werden, woher die Verletzung rührt.

Wieso es keine Bilder vom Ort der Geiselnahme geben soll

Das Opfer sei zwar psychisch angegriffen, körperlich aber nicht schwer verletzt, teilte die Polizei weiter mit. Auch der mutmaßliche Täter sei weitgehend unverletzt.

Alla direzione di Mdp, che si riunisce a Roma, sarà approvato un corposo documento. Huffpost è in grado di anticipare. Non è il classico papiro che si approva al termine di riunioni fiume, ma qualcosa di più. La base politico programmatica della ""nuova sinistra"" che prenderà forma di qui a inizio dicembre. È stato già discusso, riservatamente, con le altre forze, da Civati a Fratoianni fino a Montanari e la cosiddetta sinistra del Brancaccio (e questa è una novità). E nei prossimi giorni ognuno dei soci fondatori della nuova casa comune lo approverà a casa propria.

Il voto siciliano, non esaltante neanche per la sinistra che di fatto prende unita quanto la somma di Fava e Italia dei Valori che correvano insieme la volta scorsa, impone un timing serrato, dopo mesi di attese e dibatti politicisti. Ora che il leader c'è, si prevede una serie di appuntamenti pubblici.

Mdp convocherà una serie di assembleee provinciali, di qui al 19 novembre, giorno in cui si terrà una assemblea nazionale. L'evento fondativo del nuovo soggetto invece è previsto per l'inizio di dicembre - è stata ipotizzata la data del 2 - o comunque ""compatibilmente con le esigenze di carattere istituzionale"", quando cioè Grasso, che sarà incoronato leader, avrà smesso di esercitare il ruolo di arbitro a palazzo Madama e sarà più libero di parlare e costruire quella""nuova sinistra"" che viene tratteggiata nel documento. Documento che, prima della stampa definitiva, è stato letto e riletto da tutti i protagonisti di questa storia. Proprio tutti.

UNA NUOVA PROPOSTA, LEGGI IL DOCUMENTO

Ci impegniamo a partecipare insieme alle prossime elezioni politiche, con una proposta che punti a cambiare la vita delle persone e restituire speranza a milioni di cittadine e cittadini che oggi non si sentono più rappresentati.

Intendiamo costruire un progetto credibile solido e autonomo, che punti a riconnettere sinistra e società, per ribaltare rapporti di forza sempre più favorevoli alla destra in tutte le sue articolazioni.

Ci rivolgiamo a tutte le esperienze del civismo, a chi lavora quotidianamente nell'associazionismo, alle forze organizzate del mondo del lavoro, ma soprattutto a tutte le donne e gli uomini trascinati in basso dalla crisi, che hanno bisogno di una politica diversa per risollevarsi; ai tanti portatori di competenze che non trovano occasione per metterla in pratica, a coloro che ce l'hanno fatta ma non si rassegnano a una condizione diversa di tanti.

La nostra sfida ha un'ambizione alta: partire da un contesto sociale disgregato e diviso e proporci, attraverso le linee del nostro programma, un chiaro indirizzo di governo, coerente, trasparente e credibile. Sta qui il senso dell'utilità per il Paese del voto che chiediamo contro ogni trasformismo e ogni alleanza innaturale.

L'avanzata di forze regressive e xenofobe in molti Paesi europei può essere arrestata non da piccole o grandi coalizioni a difesa dell'establishment e di un ordine sociale ormai insostenibile, ma solo da una grande alleanza civica e di sinistra, che ristabilisca la centralità del valore universale dell'eguaglianza.

La crescita delle diseguaglianze è oggi principale fattore di crisi dei sistemi democratici.

La lunga crisi, prodotta dai guasti del capitalismo finanziario e acuita in Europa da un processo di integrazione egemonizzato dal neoliberismo, ha enormemente accresciuto le diseguaglianze, ha svalutato il lavoro e compresso i suoi diritti, ha costretto alla chiusura di tante aziende e tante piccole e medie attività, ha condannato i giovani a una disoccupazione di massa e una precarietà endemica, ha piegato e svuotato l'istruzione, la sanità e la previdenza pubbliche, ha colpito il ceto medio e ha allargato l'area di povertà e insicurezza sociale.

Il progetto politico a cui vogliamo dar vita nasce per contrastare queste tendenze, riaffermando l'attualità e la modernità del modello sociale ed economico disegnato dalla nostra Carta Costituzionale.

Non regge più il modello di sviluppo basato su alti livelli di inquinamento, su uno spreco insostenibile di materie prime e di consumo del territorio. Vogliamo con la nostra lista essere parte integrante di quel movimento ambientalista che in tutto il mondo si batte per avviare un'ambiziosa transizione verso una ''economia circolare"", per fermare i cambiamenti climatici riconvertire ecologicamente l'economia, liberarsi dalla dipendenza dei combustibili fossili, affermare nuovi modelli di consumo, raggiungere l'obiettivo di rifiuti zero, garantire la sicurezza alimentare e gli approvvigionamenti idrici.

Vogliamo riportare il lavoro e la sua dignità al centro della società.

Il lungo ciclo della precarizzazione, contrariamente alle promesse liberiste, ha bloccato la crescita della produttività, ha compresso i salari, ha accresciuto la disoccupazione, ha dequalificato una parte importante del nostro apparato produttivo. Oggi siamo il Paese con il lavoro più precario d'Europa, e con il più alto tasso di disoccupazione giovanile.

Per questo crediamo si debba cominciare restituendo ai lavoratori i diritti sottratti, con la legge sul Jobs Act, che va cancellata, e un'età di accesso al pensionamento in linea con quella dei paesi europei. E diversa secondo il grado di gravosità dei lavori.

La più grande ingiustizia che vogliamo debellare è la condizione di precarietà e di infelicità nella quale sono costretti a vivere milioni di nostri giovani. Non c'è un grande futuro per l'Italia se non si garantisce a loro una prospettiva radicalmente diversa di vita.

Non sono più tollerabili discriminazioni salariali che violano gravemente leggi e principi costituzionali. Ci batteremo per riaffermare un fondamentale principio di giustizia sociale negato in tante parti d'Italia: allo stesso lavoro deve corrispondere la stessa contribuzione tra uomini e donne.

L'attacco all'autonomia e alla qualità della scuola e dell'università pubblica è parte dello stesso disegno di disgregazione delle condizioni di uguaglianza.

L'indebolimento dell'istruzione quale presidio dello spirito critico e fattore di mobilità sociale è stato infatti il corollario indispensabile delle 'riforme' volte a rendere il lavoro più precario, ricattabile e sottopagato, minandone la funzione costituzionale di fondamento della cittadinanza democratica.

Vogliamo mettere in campo una diversa idea di scuola, cominciando da un piano di rifinanziamento dell'istruzione pubblica che la porti finalmente ad avere risorse pari a quelle previste nei paesi più avanzati.

Lo stesso deve essere fatto per Universitá e ricerca, umiliate da anni di tagli insostenibili.

Bisogna ricostruire il sistema di tutela del patrimonio culturale smantellato dalle ultime riforme, puntando sulla produzione e la redistribuzione della conoscenza. Vogliamo una cultura che formi cittadini sovrani e non consumatori o clienti.

Ci battiamo per il rilancio del welfare pubblico universalistico, a partire dalla sanità, che deve essere garantita contro processi striscianti di privatizzazione e messa in condizione di rispondere alle sfide aperte dai nuovi farmaci e dalle biotecnologie, da rendere accessibili per tutti.

Vogliamo lanciare un grande piano di lavoro e investimenti pubblici, da cui far passare il rilancio del welfare e la messa in sicurezza del territorio, delle scuole, delle case. Bisogna superare la logica delle Grandi Opere, del consumo di suolo e dello Sblocca Italia: l'unica grande opera utile è la messa in sicurezza del territorio.

Senza gli investimenti pubblici che l'Italia non è in grado di crescere più rapidamente e di creare occupazione stabile e di qualità.

E' nel Sud che bisogna concentrare una quota nettamente più rilevante di investimenti pubblici e privati per fare ripartire l'Italia, conducendo una lotta senza quartiere a mafia e camorra.

L'obiettivo imprescindibile della piena occupazione dipende infatti anche dalla riattivazione di forme di intervento pubblico nell'economia, che mettano finalmente l'ambiente e il clima al centro della politica e del modello di sviluppo del Paese.

Tutto questo sarà possibile se sapremo ripristinare un sistema di reale equità e progressività fiscale (come previsto dall'articolo 53 della Costituzione), capace di spostare il prelievo dal lavoro alle rendite e ai grandi patrimoni, nonché avviare una lotta senza quartiere all'evasione di chi ha di più, a partire dalle grandi multinazionali ai paradisi fiscali: la custodia dell'ambiente diventa infatti il vero tratto distintivo di una rinnovata visione progressista.

La riaffermazione di diritti sociali primari va di pari passo con una nuova stagione di avanzamenti sul terreno dei diritti civili e di libertà che partano dallo jus soli, il testamento biologico e poi si estendano agli altri diritti .

Sentiamo il dovere imprescindibile di garantire un'accoglienza degna a chi cerca in Europa una vita migliore, sfuggendo a regimi sanguinari o alla disperazione della fame.

Il ripudio della guerra, il rilancio del multilateralismo e della cooperazione internazionale sono l'altro lato della medaglia e la bussola di un nuovo ruolo dell'Europa nel mondo globale, in un quadro ancora drammaticamente segnato da conflitti, terrorismo e grandi fenomeni migratori. Senza l'Europa i singoli stati nazionali sarebbero condannati ad una crescente irrilevanza nel nuovo scenario mondiale. L'Europa può svolgere un ruolo importante nel mondo e tornare ad essere fattore di sviluppo e benessere, solo se cambia radicalmente mettendo in soffitta odiose politiche di austerità, sorrette da una miope governance intergovernativa. Serve un'Europa pienamente in sintonia con i principi fondamentali della nostra Costituzione, più democratica, più sociale e meno condizionata dagli egoismi nazionali.

La piena affermazione a tutti i livelli della pari dignità individuale e sociale delle donne è un pilastro del nostro progetto di attuazione integrale della Costituzione repubblicana e del suo cuore pulsante, l'articolo 3.

Va combattuta senza tregua ogni forma di violenza sulle donne.

Vogliamo, in definitiva, ricostruire lo Stato, avvicinare istituzioni e cittadini, restituire i comuni alla pienezza delle proprie funzioni di primo raccordo tra i bisogni delle comunità e i doveri di chi amministra il bene pubblico. Raccogliamo il grido dall'arme dei sindaci italiani che chiedono una svolta nelle politiche verso le città. Dobbiamo garantire sicurezza a tutti senza erigere muri. Occorre ritrovare una politica più responsabile, più progettuale, più sobria nei comportamenti e onesta anche intellettualmente.

Per fare tutto questo e molto altro crediamo si debba aprire una stagione discussione e di partecipazione dal basso, a cui affidare il progetto, il percorso e la scelta delle persone.

Per questo è il momento di costruire un grande spazio pubblico, aperto, trasparente plurale e inclusivo; un luogo che non sia il terreno di contesa tra progetti ambigui e incompatibili tra loro, ma il laboratorio di una proposta davvero innovativa e coraggiosa.

Il cambiamento e l'alternativa rispetto alle politiche degli ultimi anni sono la cifra fondamentale di questo progetto, il cui obiettivo è dare sostanza ai valori di eguaglianza, inclusione, giustizia sociale.

Con questo spirito ci impegniamo a costruire una lista comune alle prossime elezioni politiche: una lista che appartenga a tutte e tutti quelli che vorranno partecipare, insieme e nessuno escluso, e che si riconoscano nelle proposte e valori del nostro programma.","Direzione Mdp, partita la road map a sinistra",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/07/direzione-mdp-partita-la-road-map-a-sinistra_a_23268997/?utm_hp_ref=it-homepage

North Korea recently called for a halt to the brutal sanctions against the country stating they constituted ""genocide."" Several rounds of sanctions have been imposed on Pyongyang after the regime failed to stop its nuclearization program despite the United Nations Security Council's (UNSC) countless warnings to do so.

""Today the U.S.-led racket of brutal sanctions and pressure against the DPRK constitutes contemporary human rights violation and genocide,"" the North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva said in a statement according to the New York Times. The sanctions regime ""threatens and impedes the enjoyment by the people of DPRK of their human rights in all sectors,"" it said.

The call to end the sanctions comes as U.S. President Donald Trump starts his 13-day trip to Asia where he will hold talks with China, South Korea and Japan. Focusing on both the economy and the Korean threat, President Trump will definitely call on his partners to impose more pressure on Pyongyang and its nuclear program.

Even NATO has issued a statement on the North Korean nuclear weapon program's threat. Pyongyang has some serious nerve calling the UN sanctions a ""genocide"" considering the number of human rights violations that occur on a daily basis throughout the country. More than 16 waves of sanctions have been adopted by the United Nations Security Council since 2006 under resolution 1718.

If Kim Jong-un is so concerned for his country, maybe he should shift all the money invested in developing nuclear weapons to his people's welfare.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un claps during a celebration for nuclear scientists and engineers who contributed to a hydrogen bomb test, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on Sept. 10, 2017.

Adding to that, Pyongyang's hydrogen bomb test conducted on Sept. 3 pushed the country further into isolation when China did not veto the latest rounds of sanctions.

China has said it will strictly enforce UN Security Council sanctions banning imports of North Korean coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North.

The North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva issued a statement saying the sanctions imposed have ""blocked the delivery of medical equipment and medicines"" destined to children and mothers in the country.

""All types of anti-human rights and inhumane sanctions against the DPRK should be terminated immediately and thoroughly,"" the statement said.

What amazes me is that despite having issues receiving vital medical equipment for its population, Kim Jong-un has been threatening the United Nations with a possible nuclear war instead of calling for a stop to his country's nuclearization, which would allow the international community to come to its aid.

North Korea is even planning an atmospheric hydrogen bomb test instead of focusing on its population's welfare. By doing so, Pyongyang and its regime are trying to gain the international community's pity while working behind their back to build nuclear weapons capable of killing millions.

Until North Korea stop its nuclear weapon development program and commit human rights abuses such as sending people into forced labour, I do not believe the international community will cease or at least ease the sanctions unilaterally approved by the UNSC.

In the meantime, Pyongyang will continue to be a threat to the international community by continuing nuclear weapons tests and challenging both South Korea and Japan.

“Thor: Ragnarok” is full of a Hela lot of surprises. Yeah, the twist that Cate Blanchett’s character, Hela, was Thor’s sister got out before the movie premiered on Friday, and Mark Ruffalo accidentally live-streamed the movie at an early screening, but many of the film’s secrets remain intact, including some major cameos. Warning: “Thor: Ragnarok” spoilers below! After Thor (Chris Hemsworth) gets back to Asgard, where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been ruling in an Odin (Anthony Hopkins) disguise after secretly exiling the real Odin, Thor witnesses a play honoring Loki’s “death,” which happened in “Thor: The Dark World.” (Don’t worry. The dude wasn’t really dead.)

In the play scenes, Thor is played by Luke Hemsworth, Chris’ older brother; Odin is played by Dr. Grant himself, Sam Neill; and Loki is played by Matt Damon wearing a ridiculous Loki wig. Director Taika Waititi told HuffPost the Damon cameo really happened because he’s good friends with Chris. “It was like an homage to the previous films but also being a bit more irreverent, being able to poke fun at ourselves,” he said in reference to the play scene. “Chris is very good at that. He has great self-deprecating humor.”

Steve Granitz via Getty Images Luciana Barroso and Matt Damon at the ""Thor: Ragnarok"" premiere Oct. 10.

The director said the play was planned as an in-joke for everyone who saw “Thor: The Dark World,” adding, “We shot everything the same size and the same angle and we basically copied the entire death scene from that movie.” For those who haven’t seen the previous “Thor” film, Waititi says it is still an “interesting piece of story” that helps set up Loki’s storyline. As far as the other surprises in the movie, you should probably just see them for yourself. Marvel has gone to great lengths to keep them quiet. Even the trailers were digitally altered from the final film to hide plot points. “When we came out with our first trailer, there were a few stories in we weren’t sure if we wanted in the film or not,” said Waititi. The director said they just “wanted to make a cool trailer,” but promotion “shouldn’t necessarily be just showing shots from the finished movie.” Get ready for some moments that’ll Ragna-rock your world.

The couple, who are from Australia, started looking at wedding magazines, but were left “uninspired” by the lack of diversity and representation in the existing publications. “I guess what most people would call ‘traditional’, I would call ‘heteronormative’,” Tara told HuffPost UK.

Pinterest CLOSE ″There was a bride and a groom, women met men at the altar, men wore a suit, women wore a dress… We don’t identify as fitting into that idea, the world is full of people that identify as shades of grey rather than black or white.”

Dancing With Her Tara Baker (L) and Arlia Hassel, who co-founded 'Dancing With Her'.

So they decided to launch a long-overdue alternative. “Two-bride weddings aren’t featured in wedding magazines all that often, and we know that finding inspiration we could picture ourselves in was something that was important to us,” Tara said. “We also get the opportunity to share practical advice that is appropriate to LGBTQ+ weddings, like how to get yourself down the aisle, the legalities surrounding same-sex marriage and how to navigate the tradition of changing your last name.”

Beatrice Glenister One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

The launch of the magazine is incredibly timely, with the country holding a same-sex marriage referendum. The results of which will be revealed on 15 November. Currently same-sex couples can register their relationship as a civil union but this does not carry the same legal status as a marriage. Tara explains that many couples they’ve worked with choose to travel overseas and marry abroad, although these marriages are not currently recognised when couples return to Australian soil. For newly-engaged Tara and Arlia, who plan to marry in next year, the referendum result is incredibly personal. “We hope that when we wed in a small ceremony in August 2018, the Australian government will recognise our union as a legal marriage. If not, we haven’t considered registering our relationship with our state,” Tania explained. The couple have their sights set on a wedding in the Gold Coast Hinterland. “It’ll be an intimate, romantic affair with 20 of our closest friends and family. Nothing over the top, simple and romantic is what we will be going for on the day.”

Sarah Kennedy One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

Tara and Arlia have been involved in the ‘yes’ campaign, and are hopeful for the results. “We have our fingers (and toes) crossed that it will come in a resounding yes. In my heart, I feel that will be the way it goes… I have hope that the Australian population will vote in favour of equal love and human rights.” Tara describes the lead up to the referendum as an “emotional rollercoaster”, but that they have never felt closer to the LGBTQ community. “We can’t wait for a day where it isn’t assumed that our partner is of the opposite sex, or feel judged when we declare that the one we love is the same-sex.”

Jessie Dains One of the real-life weddings featured in the magazine.

‘Dancing With Her’ began as an Instagram account and blog in 2016, before launching as a downloadable digital magazine in February 2017. A print magazine was a “natural progression” but also inspired by the couple’s own engagement and first-hand experience at the lack of appropriate resource. The magazine will be a quarterly publication that can be pre-ordered and delivered internationally. Volume Two is already in early stages of production. When asked why a publication such as this hadn’t been published sooner, Tara replied: “Honestly, we have no idea! Some countries have had legal marriages between same-sex couples for nearly 15 years. “We initially knew the Australian community needed a publication like this but was quick to realise women across the world who felt the same way.”

Ein Mann hat Geiseln im Jugendamt von Pfaffenhofen genommen

Medienberichten zufolge soll der Hintergrund ein Sorgerechtsstreit sein

Die Geiselnahme im Jugendamt in des Landkreises Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm hat die Polizei beendet. Ein 28-jähriger Mann, der eine Sachbearbeiterin über Stunden in seiner Gewalt hatte, sei festgenommen worden, sagte ein Sprecher am Montag. Ein Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) nutzte nach den Angaben einen günstigen Moment, um den Mann zu überwältigen.

Der Geiselnehmer hatte sich gegen 8.30 Uhr mit der Sachbearbeiterin am Jugendamt des oberbayerischen Landkreises verbarrikadiert. Er bedrohte die 31-Jährige mit einem Messer mit zehn Zentimeter langer Klinge. Die Frau erlitt eine Schnittwunde am Oberkörper. Ob er weitere Waffen bei sich hatte, war zunächst unklar.

Polizei: ""Der Täter spricht mit uns""

Das Gebäude in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft des Landratsamtes in Pfaffenhofen war am Morgen kurz nach der Geiselnahme geräumt worden. Danach befanden sich lediglich Opfer und Täter in dem Haus, erläuterte der Sprecher.

Es begann ein stundenlanger Nervenkrieg: Die Polizei war mit einem Großaufgebot vor Ort. Auch mehrere Krankenwagen und Ärzte sowie Sanitäter wurden zum Tatort geschickt.

Im Zusammenhang mit der Geiselnahme in dem Jugendamt baten die Ermittler darum, keine Bilder oder Videos vom Tatort zu verbreiten. Solche Bilder im Netz könnten dem Täter helfen, twitterte die Polizei.

Bitte unterstützt uns bei unserer Arbeit in #Pfaffenhofen und verbreitet KEINE Bilder, Videos etc. Ihr helft damit dem Täter. — Polizei Oberbayern N (@polizeiOBN) 6. November 2017

Unterdessen nahm die Verhandlungsgruppe telefonisch Kontakt mit dem Geiselnehmer auf. Die speziell für Geiselnahmen geschulten Beamten versuchten, deeskalierend auf den Mann einzuwirken.

Als die Frau darum bat, dass ein Arzt gerufen wird, griff das SEK zu und überwältigte den 28-Jährigen. Es kam dabei nicht zu einem Schusswaffeneinsatz.

Die 31-jährige Sachbearbeiterin war nach den Angaben psychisch stabil. Sie habe lediglich eine leichte Schürfwunde. Es könne derzeit nicht eingeordnet werden, woher die Verletzung rührt.

Wieso es keine Bilder vom Ort der Geiselnahme geben soll

Das Opfer sei zwar psychisch angegriffen, körperlich aber nicht schwer verletzt, teilte die Polizei weiter mit. Auch der mutmaßliche Täter sei weitgehend unverletzt.

Nirbhaya's younger brother is flying high, literally. He has joined a private airline after completing his commercial pilot training and his parents cannot stop thanking Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for making it possible.

Badrinath Singh told IANS that the Congress leader helped the grief-stricken family in ""every way possible he could"" after his 23-year-old daughter was brutally gang raped on December 16, 2012 that led to her death 13 days later.

The father of Indian gangrape victim 'Nirbhaya' addresses media representatives as he leaves The Supreme Court in New Delhi on May 5, 2017.

""My son (he refused to name him) is now a pilot. He completed his training recently. He has joined IndiGo Airlines and is already flying planes. And it is true it was possible because of Rahul Gandhi,"" said Singh, who works at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here.

He said his son after completing his Class 12 got admitted to the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi, a government-founded autonomous institute in Rae Bareli – the Lok Sabha constituency of Rahul Gandhi's mother and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

""Rahul Gandhi made it possible. He looked after us after the incident,"" the father said, referring to the December 16 night when his daughter was brutally gang-raped.

""He (Gandhi) helped us emotionally. He helped us in many ways. He helped us monetarily. Otherwise, you can understand how was it possible for us to make our son a pilot.""

""He used to tell us he was not doing it for his politics. It was purely on humanitarian basis. He used to tell us not to speak to the media.""

Singh said many came to help the family initially, but ""it was Gandhi who stood by us always and had strictly told us to keep it a secret"".

""He used to tell us he was not doing it for his politics. It was purely on humanitarian basis. He used to tell us not to speak to the media,"" Singh said, adding that he too has nothing to do with Gandhi's politics, ""but the truth remains the truth, and we cannot thank him enough"".

He said the Congress leader used to counsel his son regularly and motivated him to do something good in his life and support the family.

""He suggested to him to pursue a pilots training course and got him admitted to the Uran Akademi in Rae Bareli... The incident left a permanent scar but Gandhi came like an angel. Whatever the politics, but he has been an angel to us.""

""He suggested to him to pursue a pilots training course and got him admitted to the Uran Akademi in Rae Bareli,"" Singh said.

Mother and father of Nirbhaya, the victim of a fatal gang-rape in a moving bus on December 16, 2012.

Singh's another son is studying engineering in Pune.

On December 16, 2012, as Nirbhaya and her male friend waited at a bus stop in Munirka, after watching a late night show of ""Life of Pi"" at a theatre there, a chartered bus stopped by. The two were unsuspecting of the bestial motives of the six males, including a minor, on board who offered to drop them to their destination.

The young woman's friend was knocked down with an iron rod while Nirbhaya was raped by the five men and the teenaged youth on the moving bus. The two were flung, bleeding by a roadside. The brutality of the rape and the woman's death in a Singapore hospital on December 29 sparked off nationwide protests.

""The incident left a permanent scar but Gandhi came like an angel. Whatever the politics, but he has been an angel to us,"" said the father.

Asked if he had flown with his son, Singh said: ""Not as of now.

엘리자베스 2세 영국 여왕이 개인 회사를 통해 조세회피처에 거액을 투자 형태로 보관중인 사실이 확인됐다. 그밖에도 쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리, 윌버 로스 미국 상무장관, 렉스 틸러슨 국무장관, 재러드 쿠슈너 백악관 선임고문 같은 고위 정치인·정부 관계자들은 물론, U2 리드싱어 보노, 마돈나 같은 연예인들도 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루된 것으로 나타났다.

페이스북, 애플, 마이크로소프트, 나이키, 우버, 이베이, 맥도날드, 지멘스, 알리안츠 등 다국적 기업들도 목록에 포함됐다. 한국인 200여명과 한국인이 세운 법인 90여개도 있었다.





'파라다이스 페이퍼스'



What are the Paradise Papers? - The Guardian

이같은 사실은 5일(현지시각) 공개된 '파라다이스 페이퍼(Paradise Papers)'로 세상에 모습을 드러냈다. 1300만개가 넘는 파일로 이뤄진 이 방대한 유출 문건에는 세계 유명 인사와 기업들이 해외 조세피난처와 다국적 기업 등을 활용해 조세를 회피해 온 정황이 자세하게 담겨있다. 지난해 4월 공개됐던 '파나마 페이퍼스'와 유사하다.

유출된 문서 대부분은 버뮤다에 위치한 법률 자문회사 '애플비(Appleby)'에서 나왔다. 애플비는 전세계 조세도피처에 사무실을 두고 고객들에게 페이퍼컴퍼티 설립 등을 통한 조세 회피, 재산 은닉 등을 자문해왔다.

지난해 '파나마 페이퍼스'에 이어 이번에도 문건을 입수한 독일 일간지 '쥐트도이체차이퉁'은 국제탐사보도언론인협회(ICIJ)에 도움을 요청했다. 이에 따라 미국 뉴욕타임스, 영국 가디언, BBC 등 전 세계 언론사(67개국, 96개 언론사, 382명)들의 국제 공조 취재로 그 내용이 드러나게 됐다. 한국에서는 뉴스타파가 이 작업에 참여했다.

""지난 6개월 동안 방대한 데이터를 일일이 분석했다""는 뉴스타파에 따르면, 유출된 자료는 1950년~2016년 기간에 생산된 1343만여건(1.4TB)에 달한다.

물론 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루됐다는 것만으로 모두 '불법'이라고 단정할 수는 없다. 다만 통상 세금을 회피하기 위한 목적임이 분명한 경우가 많고 '검은 거래'를 숨기려는 의도로 조세회피처를 활용하는 사례가 상당하다. 도덕적 책임은 물론, 때에 따라서는 법적 책임을 피할 수 없게 될 가능성도 있다는 뜻이다.





등장인물들

각 언론사들은 분석 결과를 바탕으로 자료에 담긴 내용들을 보도하고 있다. 이 중 현재까지 주목할 만한 내용 중 하나는 바로 영국 여왕 엘리자베스 2세의 조세회피 의혹이다. 이전에는 한 번도 알려지지 않았던 내용이다.

가디언에 따르면, 엘리자베스 여왕은 캐이맨제도와 버뮤다에 개인 자산 약 1000만파운드(약 145억원)를 역외 투자 형태로 보관중인 것으로 나타났다.

이 과정에는 여왕의 자산을 관리하는 '랭커스터공국(Duchy of Lancaster·DL)'이 동원됐다. DL은 영국 최대 가전·생활용품 임대 전문 소매점 '브라이트하우스' 등에 펀드 형태로 투자를 하고 있는 것으로 나타났다.

왕실 측은 이같은 투자로 세금을 회피한 사실이 없다고 해명했다. 그러나 가디언은 왕실의 재정 운영 상황을 보다 투명하게 공개하라는 요구가 다시 빗발칠 가능성이 높다고 전했다.

쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리도 간접적으로 등장한다. 정치자금 모금을 담당한 최측근인 스티븐 브론프맨이 가족 투자기업을 통해 캐이맨제도와 이스라엘, 미국 등에 복잡한 법인 거래 관계를 설립해뒀다는 것. 가디언은 이 법인들 사이의 거래를 통해 그가 '합법적'으로 세금을 회피했을 가능성이 있다고 전했다.

윌버 로스 미국 상무장관 등 트럼프 정부 고위 관계자들의 이름도 다수 등장한다. 특히 로스 장관은 푸틴의 사위인 키릴 샤말로프와 러시아 기업인들이 공동으로 소유한 에너지기업 '시부르'와 계약을 맺었던 것으로 드러났다. 여기에는 미국 정부가 제재 대상으로 분류한 이들도 포함되어 있다.

그밖에도 U2의 보노가 몰타를 경유해 리투아니아의 대형 쇼핑몰을 비밀리에 소유하고 있던 사실 등이 드러났다.

한편 뉴스타파는 ""현재까지 한국인 232명의 이름을 찾아냈다""고 전했다. 또 ""이들 한국인이 조세도피처에 세운 법인은 모두 90개로 나타났""으며, ""코스닥 상장기업같은 중견업체부터 가스공사같은 공기업, 그리고 재벌기업도 적지 않게 발견됐다""고 덧붙였다.

sRefugee advocates have hijacked Melbourne Cup day, scaling a crane at Flemington and driving a car onto train tracks leading to the race course in high-profile protests over the treatment of asylum seekers on Manus Island.

Two women, said to be ""a qualified rope access technician and a qualified arborist"", climbed a large crane at the race course and unfurled large banners reading 'EVACUATE MANUS NOW'.

""We are joining with others across Australia to demand that the government evacuate the men on Manus immediately and bring them to safety for processing,"" WACA spokesperson Charlotte Lynch said in a statement.

""This is an emergency. This is an humanitarian crisis. We refuse to sit by whilst the Government, with the complicity of the Labor Party, puts over 600 men's lives at risk.""

Elsewhere, a car spraypainted with pro-refugee slogans was driven onto train tracks at Ascot Vale, blocking services headed toward Flemington. A 7 News reporter tweeted that police had arrested one man at the scene.

Melbourne Trains has advised customers of ""Delays over 60 minutes due to a motor vehicle stopped across rail lines at the Ascot Vale level crossing"".

In other parts of Melbourne, numerous banners have been erected reading 'Sanction Australia'.

Eppure, oggi più che mai si sente il bisogno di un vero e serio insegnamento di quella che continuerò a chiamare educazione civica.

E con questo torno a un tema caro a Emma Bonino e – di conseguenza – a quello che dovrebbe proporsi il nascente movimento politico europeista in materia di educazione civica.","Nel 1958 Aldo Moro, ministro della Pubblica Istruzione, introdusse l'insegnamento dell'educazione civica nelle scuole medie e superiori: due ore al mese obbligatorie, affidate al professore di storia, senza valutazione.

La sua decisione ebbe pochissimo seguito, come può testimoniare chi ha studiato negli anni Sessanta e nei seguenti.

Dall'anno scolastico 2010/2011 – dopo una serie infinita di riforme o tentativi di riforma - si è passati al nome ""Cittadinanza e costituzione"", che comprende cinque argomenti: educazione ambientale, educazione stradale , educazione sanitaria, educazione alimentare, Costituzione italiana: con due ore mensili affidate al professore di storia.

In teoria, l'insegnamento è presente per tutti gli istituti di ogni ordine e grado all'interno delle materie di storia e geografia. In pratica – come sa chiunque abbia figli o nipoti nelle nostre scuole - è sparita del tutto.

Eppure, oggi più che mai si sente il bisogno di un vero e serio insegnamento di quella che continuerò a chiamare educazione civica. Perché per una lunga serie di ragioni (fra cui la crisi di molte famiglie, che dovrebbero essere la prima scuola di educazione, anche civica) assistiamo a un grave imbarbarimento del vivere civile. I fenomeni in cui questo si manifesta sono sotto gli occhi di tutti: dalla evasione fiscale alla corruzione, dal razzismo al rifiuto degli immigrati, dalla omofobia alla violenza contro le donne e al bullismo, dalla inosservanza delle regole elementari del vivere civile: nel traffico, nella raccolta della spazzatura, nella violenza con cui molti rispondono a ogni richiamo all'osservanza delle norme.

Per far fronte a questo imbarbarimento il ruolo centrale non può che essere quello della scuola. E non con un insegnamento – come dichiarato di recente da un Direttore Generale della Pubblica Istruzione – che sia ""un filo rosso che corre attraverso tutte le altre materie di insegnamento"", ma con una vera e propria materia fondamentale, che ovviamente può essere lasciata ai docenti di storia ma che gradualmente dovrebbe essere affidata a docenti specializzati, con valutazione e adeguato numero di ore alla settimana.

Non entro nei dettagli organizzativi, non volendomi improvvisare ""esperto"" di pubblica istruzione, ma pongo il problema e suggerisco alla nuova forza politica europeista che sta nascendo (e che spero non si chiamerà ""Forza Europa"", per non richiamare alla mente degli elettori né ""Forza Italia"" né tanto meno ""Forza Nuova"") di far proprio questo problema, anche per non restare paurosamente indietro rispetto ai più civili fra gli altri paesi europei, nei quali l'educazione civica è quasi sempre materia autonoma, con adeguato numero di ore di insegnamento. E ricordando che dal 2010 tutti gli Stati membri hanno adottato – almeno a parole – la Carta del Consiglio d'Europa sulla ""educazione democratica e l'educazione ai diritti umani"".

Grazie a un'amica che vive da anni in Francia ed ha tre figli nelle scuole di Parigi, ho consultato i principali documenti in materia del governo francese, che soprattutto dopo la tragedia di Charlie Hebdo ha rafforzato significativamente quello che viene definito ""insegnamento morale e civico"", affidandolo nelle medie e nelle superiori ai professori di storia.

Ne tento una sintesi.

Obiettivo della materia è quello di ""trasmettere e far condividere i valori della Repubblica accettati da tutti, quali che siano le convinzioni e le scelte di vita personali"" e di insegnare a vivere tutti insieme ""in una Repubblica indivisibile, laica, democratica e sociale"".

I valori sono quelli di sempre dei francesi (ma è bene ricordarli): ""La libertà, l'uguaglianza, la fraternità, la laicità, la solidarietà, lo spirito di giustizia, l'assenza di ogni forma di discriminazione"".

Temi dell'insegnamento: la cura del linguaggio, la cura del corpo e dell'ambiente, il rispetto dei beni collettivi, l'integrità morale della persona, il rifiuto del razzismo, l'attenzione all'handicap e all'inclusione sociale, l'uguaglianza di tutti i cittadini davanti alla legge, la parità di diritti dei ragazzi e delle ragazze, la laicità come libertà di credere o di non credere, il rispetto degli altri nelle loro diversità e convinzioni - che passa per un linguaggio e un comportamento corretti - l'osservanza di tutte le regole (comprese quelle della strada e del traffico), il dovere di prestare soccorso a chi è in gravi difficoltà, la doverosità delle sanzioni per le infrazioni alle leggi e alle regole, l'insegnamento del dibattito democratico e dei grandi principi della giustizia (diritto alla difesa e a un processo equo), i comportamenti atti a ridurre l'entità dei disastri naturali. Centrale nell'insegnamento, la conoscenza della Costituzione del 1946 e dei suoi principi fondamentali. Tema aggiunto di recente: un uso di Internet consapevole dei rischi connessi ed una attitudine critica nei confronti dei risultati ottenuti.

Volendo sintetizzare le norme francesi, direi che ""si va a scuola di diritti e doveri"". Ma forse è ora di passare alla formula ""doveri e diritti"". E con questo torno a un tema caro a Emma Bonino e – di conseguenza – a quello che dovrebbe proporsi il nascente movimento politico europeista in materia di educazione civica.","L’educazione civica, una priorità per le scuole italiane",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/carlo-troilo/l-educazione-civica-una-priorita-per-le-scuole-italiane_a_23269339/

Stephen Hawking torna a parlare di Intelligenza artificiale al Web Summit, la conferenza sulla tecnologia tenuta a Lisbona, nel corso della quale il fisico britannico ha sottolineato la necessità di tenere a bada i pericoli che questa potrebbe generare.

""Dobbiamo prepararci adeguatamente per evitare i potenziali rischi"", ha allertato, ""L'IA porta pericoli e crea nuove strade per concedere a pochi di dominare i molti. Potrebbe distruggere la nostra economia"".

Hawking ha sottolineato comunque la sua importanza e i benefici che potrebbe generare, se adeguatamente gestita: eliminare i danni subiti dalla natura, sradicare la povertà e sconfiggere le malattie.

""Sono ottimista e credo che si possa sviluppare un'Intelligenza Artificiale pensata per il bene del mondo, affinché possa lavorare in armonia con noi"", ha continuato il fisico, ""Bisogna semplicemente essere consapevoli dei pericoli, identificarli e prepararsi alle conseguenze"".

Sull'Intelligenza Artificiale, altri noti personaggi hanno detto la loro, suggerendo massima cautela, poiché è alto il rischio che le macchine possano infine superare e prendere il sopravvento sull'uomo, inerme di fronte a delle azioni che prescindono dalla sua volontà.

Eleon Musk, ceo di Tesla, in passato ha affermato che ""tutte le nazioni forti nell'informatica svilupperanno sistemi d'intelligenza artificiale e la competizione per la superiorità potrà causare la terza Guerra mondiale"". Secondo Musk, infatti, ""un nuovo conflitto internazionale potrebbe essere avviato non dai leader dei vari Paesi ma da uno dei loro sistemi di intelligenza artificiale, se questo dovesse decidere che un attacco preventivo costituisce il percorso ideale per la vittoria"".

Anche Hawking aveva espresso una perplessità simile. ""La tecnologia è avanzata a un ritmo tale che questa aggressione potrebbe distruggere tutti noi, con una guerra nucleare o biologica"", ha scritto il fisico sulle pagine del Times, suggerendo un'arma contro quella minaccia, ""Possiamo controllarla utilizzando la logica e la ragione"".","""L'intelligenza artificiale potrebbe distruggerci.

Dans ""Tout nous sépare"" de Thierry Klifa, en salles le 8 novembre, Nekfeu et Catherine Deneuve forment un sacré duo. Dans un monde où tout les oppose, les deux personnages se retrouvent ""forcés"" de coopérer.

Dans ce thriller aux allures de film noir, Nekfeu incarne Ben, un jeune homme sans histoire vivant dans une cité du Sud de la France. Chômeur, il vit de petits trafics avec ses deux amis d'enfance Rodolphe, incarné par Nicolas Duvauchelle, et Karim, joué par Sébastien Houbani.

Pour Ken Samaras, le cinéma est un nouveau monde. Habitué à la scène et aux tournages de clips, Nekfeu raconte au HuffPost cette nouvelle étape dans sa carrière.

Le HuffPost: Pour votre premier rôle au cinéma, vous intégrez un casting de stars, quel effet cela vous fait?

Nekfeu: C'est incroyable, j'en suis très fier, et puis ça fait plaisir à ma famille! Au début du tournage, je ressentais une énorme pression mais ça s'est vite arrangé.

Il y a quelques années, vous imaginiez-vous donner la réplique à Catherine Deneuve au cinéma?

Non pas du tout! Avant de rencontrer Thierry Klifa je n'avais même pas l'envie de faire du cinéma. Je ne me sentais pas légitime en tant qu'acteur. Par ailleurs je trouve ce métier très impudique, ce qui ne m'a jamais vraiment plu. Mais comme j'aime bien les défis, que le casting et l'histoire du film me plaisaient, je me suis dit que je ne pouvais pas refuser.

Vous recevez régulièrement des propositions pour le cinéma sans pour autant en faire votre priorité, qu'est ce qui a fait que ce film soit devenu une priorité pour vous?

Jusqu'à maintenant, les scénarios que je recevais véhiculaient des valeurs que je ne cautionnais pas ou étaient des comédies commerciales qui ne me parlaient pas, avec le rôle cliché du rappeur. Donc évidemment, je ne faisais pas du cinéma ma priorité. Et quand Thierry Khlifa est venu me chercher, je lui ai dit qu'il se trompait de personne, que je ne voulais pas faire de cinéma et que je préférais me focaliser sur ma musique... Il m'a répondu que je devrais essayer, au moins lire le scénario, voir le casting, etc. Et puis j'ai relativisé, je me suis rendu compte de la chance que j'avais et je me suis dit ""si tu ne faisais pas de rap tu l'aurais fait direct."" Donc j'ai lu l'histoire et je me suis dit que ça pouvait coller, je me suis tout de suite vu dans le personnage de Ben.

N'aviez-vous pas peur d'être confiné au stéréotype du rappeur/acteur que l'on peut voir dans les comédies populaires?

Non parce que je ne joue pas le rôle d'un rappeur! J'incarne un mec banal, vivant dans un quartier populaire comme il y en a des milliers en France. À vrai-dire, cela me rappelle comment j'ai grandi. Nos personnages sont plus proches de ceux qui ne sont pas vraiment faits pour le banditisme. C'est quand on se retrouve face à des vrais voyous qui viennent récupérer leur dû que l'on se rend compte qu'on n'est pas des vrais méchants. Dans le scénario, le fait que l'on soit une équipe de trois, et non une énorme bande, facilite le côté sincère, on n'est pas dans le paraître ni dans le surjoué.

Que pensez-vous de la place qu'occupe actuellement le rap dans le cinéma français?

Je suis super content qu'il y ait de plus en plus de rappeurs qui se lancent. Et j'aimerais bien que, de plus en plus, il y ait des réalisateurs comme Thierry Klifa qui proposent aux rappeurs des rôles qui ne soient pas des mauvaises incarnations d'eux-mêmes, des braqueurs, des dealers... Maintenant il y a des réalisateurs qui ont la quarantaine, ont grandi avec NTM, et ne posent aucun cliché sur le rôle qu'un rappeur devrait avoir au cinéma. Ca évolue avec les nouvelles générations.

Aux États-Unis il y a toujours eu cette communication entre le rap et le cinéma. En France, je trouve qu'il y a cette espèce de racisme sociétal qui fait que -sauf quand on a besoin d'un rappeur pour les comédies populaires- on ne fait pas appel à nous alors que notre musique est la plus écoutée en France.

Pensez-vous à faire une pause dans la chanson pour vous consacrer à une carrière dans le cinéma ?

C'est plutôt l'inverse! Avec ""Tout nous sépare"", j'ai fait une pause pour mieux reprendre le rap. Plus sérieusement, je continuerai à rapper parce que c'est ce que je fais depuis le début. En revanche, depuis quelques années, j'essaye vraiment d'apporter un aspect cinématographique à mes clips. Je pense même que désormais, tous mes investissements iront dans la production de clips.

Mais le cinéma m'a plu et je serai bientôt à l'écran dans un second film que nous avons déjà tourné qui s'intitule ""L'échappée"", il est réalisé par Mathias Pardo.

Votre personnage passe par de nombreuses émotions durant le film, comment avez-vous géré cela ?

Sur scène, je suis sincère, je n'en ai rien à foutre, je ne ressens même plus la pression, je peux me permettre de bafouiller ou de ne pas rapper quelques secondes. Au cinéma c'est tout le contraire. Les émotions sont forcées alors il faut faire semblant. Mais j'ai remarqué qu'il était facile de faire semblant face à des acteurs tels que Catherine Deneuve, Nicolas Duvauchelle ou Diane Kruger. Lorsque l'on devait jouer un dialogue par exemple, ils étaient tellement naturels que j'avais l'impression de mener une véritable discussion, j'oubliais complètement la caméra.

Pour les scènes un peu plus violentes, j'ai eu beaucoup de mal à jouer la douleur, alors on a trouvé une solution. Lorsque je me fais frapper, les autres me frappent pour de vrai, ils ne retiennent pas leurs coups. Cela m'a vraiment facilité la tâche puisque j'avais vraiment mal! (rires)

Sur les affiches promotionnelles du film, vous apparaissez sous le nom de Nekfeu alors que dans le générique de fin, il est écrit Ken Samaras. Pourquoi ?

Le fait qu'il soit écrit ""Nekfeu"" sur les affiches du film est un choix purement promotionnel. Mon nom de rappeur est quand même plus connu que mon nom civil! En revanche, dans le générique du film, j'ai demandé à ce que mon vrai nom -Ken Samaras- soit écrit pour que ma famille puisse être fière de moi. Imaginez-vous! (rires) Je vais pouvoir montrer le film à ma grand-mère et à toute ma famille restée en Grèce. Je suis très fier de ça.

There's nothing quite like the winter romance of mountains and the movies.

The joys of this breathtaking and passionate affair is best summed up at the annual Dharamsala International Film Festival, now in its 6th edition.

Monks, both young and old, dressed in soothing red robes, people the vibrant town, strolling across its long-winding streets. Clad stylishly in what appear Ray Bans, red sneakers, and black backpacks, they make for quite a sight.

Tourists, both local and foreign, walk the streets with the restless enthusiasm only wanderlust can inspire. At the central square is where the cinephiles gather, exchanging notes about what to watch and what to skip, and where to find the most delicious Momos (it's at the Tibet Kitchen btw, a lovely restaurant just around the corner of the square).

Assembled under trying circumstances and functioning with modest resources, DIFF opened Thursday evening at the Tibetan Children's Village (TCV) near the Dal lake, about 10 minutes away from Dharamsala's main town, McLeod Ganj.

Free from the tempting vanities that the Mumbai Film Festival seductively pulls off, Dharamsala Film Festival, like the actor Adil Hussain said, is a great festival because 'there is no red carpet.'

Hussain, a naturally gifted actor, who sprung up on the scene with his layered performance in Gauri Shinde's much-celebrated English Vinglish, was present at the opening ceremony as his film, Mukti Bhavan (Hotel Salvation is its international title), opened the festival.

Hotel Salvation, which translates to 'deliverance from harm', is an uniquely inspiring choice of film for a festival set in Dharamsala, a place that's largely populated by Tibetans who escaped home due to a brutal Chinese oppression in search of a safe place. The festival founders, Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, are vocal critics of the Chinese occupation of Tibet and its systematic cleansing of Tibetan culture.

In that context, Hotel Salvation is also a very political choice as opening film, even if it's incidental and not deliberate.

The film has been often cited as the best film of the year. At least that was the case until Amit Masurkar's Newton came along.

Directed by debutant Shubhashish Bhutiani, who was only 23 when he pitched the idea to Hussain, Mukti Bhavan is a hauntingly beautiful portrait of life and death and of troubled parent-offspring relationships.

As Hussain's character, Rajiv, takes his father to the titular hotel, where the elderly come to peacefully transition into the realm of the unknown, the film very subtly nudges one into examining our own attitudes towards mortality, parents as well as how their upbringing influences the way we end up treating our children. Incidentally, this was also one of the underlying themes in Titli.

Adil Hussain at the 6th Dharamsala International Film Festival.

Hussain and Behl have a fractured father-son relationship and it's this very complexity that Bhutiani explores with nuance and subtlety.

On the deathbed, can you get yourself to despise your father, or even love him fully, for the decisions that dramatically altered the course of your life? Hate, bitterness, distance are all components of the larger sentiment of love which overpowers most feelings in Hotel Salvation's morbid yet deeply funny universe.

The film has a terrific ensemble, led by Hussain and supported ably by Lalit Behl (who played the quietly sinister patriarch in Kanu Behl's Titli), Palomi Ghosh, Geetanjali Kulkarni, and Navnidra Behl.

Hussain spoke about how he drew out this part from his personal experience of having had a troubled relationship with his father, who wanted him to become a professor of English and not an actor. It was only in the last two years of his late father's life did he come around to approving his career choice, after watching an interview of his on the BBC.

About his performance, Hussain said, ""I have learnt to be responsive and not reactive. I tend to internalise and hold back my emotions. Whatever seeps out is the performance you see on-screen.""

Incidentally, Hussain's acting mentor, the legendary Barry John, was in the audience. About the film, Barry said, ""A film like Mukti Bhavan is so moving and one is at a loss for words. There are so many emotions one experiences that one doesn't know how to cope with it.""

It couldn't have been summed up in a better way.

The festival will continue until the weekend, where Rima Das' MAMI-favorite, Village Rockstars, plays as the closing film.

Among other films to be screened at the 4-day long festival include India's Oscar-entry Newton, Konkona Sen Sharma's A Death in the Gunj, and Rahul Jain's, Machines.

엘리자베스 2세 영국 여왕이 개인 회사를 통해 조세회피처에 거액을 투자 형태로 보관중인 사실이 확인됐다. 그밖에도 쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리, 윌버 로스 미국 상무장관, 렉스 틸러슨 국무장관, 재러드 쿠슈너 백악관 선임고문 같은 고위 정치인·정부 관계자들은 물론, U2 리드싱어 보노, 마돈나 같은 연예인들도 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루된 것으로 나타났다.

페이스북, 애플, 마이크로소프트, 나이키, 우버, 이베이, 맥도날드, 지멘스, 알리안츠 등 다국적 기업들도 목록에 포함됐다. 한국인 200여명과 한국인이 세운 법인 90여개도 있었다.





'파라다이스 페이퍼스'



What are the Paradise Papers? - The Guardian

이같은 사실은 5일(현지시각) 공개된 '파라다이스 페이퍼(Paradise Papers)'로 세상에 모습을 드러냈다. 1300만개가 넘는 파일로 이뤄진 이 방대한 유출 문건에는 세계 유명 인사와 기업들이 해외 조세피난처와 다국적 기업 등을 활용해 조세를 회피해 온 정황이 자세하게 담겨있다. 지난해 4월 공개됐던 '파나마 페이퍼스'와 유사하다.

유출된 문서 대부분은 버뮤다에 위치한 법률 자문회사 '애플비(Appleby)'에서 나왔다. 애플비는 전세계 조세도피처에 사무실을 두고 고객들에게 페이퍼컴퍼티 설립 등을 통한 조세 회피, 재산 은닉 등을 자문해왔다.

지난해 '파나마 페이퍼스'에 이어 이번에도 문건을 입수한 독일 일간지 '쥐트도이체차이퉁'은 국제탐사보도언론인협회(ICIJ)에 도움을 요청했다. 이에 따라 미국 뉴욕타임스, 영국 가디언, BBC 등 전 세계 언론사(67개국, 96개 언론사, 382명)들의 국제 공조 취재로 그 내용이 드러나게 됐다. 한국에서는 뉴스타파가 이 작업에 참여했다.

""지난 6개월 동안 방대한 데이터를 일일이 분석했다""는 뉴스타파에 따르면, 유출된 자료는 1950년~2016년 기간에 생산된 1343만여건(1.4TB)에 달한다.

물론 조세회피처와의 거래에 연루됐다는 것만으로 모두 '불법'이라고 단정할 수는 없다. 다만 통상 세금을 회피하기 위한 목적임이 분명한 경우가 많고 '검은 거래'를 숨기려는 의도로 조세회피처를 활용하는 사례가 상당하다. 도덕적 책임은 물론, 때에 따라서는 법적 책임을 피할 수 없게 될 가능성도 있다는 뜻이다.





등장인물들

각 언론사들은 분석 결과를 바탕으로 자료에 담긴 내용들을 보도하고 있다. 이 중 현재까지 주목할 만한 내용 중 하나는 바로 영국 여왕 엘리자베스 2세의 조세회피 의혹이다. 이전에는 한 번도 알려지지 않았던 내용이다.

가디언에 따르면, 엘리자베스 여왕은 캐이맨제도와 버뮤다에 개인 자산 약 1000만파운드(약 145억원)를 역외 투자 형태로 보관중인 것으로 나타났다.

이 과정에는 여왕의 자산을 관리하는 '랭커스터공국(Duchy of Lancaster·DL)'이 동원됐다. DL은 영국 최대 가전·생활용품 임대 전문 소매점 '브라이트하우스' 등에 펀드 형태로 투자를 하고 있는 것으로 나타났다.

왕실 측은 이같은 투자로 세금을 회피한 사실이 없다고 해명했다. 그러나 가디언은 왕실의 재정 운영 상황을 보다 투명하게 공개하라는 요구가 다시 빗발칠 가능성이 높다고 전했다.

쥐스탱 트뤼도 캐나다 총리도 간접적으로 등장한다. 정치자금 모금을 담당한 최측근인 스티븐 브론프맨이 가족 투자기업을 통해 캐이맨제도와 이스라엘, 미국 등에 복잡한 법인 거래 관계를 설립해뒀다는 것. 가디언은 이 법인들 사이의 거래를 통해 그가 '합법적'으로 세금을 회피했을 가능성이 있다고 전했다.

윌버 로스 미국 상무장관 등 트럼프 정부 고위 관계자들의 이름도 다수 등장한다. 특히 로스 장관은 푸틴의 사위인 키릴 샤말로프와 러시아 기업인들이 공동으로 소유한 에너지기업 '시부르'와 계약을 맺었던 것으로 드러났다. 여기에는 미국 정부가 제재 대상으로 분류한 이들도 포함되어 있다.

그밖에도 U2의 보노가 몰타를 경유해 리투아니아의 대형 쇼핑몰을 비밀리에 소유하고 있던 사실 등이 드러났다.

한편 뉴스타파는 ""현재까지 한국인 232명의 이름을 찾아냈다""고 전했다. 또 ""이들 한국인이 조세도피처에 세운 법인은 모두 90개로 나타났""으며, ""코스닥 상장기업같은 중견업체부터 가스공사같은 공기업, 그리고 재벌기업도 적지 않게 발견됐다""고 덧붙였다.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung weiterhin bei 50 zu 50, sagt sie im HuffPost-Interview

Außerdem sieht sie trotz der Kompromissbereitschaft der Grünen große Differenzen

Nach dem Start der zweiten Sondierungsrunde geht es bei Jamaika ums Eingemachte. Nicht nur beim Klimaschutz gibt es weiter Konfliktpotenzial - auch die Flüchtlingspolitik ist ein zentraler Streitpunkt.

Für die FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer stehen die Chancen auf eine Einigung deswegen weiter bei 50 zu 50. In einem Interview mit der HuffPost sagte sie zum Beginn der Gespräche:

""Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.""

Die Grünen gingen am Morgen einen ersten großen Schritt auf die potentiellen Partner zu. Sowohl beim Verbrennungsmotor als auch beim Kohleausstieg zeigten sie Kompromissbereitschaft.

""Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen"", sagte Beer. Dennoch sieht die FDP-Generalsekretärin noch große Differenzen. ""Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen"", sagte sie.

""Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig.""

Auch bei der Flüchtlingspolitik rief sie den Verhandlungspartner zur Kompromissbereitschaft auf.

""Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können"", sagte Beer.

Das Interview lest ihr hier:

Frau Beer, nehmen wir an, Sie erhalten ein Freiticket für einen Jamaika-Urlaub und können einen Unterhändler aus der Union oder von den Grünen mitnehmen. Wer wäre das?



Von den Verhandlungspartner kann ich mir auf der Insel sicher eine nette Zeit mit CSU-Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer machen. Aber eigentlich müsste ich natürlich meine bessere Hälfte mitnehmen.

Heute gehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen in die zweite Runde, doch es hakt gewaltig. Wird das noch etwas mit der Koalition?

Ich sehe die Chancen nach wie vor bei 50 zu 50, dass Jamaika gelingt. In den kommenden Tagen wird es darum gehen, die Gräben aus dem Weg zu räumen und eine gemeinsame Vision zu entwickeln, die jeder unterschreiben kann.

Das klingt jetzt sehr freundlich. FDP-Chef Lindner redet schon über Neuwahlen und eine mögliche Oppositionsrolle. Wo soll das hinführen?



Am Ende haben wir keine Angst vor Neuwahlen, das wollte er deutlich machen. Uns geht es um eine neue Politik, die deutlich werden muss. Aber wir arbeiten auch nicht auf Neuwahlen hin.



Können Sie uns das versprechen?



Ja.



Woher dann das Gerede über Neuwahlen?



Am Ende ist für uns klar: Wir werden uns nicht selbst verleugnen. Wenn wir die Wahl haben zwischen Glaubwürdigkeitsverlust oder Neuwahlen, entscheiden wir uns für Neuwahlen. Aber das ist nicht unser Ziel.



Haben Sie einen kleinen Westerwelle-Komplex - nicht noch einmal aus dem Bundestag ausscheiden?



Ich neige nicht zu Komplexen, egal, mit welchem Namen Sie das verbinden. Ich neige dazu, feste Prinzipien zu haben. Am Ende muss unsere liberale Handschrift klar erkennbar sein. Wir stehen nicht als Stützrad für eine Schwarz-Rote Politik, wie sie die vergangenen vier Jahre gemacht wurde.



Die Grünen sind ja auch noch mit dabei.



Ja, aber man hat ja schon den Eindruck, dass Schwarz-Grün bereits Vorgefühle entwickelt hat.



Woran machen Sie das fest?



Wenn ich mir den ein oder anderen Gesprächsverlauf anschaue. Aber ich möchte nicht zu viele Internas aus den Sondierungsgesprächen verraten. Generell ist uns natürlich klar, dass wir nicht alle unsere Forderung durchsetzen können. Doch unsere liberale Handschrift muss erkennbar sein.



Große Differenzen gibt es mit den Grünen beim Thema Klimaschutz. Wie wollen Sie hier einen Kompromiss erreichen?



Wir sind uns mit den Grünen völlig einig, dass wir die Klimaschutzziele 2050 erreichen müssen. Allerdings müssen wir das physikalisch hinbekommen.



Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck sagte, alle Parteien müssen sich “am Riemen reißen”. Das klingt nicht so, als wäre man sich völlig einig.



Wir sind uns bei den Zielen einig. Beim Weg dorthin hingegen bisher nicht. Wir müssen uns eingestehen, dass unsere jetzige Klimaschutzpolitik nicht funktioniert hat. Sie ist die teuerste der Welt, aber wir haben keine einzige Tonne CO2 eingespart. Das ist doch völlig widersinnig. Wir wollen einen Klimaschutz, der funktioniert. Da sind wir grüner als die Grünen.



Was ist die Alternative?



Wir können unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele nur mit Technologien erreichen, die sich noch nicht durchgesetzt haben. Das müssen wir in unserer Klimapolitik dringend miteinbeziehen.



Geben Sie uns ein Beispiel.



Etwa bei der Mobilität. Wenn wir den Verbrennungsmotor abschaffen, bevor wir das Reichweitenproblem der E-Autos gelöst haben, machen wir realitätsferne Politik an den Menschen vorbei.

Wir haben die heutigen Aussagen des Grünen-Chefs in diese Richtung als Signal der Einigungsbereitschaft aufgenommen, wie Christian Lindner ja auch deutlich gemacht hat. Klare, erreichbare Ziele und Technologieoffenheit zu ihrer Erreichung statt auf Verbote zu setzen, das muss die Devise sein. Und so ist es auch mit der Kohlekraft.



Warum?



Wir haben jetzt schon Probleme mit der Versorgungssicherheit. Bei manchen Unternehmen flackert das Stromnetz und gefährdet damit die Produktion, weil der Strommix aus den Erneuerbaren in Stoßzeiten nicht ausreicht. Wenn wir die Kohle jetzt parallel zur Kernenergie aus dem Stromnetz rausnehmen, müssen wir mit flächendeckenden Blackouts rechnen. Das kann niemand wollen.



Was ist mit Erdgas? Das ist effizienter und nicht ganz so schmutzig wie Kohle.



Fakt ist doch: Bislang haben uns die Grünen nicht vorrechnen können, wie sie einen Kohleausstieg ausgleichen wollen. Da bliebe uns nur übrig, Kohle- und Kernenergie aus Frankreich und Polen zuzukaufen. Ob die Grünen so wirklich das Klima retten, bezweifle ich.



Reden wir über den Umgang zwischen den Jamaika-Parteien. FDP-Chef Lindner hat den Grünen etwa vorgeworfen, ein “Konjunkturprogramm für die AfD” zu betreiben. CSU-General Scheuer nennt die Grünen “schizophren”. Woher kommt die schlechte Laune?



Wir schauen schlicht auf die Realitäten. Beispiel Flüchtlingspolitik, worauf sich das Zitat von Christian Lindner ja bezog. Natürlich ist ein Familiennachzug, wie ihn die Grünen wollen, in gewissen Bereichen sinnvoll - etwa, wenn derjenige seine Familie hier in Deutschland ernähren kann, weil er einen Job und eine Wohnung hat.

Aber das funktioniert nur, wenn wir diejenigen abschieben, die kein Bleiberecht haben. Sonst werden uns die Bürger zurecht auf die Barrikaden gehen. Denn wir können nicht jeden aufnehmen.



Wie wollen Sie die Grünen davon überzeugen?



Es gibt auch bei den Grünen Politiker wie Herrn Palmer, die davon bereits überzeugt sind. Sie wissen, dass es vor Ort Schwierigkeiten gibt, einen unbegrenzten Zuzug von Flüchtlingen zu schultern. Es fehlen Wohnungen, Klassenräume, Lehrkräfte und Kita-Plätze.



Herr Palmer aber spricht nicht für seine Partei. Wie wollen Sie etwa Parteichef Özdemir überzeugen?



Ich setze darauf, dass auch Cem Özdemir irgendwann für logische Argumente zugänglich wird und in seinem Wahlkreis merkt, dass auch dort nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufgenommen werden können.



Schauen wir auf CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer. Es wirkt so, als liefe gegen ihn ein innerparteilicher Putsch. Glauben Sie, dass er noch lange am Verhandlungstisch von Jamaika sitzen wird?



Das muss die CSU entscheiden.



Lohnt es sich, Kompromisse mit jemandem zu machen, der womöglich schon bald nicht mehr für seine Partei spricht?



Am Ende des Tages machen wir Kompromisse mit der CSU, nicht mit Horst Seehofer.

Beobachter sehen die Jamaika-Verhandlungen durch die Personaldiskussion in der CSU grundsätzlich in Gefahr. Teilen Sie diese Sorge?



Unsere Verhandlungen könnten schneller voranschreiten, wenn die CSU so geschlossen wäre wie die FDP. Aber Streit gibt es auch bei den Grünen, die sich untereinander nicht immer einig sind.

HuffPost UK Camilla Thurlow

HuffPost UK recently caught up with the former bomb disposal worker about how ‘New Activists’ felt the like the right fit for her, why the refugee crisis means so much and what it’s like breaking the reality TV star mould... What made you want to get involved with ‘New Activists’? Having seen the other ‘New Activists’ and what they’d been working on, you could see that it was really opening people’s eyes to a whole different side of activism. Like, it was humanising the people involved. In some instances there’s been a bit of a stigma attached to activism, and people would consider activists to be only a certain type of person. But actually this documentary series has really given an insight into the fact it’s just about normal people who feel very strongly, and there’s so many different sides to that person. It’s all about big ideas but with very real people. People know you best from ‘Love Island’, and after being on a show like that, you get a lot of offers. How did you decide what to do next? I think it’s all about authenticity, really, on that side of things, and I know what I think I’m good at, and it tends to be stuff that I feel passionately about. If I’m going to do something, I like to do it justice. For me it was just important to find the right thing, and also to try and make sure that I was using any platform that I might have to raise awareness for certain issues that I don’t think necessarily always get seen. It’s that thing, interestingly, of different horses for different courses. I have so much admiration for the other things that people have done, and this seemed like the right opportunity for me. On ‘Love Island’, we saw how much you wanted to do more activism. Did you ever worry that being on a show like that would limit your options? Of course there were concerns in my mind in terms of going back to the work that I did before, and I think obviously it’s always worth having those concerns and having a healthy level of worry about what you’re going to do next, because it makes you stay on the right track. So I guess I was worried to an extent, but I think it was the same for all of us who were in it from the beginning. When we came out we just didn’t realise how successful the series had been, and how successful it had been across so many different demographics. It was really a very diverse audience and… I think there was definitely something in the timing, this summer was quite an interesting time on many different levels with domestic and foreign politics, and somehow in that. ‘Love Island’ became this really engaging escapism. So I’ll say that I did have concerns, but in the same way I would have had concerns about many different things and how that could affect my work.

ITV Camilla and her 'Love Island' co-stars this summer

Do you hope that your involvement in ‘Love Island’ and ‘New Activists’ can possibly inspire a new breed of celebrities who start on reality shows? I think the thing is, it’s really interesting because I feel like there are comparisons being drawn that aren’t as clear as it might appear. I don’t feel as different [to other reality stars] as sometimes people perceive it. I’m struggling to explain myself, but I think it’s very easy to label someone as a “typical reality TV star” but that person will have many other sides to them. The only thing that I sort of hope will happen is that... if I can raise any awareness of the issues that are important to me, that will make me very happy. What is it about the refugee crisis in particular that spoke to you? I think part of it comes from my previous work, pre- ‘Love Island’. When you go to an area where there’s been a conflict and you can see people have been forced to leave their homes behind, and then you’re involved in trying to make the area safe so they can come back… you start to think about what it must mean for that person. To have literally got to a point where they had no choice but to leave, but also what growing up against that backdrop of violence can do to a person. Also, because I was on the EOD [explosive ordnance disposal] side, I wasn’t seeing much of the people who had been forced to leave, so it was really important to me to build up that whole picture of what the results of conflict are. So, I initially took the trip to Greece with Jamie [Jewitt, her boyfriend and fellow ‘Love Island’ star] and that was certainly an eye-opener, from that point on we just realised how much we could be doing to help people, and i just wanted to be a part of that. So how did your trip to Calais come about? I spoke to Josie [Naughton], who’s the co-founder of Help Refugees about supporting them. It’s been a year since the demolition of the Jungle camp in Calais, and since then, people have been homeless, living rough - not that they had homes before, but there was some form of camp, some form of protection, and they are now completely exposed. And that includes a number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping rough, completely unprotected, no one to stop anything happening to them. The more I discussed it with her, the more I realised first of all that I needed to see it for myself, and secondly that I wanted to be a part of trying to highlight the fact that there is a legal route for these children to come here, there is a safe way and that needs to happen urgently. Especially now it’s coming up to winter. In the year since the jungle camp closed, how has the situation in Calais changed? I think it’s worse, for the people who are there at the moment. It would be wrong for me to draw any sort of straight of judgement, because I didn’t see it before. But we spoke to a gentleman called Stu in the distribution centre, and he had been in the jungle camp, and he said for him the conditions are worse. Now, they’re not even allowed tents to sleep in, so now they get a sleeping bag and a blanket at best, and even those are often taken away by the police, so the conditions are really really bad. In terms of keeping track of people, in making sure that they haven’t been hurt or harmed, that they haven’t attempted to cross and then not made it back and they’re stranded somewhere on their own, it’s just so much harder when there’s no formalised systems.

While it’s true that we’re getting ever closer to overcoming the technological hurdles in our way, regulations are such that allowing fully-autonomous vehicles onto the roads is difficult. Yet a new study has claimed that self-driving cars only have to be moderately better than human drivers before they could start saving lives.

The report, published by non-profit organisation the RAND Corporation, has found that if we allowed the use of self-driving cars that were just 10% better than current American drivers it could prevent thousands of deaths over the next 15 years. This is compared to waiting until cars are at least 75% or 95% better than their human counterparts. The study came up with the figures by estimating future road fatalities over hundreds of different futures while taking into account the numerous safety requirements for autonomous vehicles to be introduced. While carmakers are testing the water with semi-autonomous systems like Tesla’s Autopilot, very few are capable of achieving self-driving outside of a pre-determined environment e.g. Motorways.

Despite this, the study argues that even rolling them out en masse in their current form could still prove to be a safer decision than not. “Our work suggests that it is sensible to allow autonomous vehicles on America’s roads when they are judged to be just moderately safer than having a person behind the wheel,” said Nidhi Kalra, co-author of the study and director of RAND’s San Francisco office. “If we wait until these vehicles are nearly perfect, our research suggests the cost will be many thousands of needless vehicle crash deaths caused by human mistakes. It’s the very definition of perfect being the enemy of good.” Of course it’s nowhere near as simple as just putting driverless cars on the road, there’s public opinion to consider as well.","Introducing Self-Driving Cars Sooner Could Save Hundreds Of Thousands Of Lives, Claims Study",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/introducing-self-driving-cars-sooner-could-save-hundreds-of-thousands-of-lives-claims-study_uk_5a019dade4b07eb51181f038

MONTREAL — Greater Montreal homes sold more quickly in October as continued strong demand propelled average prices seven per cent higher, the area's real estate board said Monday.

""The single-family home and plex markets are becoming increasingly favourable to sellers, as selling times for these property categories are falling,"" said Mathieu Cousineau, president of the Greater Montreal Real Estate Board.

Single family homes sold last month were on the market on average for 78 days, almost two weeks less than a year ago.

Buildings with two to five units sold three days quicker at 81 days. Condominiums took the longest to sell at 103 days, but that was 17 days fewer than in October 2016. That signals a balanced condo market, said Cousineau.

Most active October in eight years

The number of homes sold in the month increased seven per cent to 3,270, led by a 13 per cent increase in condo sales and three per cent for single homes.

Last month was the most active October in eight years, the real estate board said.

The strong activity came ahead of the federal government's plans to tighten mortgage requirements.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions will implement new lending guidelines at the beginning of next year. Among the changes being considered is a requirement that homebuyers who do not require mortgage insurance still have to show they can make their payments if interest rates rise.

Paul Cardinal of the Quebec Federation of Real Estate Boards has attributed monthly housing gains this year to strong job creation, consumer confidence and foreign migration.

""Si te gusta ver a la gente famosa, probablemente no hay nada mejor para ello que una boda real.
El mes pasado una fuente cercana a Harry dijo al US Weekly que se espera que sea una boda de mucho más bajo perfil.
""Puedo adivinar que se casará en la Capilla de San Jorge en el castillo de Windsor.
De nuestra parte, lo que decimos es que ¡ojalá que nuestra invitación no se pierda en el correo!","Si eres fan de los royals, de seguro tienes fantasías de cómo sería asistir a una boda real. Y ahora que el príncipe Harry y Meghan Markle están a punto de unirse en matrimonio, seguramente tus fantasías están a todo lo que dan.

Pero si bien uno sólo puede imaginarse lo que es ser invitado a una boda así, el periodista Duncan Larcombe conoce de primera mano qué tan glamoroso es un acto así.

Así, mientras no despegábamos la mirada de la tele el día en que Kate Middleton y el príncipe William se dieron el sí en abril de 2011, Larcombe de hecho figuró entre las 1,900 personas que asistieron a la ceremonia nupcial en la Abadía de Westminster.

El ex editor de realeza para The Sun, fue uno de los seis periodistas que asistió como invitado. ""Nos dijeron unas dos o tres semanas por anticipado que seríamos invitados, pero que no lo podíamos decir a nadie"", dijo a Elle UK en una reciente entrevista. ""No quería que se esparciera esto entre otros periodistas"".

Así que, ¿qué se sintió al estar entre tantos royals en esa ceremonia? De acuerdo con Larcombe, fue tan surreal como cualquiera lo imagina.

""Fue una experiencia muy extraña, algo así como sentarse en el museo de cera de Madame Tussauds, pero con estatuas parlantes"", dijo. ""Fue una de las experiencias más increíbles de toda mi vida. Es darse cuenta de que la historia se escribe frente a tus propios ojos.

""No se parece a ninguna de las otras bodas a las que he ido"", añadió. ""Si te gusta ver a la gente famosa, probablemente no hay nada mejor para ello que una boda real. No hay lugar que contenta a tantos famosos y miembros de la realeza bajo un solo techo"".

Larcombe también pudo ser testigo de momentos francos por parte de los royals, incluyendo cómo el príncipe Harry trataba de componerse a sí mismo al lado de su hermano Harry antes de la ceremonia. ""Se veía completamente aterrado"", dijo el periodista, y luego, el silencio total que llenó la iglesia cuando la Duquesa de Cambridge finalmente entró.

""Todo lo que podíamos escuchar eran los ecos de la muchedumbre de afuera"", dijo.

Si bien Larscombe señala que hubo una espera interminable antes de que iniciara la ceremonia nupcial, el evento bien que valió la pena. No sólo vio cómo se escribía la historia ante sus ojos, sino que se demostró que cada invitado recibía un trato de iguales, sin importar qué tan famoso (o no tan famoso) es.

""Fue muy claro en la boda que no importaba si eras el sultán de Brunei o un tipo que se ha cruzado en (la Real Academia de) Sandhurst con William, o una estrella de Hollywood... todos tuvimos que llegar temprano"", explicó, añadiendo que la Reina fue la última en llegar antes de la novia. ""Supongo que para alguien como Sir Elton John, a quien le encanta ser el centro de la atención, eso fue algo muy humillante"".

Aunque hay mucha emoción por el eventual compromiso y boda de Harry, su ceremonia nupcial será muy diferente a la de su hermano dado que William es el segundo en la línea para heredar el trono y Harry es el quinto (y será el sexto cuando el tercer bebé de William y Catherine nazca). Esto significa que la boda con Markle será un tanto más informal.

El mes pasado una fuente cercana a Harry dijo al US Weekly que se espera que sea una boda de mucho más bajo perfil.

""La pompa y el esplendor es lo menos que Harry quiere"", dijo la fuente a ese sitio. ""Puedo adivinar que se casará en la Capilla de San Jorge en el castillo de Windsor. Con ello, no sería un circo para los medios y le daría al evento el sentido de privacidad que Harry tanto quiere"".

Das ändert sich allerdings gerade, was nicht zuletzt auf Bücher wie „Das geheime Leben der Bäume"", „Gebrauchsanweisung für den Wald"", „Das geheime Netzwerk der Natur"" des schreibenden Försters Peter Wohlleben zurückzuführen ist. Wälder sind für ihn nicht nur „Holzfabriken und Rohstofflager"", sondern auch Lebensräume für viele Tier- und Pflanzenarten, die miteinander verwoben und voneinander abhängig sind. Immer, wenn sie sich artgerecht entfalten können, bieten sie Schutz und Erholung. Mit seinem Engagement setzt er ein hoffnungsvolles Zeichen für die Zukunft, dass das geheime Leben der Wälder und der Bäume weiterhin stattfindet und auch unsere Nachfahren noch staunend zwischen den Bäumen spazieren können.

Der Aufenthalt in der Natur verbessert die Stimmung und entlastet die Atemwege. Deshalb ist es wichtig, in die Stadtbebauung mehr Grün zu integrieren - das beeinflusst positiv Herzschlag und das vegetative Nervensystem. „Es geht dabei nicht um Sauerstoff, sondern offensichtlich um einen Reiz, der unser vegetatives Nervensystem runterfahren lässt"", sagt Peter Falkei, Direktor der Klinik und Poliklinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie am Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) in München. Wenn man durch einen Wald geht, werden die neuronalen Netze „heruntergefahren"". Er vermutet, dass dies mit einem Gefühl von Geborgenheit zu tun hat, einem Schutz vor Lärm und Stress. Auch regenerieren sich Hirnareale, die zuständig für Aufmerksamkeit und Konzentration sind, während eines Spaziergangs, der uns hilft, wieder ins Gleichgewicht zu kommen in der Schräglage der Welt.

Städte machen nervöser und lassen Menschen schlechter schlafen. Auch Lichtverschmutzung ist ein enormes Gesundheitsrisiko. Im Gehirn kommen die beiden Schaltstellen Mandelkern und Cingulum ins Spiel: Der Mandelkern reagiert auf Dinge, die er nicht kennt und nicht verorten kann; das Cingulum macht den Relevanzcheck: Ist etwas wichtig für die eigene Person oder nicht? Aktuelle Studien belegen, dass beide bei Menschen, die in Städten mit mehr als 100.000 Einwohnern aufwachsen, aktiver sind, was zu einer Grundunruhe der Städter führt, „einer Art unproduktiven Aufmerksamkeit"" (Falkei). Meistens sind Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen auf private Stressfaktoren und berufliche Probleme zurückzuführen.

Viele Menschen greifen dann auf Antidepressiva zurück. Laut Depressionsatlas der deutschen Techniker Krankenkasse hat sich zwischen 2000 und 2013 die verschriebene Tagesmenge an Antidepressiva verdreifacht. 2015 zahlten die gesetzlichen Krankenversicherungen dafür rund 750 Millionen Euro an die Pharmaindustrie.

Statt auf Medikamente zu setzen verordnen Ärzte in Japan ihren Patienten Waldtherapien, denn bewusstes Gehen durch den Wald ist gesundheitsfördernd. Inzwischen hat der Trend auch Deutschland erreicht. Auf Usedom darf sich seit September 2017 ein Wald „Kur- und Heilwald"" nennen.

Für 94 Prozent der erwachsenen Deutschen gehören die Natur und insbesondere der Wald zu einem guten Leben. Das ist das Ergebnis einer Studie des Bundesamtes für Naturschutz (BfN) zum Naturbewusstsein der Deutschen, die 2016 erschien. Die Nähe zur Natur ist mit einer größeren Lebenszufriedenheit verbunden.

Bäume haben bis heute nur deshalb überlebt, weil sie eine enorme (Widerstands-)Kraft bzw. Resilienz und genetische Vielfalt innerhalb einer Art aufweisen. „Fest und stark ist nur der Baum, der unablässig Winden ausgesetzt war, denn im Kampf festigen und verstärken sich seine Wurzeln"", schrieb schon der römische Philosoph Seneca. Wo sich Bäume wieder erneuern, erleben sich auch die Menschen als selbst regulierendes Prinzip. Bäume, die bis heute einzigartig sind, dienten den Menschen als Heiligtum, als Nahrungs- und Inspirationsquelle. Prominente Baumliebhaber waren Goethe, Beethoven, Abraham Lincoln, Bismarck, Hermann Hesse, Kurt Tucholsky, Winston Churchill, Ruth Maria Kubitschek oder Michael Gorbatschow.

Der Wald hat heute neben der Holzproduktion seine größte Bedeutung im Klimaschutz - nämlich die (über)lebensnotwendige CO2-Sequestrierung. Deshalb muss eine nachhaltige Optimierung zwischen der Holzproduktion und der Klimawirkung gesucht werden. Viele große private Waldbesitzer in Deutschland haben (häufig im Gegensatz zu den Staatsforsten) seit langem einen hohen Holzvorrat im Wald angestrebt. Damit verbunden ist die Befolgung einer dynamischen Nachhaltigkeitsregel (Holz + CO2-Sequestrierung). In absehbarer Zukunft muss viel weniger Holz geschlagen werden, denn für den Klimaschutz ist es zwingend, die Biomasse im Wald mindestens bis ins Jahr 2150 so hoch wie möglich anwachsen zu lassen.

Der Begriff Nachhaltigkeit kommt aus der Forstwirtschaft und bezeichnet die Nutzung eines regenerierbaren Systems, so dass es in seinen wesentlichen Eigenschaften erhalten bleibt und sich auf natürliche Weise erneuern kann. Der US-amerikanische Songwriter, Country- und Folk-Sänger Songwriter John Denver gründete die Organisation „Plant It 2000"" zur Wiederaufforstung hunderttausender Bäume, der Unternehmer und Umweltaktivist Douglas Tompkins, Gründer und ehemaliger Chef der Textilmarken The North Face und Esprit Holdings Limited, kaufte ein großes Gebiet in Argentinien und Chile auf, um Nationalparks zu schaffen. Und der ehemalige Chefdirigent der Berliner Philharmoniker Claudio Abbado ermöglichte mit zwei Konzerthonoraren die Anpflanzung von 90.000 Bäumen in seiner Heimatstadt Mailand.

In seinem Privatgarten am Landsitz Highgrove spricht Prinz Charles regelmäßig mit seinen Bäumen und behandelt sie fast wie Persönlichkeiten. Zudem setzt er sich seit Jahrzehnten mit seinen Stiftungen für Naturschutz und Artenvielfalt ein.

Als der Reformator Martin Luther im April 1539 in seinem Garten die Bäume betrachtete, sprach er: „Gelobt sei Gott, der Schöpfer, der aus toten verstorbenen Kreaturen im Lenz alles wieder lebendig macht!"" Er liebte Bäume aber nicht nur wegen ihrer Erhabenheit und Schönheit, sondern auch wegen ihres nachhaltigen Nutzens. Sein berühmter Satz „Wenn ich wüsste, dass morgen die Welt unterginge, würde ich heute noch ein Apfelbäumchen pflanzen."", lässt sich zwar nicht belegbar nachweisen, weil der erste schriftliche Nachweis erst in einem Rundbrief der hessischen Kirche aus dem Jahre 1944 zu finden ist - dennoch wäre diese Aussage sicher in seinem Sinne gewesen.

Ein immerwährender Neuanfang.

Like adults, all children will have different reactions to a traumatic event, and how they react may depend on a combination of their age, personality and previous life experience.
The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.
“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.
“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.","And the risk of them subsequently developing the anxiety disorder PTSD is particularly high if the child’s family is facing poverty, unemployment or housing issues.

But actually more than two thirds of children in the UK are likely to have experienced a traumatic event by the age of 16, according to chartered clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan, who helped to write the guide for social workers looking after the families affected by the Grenfell Tower fire .

Often associated with veterans returning from war zones, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may not seem like something that might affect a child.

Like adults, all children will have different reactions to a traumatic event, and how they react may depend on a combination of their age, personality and previous life experience.

But children are unlikely to know that they are suffering, and so will require parents to help them understand what they are going through.

Why might a child suffer from PTSD?

The charity PTSD UK says that at the most basic level, PTSD is a “memory filing error” caused by a traumatic event, which and can affect anyone, regardless of their age.

In fact one in three teenagers who survives a serious car crash and 40% of people who have lost a loved one suddenly will experience PTSD.

According to PTSD UK the defining characteristic of a traumatic event is whether or not it has the “capacity to provoke fear, helplessness, or horror in response to the threat of injury or death” so consider the event in those terms.

Young people are just as vulnerable to these triggers as adults.

“PTSD can occur after directly or indirectly experiencing a traumatic event that puts you or someone close to you at risk of serious harm or death,” said Dr Rosan, programme lead at the Mental Health Foundation.

“This can be anything from a road accident, to experiencing or witnessing violence or human accidents.”

What are the signs of PTSD in a child?

As with adults, the way children react to a trauma is likely to be individual to them as a person, but there are some tell-tale symptoms of PTSD that parents can be alert to.

Dr Rosan advised that it is likely children, who are older than toddlers, will experience a physical response, with symptoms such as an increased heart rate, sweating, rapid breathing and changes in appetite.

Your child might also become preoccupied with thoughts or images of the event or start experiencing nightmares and worrying that it will happen again.

“You may notice that they are less able to concentrate or they become easily distracted,” said Dr Rosan.

“A sudden onset of intense emotions is also to be expected – such as fearfulness, increased anxiety, anger or irritability.”

For younger children, physical symptoms might not be reported in these terms and instead they might tell you they have a headache or stomach ache.

“There may also be changes in their behaviour such as becoming jumpy, finding it hard to sleep, having temper tantrums or being disobedient, or being overly clingy compared to usual,” said Dr Rosan.

“Regressive behaviours are common, such as a resurgence of bedwetting or thumb-sucking.”

Charlize Theron, Jack Nicholson o Demi Moore han sido víctimas de los matones de instituto. A esos nombres se suma Winona Ryder que, según relata la actriz en su biografía, recibió una paliza en el instituto por el simple hecho de llevar una cazadora de chico. Ahora, una usuaria de Twitter ha recuperado su historia y se ha vuelto viral.

""Llevaba una vieja sudadera de chico deI Ejército de Salvación"", recuerda la actriz. ""Fui al baño y escuché 'Hey, maricón'. Entonces me estamparon la cabeza en una taquilla, me caí al suelo y empezaron a patearme. Tuve que tener huevos"", detalla la actriz en su relato. Según la publicación, el desenlace de estos acontecimientos fue bastante curioso ya que la expulsaron a ella en lugar de a los matones.

Ryder protagonizaría Beettlejuice unos años después de esto, con solo 17 años, y según se puede leer en la historia, no le costó planear su venganza una vez que logró la fama. ""Al tiempo, fui a una cafetería y me encontré con una de las chicas que me pateó. Me dijo: 'Winona, Winona, ¿me puedes firmar un autógrafo?'. Entonces le dije: '¿Te acuerdas de mí? ¿Te acuerdas que en séptimo pateaste a una niña?' Ella respondió que recordaba 'algo', le dije que era yo y la mandé a tomar por culo"", concluye.

El relato original del tuit —que ha alcanzado en dos días más de 160.000 retuits y 500.000 me gusta— detalla que esto ocurrió el tercer día de clase de séptimo curso en el instituto Kenilworth de Petaluma (California, EEUU) y que terminó con las costillas fracturadas y seis puntos en la cabeza.

Ryder llevaba entonces el pelo corto y usaba ropa para niños debido la influencia de las películas de gánsteres de entonces como Bugsy Malone (1976), por lo que cree que los matones pensaban que era un chico gay. Aunque, a pesar de aclararles que era una chica, estos siguieron molestándola.

Emily Eekhoff bemerkte, dass sich ihr ungeborenes Baby plötzlich anders in ihrem Bauch bewegt

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Swift has yet to respond to the ACLU's letter, as well as HuffPost's request for comment.","Weary of simple pop music spats, Taylor Swift now has a new feuding partner: the ACLU.

The singer has landed in the watchdog organization's crosshairs after her lawyer sent an intimidating letter to the website PopFront regarding a recent article about Swift's popularity among white supremacists.

In a piece titled, ""Swiftly to the alt-right: Taylor subtly gets the lower case kkk in formation,"" writer Meghan Herning argues that Swift's new single ""Look What You Made Me Do"" serves as a ""subtle, quiet white support of a racial hierarchy"" by positioning the singer alongside the history of the eugenics movement and the rise of neo-Nazis.

William J. Briggs, a lawyer representing Swift, wrote in a letter to Herning that her PopFront article is a ""provably false and defamatory story"" that will result in a lawsuit if the website refuses to issue a retraction or take down the post.

""It appears to be a malicious attack against Ms. Swift that goes to great lengths to portray Ms. Swift as some sort of white supremacist figurehead, which is a baseless fiction masquerading as fact and completely misrepresents Ms. Swift,"" Briggs wrote.

The letter also defends Swift's political silence in the last presidential election as a personal choice, as she has ""no obligation to campaign for any particular political candidate or broadcast her political views.""

Herning shared the letter with the ACLU, which is now defending the blogger against any legal threats against her, calling Briggs' claims ""meritless."" In the eyes of the organization, the article is a ""mix of political speech and critical commentary"" that falls within the protections of the First Amendment.

""This is a completely unsupported attempt to suppress constitutionally protected speech,"" Michael Risher, an attorney for ACLU of Northern California, said in a press release.

""Intimidation tactics like these are unacceptable,"" Matt Cagle, another attorney with the organization, added. ""Not in her wildest dreams can Ms. Swift use copyright law to suppress this exposure of a threat to constitutionally protected speech.""

Swift has taken legal action against claims of this nature before. The singer has been heralded as a white supremacist hero in the dark corners of the internet by those who've described the pop star as an ""Aryan goddess."" (Breitbart, a website that has offered a platform for alt-right views, tweeting out the lyrics to her new single certainly didn't help.)

J'avais déjà couru 3 fois le marathon de Paris mais tous les marathoniens rêvent de courir celui de la Grosse Pomme. Il est mythique. C'est le graal!

26 miles en courant, soit 42 km 195, à partir de Staten Island; puis Brooklyn, le Queens, le Bronx et enfin Manhattan. Ça commence avec le fameux pont, le Verrezano Bridge; il est à l'image de la grandeur américaine, immense. Au total, cinq gigantesques ponts à franchir qui te cassent les jambes et qui n'en finissent plus. Pour terminer dans Central Park avec son parcours vallonné! Mais en soi, le marathon commence le jour où tu poses le pied sur le sol américain! Il y a des affiches placardées partout dans les rues, des vidéos sur le marathon dans tous les commerces. La ville vit et vibre pour cet événement! On croise beaucoup de Runners venus du monde entier dans tout Manhattan! Pour moi, ce fut le retrait du dossard la veille qui fut un moment magique. Ce moment dont j'avais tant rêvé!!! J'y étais pour de vrai! Une organisation parfaite. Tout est fait pour t'en mettre plein les yeux, que ça soit du petit goodies (petit gadget) à l'effigie de la course à acheter, jusqu'à la peluche, en passant par tous les styles de vêtements techniques ou non! Dingue!

Pour moi, le retrait du dossard la veille fut un moment magique.

Dimanche 5 novembre: ça y est, c'est le Jour J! Réveil à 5h, transport en bus depuis l'hôtel jusqu'au lieu du départ, je suis déjà concentré sur ma course tout en canalisant mon excitation.

Il y a un monde fou, plus de 50.000 coureurs. Je vous laisse imaginer la sécurité: US marines, police, hélicos, camions bennes et camions poubelles anti-voiture bélier barrant toutes les rues donnant sur le parcours, portiques à métaux filtrant les spectateurs et les coureurs avec fouilles individuelles par les policiers. Évidemment, j'avais encore à l'esprit l'attentat qui avait eu lieu le 31 octobre au sud de Manhattan alors que j'étais à quelques blocs de là quand ça s'est passé et qui avait fait 8 morts et de nombreux blessés; et celui aussi de Boston plusieurs années auparavant durant le marathon. Mais la sécurité était telle qu'on se sentait réellement sécurisés. Notre tour-opérator nous a confié que la municipalité de New York avait envisagé un temps d'annuler le marathon, mais nous n'avions pas été informés de cela directement. Je pense que tout le monde avait malgré tout en tête un gros risque d'attentat.

Une organisation parfaite. Tout est fait pour t'en mettre plein les yeux. La ville vit et vibre pour cet événement!

9h. C'est le départ. Mais avant, l'hymne national américain! Instant solennel et émouvant je l'avoue, même si je ne suis pas américain. Tout événement sportif commence ainsi en Amérique. Il faut reconnaître que ça prend vraiment aux tripes juste avant de s'élancer.

Enfin le coup de canon est tiré pour donner le top départ, avec un survol d'hélico au-dessus de nous!

Je vous laisse imaginer la sécurité: US marines, police, hélicos, camions bennes et camions poubelles anti-voiture bélier.

Les fous du bitumes sont lancés. La musique ""New York, New York"" chantée par Frank Sinatra ouvre la danse de ces dizaines de milliers de jambes qui se mettent en action. Il y aura d'ailleurs des orchestres tout le long du parcours pour en faire une vraie fête. Géniale ambiance! Une foule continue de spectateurs le long du trajet supporte les coureurs par ses encouragements. On crie, on agite des cloches, on hurle, on chante. Il y a même des gens qui nous proposent des bananes coupées, des quartiers d'orange et tas d'autres choses à manger. Je me suis même demandé s'il n'y avait pas des cheesecakes! Bref, tout le monde est avec nous et nous soutient avec un enthousiasme délirant! Ça nous fait supporter les moments tellement difficiles.

Il y aura des orchestres tout le long du parcours pour en faire une vraie fête. Géniale ambiance!

Je portais un T-shirt à l'effigie de mon pays et j'ai donc souvent entendu ""Allez la France!"" avec un accent américain. Ça m'a fait sourire. Mais ça m'a porté. Et les enfants comme les adultes te tendent la main pour que tu la leur tapes sur ton passage!! Ce climat joyeux et fraternel me fait oublier la bruine un peu gênante et me permet de relancer mon allure tout en me donnant des frissons dans les jambes.

Je suis arrivé au bout de 3h30. Je n'avais plus de jus, tant ce marathon-là est difficile en raison de ses lignes droites infinies qui montent; on m'avait prévenu mais la joie et l'émotion d'être finisher m'ont permis d'oublier, encore 24 heures après, mes crampes et mes courbatures; mais j'ai été fier de porter ma médaille autour du cou, comme la tradition le veut à New York, jusqu'au retour en France. On m'a souvent arrêté pour me féliciter et me dire ""YES ,YOU DID IT!""

YES ,YOU DID IT!

Je signe donc, avec encore plus de motivation, pour celui de Londres l'année prochaine même si cela a exigé de ma part beaucoup d'entraînement et de sacrifices pour m'y préparer. Mais voilà, la passion de courir surpasse tout! Cependant, je sais que celui de NYC restera gravé dans ma mémoire comme le plus génial, le plus incroyable, le plus fou!

COME ON MUSLIMS SAY THIS EVERYDAY IN PRAYER. — Rowaida Abdelaziz (@Rowaida_Abdel) October 31, 2017

To hear a spiritual phrase that Muslims use in their everyday lives twisted in this violent way is incredibly frustrating, said Rabiah Ahmed, director of media and public affairs at the Muslim Public Affairs Council.

″[Allahu Akbar] has been used in traditional Muslim prayers for centuries and is used as a peaceful reminder of their religious commitment. They are also the opening words of the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) and is also often used in approval in the same way Christians say Amen,’” Ahmed told HuffPost.

“Its extremely painful and frustrating [to see it misused], and unfortunately, just another example of how our religion is co-opted by those those who act outside of it.”

A Phrase With A Profound Spiritual History

The phrase Allahu akbar has a long history of use within Islam. It expresses a sentiment that is at its heart a theological reflection about humanity’s place in the world: That no matter what trials or victories people face, God is greater than it all.

It appears a few times in the Quran, but only mid-sentence, according to Imam Omar Suleiman, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research. The phrase is more explicit in the sunnah, a set of teachings about the way of life modeled by Islam’s founder, the Prophet Muhammad.

Suleiman pointed in particular to a hadith ― one of the collected reports about the prophet ― where Muhammad is recorded as saying, “Allah is Greater, Mightier than all His creation. He is Mightier than what I fear and dread.”

“What it suggests is that God is greater than all our concerns, God is greater than all that is ascribed to him, greater than all the disappointments we have,” Suleiman said. “God is greater than our pain, God is greater than our material possessions.”

Allahu akbar is an affirmation of a belief in a monotheistic God, Suleiman said ― since it suggests that God has no partners. Belief in absolute monotheism is a core part of orthodox Islamic theology.

The phrase Allahu akbar is also used by non-Muslim Arab speakers, since “Allah” is the Arabic word for God. Some Christians from Syria, Lebanon, and other regions in the Levant, say Allahu akbar to express surprise, excitement, puzzlement or dismay ― in the same way that English speakers may use the phrase “Oh my God.” (It’s not a religious pronouncement for these Christians, however, and some Arab Christians, such as Egypt’s Copts, do not use it.)

From a theological point of view, the idea that God is greater than human circumstances is not limited to Islam. In English, one verse of the Bible declares, “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.”

A popular Christian worship song by the band MercyMe is based on the verse. Another wildly popular Christian song, by the musician Chris Tomlin, states, “Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other.”

Nick Jonas has a symbol representing the words “God is greater than the highs and lows” tattooed on his arm.

Saying Allahu Akbar In Prayer, Joy And Sadness

For Muslims, the phrase Allahu akbar is built into the prayers that are one of the pillars of Islam. It begins the call to prayer, or “adhan.” It’s also used as a verbal transition between the different positions Muslims assume during prayer ― standing up, bowing, kneeling, prostrating on the ground.

“There’s something extremely powerful about saying Allahu akbar and then prostrating yourself, putting your face on the ground in supplication to our creator,” Suleiman said. “In Islam, the greatest position of prayer is prostration ― the more you lower yourself to God, the higher he elevates you.”

Muslim Girl via Getty Images Muslims repeat Allahu akbar as a transition between different positions used during prayer.

Outside of the context of formal prayer, Allahu akbar is also used by Muslims in moments of celebration, such as when someone passes a hard exam or is accepted into college. It is also said in times of sorrow ― such as when a dearly loved one passes away.

The phrase is often the first sound Muslims whisper into a baby’s ears at birth and one of the last sounds they hear during a burial, as a body is lowered into the grave.

Suleiman said that often during Islamic fundraisers, every time someone raises their hand to donate the whole audience will say Allahu akbar in celebration of the act of charity.

The phrase is so much a part of daily life that Qasim Rashid, a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in America, estimates that he’s said it more than 1.6 million times over the course of his life ― just because of the five daily prayers.

“[Praying] five times a day, since I was about seven years old, it comes out to about 1.6 million times over the last 28 years or so,” Rashid told HuffPost. “That doesn’t include when I said Allahu akbar when my kids were born, or when I helped build a hospital, or Michael Jordan made the game winning shot in the NBA finals.”

“It’s part of our celebratory mode, and to believe that it could mean something violent is asinine,” he said.

For the record, ""Allahu Akbar"" has no inherent political/violent connotation meriting instant terror diagnosis.I say it like 20 times a day. — rabia chaudry (@rabiasquared) October 31, 2017

The Consequences Of Misusing The Phrase

Despite the prevalence of this religious concept, Hind Makki, an interfaith educator and activist, told HuffPost said she feels that a stigma has become attached to the phrase in American culture ― particularly when it is said in Arabic.

“It’s one of those Arabic phrases that people who aren’t Muslim or aren’t really familiar with Islam treat with dread because they connect it to a crime,” she said.

“It’s frustrating because we have seen how many mass shootings and mass murders there have been recently and several of the suspects, I would assume have some kind of ideological bent,” she said, referring in particular to the Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, whose rampage in October left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. “But because the person is not from a Muslim background, or didn’t yell Allahu akbar, people are like, ‘We don’t know why he did it.’”

Some Muslims have become wary of saying the phrase, or speaking in Arabic in general, while in public. The feeling of anxiety is felt heavily on planes, where some have reported being taken off flights for speaking in Arabic.

Rashid said that as a result of how the phrase is treated in America, he tries to use it as much as possible around his children.

“I don’t want them to feel intimidated. I feel young Muslims feel intimidated using words like jihad, or Allahu akbar, or even saying ‘assalamu alaikum’ [a common greeting] in public,” he said. “It’s an unfortunate side effect of what’s happening right now.”

Burhaan Kinu via Getty Images Allahu akbar is said during prayer and also in everyday conversations -- as an expression of celebration.

Another side effect of misusing and misunderstanding Islamic phrases is that it leads to fears of a backlash against the Muslim community. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased dramatically since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Allahu akbar has been weaponized in the past by people whose intent is to harm Muslims. In Quebec City, Canada in January, it was reportedly yelled out by a suspect with far-right, white nationalist views during a deadly attack on a mosque community.

This summer, an Italian mayor threatened that anyone who shouts Allahu akbar in a main square in Venice would be immediately shot.

Ahmed, of MPAC, said she believes every terrorist act done in the name of Islam not only takes away innocent lives but also threatens the security of Americans who are Muslim.

“Because there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding about our faith and community, those who seek revenge for these attacks will usually direct their anger toward the first innocent Muslim they see on the streets, at school, and at public places,” she told HuffPost. “Since 9/11, this has been our reality.

Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone.","I grew up saying “Allahu Akbar” numerous times every day.

And no, I wasn’t, and am not, a terrorist.

I wasn’t someone who blew buildings up, killed people or shot a missile from my rocket launcher. As far as the West is concerned, those are the events associated with the saying when something bad is about to happen. People of the West are terrified of the phrase.

I was a Muslim boy trying to pray as many times as he could amidst a life of love and peace, in a home that did not condone any terrorism. My father was a poet who read me love poetry instead of nursery rhymes. He uttered the phrase when he prayed. If love existed in the form of a man, it was my father.

“Love everyone,” was the phrase he uttered almost daily. To him, there was not a problem he couldn’t solve with love.

Allahu Akbar

The saying literally means God is the greatest. It is required of all Muslims to say several times during prayer, which is demanded five times a day. On the average a Muslim ends up saying it hundreds of times. The words are also used as a celebration of life: When a baby is born, when a couple marry or when a veteran returns home safe.

The word Islam means surrender. You’re supposed to surrender to God and worship him. Love, mercy and compassion are uttered several hundred times a day by any Muslim when they say Besm Allah Alrahman Alraheem, In The Name Of God The Merciful The Compassionate. That saying is uttered before you do anything.

So when and why is the phrase Allahu Akbar used as a battle cry, when a terrorist is about to kill someone? The latest incident was the horrific act in New York when the terrorist shouted the phrase before the police shot him, and after he killed eight people and injured many more.

For the majority of Muslims, to shout God’s name as you killed the innocent is an abomination. Muslims no more want innocent people killed than anyone else. So why is the phrase used by terrorists?

For the same reason ISIS and Al-Qaida exist: The misinterpretation of Islam. When you use religion as the motive for you actions, you have the power to appeal to the masses. It’s a brain washing if you will. The terrorists who flew the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11th are no different than any suicide bomber in Israel/Palestine, are no different that the one who mowed down bicyclists in New York. They are people who misunderstood and misused the religion. They are sick and twisted and evil.

The phrase is to remind Muslims that God is supreme. That’s it. It was never to be used as a battle cry during horrendous actions furthering political agendas with evil motives.

My heart sank when I heard the terrorist shouted the saying after the attack. I will never understand the link between Islam and Terrorism. The Islam I grew up amidst condemns such actions. It preaches love and peace and tranquility and feeding the hungry and clothing the poor and sheltering the homeless. One of the five main requirements of Islam in addition to prayer and fasting is to give a percentage of your money to the poor.

Is There A Difference?

To me, there is no difference between the terrorists who shout Allahu Akbar when committing a crime and those white nationalists and racists who shouted “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville ― Virginia recently.

Here’s where the double standard hurts: When that man killed 58 people in Las Vegas, the word terrorist was not uttered by anyone. Why is it only attached to people who claim Islamic affiliation?

The Quran was brought down to Muhammad in the seventh century. The verses which preach war and fighting were contextual and apply to the time when he and his followers had no choice but to fight back, or die. It is no different than the Old Testament which contains many verses preaching war and killing.

In Deuteronomy Chapter 2, Verses 32-37, Moses is told to kill men, women, and children:

“And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Siphon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones , of every city, we left none to remain. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us.”

How is this any different than what’s in the Quran? And why are Muslims judged by a different prism? Most of the Quran preaches love and harmony and helping those who have not. Take this for example:

“And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward nor thanks from you.” [76:8-9]

Any ancient religious book can be misunderstood and misrepresented. The Ku Klux Klan said the Jesus was the first Klansman. They burned crosses to spread their ill will. How is that any different?

My Sister

Karim Shamsi-Basha My sisters Mimi, right, and Rowaida.

My sister Rowaida lives in New York. We chatted last night when I wanted to make sure her head covering was not causing any problems. In the past when terrorists committed atrocities in the name of Islam, women with head coverings were profiled. She said everything was fine, and prayed for those people affected by the terror.

My sister prayed for them.

She is a teacher and her husband is an architect. All they want is food, water, and a roof over their heads, and for their children to thrive. They have four: a computer scientist, a doctor, a physical therapist, and a pharmacist. They love like anyone else, and they have compassion and mercy and empathy like anyone else.

The covering on her head says two things: Modesty and humility.

A Wish Or Two

I have one wish, well maybe two.

The first is for my children to thrive and go through life without any judgment based on their last name.

The second is for this world to know that Muslims mean no one any harm. The people who mean harm are as far from Islam as the KKK is far from Christianity.

The launch of the white and blue bus bearing Hanson's face constitutes a late joining of the Queensland election trail for the senator as she was caught out of the country on a parliamentary trip to India when the Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called the election.

Hanson confirmed a preference deal with the Katter's Australian Party ahead of Labor and the LNP but would not confirm whether the two parties would vote together as a block in the next state parliament.

""I think it's time for One Nation and honestly I think this is going to be bigger than what it was in 1998,"" she told reporters in Brisbane before the bus took off.

The Battler Bus also includes a hashtag for people to follow on social media, #PeopleB4Politics.

A quick search of the hashtag did not find a flood of One Nation mentions; rather it has been used in United Kingdom in a campaign to protect the rights of millions of European citizens who live in the UK but will be affected by Brexit.

The 100-foot-long void, which is roughly the length of an NBA court, was found by an international team of scientists who announced the results of their findings in the journal Nature on Thursday.

“We don’t know if it’s a chamber, a tunnel, a big gallery or things like that,” Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of the Scan Pyramids project, which published the finding, told the New York Times. “We have chosen the word ‘void’ and nothing else because we don’t know what this void is.”

Mohamed Abd El Ghany / Reuters Researchers examining the Great Pyramid of Giza say they have found a 100-foot-long cavity inside.

The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as Khufu’s Pyramid for its builder, a 4th Dynasty pharaoh, is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids.

According to the article in Nature, the chamber is located above the pyramid’s Grand Gallery, which is a sloping passageway between the King’s Chamber and the smaller Queen’s Chamber. Though it’s not yet known what this chamber was used for, researchers suspect it is likely empty.

“There’s zero chance of hidden burial chambers,” Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the United Kingdom’s University of Bristol, said in the Nature report.

Dodson reasons that they have already found the pyramid’s burial chamber, which holds a sarcophagus. He suspects that this large room is a “relieving chamber,” which is designed to reduce weight above the Grand Gallery.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images The Grand Gallery, identified with the number 10, is seen sloping between the King’s Chamber (number 12) and the smaller Queen’s Chamber (number 8). The void was detected directly above the Grand Gallery.

According to Tayoubi, people have wondered for hundreds of years if there could be hidden chambers inside of the pyramid.

It was his own curiosity about the subject that prompted Scan Pyramids to position equipment inside the pyramid that is able to detect subatomic particles called muons, which are able to pass through the pyramid.

The muon detectors were placed inside the Queen’s Chamber and directed to record the muons’ locations and activity throughout the structure. Because the particles are partially absorbed by the stone, areas inside of the pyramid found with larger than normal collections of muons suggested a large space, the report states.

Patrick CHAPUIS via Getty Images A view inside of the pyramid's Grand Gallery is seen in a photo taken in 2005.

After several months of monitoring the detectors, “we had an unexpected line,” Tayoubi said in the report.

To back up the equipment’s findings, two other teams of physicists from France and Japan placed different types of muon detectors both inside and outside the pyramid. Those detectors reported the same void above the Grand Gallery.

“It was a big surprise,” says Tayoubi. “We’re really excited.”

We are what we eat or so the famous saying goes. For those living in countries with poor population nutrition like India, this saying has more ironic significance than we can imagine. In India, it is estimated that half of Indian women age 15-49 (48 percent) and 43 percent of Indian men age 15-49 are undernourished. Arguably, a third of women of reproductive age in India is undernourished. In children under 5, statistics reveal that stunting is seen in 48 per cent while 43 per cent are underweight and wasting is common in close to 20 per cent. Hence, India is what it eats. It seems either hungry or without sufficiently nutritious food.

While governments ignore or dismiss these statistics, what they often do not realise is that poor nutrition is a leading cause of vulnerability to diseases. Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases. Take the case of Tuberculosis of TB- one of India's top killers.

TB is easily diagnosed and treated, yet it kills lakhs of Indians each year. Several studies globally, and in India, illustrate that social, behavioural, economic and environmental factors like undernutrition, indoor air pollution, smoking and alcohol addiction act as facilitating factors to the spread of TB.

Nutrition has a critical role in both determining immunity and the ability to recover from diseases

Of these, undernutrition is the single-most important predisposing factor for TB in India. Hence, a significant section of India's population has poor nutrition and resultantly poor immunity to the TB bacteria. Not surprisingly, like undernutrition, TB exists in India at an epic scale, most often affecting those among the age group of 15-55 — an individual's most productive age.

With undernutrition we essentially create large masses with increased vulnerability to TB and other diseases. This, along with poor infection control and limited awareness, creates disease epidemics such as TB in India. Nutrition also affects recovery from disease. In the case of TB, poor nutrition also affects recovery from TB and increases drug toxicity, relapse and death once TB develops. As a result patients with poor nutritional levels are likely to show poorer performance on TB treatment because of poor muscle strength. There is always a higher risk of TB relapse among such patients as well. Appropriate nutritional intake is critical to ensure treatment completion as well as a faster road to recovery.

When considering India's significant TB crisis, it is clear that new technologies, quick and early diagnosis and less toxic treatments are critical to address India's TB epidemic. With a vast number of people affected, this is needed urgently. An accompanying though more fundamental question, what about addressing hunger and nutrition? How can we comprehensively address TB in the long-term without addressing the nutritional status of the population and ensuring immunity? Until we do so, are we not setting a near-impossible task for ourselves with a large and vulnerable population? Unless we address the root cause, will faster diagnosis and improved treatment alone end TB in India?

India needs food security for increased immunity for all diseases including TB. Why? The answers are simple. First and foremost, hunger and poor nutrition should be morally unacceptable in largely poor countries like India. If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority. Without food, words like vikas are meaningless. Also, continued malnutrition and hunger increase vulnerability, thereby increasing disease prevalence, and consequently human suffering, burdening the health system and society at large. This has staggering human, economic and social consequences that perpetuate inequity—something that should be unacceptable as well. From a purely economic view, it causes increased suffering, loss of wages, unemployment, debt and financial desperation — undesirables in India's fantastic march towards vikas.

If the state cannot feed its people, it loses all moral right to exercise authority

It's time India thought of significant investment in nutrition as the foundational basis of a population's well-being, social justice, economic growth and as a preventive strategy for all diseases. Some solutions that India must consider are universal food security. This, of course, is fraught with challenges both in relation to implementation and in funding. However, these challenges cannot be used as the basis of reneging on this essential and beneficial strategy.

Too often there are too many ineffective schemes.We need to re-examine, link and innovate programmes run by various ministries, including health and women & child development among others. This is possible if we mainstream nutrition and food security for all beneficiary groups and not just those affected by diseases. For those affected by diseases, we need to provide long-term specialised nutritional support and supervision through programmes that ensure sufficient nutrition.

It's time to go back to basics and recognise that nutrition is the fundamental building block not just for disease prevention but the nation itself. Until we do so our claims to eliminate TB or any other disease will remain hollow. And our march towards vikas will be like a never-ending one to a mythical heaven.

Mais en France aussi le CSA s'intéresse de près au programme de M6.

Comme l'a appris Le HuffPost ce lundi, l'émission de Stéphane Plaza est ""mise sous surveillance"" depuis septembre par le Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel français.

Le conseil a commencé à s'intéresser au programme de M6 en février dernier. À l'époque, une quinzaine de signalements a été envoyée après la diffusion d'un ""choc des champions"" en prime-time (celui-la même qui a fait réagir le CSA belge). Les commentaires de la voix off de l'émission sur le physique de participantes et notamment sur une professionnelle de l'immobilier avaient vivement faire réagir les téléspectateurs.

""On a considéré à l'époque qu'il n'y avait pas assez d'éléments de droit et que ça pouvait être un dérapage à caractère humoristique et occasionnel, a confié le CSA au HuffPost. Mais ça a été une alerte pour nous. Le conseil a ensuite été saisi par les téléspectateurs lors de la diffusion d'autres épisodes de 'Chasseurs d'appart''. Ces alertes régulières sur ce programme ont poussé le CSA à s'auto-saisir. Depuis la rentrée, nos équipes regardent régulièrement l'émission et le conseil donnera ses conclusions en décembre.""

""Si le sexisme devient un ressort éditorial, ça peut poser problème au conseil', a ajouté le gendarme de l'audiovisuel.

En Belgique, un décret de juillet 2016 de la Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles interdit les programmes portant atteinte au respect de l'égalité entre les femmes et les hommes. En France, depuis la loi du 4 août 2014, le CSA est aussi compétent pour veiller à ""l'égalité réelle entre les femmes et les hommes"" et à la lutte contre les préjugés sexistes et les violences faites aux femmes.

En 2016, le gendarme de l'audiovisuel a d'ailleurs épinglé la téléréalité dans ce domaine. ""Les Anges"", ""Bachelor"" ou ""Les Marseillais"" ont valu à NRJ12, NT1 et W9 un coup de semonce après un visionnage régulier de ces émissions.

Le Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel a la capacité de s'auto-saisir s'il reçoit des alertes régulières sur un programme. Le dernier exemple en date est sans doute la surveillance de Radio Courtoisie suite aux propos ouvertement racistes et négationnistes de son président (et candidat à la présidentielle de 2017) Henry de Lesquen. Comme le rappelle lemonde.fr, l'autorité a d'abord été interpellée par des citoyens sur le contenu du compte Twitter d'Henry de Lesquen, mais le conseil n'était compétent que sur les propos tenus à l'antenne.

Under fire for suggesting that the use of feminine brand names would boost liquor sales, Maharashtra minister Girish Mahajan on Monday apologised for his remarks and said he did not intend to hurt the sentiments of women.

The remarks, at an event organised by a sugar mill in North Maharashtra's Nandurbar district on Saturday, were made in a lighter vein, he said.

""I regret my remarks. I express my apologies. It wasn't my intention to hurt women's sentiments,"" Mahajan, who handles the water resources portfolio, told reporters at a hurriedly convened press conference here.

""This (my remarks) is a mistake which happened unintentionally. It was not my intention to hurt anyone,"" he said.

What he said wasn't aimed at causing pain to women, the minister said.

""It was said in the flow of things, in a lighter vein,"" he added.

""If you want alcohol or any products' demand to rise, name it after a woman and see how demand soars,"" he had said on Saturday while attending an event of a sugar factory which also produces liquor under the brand name 'Maharaja'.

A video of his speech was uploaded on YouTube.

A police complaint has been filed in Chandrapur district against Mahajan for the alleged derogatory statement.

NCP state spokesperson Nawab Malik criticised Mahajan for his remarks.

""I think the minister is a habitual drinker and we appeal to all the women in Maharashtra to come out and fight against such a mindset,"" Malik said.

In an editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamana today, the Shiv Sena also took potshots at Mahajan.

""In a lot of places in Maharashtra, women are protesting against the sale of liquor.

Ist man aber von Beruf Erzieherin, rate ich dringend davon ab.

So findet man nämlich dort Posts, in denen eine Mutter von ihrem erschütterten Vertrauen zu der Erzieherin ihres Sohnes berichtet, weil diese ihn im KiGa beim Essen für 2 Minuten vor die Tür gesetzt hat, da er sich dort angefangen hatte zu prügeln.

Das Kind wäre jetzt emotional total am Boden... Musste das Zimmer verlassen, bis die Erzieherin nach kam, um die Situation mit dem Kind in Ruhe zu klären. Sie fühle sich überhaupt nicht mehr wohl jetzt dort.

Muss man hier schon etwas schmunzeln, so liest man am besten nicht weiter, was andere Mütter darunter schreiben:

""Das ist verletzte Aufsichtspflicht! Dafür kannst du sie kündigen lassen!""

""Melde das dem Träger.""

""Erkundige dich beim Rechtsanwalt.""

""Vielleicht kann man den KiGa deshalb schließen lassen, frag mal bei Jugendamt nach.""

Ungelogen.

Alltag im Kindergarten

Ich habe mir also ein Herz gefasst und versucht zu erklären, wie eine Essenssituation im KiGa abläuft:

20 Kinder sitzen um einen Tisch und warten darauf, dass du jedem von Ihnen das Essen austeilst. Nebenbei rufen die ersten schon wieder nach was zu trinken, weil ihr Glas schon ausgetrunken ist. Ein kleineres Kind braucht Hilfe dabei, sein Fleisch zu schneiden.

Ein weiteres jammert darüber, dass ihm das Essen nicht schmeckt. Der Nebenmann schmeißt das Glas um, die Pfütze muss aufgewischt werden. Wieder leere Trinkgläser. Zwei Kinder streiten, weil einer eine Nudel vom Teller des anderen geklaut hat und die zwei daneben bewerfen sich giggelnd mit ihrem Essen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wir Erzieher stehen jeden Tag kurz vor dem Burnout

So... Ist es da nicht vielleicht gar nicht soooooo unverständlich, dass das Kind kurz draußen warten soll, bis alle versorgt sind, damit die Erzieherin dann in Ruhe mit ihm sprechen kann um die Situation zu klären? Vor allem, wenn die Gruppentüre ein Glasfenster hat, um sehen zu können, was draußen vor sich geht?

Ich habe für diese Darstellung viele ""Likes"" bekommen, hauptsächlich von anderen Erzieherinnen. Von den anderen wurde meine Sicht der Dinge ignoriert. Ganz klar, sonst kann man sich ja nicht weiter aufregen.

Keine Ahnung von den Aufgaben der Erzieher

Nun könnte man meinen, dieses Phänomen tritt nur im Internet auf. Aber nein.

Zurück in der Arbeitswelt, kann ich nur noch Kopfschütteln. Und es wird mit jedem Jahr nur schlimmer... KiGa-Bashing, das neue Hobby vieler Eltern. Eine ganz neue Art des Mobbing ist geboren.

Als Erzieher ist es heutzutage kaum mehr möglich, sich auf die Bedürfnisse der Kinder zu konzentrieren, da einige Eltern ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse beim Personal an erster Stelle sehen.

Es ist nicht mehr möglich, überhaupt irgendetwas richtig zu machen, deshalb verbringt man gefühlte Stunden damit, sich morgens oder mittags vor Eltern im Flur zu rechtfertigen, warum dieses oder jenes so passiert ist.

So kommt zum Beispiel eine Mutter mit der Beschwerde, man habe ihr am Vortag nicht gesagt, dass ihr Kind im Flur beim Anziehen Streit angefangen habe. Sie möchte so etwas aber bitte dringend immer sofort mitgeteilt bekommen, denn schließlich möchte sie dann mit ihrem Kind darüber reden können, dass man so etwas nicht tut.

Ok... das ist jetzt zum Beispiel eine der Aufgaben, die ein Erzieher eigentlich hat: Hilfe bei der Konfliktlösung. Vielleicht habe das aber auch bloß ich falsch verstanden.

Jedenfalls wird bei dieser Beschwerde und gleichzeitigen Bitte anscheinend übersehen, dass wir nicht nur ein Kind betreuen. Und bei einer Gruppe von 20 Kindern würde es ziemlich viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen, jeder Mutter beim Abholen einen Bericht darüber zu erstatten, wann ihr Kind sich gestritten hat. Denn sind wir mal ehrlich: Kinder streiten ständig!

Auch kommt es manchmal vor, dass ein Kind dabei ausholt, und dem andern Kind ""eine scheppert"". Natürlich greifen wir Erzieher dann ein (selten schaffen wir das, bevor es ""klatsch"" gemacht hat, wir sind Menschen, keine Fantasyfiguren mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit), erklären, dass man dem andern nicht weh tun darf und zeigen alternative Handlungsmöglichkeiten auf.

Wir überprüfen, ob sich der andere weh getan hat, reichen Kühlbeutel und Kügelchen.

Beim Abholen werden Eltern von ""Täter"" und ""Opfer"" informiert, damit sie Bescheid wissen, falls Ihre Kinder daheim davon erzählen. Passt, oder? Nein, passt nicht.

Drohungen und Beleidigungen gegen das Personal

Greift ein Kind noch zwei mal öfter darauf zurück, sich körperlich zu wehren oder zu äußern, gibt es schon nach kürzester Zeit die lautstarke Forderung von Eltern, dieses Kind dem Jugendamt zu melden.

Es wird von einer Gefahrenlage im Kindergarten gesprochen. Ja, es wird sogar der Kindergarten gewechselt. Weil das ja sonst nirgends vorkommt oder toleriert wird! Nur hier ist das so.

Dass es sich hierbei um Kinder handelt, die zwei Minuten nach ihrem Streit wieder miteinander spielen und keiner dabei verletzt wurde, vergessen die Eltern hierbei leider komplett.

Natürlich gibt es auch Kinder, die tatsächlich Bedürfnisse haben, die ihr derzeitiger Kindergarten nicht erfüllen kann. Je nachdem worum es dabei geht, und vor allem, wenn so viel ""körperliches Verhalten"" im Spiel ist, kann man den Eltern dann also höflich ans Herz legen, dass heilpädagogisch geschultes Personal ihrem Kind besser dabei helfen kann, seine Konflikte zu bewältigen.

Dabei lässt man dann ganz bewusst weg, dass ihr Kind nicht aufgrund von Hochbegabung ""unterfordert"" ist, wie von den Eltern geschildert, sondern das Problem wo anders liegt.

Wenn's so einfach denn wäre... Nein.

""Was für ein unfähiges Personal kommt jetzt nicht mit meinem Kind zurecht? Dieser Kindergarten ist das Allerletzte! Andere müssen vor euch gewarnt werden!""

Wenn man dann als privater Kindergarten auch noch das Recht hat, den Betreuungsvertrag zu kündigen, weil man mit den Eltern zusammen im Gespräch nicht weiter kommt und sich angemessene Hilfe für das Kind wünscht (und andere Eltern berechtigterweise schon mit dem Jugendamt drohen) erreicht der Frust dieser Eltern ganz neue Dimensionen.

Drohungen, den Kindergarten bei der Familienministerin zu melden. Beim Landesjugendamt über das unfähige Personal informieren wollen.

Ja, solche Drohungen gehören mittlerweile zum Alltag eines Erziehers.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Die Eltern werden dir die Hölle heiß machen"" - das habe ich in 40 Jahren als Erzieherin gelernt

Erzieher sollen sich aber ganz selbstverständlich beißen lassen, wenn man versucht, das Kind zu beruhigen. Immerhin sind wir ja selber schuld, unfähig wie wir sind.

Organisierte Elternbanden

Man könnte jetzt sagen: Ok, vielleicht ist das ein Problem der privaten Einrichtungen. Aber nein! Die Kollegin aus dem Regelkindergarten erzählt, dass sie einen Papa im Garten neulich fragte, warum er mit seinem Handy Fotos der dort zum Spielen vorhandenen Fahrräder macht.

Sie wurde dann darüber aufgeklärt, dass sein Kind sich an einem Fahrrad in den Finger geschnitten hat. Drei Tage später kam ein Brief vom Rechtsanwalt der gegen den Kindergarten klagt, weil bei einem Fahrrad am Lenker der Gummigriff fehlte und sich das Kind dort verletzt habe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eltern: Hört auf, eure Kinder zu verweichlichten Menschen zu erziehen

Oder aber organisierte Elternbanden, die sich beim Bürgermeister beschweren, weil der Kindergarten sich pädagogisch begründet weigert, das Vorschulprogramm nach den Vorstellungen einzelner Eltern für alle zu erweitern.

Wenn ich also morgens aufstehe und mich für die Arbeit fertig mache denke ich mir nicht: Oh ja, heute backe ich Kuchen mit den Kids! Sondern: Mal sehen, was mich heute wieder davon abhält, Kuchen mit den Kids zu backen.

Die traurige Wahrheit ist: Die ganze Zeit, die wir damit verbringen, uns mit solchen Dingen herumzuschlagen, verbringen wir eben nicht bei den Kindern.

Aber liebe Eltern, was glaubt ihr denn, wem ihr hier eure Kinder anvertraut? Sind wir auf das viele Geld aus, dass man als Erzieher verdient? Bekommt man einen Erzieherabschluss durchs Beantworten von Multiple-Choice-Fragen im Internet?

Wir wollen für eure Kinder da sein

Erzieher sind Menschen, die es sich zum Beruf gemacht haben, für eure Kinder da zu sein. Wir wollen sie umsorgen, ihnen etwas beibringen und ihnen einen geborgenen Raum für ihre Entwicklung schaffen.

Die ganze Negativität, die tagtäglich über das ""Nichts-recht-machen-können"" in unseren Gruppenalltag eindringt, verstört Kinder und Personal.

Wir opfern unsere Freizeit, um Spielzeug für Eure Kinder zu basteln, um Feste vorzubereiten und um uns Beschäftigungen mit Lerneffekt auszudenken.

Die geopferte Freizeit wird aber mit jedem mal Drama etwas weniger. Denn ganz ehrlich: Wer hat schon Lust, sich unbezahlt Gedanken über die Arbeit zu machen, wenn man als Dank dafür schlecht gemacht wird und sich beleidigen lassen muss?

Liebe besagte Eltern, seht ihr nicht, dass ihr höchstpersönlich dafür sorgt, dass die Qualität schlechter und die Geduld weniger wird, die wir gerne für eure Kinder übrig hätten?

Jedem, der sich in diesen Beispielen mit ähnlichem Verhalten wiedererkennt, möchte ich sagen:

Ihr seid die Tyrannen, die ihren Anteil am Personalnotstand der Kindergärten haben.

Wer möchte schon freiwillig unter solchen Umständen arbeiten?!

Es gibt sie noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern

Abschließend möchte ich aber dringend betonen: Es gibt sie natürlich noch, die ""normalen"" Eltern!

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens nicht aufstehe, um mir zu überlegen, wie ich sie ärgern kann oder ihr Kind negativ in seiner Entwicklung beeinflussen kann.

Die Eltern, die wissen, dass ich morgens aufstehe, weil ich ihre Kinder liebe, und nur das Beste für die mir anvertrauten kleinen Menschen will.

Die Eltern, die ""Danke"" sagen.

Die Eltern, die mir nicht sofort böse Absicht unterstellen, wenn tatsächlich mal ein Fehler passiert.

Die Eltern, die zu vernünftigen Gesprächen bereit sind, wenn es ein Problem gibt.

Bitte, liebe ""normale"" Eltern! Ihr müsst endlich lauter sein als die Dauer-Motzer und Drama-Verursacher! Damit wir weiterhin wissen, warum wir morgens aufstehen und nicht irgendwann resignieren.

Der Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad warnt eindringlich vor dem politischen Islam

Dieser würde die Integration von muslimischen Migranten in Deutschland massiv behindern

Auch die katholische und evangelische Kirche trügen daran eine Mitschuld

Der ägyptisch-deutsche Politikwissenschaftler Hamed Abdel-Samad hat vor dem politischen Islam in Deutschland gewarnt. Insbesondere kritisierte er den größten Moscheeverein in Deutschland, die von der Türkei dominierte Ditib.

Auf einer Veranstaltung der “Passauer Neuen Presse” sagte er am Montagabend, Ditib stehe für einen Islam, mit dem muslimische Migranten in Deutschland nicht erfolgreich mit einbezogen werden könnten. Das Ziel dieses politischen Islam sei “niemals die Integration der Muslime“.

Auch wenn sich islamische Organisationen in Deutschland oft als offizielle Repräsentanten der hierzulande lebenden Muslime darstellen würden, habe das nichts mit der Realität zu tun.

Abdel-Samad begründet das damit, dass nur ein kleiner Teil der fünf Millionen Muslime in Deutschland Mitglieder solcher Verbände sind. Für eine gelungene Integration sei es viel wichtiger auf die einzelnen Individuen einzugehen, als auf politische Gruppierungen.

Oft geäußerte Kritik

Wenn Abdel-Samad so etwas sagt, erzeugt das immer Aufmerksamkeit in Deutschland. Der Politologe ist für seine harte Haltung ebenso bekannt wie umstritten.

Neues hat sein Beitrag am Montagabend in der Diskussion denn auch nicht gebracht. Dass die türkische Regierung über Ditib Einfluss in Deutschland zu nehmen versucht, ist bekannt. Der Glaubensverband steht hierzulande schon länger in der Kritik. Unter anderem werden Imamen von Ditib Spionage für die türkische Regierung vorgeworfen.

Gleichwohl hält Abdel-Samad damit eine Diskussion am Laufen, die tatsächlich geführt werden muss. Zuletzt hatte etwa der CDU-Politiker Jens Spahn in harschen Worten angemahnt, die Zusammenarbeit mit den Islamverbänden zu überprüfen.

Dabei geht es darum, wie der Islam in Deutschland in der Gesellschaft vertreten werden soll, wer für Muslime sprechen kann und darf.

Denn klar ist: Muslime sind traditionell weniger hierarchisch organisiert als etwa die Christen.

""Die Kirche macht sich mitschuldig""

Abdel-Samad nahm am Montag auch die Kirchen in die Pflicht. Auch sie setzen seiner Ansicht nach zu stark auf Verbände wie die Ditib.

Er warf Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, dem Landesbischof der evangelischen Kirche in Bayern, Fehler im Umgang mit der Ditib vor.

So habe seine Kirche zur Gedenkfeier nach dem Terroranschlag auf dem Breitscheidplatz in Berlin 2016 einen Imam eingeladen, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt vom Verfassungsschutz beobachtet wurde.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Der Islam ist kein Problem, das man lösen muss""

“Indem man solche Leute hoffähig macht, macht man sich als Kirche mitschuldig”, so Abdel-Samad. Die Kirche würde keinerlei Konsequenzen im Umgang mit Ditib folgen lassen, und das obwohl man um ihre problematische Rolle wisse.

Bedford-Strohm argumentierte, man wisse um die Kritik - aber deswegen werde man den Dialog nicht abreißen lassen. Denn er sei unabdingbar.

Doch Abdel-Samad wehrt sich gegen solche Kompromisse. Nur mehr Ehrlichkeit mit dem Islam und mit seinen Vertretern in Deutschland könne zu einer besseren Integration führen.

And now that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's inevitable engagement looms near, your fantasies have likely kicked into overdrive.

But while we can only imagine what it's like to be a wedding guest, journalist Duncan Larcombe knows first-hand how glamourous the affair actually is.

Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on their wedding day, April 29, 2011.

While we were glued to our TV screens watching Kate Middleton and Prince William get hitched in April 2011, Larcombe was actually among the 1,900 people at the service in Westminster Abbey.

The former royal editor of The Sun was one of six journalists who attended the nuptials. ""We were told in advance about two or three weeks before that we were invited, but we were told not to tell anybody,"" he told Elle U.K. in a recent interview. ""They wouldn't have wanted word to get out amongst other journalists.""

It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork.

So what was it like being among so many royals at the ceremony? According to Larcombe, it was just as surreal as we imagine.

""It's a very weird experience, kind of like sitting in Madame Tussauds with moving waxwork,"" he said. ""It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. You know when you're there that you're watching history unfold in front of your eyes.""

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge kissing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace.

""It's not like any wedding I've ever been to,"" he added. ""If you like people watching there's probably nothing better than a royal wedding. There isn't a room that has that many famous and royal people all under one roof.""

Larcombe also got to witness candid moments among the royals, including Prince William trying to compose himself beside brother Prince Harry before the ceremony (""[He] looked absolutely terrified""), and when complete silence filled the church when the Duchess of Cambridge finally arrived.

""All we could hear was the echoes of the crowds outside,"" he said.

Crowds gather on the mall prior to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.

While Larcombe admitted that there was a lot of waiting around for the nuptials to begin, the event was well worth it. Not only did he get to see history in the making, but he revealed that every guest was treated as an equal — no matter how famous (or not famous) they were.

""It was quite clear at the wedding that no matter if you were the Sultan of Brunei or a guy who's been at Sandhurst with William, or a big Hollywood star, everyone got there early,"" he explained, noting that the Queen was the last to arrive and then the bride. ""I think for someone like Sir Elton John, who is normally one to be the centre of attention, it was probably quite humbling.""

Elton John (C) and partner David Furnish (L) attend the wedding service for Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Although there's much excitement over Prince Harry's possible engagement and wedding, his nuptials will likely be very different from his brother's, considering Harry is fifth-in-line (sixth-in-line when William and Catherine's third child arrives) to the throne and William is second. This means his and Markle's wedding will likely be more informal.

Keep Up With The Royals

Get our weekly email round-up of all things Royal.



Last month, a source close to Harry told Us Weekly that a low-key wedding is more his style.

""Pomp and pageantry is the last thing he would want,"" the insider told the site. ""I can see him wanting to get married at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. It would stop it from turning into a total media circus and give the day a sense of privacy that Harry so badly craves.""

Only time will tell what Harry's wedding will actually be like. Here's hoping our invites don't get lost in the mail!

En 2017, le secteur public paiera environ 70 pour cent du total des dépenses de santé au pays.

Les médicaments

En 2017, le secteur public financera 42,7 pour cent des dépenses en médicaments prescrits, ce qui représente 14,5 milliards $ sur un total de 39,8 milliards $.

Les médicaments anti-TNF (utilisés dans le traitement des affections telles que la polyarthrite rhumatoïde et la maladie de Crohn) et les nouveaux médicaments contre l'hépatite C étaient les deux principaux responsables de la croissance des dépenses publiques en 2016 : ils ont représenté 20,8 pour cent et 12,6 pour cent de cette croissance, respectivement.

Selon les prévisions, les médicaments prescrits représenteront 85,2 pour cent des dépenses totales en médicaments, tandis que les médicaments sans ordonnance compteront pour les 14,8 pour cent restants. Ces données sur les médicaments excluent le Québec.

Le Canada vs l'international

Le Canada fait partie des pays de l'Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques (OCDE) qui dépensent le plus sur la santé, avec 5782 $ par personne en 2015. Il s'agit de la dernière année pour laquelle des données comparables étaient disponibles.

En 2015, parmi 35 pays sélectionnés de l'OCDE, les États-Unis rapportaient les dépenses les plus élevées, à 11 916 $, et la Nouvelle-Zélande les plus basses, à 4443 $ par personne.

Les dépenses de santé par habitant au Canada en 2015 étaient supérieures à celles de la France (5677 $), de l'Australie (5631 $) et du Royaume-Uni (5170 $).

Les dépenses publiques en médicaments ont été analysées à l'aide des données provenant de 11 autorités compétentes au Canada, soit neuf provinces, un territoire et un régime fédéral administré par la Direction générale de la santé des Premières Nations et des Inuits (DGSPNI).

Les dépenses publiques en médicaments excluent les médicaments fournis dans les hôpitaux et ceux financés par les organismes de lutte contre le cancer ou par d'autres programmes spéciaux. Les dépenses consacrées aux médicaments dans les hôpitaux se sont élevées à 2,1 milliards $.

What do you say about a man who invalidates 86.4 percent of a country's currency overnight, and then keeps coming up with explanations over the next one year to tell the citizens that it was a success?

You don't need to be an economist to realize that if the bulk of currency in a country where transactions are largely carried out in cash (80 to 98 percent, depending on which estimate one takes), is suddenly invalidated, the results will largely be disastrous, a few benefits here and there, notwithstanding.

It has almost been a year since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a late evening broadcast to the nation, invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. The idea was to attack black money and fake currency which were used to finance terrorism.

As the press release accompanying the demonetisation decision put it: ""Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time.""

Modi invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which he said were used to store black money, and then decided to introduce a Rs 2,000 note, making it even more easier for those who have black money, to store some of it, in the form of cash.

Let's look at a few points one by one.

1) The total value of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that were invalidated stood at Rs 15.44 lakh crore. On November 15, 2016, a week after Modi announced the demonetisation decision, the Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the government expected that around Rs 4-5 lakh crore of the invalidated notes won't make it back into the banking system.

The hope was that those who have black money in the form of cash will not deposit it in the banks because they would end up creating an audit trail. This would end up destroying black money. Of course, nothing of that sort happened.

Around 99 per cent of the invalidated currency made it back into banks. This basically meant that what was supposed to be an attack on black money became a big money laundering scheme.

2) Why did this happen? This happened primarily because no basic research was carried out to check if demonetisation could really attack black money. In May 2012, the ministry of finance had published a White Paper on black money. As per data offered in this White Paper, it can be calculated that on an average around 4.9 percent of the black money is held in the form of cash. A bulk of the black money is held in the form of real estate and gold. Hence, by attacking cash/currency, Modi ended up sending the entire country on a merry-go-round. This is what happens when you make a decision that goes against the data that is on offer.

3) In August 2014, Raghuram Rajan, the then governor of the Reserve Bank of India, whom the Modi government let go by not offering a second term, said: ""In the past, demonetisation has been thought of as a way of getting black money out of circulation. Because people then have to come and say 'how do I have this 10 crores in cash sitting in my safe and they have to explain where they got the money from. It is often cited as a solution. Unfortunately, my sense is, the clever find ways around it.""

Rajan further said: ""Black money hoarders find ways to divide their hoard into many smaller pieces...I think there are ways around demonetisation. It is not that easy to flush out the black money.""

Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This is precisely what happened. Those with black money found various ingenious ways to divide their black money into smaller amounts and exchange it. Thus, a decision which was supposed to destroy black money, helped people launder it.

This was before any such proposal for demonetisation was on the table. As Rajan writes in his recently released book I Do What I Do: ""I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetization, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them, and felt there were potentially better alternatives to achieve the main goals. I made these views known in no uncertain terms.""

Of course, PM Modi decided not to listen to the best economist he had at his disposal.

4) No country in a reasonably good economic position has demonetised currency in the past, at the same level that India did. This is primarily because the economics of demonetisation is very complex. This was also overlooked. In short, there was enough evidence available which said that demonetisation as a tool to weed out black money, would not work.

5) Demonetisation was also supposed to ""to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN)."" Take a look at Table 1, which basically lists out the number of fake currency notes that were detected in the banking system.

Table 1: Denomination-wise Counterfeit Notes Detected in the Banking System

(April to March)

(Source: Annual report of the Reserve Bank of India)

The number of fake Rs 500 (old) and Rs 1,000 notes that were detected during the financial year stood at around 5.74 lakh. The total number of demonetised notes stood at around 2,400 crore. This basically means that as a proportion, the fake notes identified between April 2016 to March 2017 stands close to 0 percent of the demonetised notes.

Demonetisation failed to achieve its second big objective. In fact, if you look at Table 1 carefully, fake notes of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 hit the market, soon after demonetisation.

6) In a matter of few weeks it was clear that demonetisation would not achieve its two main objectives. Hence, a third objective was introduced. This was to move towards a cashless society through digital transactions.

As Modi said in the November 2016 edition of the Mann Ki Baat radio programme: ""The great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a 'Cashless Society'. It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible. But why should India not make a beginning in creating a 'less-cash society'? Once we embark on our journey to create a 'less-cash society', the goal of 'cashless society' will not remain very far.""

Indeed, a very noble motive, but at what cost?

How are things looking on this front? Let's first look at the total value of digital transactions. Data for total digital transactions is available up to August 2017 and has been adjusted for real time gross settlement, which can only be used for transactions of Rs 2 lakh or more. Take a look at Figure 1.

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

The total value of digital transactions in August 2017 was more or less similar to the total value of digital transactions before demonetisation. As Figure 1 tells us, digital transactions by value kept increasing between January and August 2016. After that they have gone up and down. This also reflects the overall slowdown of the economy post demonetisation.

How do things look, when it comes to volume of digital transactions? Take a look at Figure 2.

Figure 2:

(Source: Reserve Bank of India)

While, there was a huge one time jump when it comes to the volume of digital transactions post demonetisation, things have remained flattish since then. The initial jump wasn't surprising given that there was barely any cash going around in the financial system. But that growth hasn't sustained.

Hence, the digital goal has not been achieved either. Such a fundamental behavioral change cannot be made overnight. People have to be nudged towards it and not forced, as was the case.

7) In the game of changing goal posts, an increase in the income tax base, has been highlighted as another benefit of demonetisation. The question is, has this increase translated into higher direct tax collections? For the period, April to September 2017, ""Net Direct Tax collections represent 39.4% of the total Budget Estimates of Direct Taxes"". For the same period last year, ""38.65% of the Budget Estimates of direct taxes for FY 2016-17 has been achieved.""

Yes, there has been a marginal improvement in direct tax collection. But this still does not justify the destructive effect that demonetisation had on the economy.

Another point made in the game of changing goal posts is that income tax notices have been sent to many people. So, what? People with black money have access to the best CAs and the best lawyers, and know how the system functions. They aren't exactly sitting there waiting to pay fines and hand over their money to the government.

Also, take a look at Table 2. This tells us very clearly, the limited processing capacity of the Income Tax department.

Table 2:

(Source: Annual Report, Ministry of Finance)

8) There is enough evidence going around by now to say that the informal part of the economy, which dealt in cash, received a huge blow, from which it is yet to come out. The tragedy is that much of this is not reflected in the GDP numbers, given that the GDP numbers tend to measure the formal part of the economy, and not the informal one.

Also, there is a huge contradiction here. The Modi government has been saying that self-employment is the way forward when it comes to jobs. If self-employment is the way forward, then the informal sector needs to be handled with care.

In fact, as former prime minister Manmohan Singh, put it in an interview to Bloomberg Quint: ""The value created by the informal sector will be captured in the form of income, wealth or consumption effects. Hence, we must be cautious about sweeping generalisations about the informal economy and passing moral judgments about the entire sector.""

9) One of the claimed successes of demonetisation has been that the cash to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has come down. In a speech made on October 4, 2017, Modi said: ""Demontisation के बाद Cash to GDP Ratio अब 9 प्रतिशत पर आ गया है। (after demonetisation, the cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent.""

This fall in cash to GDP ratio is being passed off as an achievement and the fact that nation as a whole has become more honest. As Modi said in the speech referred to earlier in the piece: ""भाइयों और बहनों, इस सरकार ने देश में संस्थागत ईमानदारी को मजबूत करने का काम किया है। ये सरकार के अथक परिश्रम का ही परिणाम है कि आज देश की अर्थव्यवस्था कम Cash के साथ चल रही है। (Brothers and sisters, this government has worked to strengthen the institutional honesty of the country. It is due to the tireless hard-work of this government that today the country's economy is running on less cash.)""

For the period of three months ending March 2017 and June 2017, the non-government part of the GDP (which forms around 90 per cent of the GDP) has grown by a little over 4 per cent. When growth in economic activity slows down, the growth in currency in circulation is bound to be impacted as well.

So, yes, the hard work of the government has led to a lower cash to GDP ratio, but at the cost of slowing down economic activity. Hence, claiming this as success, is more of trying to build a narrative around demonetisation being successful, rather than being an actual success of any sort.

10) Another point that is being made is that a lower cash to GDP ratio means that the country has become more honest. Take a look Figure 3. It basically plots the cash to GDP ratio of different countries.

Figure 3:

(Source: https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/curse_of_cash_data)

Japan has the highest cash to GDP ratio at 19.4 per cent. India is nearly half of that at around a little over 10 per cent. Is India a more honest nation than Japan? As per the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2016, Japan is the twentieth least corrupt country in the world. India stands at the 79th position, despite having a much lower cash to GDP ratio.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

Or take the case of Brazil, which has a cash to GDP ratio of 3.31 per cent. Like India, it is the 79th least corrupt country in the world. Then there is the Eurozone (country's which basically use euro as their currency). Their cash to GDP ratio is higher than that of India. Is the Eurozone more corrupt than India?

Hence, the link between a low cash to GDP ratio and low corruption is basically very weak. It is basically something that the Modi government has invented in order to build a positive narrative around demonetisation.

To conclude, one year after demonetisation, all the destruction that was unleashed in its aftermath, could have been avoided, if PM Modi had heard the best economist he had at his disposal, and not an accountant masquerading as one.

INTERNATIONAL - La première tournée du président Trump en Asie est forcément un événement, surtout quand on connaît sa propension à la boulette diplomatique. Après avoir quitté les Etats-Unis le 3 novembre et avoir visité le Japon et la Corée du Sud, il est attendu en Chinen ce mercredi 8 novembre par le président Xi Jinping.

Pékin s'apprête à l'accueillir en très grande pompe, et à lui offrir plus de cérémonial que d'ordinaire. Garde militaire d'honneur, banquet officiel et des milliards de dollars d'accords commerciaux, la Chine veut impressionner.

Un protocole très élaboré qui survient dans un contexte de tensions sur toute une série de sujets, du vaste déficit commercial américain à la gestion par Pékin de la Corée du Nord, son voisin imprévisible.

""C'est un homme puissant"", a dit Donald Trump récemment du président chinois. ""Il se trouve que je pense que c'est un type très bien"", a-t-il ajouté. Pour David Dollar, spécialiste de la Chine à Brookings, il est peu vraisemblable malgré le tapis rouge déroulé que Pékin fasse beaucoup de concessions.

Et pour cause. La Chine voit bien au-delà du déficit commercial américain. Xi Jinping est surtout connu depuis plusieurs années pour son plan à long terme qui vise à remettre en cause l'hégémonie américaine, économique et militaire, au moins en Asie.

Voici comment.

La réouverture des routes de la soie

La route de la soie désigne les anciens itinéraires de commerce entre l'Asie et l'Europe. Par voie de terre et de mer, ces routes auraient été pratiquées dès 2000 avant notre ère, avant d'être progressivement désertées à partir du XVe siècle, puis définitivement après l'ouverture du canal de Suez (1867).

Le grand projet de Xi Jinping est tout simplement de les ressusciter. Le 21 avril 2016, un premier convoi ferré a ainsi rallié Wuhan à Lyon en 15 jours, après un périple de 11.000 kilomètres. Le 23 février, Bernard Cazeneuve, alors Premier ministre de passage en Chine, a assisté à l'arrivée en sens inverse d'un train chargé de bouteilles de Bordeaux et de pièces détachées en provenance des usines PSA.

La Chine a aussi l'intention de financer la construction d'un chapelet de ports, ces anciens comptoirs, qui rallient l'Europe en passant par l'océan indien et la mer méditerranée. Ce n'est pas un hasard si la Chine a racheté le port du Pirée, à Athènes, en janvier 2016. Le groupe Cosco s'est engagé à investir 350 millions d'euros dans ce qui sera son terminus européen.

""Ce qui est nouveau, c'est que le sens des routes de la soie s'est inversé"", analyse Jean-François Di Meglio, président du think tank Asia Centre, interrogé par Europe1. ""La première route de la soie marchait avant tout dans l'intérêt de l'Occident. Cette fois, c'est la Chine qui prend l'initiative et compte en profiter.""

Mi mai, lors du sommet à Pékin sur ""Obor"" (One belt, one road), Xi Jinping a rassemblé un ""G20 réapproprié"", selon les termes de Jean-François Di Meglio, présent pour l'occasion. Vladimir Poutine, Recep Erdogan pour la Turquie, Alexis Tsipras pour la Grèce ou encore la présidente du FMI et le secrétaire général de l'ONU.

En revanche, les Etats-Unis ont décliné l'invitation, tout comme les dirigeants européens du G7, à l'exception de l'italien Paolo Gentiloni. Comme un boycott de la concurrence?

La nouvelle banque chinoise qui bouscule le FMI

C'est le bras armé financier de la nouvelle route de la soie. Face au monopole des Etats-Unis sur les grandes institutions financières internationales que sont le FMI et la Banque mondiale, la Chine a lancé en 2015 la Banque asiatique d'investissement pour les infrastructures (BAII).

Comme pour le FMI, elle compte de nombreux pays actionnaires, 57 au total pour le lancement en 2015. Malgré les réticences et les mises en garde des Etats-Unis, la France, l'Allemagne, le Royaume-Uni, ou l'Italie en font partie, tandis que les Etats-Unis, et le Japon et l'Inde, les deux grands rivaux régionaux, ont décliné l'offre.

Normal, son but est justement de s'affranchir de la tutelle américaine pour décider du financement de grands projets d'infrastructure. Au Pakistan, ce sont des dizaines de milliards de dollars qui financent un véritable ""plan Marschall"" pour créer une route des cols de l'Himalaya au port de Gwadar.

En Ethiopie, le port de Djibouti s'est aussi mis au chinois sous l'impulsion de grands travaux, tandis qu'une ligne de chemin de fer a été construite pour le relier à la capitale Addis-Abeba. En tout, des dizaines de ports doivent être développés et des milliers de kilomètres de voies ferrées construits.

Imposer le yuan en Asie à la place du dollar

Cela peut sembler très technique, le sujet est pourtant crucial à long terme. La Chine a pour ambition d'imposer la yuan comme monnaie de référence, et, surtout, comme monnaie de change sur les marchés internationaux à la place du dollar.

Kézako? Aujourd'hui, l'écrasante majorité du commerce international est facturé en dollar, y compris celui de la dette publique. Demain, la Chine rêve que le yuan occupe le même rôle. ""Elle se dit que comme premier exportateur mondial, elle pourrait se délivrer des risques de change avec le dollar, éviter la dépendance à l'économie américaine"", analyse Philippe Crevel, président du Cercle de l'épargne.

Il en va ni plus ni moins de la stabilité économique de l'Asie. En 1998, c'est la remontée des taux d'intérêts américains par la Fed qui est à l'origine de la crise asiatique. Le changement des taux a provoqué une dépréciation des monnaies asiatiques, plongeant dans le rouge certains pays dont la dette devait être remboursée en dollars.

Accessoirement, l'influence de la Chine sur ces pays serait grandement accrue...

In Saudi Arabia, 10 princes and dozens of ministers are detained by new anti-corruption body, state media report https://t.co/eXTSWd5Jbm — BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) November 4, 2017

King Salman also appointed two new ministers on Saturday to key security and economic posts, removing one of the royal family's most prominent members as head of the National Guard.

Prince Miteb bin Abdullah was replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favour of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.

Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago.

The Cabinet reshuffle helped to consolidate Prince Mohammed's control of the kingdom's security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will head the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.

Die einzige Behandlung, die ihn noch retten könnte, ist in Deutschland nicht zugelassen

Deshalb ist die Familie jetzt extra nach Seattle geflogen - und hofft auf eure Hilfe

Margit und Andreas Fischer haben nicht eine Sekunde gezögert, als sie sich in der Haunerschen Kinderklinik in München entscheiden mussten, ob ihr Sohn leben oder sterben soll. Raphael ist zwei Jahre alt und leidet an einer besonders aggressiven Form des Blutkrebses, der sogenannten akuten lymphatischen Leukämie (ALL).

Weil die Behandlungen in Deutschland nicht mehr anschlugen und es dadurch nur noch wenig Hoffnungen für den Jungen gab, empfahlen die Ärzte eine letzte Alternative: eine neuartige dreimonatige Immunbehandlung an der Westküste in Amerika.

Für die Eltern gab es keine Diskussionen. Ihr Sohn soll leben. Seit gut einer Woche ist die Familie jetzt an der Westküste der USA, um sich auf die Therapie vorzubereiten.

Raphael hat schon fünf Monate Chemo-Therapie hinter sich

Raphaels Leiden begann bereits, als er fünf Monate alt war. Nachdem eine Bronchitis bei ihm diagnostiziert worden war und wochenlang nicht verging, veranlasste der Kinderarzt eine Blutuntersuchung. Dabei machte er die schockierende Diagnose:

Raphael leidet an akuter lymphatischer Leukämie. Eine schmerzvolle und belastende Zeit begann für die Familie, die noch bis heute anhält.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Meine Tochter hatte Krebs - jetzt kämpft sie für andere Kinder

Der kleine Raphael musste einen fünfmonatigen Chemoblock, zwei Antikörperbehandlungen sowie zwei Knochenmarktransplantationen über sich ergehen lassen.

Zwar gab es Hoffnungsschimmer wie die Knochenmarkspende von seiner Mutter, die die Erkrankung vermeintlich bekämpfen konnte. Doch am Ende zeigte sich der Krebs widerspenstig. Die bösen Zellen waren wieder da.

Das soll sich jetzt im etwa 8500 Kilometer von Aschau entfernten Seattle ändern. Die Behandlung, die er jetzt bekommen soll, kann gefährliche Nebenwirkungen aufweisen. Doch in ähnlichen Fällen war sie bereits erfolgreich und führte zur Heilung.

Erst kürzlich wurde die Immuntherapie in den USA zugelassen. Laut Fachmedien zeigten klinische Studien, dass sie bei mehr als 80 Prozent der Patienten angeschlagen habe. Für Raphael ist diese Therapie die letzte Chance, den Blutkrebs endgültig zu besiegen.

Die Reise in die USA war für die Familie eine zusätzliche große Last. Doch sie war nötig. Denn in Deutschland ist die Behandlung derzeit weder zugelassen, noch können Kinder im Rahmen von klinischen Studien behandelt werden.

Margit und Andreas Fischer wollen erreichen, dass nicht nur Raphael, sondern auch andere Kinder mit Leukämie in Deutschland eine solche Chance bekommen.

Kinder wie Raphael sollten auch hier behandelt werden

Deshalb haben sie sich mit der gemeinnützigen Stiftung ""Care for Rare"" in Verbindung gesetzt und rufen zu Spenden auf. Die Stiftung setzt sich dafür ein, dass Kinder mit seltenen Erkrankungen nicht leiden oder gar sterben sollten.

Denn gerade weil ihre Erkrankung so selten ist, sollten sie noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekommen. Die Familie will eine Plattform für neue Immuntherapien am Haunerschen Kinderspital errichten, damit in Zukunft Kinder wie Raphael zur Behandlung nicht mehr in die USA geschickt werden müssen.

In Seattle beginnt bald Raphaels Therapie. Er musste wieder eine Chemotherapie über sich ergehen lassen, um die Krebszellen vor dem Therapiestart einzudämmen und ist daher etwas schwach. Die Familie und die Ärzte aber sind voller Hoffnung: Raphael soll leben.

Noch ist Rosa aber nicht bereit, sich sofort nach ihrer Ankunft mit ihrer Familie zu konfrontieren. Sie hat die Ostsee vermisst und fährt an den Strand. Dort sieht Rosa auch ihren Vater. Er sitzt in seinem Strandkorb - erschossen.

22:00 Uhr, NDR: Tatort: Eine Frage des Gewissens

Im Einsatz bei einem Raubüberfall erschießt Thorsten Lannert (Richy Müller) den Räuber, der eine Geisel genommen hat. Die Anhörung wegen Verhältnismäßigkeit dieser Handlung sollte eine Routineangelegenheit sein, der Täter war gefährlich und völlig unberechenbar. Doch die Mutter des Toten hat Anwälte engagiert, die Lannert wegen fahrlässiger Tötung angeklagt sehen wollen. Sebastian Bootz (Felix Klare) entlastet Thorsten Lannert in der Befragung - obwohl er eigentlich im Hinblick auf die entscheidenden Sekunden gar nicht sicher ist. Eine weitere Zeugin wird ermordet, bevor sie aussagen kann. Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Überfall im Supermarkt und dem Mord?

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.
Duffer continued:“I’m sure we were just like, ‘It would be cute if [Bob] suggests moving to Maine, right next to Stephen King.’ Stephen King exists in this world.
Some of the characters have read Stephen King.
But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King.","This connection stems largely from the introduction of Bob Newby (Sean Astin). While driving with Will (Noah Schnapp) in the car, Bob mentions that as a kid he had nightmares about “Mr. Baldo,” a clown who had offered him a balloon. (Just like Pennywise in “It” does). At another point, Bob also suggests to Joyce (Winona Ryder) that they buy his parents’ house in Maine. (“It” takes place in Derry, Maine.)

The Duffer brothers, who actually once pitched an “It” remake themselves, recently told Vulture that the connections are completely intentional. But there seems to be one big hole in the theory.

“Stranger Things” co-creator Matt Duffer first told Vulture that he had a problem with the 1990 “It” miniseries as a kid, and Bob’s story was inspired by that.

“I think [Bob’s clown story] was really me describing something that just freaked me out. I didn’t have that experience myself. I just had nightmares like that,” he said.

Duffer continued:

“I’m sure we were just like, ‘It would be cute if [Bob] suggests moving to Maine, right next to Stephen King.’ Stephen King exists in this world. Some of the characters have read Stephen King. But Bob definitely does not read Stephen King. He’s not interested at all in Stephen King because he hates that kind of story.”

Since King exists in the world of “Stranger Things,” it seems unlikely that his fictional characters would as well, so the kids are probably safe from Pennywise after all.

The University of Saskatchewan student told HuffPost Canada she wasn't given a heads up from the premier's office that her experience — claims that have launched two internal investigations — would be brought up in legislature last week.

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall announces he is retiring from politics during a press conference at the Legislative Building in Regina Aug. 10, 2017.

""It felt like it was a political whipping point rather than something that happened to a real person,"" Schuhmacher told HuffPost Canada.

The sociology student published a blog post last month with detailed allegations of how she was sexually assaulted by a former NDP election candidate. Her story was one of two the premier made a reference to in legislature.

""It's like things finally had started dying with all that had happened after I went public and now it's back,"" she said.

It felt like it was a political whipping point rather than something that happened to a real person.

Wall's comments raised eyebrows for Schuhmacher and the NDP, of which she is an active member. The remark came up during question period on Tuesday during debate over a land deal scandal involving the province's Global Transportation Hub (GTH).

Wall said he found it ""interesting"" the opposition was lecturing him on accountability when the NDP ""has a former leader who is alleged, alleged to have a complaint on sexual harassment brought to him, and it's also been alleged that he did nothing about it.""

The remark incensed Saskatchewan NDP Leader Nicole Sarauer. She called on Wall to retract his statement the next day.

Interim Saskatchewan NDP Leader Nicole Sarauer speaks in the Legislative Assembly on Nov. 1, 2017.

""Shame on this premier for using these words for cheap political points,"" she said.

Sarauer accused Wall of ""completely ignoring"" Schumacher's request that her story ""not to be used for political gain."" Wall doubled down and questioned the party on why the accused continued to be a member of the provincial NDP after allegations about his conduct surfaced.

NDP MLA Trent Wotherspoon called Wall's points ""disgusting"" and added, ""Those aren't his stories to tell.""

Watch the full exchange between Sarauer and Wall:

""I make no apology for raising it,"" Wall later told reporters. He justified the relevance of bringing up the young woman's story by citing it was in the pursuit of transparency and accountability.

Wall's chief of operations and communications told HuffPost Canada the premier is ""in no way whatsoever avoiding any political issues.""

In an email, Kathy Young said the government has answered ""hundreds of questions"" about the GTH.

""This goes directly to the NDP's handling of accusations of sexual harassment and assault and the fact that alleged perpetrators were employed within the NDP organization after these allegations came to light to their leader, caucus and party.""

The NDP did not respond to HuffPost Canada's request for comment.

'Creepy men and predatory men aren't partisan by nature'

Two independent investigations into the claims related to the former NDP candidate's actions as well as the party's handling of the allegations remain ongoing.

Schumacher, an organizer with the Saskatchewan NDP's youth wing, said the ""Harvey Weinstein effect"" encouraged her to go public with her own story of sexual harassment and assault.

The 19-year-old said she wasn't pleased with the premier using her sensitive story for politicking. She asked for an apology.

""I commend him if his genuine intent is to end this kind of behaviour in politics,"" she said.

She added that there was one thing she couldn't shake: that the premier used her story as a political foil of sorts, a talking point against the NDP.

E che dovrebbe garantire entrate stimate in 154 miliardi di dollari in dieci anni. Nella riforma fiscale presentata dai repubblicani al Congresso americano e' infatti spuntata a sorpresa una 'supertassa' del 20% sui soldi che le multinazionali versano all'estero, nelle casse di società affiliate che spesso operano in veri e propri paradisi fiscali.

La 'supertassa' - che alcuni commentatori definiscono una vera e propria 'bomba atomica' - in particolare dovrebbe essere applicata a tutte quelle multinazionali che si rifiutano di assoggettare le loro filiali o società offshore sotto la giurisdizione dell'Irs, l'agenzia delle entrate statunitense. Un escamotage usato da molte società che cosi' evitano il pagamento delle tasse negli Usa su gran parte delle somme guadagnate. Fin dalla campagna elettorale Trump aveva promesso di 'punire' non solo le grandi società che spostano parte della loro produzione all'estero, a danno dei posti di lavoro, ma anche quelle che si rifugiano in paradisi fiscali per eludere il sistema fiscale americano

APPLE - La mossa di Trump potrebbe colpire multinazionali come la Apple, attualmente sotto lente d'ingrandimento per lo scandalo dei conti off shore. ""L'isola di Jersey, nel canale della Manica, è il 'nuovo paradiso fiscale' di Apple, dove sono parcheggiati miliardi di dollari non tassati"" scriveva ieri il New York Times citando i Paradise Papers e documenti segreti dello studio legale Appleby, con base nelle Bermuda e a servizio delle aziende e dei ricchi. Apple - scrive il New York Times - avrebbe accumulato più di 128 miliardi di dollari di profitti offshore, che non sono tassati dagli Stati Uniti o da altri Paesi. Strategie come quella usata da Apple per l'isola di Jersey, e usate da altri colossi - secondo il Nyt -, costano ai governi a livello mondiale circa 240 miliardi di dollari di entrate perse ogni anno, in base ai dati dell'Ocse. Apple - scrive infine il quotidiano newyorkese - avrebbe scelto Jersey dopo le indagini del Congresso americano sull'elusione fiscale e dopo il giro di vite lanciato dalle autorità irlandesi. Sulla vicenda Apple ha spiegato in sintesi che su alcuni conti sono accumulati i fondi proprio per la copertura fiscale.

IL CASO HAMILTON -Tra i nomi più noti dell'inchiesta Paradise Papers è spuntato oggi quello del pilota Lewis Hamilton. Vi sono infatti pure 16,5 milioni di sterline riconducibili a Hamilton, sottratti al fisco e trasferiti con ""un marchingegno"" su conti offshore dell'Isola di Man, fra gli altarini svelati dai 'Paradise Papers': le carte che documentano operazioni finanziarie spregiudicate di personaggi ricchi e potenti del pianeta. L'iridato britannico di Formula 1, da poco campione del mondo per la quarta volta, viene additato dal Guardian, che gli attribuisce inoltre una fortuna pari a 130 milioni sparsa in paradisi fiscali come Malta o Guernsey.

Hamilton si sarebbe in particolare fatto rimborsare 3,3 milioni di sterline d'Iva (Vat in inglese) sull'acquisto di un jet privato, trasferito fiscalmente sull'Isola di Man nel 2013 facendo apparire il tutto come un'operazione di leasing consentita - nel Regno Unito o nell'Ue - solo per velivoli usati a scopo di business commerciale e non a titolo personale. Il pilota ha fatto rispondere da un portavoce in questi termini: ""Essendo uno sportivo globale che paga tasse in un vasto numero di Paesi, Lewis si affida a un team di consulenti professionisti nella gestione dei suoi affari. Questi consulenti hanno rassicurato Lewis che ogni cosa é stata fatta alla luce del sole e la questione é ora nelle mani dei suoi avvocati"".","Paradise Papers, in arrivo la super tassa di Trump contro giganti come Apple, Ford o Pfizer",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/07/paradise-papers-in-arrivo-la-super-tassa-di-trump-contro-giganti-come-apple-ford-o-pfizer_a_23269538/

Depuis plus de cinq années, les associations - dont Eva pour la vie, qui a initié dès 2012 ce combat de fond - se battent pour faire prendre conscience aux décideurs politiques de l'urgence à mettre en place des mesures pour développer la recherche sur les cancers pédiatriques. En effet, le cancer, 1ère cause de décès par maladie des enfants, en tue 500 par an en France. Soit l'équivalent de 20 classes d'école chaque année. Le nombre de décès d'enfants touchés par cette maladie ne recule plus depuis une quinzaine d'années.

Comme vous l'avez sûrement lu ou entendu, les très faibles fonds publics anti-cancer actuellement alloués à la recherche académique sur les cancers de l'enfant sont très insuffisants pour permettre à de nouvelles équipes d'initier des programmes innovants sur cette thématique, pourtant très sous-représentée actuellement, et pour fournir aux chercheurs déjà engagés - qui consacrent parfois plus de 50% de leur temps à chercher des financements – les moyens indispensables à leurs travaux pour espérer que demain, on puisse mieux soigner les enfants et adolescents atteints de cancers.

La situation reste particulièrement préoccupante pour les cancers spécifiques aux enfants (par exemple, certains types de tumeurs cérébrales, de leucémies du nourrisson aujourd'hui sans aucun espoir de guérison). De nombreux chercheurs rappellent que cette recherche pourrait aussi les aider à mieux comprendre, et mieux soigner, les cancers de l'adulte. La notion de ""faible nombre"", ou une opposition avec des cancers plus fréquents comme nous l'avons déjà entendu, ne saurait être un argument.

Des travaux parlementaires sans précédent - menés en 2015 et 2016 par l'ex-députée socialiste de la Gironde Mme Martine Faure - du groupe d'études parlementaires cancers pédiatriques qu'elle dirigeait ont démontré les insuffisances en matière de soutien financier à la recherche, de l'aide aux familles, et du don de vie. Certains constats allaient même au-delà de ce que les associations de parents dénoncent.

Mme Martine Faure avait déposé plusieurs amendements sur l'ensemble des points qui posent problème fin 2016, mais la situation politique de l'époque ne lui avait pas permis de se faire entendre. Elle nous a indiqué être prête à fournir tous les rapports de ses travaux, les proposition d'amendements et même, à échanger et travailler autant que nécessaire avec tout-e député-e souhaitant s'engager sur la question, indépendamment de toute considération politico-politicienne.

Après l'échec de Mr Jean-Christophe Lagarde (UDI) en 2014 et de Mme Martine Faure (PS) en 2016, nous mettions beaucoup d'espoir sur Mr Benoit Simian (LREM), dont nous saluons la démarche, qui présentait dans la nuit du 21 au 22 octobre dernier un amendement, dans le cadre du Projet de Loi des Finances 2018, visant à allouer la part non affectée des recettes de la taxe Chirac sur les billets d'avion en faveur de cette mission, soit 20 millions d'euros par an: une mesure simple et efficace, ceci sans créer de nouvel impôt, ni réduire le budget d'une autre cause importante, contrairement à ce qui a pu être dit.

- lien vers la vidéo du débat du 22 octobre 2017

- Texte de l'Amendement

http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/amendements/0235A/AN/1157.asp

En effet, sur les 230 millions d'euros de recettes annuelles récoltés via cette taxe, seuls 210 millions sont reversés au FSD (fonds de solidarité et de développement). Or, après une rupture de séance étonnamment longue, l'amendement qui était techniquement valide a été brutalement rejeté par le gouvernement, par la voix de son porte-parole Mr Christophe Castaner, tout comme par le parti socialiste, représenté par Mr Olivier Faure.

Un choc et une incompréhension des familles, des chercheurs et des associations face à la brutalité de la décision du gouvernement, alors que cet amendement était porteur d'espoirs pour des enfants et des familles qui sont encore trop nombreux à n'en avoir aucun à ce jour.

Un choc, d'autant plus qu'après discussion avec Mr Olivier Faure et certain-e-s député-e-s LREM, il semblerait que cette position ""défavorable"" soit notamment due à une mauvaise compréhension de cet amendement: il ne s'agissait pas de déshabiller Paul pour habiller Jacques! Il aurait été inconcevable, tant pour Mr Benoit Simian que pour les nombreux soutiens à cette démarche de réduire le budget du fonds de solidarité et de développement. Il s'agissait uniquement d'utiliser un financement qui aujourd'hui repart dans le budget général, sachant que la cour des comptes et un rapport du Sénat ont rappelé cette incohérence.

De plus, toutes les preuves sur les insuffisances en matière de financement de cette recherche ont été apportées. Il serait donc malhonnête, de la part d'un député ou d'un ministère, de se réfugier derrière une quelconque autosatisfaction.

Parallèlement à cet échec, plus de 60 associations, plus de 100 chercheurs, d'oncologues, cliniciens ... ont co-rédigé et co-signé le manifeste www.grandirsanscancer.com visant à demander à l'Etat de mettre en place une loi garantissant un fonds annuel d'environ 20 millions d'euros/an, dédié à la recherche fondamentale, translationnelle et clinique sur les cancers et leucémies des enfants.

Nous savons que le Projet de Loi des Finances 2018 va continuer d'être débattu dans les semaines à venir. Nous ne pouvons plus perdre de temps: pendant que l'on tergiverse, des dizaines d'enfants atteints de cancers, de leucémies, de maladies incurables décèdent chaque mois dans l'anonymat de leur chambre d'hôpital, parce que les décideurs de leur pays trainent des pieds à s'engager pour eux.

Nous sommes conscients que financer correctement la recherche en oncologie pédiatrique ne changera pas les choses du jour au lendemain. Mais nous sommes également certains d'une chose: un financement aussi faible que celui qui est actuellement alloué (les 20 millions d'euros de budget proposés par Mr Benoit Simian correspondent au budget manquant) les condamne. La générosité des associations permet certes de soutenir quelques projets, mais elle ne peut, à elle seule, répondre à tous les besoins manquants, loin de là!

Devons-nous aussi sacrifier notre recherche en pédiatrie, et attendre que les progrès viennent des Etats-Unis, sachant que fin 2014, le grand président Barack Obama a voté la création d'un fonds dédié à la recherche sur les maladies pédiatriques incurables en particulier les cancers de l'enfant? (Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act)? Ou devons-nous, sachant que nous avons des chercheurs d'un très bon niveau, leur donner les moyens d'avancer pour ce qui devrait, aux yeux de vous décideurs, être considéré comme ce qu'il y a de plus prestigieux: la vie des enfants.

Nous comptons sur vous pour faire honneur à votre mission de député(e) et pour relancer, déposer de nouveau l'amendement proposé par Mr Benoit Simian (quitte à en améliorer la présentation afin de se prémunir de toute mauvaise interprétation) et surtout, le soutenir UNANIMEMENT!

Yes, you read that correctly -- an advent calendar that has ousted chocolate and brought in the gin.

The people at Gintonica created the calendar which includes 24 different types of Australian craft gin ready to try each day of December. The various gins come from five different Australian states and represent 21 distillers. The bottles are 50 millilitres in size.

The calendar also includes serving suggestions and tasting notes from the distillers and a few gin cocktail recipes.

The Advent Season Traditionally, advent is the season before Christmas during which Christians prepare for the coming of Christ. The name 'Advent' itself comes from the Latin word 'adventus' which means 'arrival'. The season includes the four Sundays before Christmas and is observed using a wreath with four candles -- one candle for each week in the season. Each Sunday, a new candle is lit as Christmas approaches. Of course, the Advent season is celebrated by many people, religious or not. Advent calendars are often the highlight of this time for children, as they can eat a little chocolate each day. All over the world, Christmas markets pop-up in town squares and main streets, decorations appear and trees go up. In the warmer weather, many Aussies choose to check out the light displays in their local areas, or to travel a little further afield and visit some of the more extravagant houses. For most of us, Advent is a time to catch up with family and friends and attend Christmas parties among the mad dash from store to store to get that Christmas shopping done.

The Australian Gin Advent Calendar is available for purchase via the Gintonica website, however they can only be shipped to locations within Australia. Orders will be shipped before December 1, so you won't need to play catch up once the final month of 2017 ticks around.

Una diserzione del voto che non ha trovato un contenimento neanche con il risultato, indubbiamente importante, del Movimento cinque stelle. La prima considerazione, allora, riguarda la performance dei grillini, su cui si è spesa in modo massivo l'immagine del neoleader Di Maio, che con un coup de théâtre, dichiara, ostentando una degnazione intinta nel fiele a risultato appena acquisito, di ""cancellare"" il faccia a faccia televisivo con Renzi, perché non si addice al vincitore il confronto col perdente. Il voto grillino in Sicilia, al netto di quel che sarà il governo di palazzo dei Normanni, racconta una cosa su cui occorre riflettere: i Cinque stelle non attingono al bacino del non-voto, ma prosciugano quello di altri partiti, confermando il tasso altissimo di volatilità dell'opzione elettorale dei siciliani. E degli italiani. Ma la lezione che porge il contenuto più significativo dal punto di vista del prossimo appuntamento elettorale nazionale, riguarda il valore della coalizione. Il centro-destra vince perché ha costruito un'alleanza. Il centro-sinistra perde perché non ha saputo (o voluto) costruirla. I Cinque stelle non ci provano perché nascono anti-coalizionali e, forse, alla fine, non si pongono l'obiettivo del governo (bisognerà cominciare a considerare anche questa ipotesi) ma solo quello di collocare un gruppo dirigente nelle assemblee elettive. Perché le leggi elettorali italiane, dal comune al Parlamento, non incoraggiano le corse solitarie, ma le coalizioni.

Dunque se il centrosinistra vuole veramente partecipare al torneo elettorale, occorrerà che si attrezzi, abbandonando il mantra coltivato dall'avvento dell'Italicum fino all'approvazione del Rosatellum (che fatica con questi ridicoli latinorum!), quello della lista autosufficiente. È cambiato radicalmente lo scenario, ma evidentemente si fa fatica a metabolizzare che chi vada da solo sia destinato a perdere.

C'è pure una forza alla sua sinistra che, se riuscisse a fare una sorta di reductio ad unum e a superare l'istinto antagonista nei confronti dello stesso Pd, potrebbe raccogliere strati interessanti di elettorato.

Occorre il riequilibrio al Centro. Il Pd non riesce a raccogliere il segmento elettorale centrista-riformista: quel che poteva prendere l'ha già preso e digerito. Bisogna che quella parte di paese che ha sostenuto da posizioni moderate i governi di questa legislatura, dimostri di avere l'intelligenza di unirsi per avere un ruolo importante nella coalizione di centro-sinistra. Alfano, i diversi rivoli dell'esperienza montiana, le esperienze regionali di liste civiche di area, i rappresentanti della cultura moderata e cattolico-democratica che siedono in Parlamento, devono mettersi insieme per competere, non per confezionare una lista-civetta.

Was die Ereignisse, die sich heute vor 100 Jahren in Russland zugetragen haben, und die noch fälschlich als ""Oktoberrevolution"" bezeichnet werden, wirklich bedeuten, wird bis heute von der offiziellen Geschichtsschreibung ignoriert. Und in den Medien verfälscht.

Der staatliche TV-Sender Rossija 1 hat dem 7. November 1917 (nach dem damals gültigen Kalender der 25. Oktober 1917) eine ganze Talkshow gewidmet. Dort sagte der Chef der Kommunistischen Partei, Gennadij Sjuganow: ""Die Geschichte kennt keinen Konjunktiv. Was passiert ist, ist passiert.""

Aber das stimmt nicht.

Wenn man uns verbieten will, darüber nachzudenken, was ohne Lenins Putsch passiert wäre, dann ist das klare Zensur. Und auch eine Rechtfertigung für die Verbrechen in unserer Vergangenheit.

Russland hätte sich nicht in den ersten Weltkrieg einmischen sollen, sagte der Chef-Kommunist. Dabei war es Deutschland, das Russland den Krieg erklärte. Und zwar auch deshalb, weil die Deutschen davon ausgingen, dass unser Land sich zu einem Wirtschafts-Riesen entwickeln und zu groß und zu stark werden würde.

Aber gehen wir noch weiter.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich auf die Bürger berufen

Hunderte Jahre hielt man die Macht - die Zarenkrone - für gottgegeben.

Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ließ der Glauben an Gott nach.

Die Februar-Revolution 1917 - der Sturz des Zaren - war deshalb zeitgemäß.

Die neue Regierung wollte sich nicht mehr auf Gott berufen, sondern auf ihre Bürger.

Deshalb hatte sie für November 1917 Wahlen ausgerufen.

Gleichzeitig setzte die Provisorische Regierung unter Alexander Kerenski den Krieg fort. An der Front schaffte sie erstaunliche Erfolge.

Dann kam Lenin und die Revolution

Wladimir Uljanow, der sich Lenin nannte, hatte zur gleichen Zeit nur ein einziges Ziel: An die Macht zu kommen. Und er wusste: Dazu musste Russland erst den Krieg verlieren, denn ein Sieg hätte Kerenski zum Helden gemacht.

Russlands Position im Krieg verbesserte sich rasch. Tschechen, Slowaken und Kroaten wollten nicht mehr weiter gegen Russland kämpfen, wo es jetzt keinen Zaren mehr gab, und Wien signalisierte notgedrungen Verhandlungsbereitschaft.

Als Berlin erfuhr, dass der eigene Bündnisgenosse abtrünnig werden könnte, wandte es sich an einen alten Freund, der von Deutschland bezahlt wurde - Wladimir Uljanow alias Lenin.

Der befahl seinen Leuten, unverzüglich die Minister der Provisorischen Regierung festzunehmen - am 25. Oktober (7. November): ""Jede Verzögerung wäre gleichbedeutend mit dem Tod"", war damals die Parole. Einen Tag später wäre der Frieden mit Österreich unterzeichnet worden.

Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk

Am 26. Oktober erließ Lenin sein ""Dekret für den Frieden"" - also die Kapitulation Russlands.

Der angebliche ""2. Kongress der Volksdeputierten"" - in Wirklichkeit nur eine Versammlung von Abgeordneten aus den wenigen Regionen, in denen Lenins Leute wirklich eine Mehrheit hatten - ""ernannte"" eine bolschewistische Regierung.

► Bei den Wahlen zur Verfassungsgebenden Versammlung, die diese ausrief, erhielt Lenins Partei im November 1917 nicht mal ein Viertel der Stimmen.

Im Dezember schaffen die Kommunisten hastig die WTscheKa, eine Vorgänger-Organisation des KGB, die Massenterror gegen das eigene Volk betrieb.

Lenins Kämpfer schossen auf Demonstranten

Am 18. Januar 1918 traf sich ein Teil der gewählten Abgeordneten zur verfassungsgebenden Versammlung.

Als diese die Erlasse der Sowjets für illegal erklärte, wurde sie aufgelöst. In der gleichen Nacht ließ Lenin seine Kämpfer mit Maschinengewehren auf Demonstranten schießen, die auf die Straße gingen, um ihre legitim gewählten Abgeordneten zu verteidigen. Mehr als hundert Menschen starben.

Lenins Mitstreiter Bucharin rief den Bürgerkrieg aus. Die bolschewistische Regierung hatte keine Legitimität. Sie kämpfte ausschließlich für die Interessen ihrer Anführer. Sie hatte keine soziale Basis, weder im alten noch im neuen Russland.

""Diktatur des Proletariates""

Selbst die russischen Marxisten wie Plechanow und Martow erkannten die so genannte Revolution, die in Wirklichkeit ein Putsch war, nicht an. Deshalb mussten Lenin und seine Anhänger sich von der ganzen tausendjährigen Geschichte Russlands lossagen.

Die nationale Symbolik - das Wappen, die Hymne, die Flagge, der Staatsnamen - alles wurde abgeschafft. Stattdessen schuf man die so genannte ""UdSSR"". An Stelle der demokratischen Republik, die sich gerade aus dem konstitutionellen Monarchie entwickelt hatte, trat eine ""Diktatur des Proletariates"".

Schon am 20. November 1917 erklärten die Bolschewiken das gesamte bestehende Recht für ungültig. Alle Gesetze verloren ihre Wirkung, die Gerichte und Staatsanwaltschaften wurden aufgelöst. Ganz offen wurde erklärt, dass die neue Regierung das Völkerrecht nicht anerkennt.

► Auch der bestehenden Moral wurde der Kampf angesagt. Ebenso wie der Kirche.

Der radikale Bruch wird heute ignoriert

Lenins ""Plan der monumentalen Propaganda"" sollte die Erinnerung an alles auslöschen, was mit dem alten Russland zu tun hatte. Denkmäler wurden zerstört, Ortsnamen geändert, ebenso der Kalender und die Rechtschreibung.

1921 wurden alle humanitären Fakultäten der russischen Universitäten geschlossen. Erst Jahrzehnte später wurde das Studium von Geschichte, Soziologie, Recht und Philosophie wieder möglich.

Dieser radikale Bruch durch die Bolschewiki wird heute von der russischen Politik - und deshalb auch der Geschichtsforschung und in den Schulbüchern - ignoriert.

""UdSSR und Russland - Mörder und Mordopfer""

Ein derartiger völliger historischer Bruch ist in der Geschichte selten, aber nicht einmalig. Das sowjetische und postsowjetische Regime hat in etwa so viel gemeinsam mit dem historischen Russland wie die Bundesrepublik mit dem Dritten Reich. ""Die UdSSR und Russland - das ist Mörder und Mordopfer"", schrieb Solschenizyn.

Statt der russischen Idee riefen die Bolschewisten die sowjetische Idee aus: Soziale Gerechtigkeit, Verzicht auf Ausbeutung, freie Entwicklung des Individuums, usw.

► Doch diese lauten Parolen waren nur ein Vorhang, mit dem die schreckliche sowjetische Realität verdeckt wurde.

In der Sowjetunion herrschte totale Zensur, die Grenzen waren geschlossen, die Menschen wurden maximal ausgebeutet, die Wirtschaft war rückständig, es herrscht Mangel selbst an Waren des täglichen Bedarfs, Hunger, Armut, ein katastrophaler Niedergang der Landwirtschaft und vieles mehr.

Es ist deshalb kein Wunder, dass die gesamte Geschichte der Sowjetunion auch eine Geschichte des Widerstands der einfachen Menschen gegen dieses System ist - und zugleich des Kampfes dieses Systems gegen die eigenen Menschen.

➨ Das könnte euch auch interessieren: Friede mit Russland - bloss wie?

Russland hatte den Anspruch, eine Weltmacht zu sein

Bolschewismus - das sind drei künstlich erzeugte Hunger-Katastrophen, GULAG - ""ein Auschwitz ohne Krematorium"" - der ""rote Terror"" und der ""große Terror"", die Deportation von sechs Millionen Menschen.

Russland schritt in das 20. Jahrhundert mit dem Anspruch, eine führende Weltmacht zu sein. Es beendete das Jahrhundert mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.

In 70 Jahren Kommunismus hat Russland 5,5 Millionen Quadratkilometer Landfläche verloren - das ist zehnmal so viel wie das Territorium Frankreichs. 1917 lebten in Russland 186 Millionen Menschen, heute sind es 143 Millionen.

Fast alle Opfer von Stalins Terror gegen das eigene Volk sind, still und leise, offiziell rehabilitiert.

► Das bedeutet, dass Lenin und Stalin einen Völkermord an ihrem eigenen Volk begangen haben.

Wir brauchen eine intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung

Was kann man dazu noch sagen? Um aus der 100-jährigen Sackgasse herauszukommen, in die Russland heute vor 100 Jahren eingebogen ist, brauchen wir eine gigantische intellektuelle moralische Erneuerung.

Nur, wenn wir uns von dem tief sitzenden Erbe und Denken aus der Sowjetzeit lossagen, das Geschehene juristisch aufarbeiten und endlich Vergangenheitsbewältigung beginnen, wenn wir an das alte Russland anknüpfen, und dessen Erbe reformieren und modernisieren, wenn wir uns dabei die Erfahrung der europäischen Demokratien zu Herzen nehmen, nur dann haben wir eine Chance, die russische Zivilisation wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Nur so können wir uns aus der Rolle des Aussätzigen befreien, in die wir uns selbst manövriert haben. Und einen würdigen Platz in der Geschichte der Menschheit einzunehmen.

Sur son compte twitter, Tariq Ramadan a démenti ""catégoriquement"" ces allégations et annoncé le dépôt d'une plainte contre X pour diffamation.

Au Royaume-uni, un scandale de harcèlement sexuel ébranle la classe politique depuis plusieurs semaines, visant des personnalités de premier plan.

Trump sagte: ""Die Ära der strategischen Geduld"" sei zu Ende

Donald Trump hat seine Position bezüglich Nordkorea bekräftigt. Die Ära strategischer Geduld sei vorbei, sagte der US-Präsident.

""Wenn die Leute sagen, meine Rhetorik sei zu stark, sollten wir uns ansehen, wohin wir mit schwacher Rhetorik in den vergangenen 25 Jahren gekommen sind"", sagte Trump am Montag in Tokio bei einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz mit Japans Premier Shinzo Abe.

Maximaler Druck auf Pjöngjang

Der japanische Regierungschef beteuerte ebenfalls, dass Japan und die USA im Konflikt um Nordkoreas Atom- und Raketenprogramm den Druck auf Pjöngjang erhöhen wollten. Dies sei nicht die Zeit für Dialog mit Nordkorea.

""Dialog um des Dialoges willen mache keinen Sinn"", sagte Abe. ""Wir wollen durch alle möglichen Mittel den Druck auf Nordkorea bis zum Maximalen erhöhen.""

Konkret kündigte Abe an, die Sanktionen auszuweiten: Die Vermögenswerte von 35 nordkoreanischen Gruppierungen und Einzelpersonen sollen eingefroren werden. Mit dieser Strategie wollen die Verbündeten den andauernden Nukleartests des nordkoreanischen Regimes Einhalt gebieten.

Trump verteidigt Rückzug aus Handelsabkommen TPP

Trump verteidigte in Japan auch den Rückzug der USA aus dem transpazifischen Handelsabkommen TPP. Bei einem Treffen mit Geschäftsleuten sagte Trump am Montagmorgen (Ortszeit) in Tokio: ""Wir werden mehr Handel haben als im Rahmen von TPP, und die Situation wird viel weniger komplex sein."" TPP sei nicht die richtige Idee gewesen.

TPP sollte rund um den Pazifik die größte Freihandelszone der Welt schaffen. Der Vertrag war im Februar 2016 unterzeichnet worden, aber noch nicht in Kraft getreten. Die elf Handelspartner repräsentieren 800 Millionen Menschen und 40 Prozent der Weltwirtschaft. Sie wollen nach dem Rückzug der USA großenteils ohne Amerika weiter vorangehen.

""Der Handel mit Japan ist nicht frei und er ist nicht gegenseitig, aber er wird es bald sein"", sagte Trump. Er habe keinen Zweifel, dass dies fair geschehen werde. Es werde eine Zeit dauern, aber dann werde es Handelsdeals und ""Handelskonzepte"" geben.

Entsprechende Gespräche mit Japan dauerten schon sehr lange. Das finanzielle Ergebnis werde besser für beide Länder sein. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten habe Japan in Handelsfragen mit den USA immer gewonnen, sagte Trump.

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU -- Demand for physical gold was lacklustre in top consumers India and China this week, while the lure of the metal remained stable in Singapore, but India's peak wedding season is expected to usher in renewed interest for bullion in coming weeks.

Gold is considered an essential part of weddings in India, second-biggest consumer of the metal in the world after China, and it is a popular gift on such occasions.

""The wedding season has started. In the next few weeks, there are many wedding dates, which will boost demand,"" said Kumar Jain, a Mumbai-based jeweller.

Dealers in India were charging a premium of up to $3 an ounce this week over official domestic prices, unchanged from last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.

""Gold imports by (jewellery) export houses have fallen sharply in the last few weeks. That's why the market is in premium, despite moderate demand,"" said a dealer with a private bank in Mumbai.

In October, India tightened gold import norms for jewellery exporters by restricting them from importing the yellow metal only for export purposes and not for selling in the domestic market.

Meanwhile, in China, the market for the precious metal remained quiet, with premiums of $5 to $9 an ounce being charged over benchmark rates, as against the $6.50 to $10 range in the previous week.

Benchmark spot gold was on track to register a small weekly gain, hovering around the $1,275.00 level as of 0919 GMT on Friday, but still below Thursday's mark of $1,284.10, highest in nearly two weeks. [GOL/]

""Dips below the $1,270 level (toward the beginning of the week) spurred some buying, but the upside, (around the $1,280 level) limited purchases,"" said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

Premiums in Hong Kong remained more or less unchanged from last week, in the 60 cents to $1.20 range.

""Premiums are quite low, and except for periodic large sales, the market is quiet,"" said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In Singapore, premiums rose to 70-90 cents from the 50 cents last week.

""There has been interest from two segments, the wholesalers and high net worth individuals, so it is still strong,"" said Loh Mun Chun, Director, Private Wealth at GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

""The wholesalers need to buy ... to produce jewellery, especially with some spillover demand coming from the Diwali and Dhanterras festivals, while the high net worth individuals ... buy to diversify their portfolio and they have the money.""

Japanese markets were closed for a public holiday on Friday.

La ""cabliothèque"" est devenu un lieu d'échange culturel et littéraire dans ce petit village: ""Ça a créé du lien social dans un village un peu vieillissant"".","INSOLITE - Dans le petit village normand de Boissey, entre Lisieux et Caen, se trouve une cabine téléphonique. Inutilisée depuis longtemps, elle vieillissait sur le bord d'une départementale. Qu'allait-elle bien pouvoir devenir? Allait-elle être démantelée, comme le prévoyait l'un des amendements de la Loi Macron?

C'était compter sans l'ingéniosité et la créativité de l'artiste plasticienne Évelyne Tosello, qui, après s'être installée dans cette commune du Calvados, a décidé de prendre en charge la reconversion pratique et esthétique de la cabine téléphonique qui est devenue une petite bibliothèque libre. Une ""cabliothèque"" en somme.

La ""cabliothèque"" a été installée en 2015, mais elle connaît une seconde jeunesse (et récolte les louanges des internautes) depuis qu'elle s'est retrouvée sur Twitter début novembre.

Au départ c'est une cabine téléphonique dans un village, de plus près c'est une bibliothèque, et à bien y penser c'est beaucoup plus encore. pic.twitter.com/TejskfB1mx 4 novembre 2017

Le principe est simple: n'importe qui peut venir se servir ou déposer un nouveau livre. Une fois lu, l'ouvrage doit être replacé dans la ""cabliothèque"", afin que les autres riverains puissent en profiter. Basée sur le civisme des lecteurs, l'initiative a été soutenue par la Mairie de la ville et par son maire, Monsieur Philippe Desforges.

L'idée a germé dans la tête de l'artiste pendant la fête de ce village de 230 âmes, en juillet 2015. Après avoir eu l'autorisation d'Orange (anciennement France Télécom), propriétaire des cabines téléphoniques dans l'hexagone, Évelyne Tosello s'est retroussée les manches, prête à donner à l'habitacle une nouvelle vie: ""J'ai décidé de m'impliquer dans la vie du village, afin de créer du lien humain et social. Mon fils a réalisé les calligraphies que l'on voit en haut de la ""cabliothèque"" et un menuisier du village s'est chargé de fabriquer les étagères. On ne voulait pas dissimuler la beauté de la cabine, juste la réhabiliter"", confie l'artiste au HuffPost. Trois mois de travaux plus tard, la cabine téléphonique était métamorphosée.

Deux années sont passées et des centaines de livres ont été empruntés. Même si Évelyne Tosello a eu de bons échos de la part des habitants, elle manque de retour. Les nombreux partages des photos de sa bibliothèque en ce mois de novembre lui permettront sans doute d'avoir plus de témoignages de lecteurs.

Environ 600 ouvrages sont proposés dans cette cabine et malgré quelques livres ""piqués"", Évelyne Tosello retient surtout le bon côté de cette expérience. La ""cabliothèque"" est devenu un lieu d'échange culturel et littéraire dans ce petit village: ""Ça a créé du lien social dans un village un peu vieillissant"".

L'initiative a inspiré d'autres communes françaises: dans le Morbihan, le Vaucluse, l'Oise ou le Vercors, des dizaines de cabines téléphoniques sont reconverties en bibliothèques. Mais celle de Boissey a été l'une des premières avec la ""cabliothèque"" de Conliège, dans le Jura, inaugurée un an plus tôt. Des pionniers!

Jamais à court d'idées, Évelyne Tosello ne compte pas raccrocher: deux autres cabines téléphoniques sont en attente de reconversion. ""J'aimerais qu'elles deviennent des petits musées. Mais je ne le ferai pas seule, il faut que les autres habitants de Boissey se motivent. Les Normands, il faut les secouer pour casser leur petit mode de vie"", lance-t-elle dans un éclat de rire.

A man in Tamil Nadu was so overcome with anger that some puppies apparently peed in his clothes, that he flung them off a terrace, killing them on the spot. Worse, he boasted about killing the first puppy, posting it on a WhatsApp group, reported The Times of India.

""1 down, 1 more to go, DoggyTales,"" Vishesh Iyengar reportedly posted in a WhatsApp group of some of his classmates at an engineering college in Vellore. ""Black dog down,"" he replied after a group member asked him if the dog was dead.

According to reports, Iyengar killed one black puppy and another light brown puppy soon afterwards. The second puppy had been recently rescued by another resident in the area and was their pet. It had apparently wandered into the apartment complex where Iyengar lives.

A police complaint has been registered at the Katpadi K1 station by animal rights activists. The resident who had rescued the second puppy reportedly claimed that Iyengar did not show any remorse, saying, ""It's just a dog, I didn't kill a human.""

Depuis le début de l'année, plusieurs discriminations dont sont victimes les femmes au sein de l'espace public ont été dénoncées de manière massive sur les réseaux sociaux, en témoignent les hashtags qui fleurissent autour du harcèlement (#BalanceTonPorc, #DearCatCaller) ou encore autour du phénomène de #Manspreading -qui consiste à s'asseoir en écartant les cuisses et en occupant ainsi le plus de place possible au détriment des autres voyageurs. La toile est devenue cet espace public sans contour géographique, où les voix se libèrent collectivement et appellent à la mise en place de solutions locales.

- Dans le champ de l'éducation, il est primordial que l'ensemble des systèmes éducatifs revisite les rôles femme-homme et inculquent aux citoyens une culture de solidarité face aux agressions dans l'espace public.

- De même, les politiques publiques se doivent d'être exemplaires et incitatives, à l'image du principe de Gender Budgeting (loi du 12 janvier 2007) défini par le Conseil de l'Europe, qui permet d'évaluer les inégalités financières liées au genre et d'étendre l'obligation de vigilance à tous les services de l'État en matière de dépense publique.

- Nous partageons la conviction que c'est en nous rassemblant en un même lieu un moment donné que nous pourrons tisser des liens et faire émerger collectivement une réflexion constructive au service d'un vivre-ensemble citoyen.

Amid shouts of “resign!” and “shame!”, the Foreign Secretary also came under heavy attack from Tory MPs such as Anna Soubry after he refused to apologise properly for his remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson admitted “I could have been clearer” when he claimed last week that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in Iran - a line which was seized on by the Tehran authorities as proof that she was ‘spreading propaganda’ against the regime. But he sparked anger after he refused repeated requests to apologise for his comments. Eventually, he said he was ‘sorry’- but only ‘if’ his words had been taken out of context. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer the Thomson-Reuters foundation had insisted the Foreign Secretary should correct his remarks, amid claims that Iranian judges want to double her possible sentence for alleged spying from five years to 10 years. She was arrested last year after a family holiday to see relatives. Her three-year-old daughter has been placed with grandparents while her mother has been locked in jail, often in solitary confinement. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry laid into Johnson, declaring Theresa May didn’t have the “strength or authority” to sack him, but he should do the decent thing and resign.

Thornberry said that he should say sorry for “the distress and anguish that his foolish words have caused” to Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family. “How many more times does this need to happen? How many more times does the Foreign Secretary have to insult our international partners, damage our diplomatic relations, and now imperil the interests of British nationals abroad? “What will it take before the Prime Minister will say ‘Enough is Enough’? “But if the truth is that she can’t, because she doesn’t have the strength or authority to sack him, how about the Foreign Secretary himself showing a bit of personal responsibility, and admitting that a job like this, where your words hold gravity and your actions have consequences, is simply not the job for him.”

Empics Entertainment Yvette Cooper.

Cooper was just as withering, declaring “the lives and the safety of British citizens across the globe depends on having a Foreign Secretary who does not bluster and is not too careless or too lazy to consider his words”. “The Foreign Secretary cannot be trusted to do this job. And he should resign.” Johnson said that Zaghhari-Ratcliffe’s husband Richard had sent him a note welcoming his clarification. The Foreign Secretary said that he also intended to take a trip to Iran personally to try to secure her release. And he hit back at Thornberry, insisting that the Iranian foreign minister had assured him his remarks had had no bearing on the sentencing process. “She deflects blame and accountability for those holding that mother in jail - and that is the Iranian regime,” Johnson said. Eventually, after his 40-minute grilling, Johnson expressed his regrets for his words, although only with a caveat that they had been misinterpreted. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, whose Oxford constituency includes family members of the jailed mother, said: “The fact is the family have been worried sick, by his irresponsible comments. “On a human level is the Foreign Secretary at all sorry for the rollercoaster of emotions he has caused Nazanin and her family this week and could he at least apologise to them today?”

Johnson replied: “Of course I’m sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of course I am..” But he faced a fresh backlash for qualifying his apology with the word ‘if’.

Η Sia ανέβασε ένα screenshot της «προσφοράς» που έκανε ο πωλητής της φωτογραφίας στους ενδεχόμενους αγοραστές, η οποία αναγράφει:

«Αν την αγοράσετε, δεν θα είναι θολή και θα λάβετε επιπλέον άλλες 14 φωτογραφίες».

Έτσι, προκειμένου να γλιτώσει τους φαν της από την κομπίνα και να ξεμπερδεύει μια ώρα αρχύτερα με το όλο θέμα, η Sia ανέβασε ολόκληρη τη φωτογραφία στον λογαριασμό της στο Twitter, γράφοντας:

At least two people were killed and one wounded in a shooting inside a Walmart store in suburban Denver on Wednesday, police said.

Police in Thornton, Colorado, did not immediately release any information about the circumstances of the shooting or who was responsible for the gunfire.

In a Twitter post about 90 minutes after the shooting, police said investigators had confirmed that two men were dead and a woman was taken to a local hospital, but no further details were given.

The situation appeared potentially ominous from authorities' initial reports.

""We've got multiple parties down, we're still trying to ascertain what their conditions are,"" Officer Victor Avila of the Thornton Police Department told Reuters by telephone not long after police arrived on the scene.

#BREAKING Police in Thornton Co search @Walmart store after gunfire reported. Police also believe multiple people are down #fox5atl pic.twitter.com/jDI0MhWrRE — Paul Gourley (@pgFox5) November 2, 2017

About an hour after the initial alert, police said on Twitter that the threat of gunfire had ended at the store, which was surrounded by police and fire crews.

""At this time this is NOT an active shooter. Active crime scene. We will update as info becomes available,"" the police department said in that tweet. Confirmation of the two fatalities came about 20 minutes later.

Thornton is city of about 120,000 people roughly 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown Denver.

Avila said police were called to the store at about 6:30 p.m. Mountain time (8:30 p.m. ET) and that the gunshots had ceased by the time the first officers arrived at the scene.

A Walmart customer, Aaron Stephens, 44, of Thorton, told Reuters he was inside paying for groceries at a self-checkout stand when he heard gunshots and the sound of ricocheting bullets.

""The employees started screaming and the customers started screaming"" as people began to flee the store, he recounted. ""I ran out, too, because I didn't want to get shot.""

Stephens said he did not see where the shooting had come from and did not see anyone struck by bullets.

Local NBC television affiliate 9NEWS reported that a woman whose son was in the Walmart had told her that he had heard about 30 gunshots and was still inside.

A video posted on Twitter showed the Walmart, which is situated in a large complex of big-box stores and other retail outlets adjacent to U.S. Interstate 25, apparently empty except for police officers with guns drawn.",At Least Two Dead In Shooting Inside Walmart Store In Suburban Denver,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/01/at-least-two-dead-in-shooting-inside-walmart-store-in-suburban-denver_a_23264036/

Diciassettemila preferenze, anzi 17.359 nel feudo di papà in provincia di Messina. Il papà è Francantonio, l'ex deputato del Pd condannato a 11 anni di carcere in primo grado, per truffa e frode fiscale, e passato in Forza Italia. Pesano, eccome, i cosiddetti ""impresentabili"" nel voto siciliano che ha portato all'elezione di Nello Musumeci. A Palermo è stata eletta Marianna Caronia, che accolse Berlusconi al Politeama con uno striscione di benvenuto di almeno cinque metri, coinvolta nell'inchiesta sugli appalti del servizio marittimo, il famoso ""sistema Trapani"" che ha potato in carcere l'ex sindaco: 6370 preferenze. Sempre a Palermo è stato eletto con 6554 preferenze Riccardo Savona, già deputato regionale con la destra nel 2012, poi passato con Crocetta e ora tornato in Forza Italia. Non è indagato ma la rottura (con Crocetta) si consumò nel corso del congresso dei Riformisti, quando l'ex governatore, vedendolo seduto in prima fila disse, citando Pio La Torre: ""Qui qualcuno deve uscire dalla sala"". Il riferimento era a un'intercettazione di Savona con il re dell'eolico Vito Nicastri, secondo le indagini della Dia spregiudicato manager a servizio di Matteo Messina Denaro, ultimo grande latitante di Cosa Nostra.

Per poco invece non è stato eletto Riccardo Pellegrino, uno dei nomi più chiacchierati di questa campagna elettorale, arrivato secondo a Catania nella lista di Forza Italia. Fratello di Gaetano, imputato per mafia, consigliere comunale nella sua città, ha raccolto 4427 preferenze. Complessivamente Forza Italia ha eletto dodici deputati regionali, la lista di Musumeci Diventerà Bellissima quattro, la lista Fdi-Lega tre, i Popolari e autonomisti di Saverio Romano cinque.

Altro escluso Antonello Rizza, sindaco di Priolo parecchi capi di imputazione, arrestato con l'accusa di truffa e turbativa d'asta, nonostante le sue 4929 preferenze. A Trapani non ce l'ha fatta Giovanni Lo Sciuto, tornato da poco in Forza Italia dal partito di Angelino Alfano. Lo Sciuto non ha indagini in corso ma è finito più volte tra le polemiche per i suoi vecchi rapporti di conoscenza con Matteo Messina Denaro. Il giornalista Sandro Ruotolo, in una sua inchiesta, mostrò una fotografia in cui i due vengono immortalati assieme al matrimonio della cugina del superlatitante. ""All'epoca dei fatti, la famiglia Messina Denaro non aveva, per quelle che erano le mie conoscenze di ragazzino, problemi con la giustizia e, non avendo io il dono della chiaroveggenza, non potevo prevedere quello che sarebbe successo"", ha precisato Lo Sciuto. Facendo una somma, solo per le liste di Forza Italia: 39.639 le preferenze dei nomi più chiacchierati.

Sempre a sostegno di Musumeci, nella lista dell'Udc, viene eletto a Messina Cateno De Luca con 5418, vulcanico ex deputato regionale, per il quale la procura ha chiesto una condanna a 5 anni: è accusato di aver favorito le imprese della sua famiglia quando era sindaco del piccolo comune di Fiumedinisi. L'inchiesta è nota come il ""Sacco di Fiumedinisi"". Sono invece rimasti fuori a Siracusa Giovan Battista Coltraro (2752), già sostenitore di Crocetta, per falso in atto pubblico e Giuseppe Sorbello, detto Pippo (1949), democristiano da più lustri, grande tessitore di relazioni, incappato cinque anni fa in un'inchiesta per voto di scambio con il clan Nardo di Lentini. Ad Agrigento non viene eletto, sempre nell'Udc, Gaetano Cani, nonostante i 4220 voti. È rinviato a giudizio per estorsione, perché avrebbe fatto firmare ai docenti di un istituto paritario le dimissioni in bianco. Facendo la somma, sono 14339 i voti raccolti dagli ""impresentabili"" del partito di Lorenzo Cesa.

Tra i Popolari e autonomisti, la lista ispirata da Saverio Romano sono eletti nomi pesanti dei tempi di Totò Cuffaro. A partire da Toto Cordaro, storico avvocato di Vasa vasa nel processo per concorso esterno: 8170 voti a Palermo. Stessa cifra Roberto Lagalla, ex rettore dell'Università di Palermo e soprattutto ex assessore alla Sanità dell'ultimo governo Cuffaro. E, direbbe Totò, ""ho detto tutto"". Nessuno dei due è coinvolto in processi, entrambi legati a un passato politicamente ingombrante. A Palermo non è invece riuscito a farsi eleggere Roberto Clemente nonostante i 5520 voti. Al suo attivo una condanna, in primo grado, per corruzione elettorale. Altro escluso Roberto Corona, a Messina (2218), condannato in primo grado a 3 anni, per via di alcune fideiussioni facili quando presiedeva Confcommercio con relativa confisca di 650mila euro di beni. Sempre tra i non eletti, a Trapani però, c'è il nome di Santino Catalano (2210 voti), che patteggiò un anno e 11 mesi per abuso edilizio. Complessivamente, 26.288 voti comprendendo l'avvocato di Cuffaro e il suo assessore alla Sanità, non indagati.

Risulta eletto, nelle liste di Musumeci, Giuseppe Zitelli con 6221, condannato a risarcire 3000 euro oltre le spese legali e di giustizia dalla Corte dei conti, nell'ambito di una Rimborsopoli nella provincia di Catania. Tra i non eletti invece Pietro D'Aì, con la lista di Musumeci Diventerà Bellissima: è stato scagionato da ogni accusa per mafia, col Gip che ha rivelato solo una gestione della cosa pubblica in taluni casi ""francamente illecita"". Per lui solo 1708 voti. Restano fuori anche Ernesto Calogero (1699), condannato in primo grado a 4 anni per compravendita di diplomi

Complessivamente, il peso dei voti legati ai personaggi più chiacchierati, stando ai più noti, raggiunge nel centrodestra quota 89903, più di un decimo del totale dei voti di Musumeci (830mila).

Anche a sinistra ci sono parecchi chiacchierati, trasformisti e riciclati vari. Luca Sammartino e Michele Catanzaro, due enfant prodige della covata di Cuffaro nell'Udc, sono eletti col Pd rispettivamente con 32.492 e 6.409 voti. Eletto a Ragusa anche Emanuele Dipasquale, detto Nello (5972). Le cronache di qualche tempo ricordano di quando era un berlusconiano di ferro e urlava ""il Pd fa schifo"", ""è pieno di pagliacci"".

Bandt told a rally in Melbourne on Saturday that Dutton was prepared to kill for political gain, likening him to a ""terrorist"" for ""threatening people's lives"".

He also said Australia was ""being shamed in the eyes of the world"" for its treatment of the remaining 600 Manus Island asylum seekers, who are said to be without water, power and food after the shutdown of the PNG facility.

Dutton brushed off the criticism, saying the federal government stood by its record on preventing asylum seekers dying at sea.

""I think that says more about Mr Bandt and the Greens than it does about me. The Australian Government has stopped deaths at sea. We've got every child out of detention,"" he said, according to the ABC.

""Mr Bandt, when he was in Government with [former Prime Minister] Julia Gillard, presided over 50,000 people coming on 800 boats and 1,200 people drowned at sea.""

More than 1,000 people gathered at Melbourne's State Library on Saturday for the rally before an action at Federation Square backing the men who remain at the centre, despite its official closure this week.

In Sydney, hundreds rallied in the city's CBD against the treatment of the men.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will discuss the issue on Sunday with newly-elected New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is in Sydney for a whirlwind visit.

Ardern this week confirmed that the previous NZ government's offer to take 150 refugees from Australia's offshore detention centres still stands amid the ongoing stand-off on Manus.

Labor Senator Doug Cameron said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had failed on the long-running issue.

""The Coalition could have easily done the Bali process, walked there with our neighbours about how we deal with this issue, (and) done international agreements to get people off the island,"" he told the ABC.

Davies-Carr filmed the 55-second video in May 2007 just to capture a moment in their lives, and he uploaded it only after reviewing it and finding it funny.

It struck a chord with many, ultimately receiving more than 854 million views.

But Davies-Carr told HuffPost exclusively that he had no idea one of the viewers might be the mastermind of one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil.

“I don’t know how to react,” Davies-Carr said when contacted by phone at his home in London. “It’s hard to take in.

“You never can tell who has a lighter side. It’s hard to imagine he’s planning terrible things one minute and then laughing with his family over this the next.”

Davies-Carr said his sons, 13-year-old Harry and 11-year-old Charlie, aren’t surprised by it because they’re too young to know much about 9/11.

However, his wife’s first reaction was different than his own.

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Die Villa wurde im Jahr 1987 für den Werbefachmann Robert Pritikin gebaut. Derzeit steht das Anwesen zum Verkauf. Wer es haben möchte, muss aber tief in die Tasche greifen: Das Anwesen kostet elf Millionen Dollar, also umgerechnet knapp zehn Millionen Euro.

Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das!","""Phubbing"" heißt, dass wir jemanden wegen unseres Handys ignorieren

Viele von uns haben wahrscheinlich selbst schon mal ""gephubbed""

Im Video seht ihr, welche anderen Anzeichen es für eine scheiternde Beziehung gibt

Ein Date kann fast schon nicht mehr deprimierender werden als dieses: Eine Klientin der Eheberaterin Christine Wilke war so sehr in ihr Handy vertieft, dass sie nicht mal bemerkt hatte, dass das Date vorbei war.

“Sie hatte ein ernsthaftes Problem mit ihrem Smartphone und hat es nach diesem Essen mit ihrem Freund bemerkt”, sagt die Therapeutin aus Pennsylvania.

“Meine Klientin war in ihrem Bildschirm versunken und als sie aufsah, hatte ihr Partner schon längst bezahlt und wartete an der Tür auf sie.”

Diese Frau hat ganz extremes “phubbing” betrieben - ihren Partner ignoriert und nur ihrem Handy die Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt.

Das Wort “phubbing” setzt sich aus den englischen Wörtern “phone”, also Handy, und “snubbing”, jemanden oder etwas ignorieren, zusammen.

Und dieses Verhalten scheint sich immer mehr zu verbreiten und sich in unser Leben einzuschleichen - vor allem in Beziehungen.

Wenn der Partner eine Affäre mit dem Handy hat

In einer neuen Studie der Baylor Universität wurden 143 Paare gefragt, wie oft ihre Interaktionen mit ihrem Partner durch ihr Handy unterbrochen wurde.

70 Prozent gaben “manchmal”, “oft”, “sehr oft” oder “ständig” an.

In einer weiterführenden Umfrage mit 145 Menschen gaben 22,6 Prozent an, dass “phubbing” in ihrer Beziehung zu Streit geführt habe. 36,6 Prozent gaben an, dass sie sich deprimiert fühlen, wenn sie das Gefühl haben, dass ihr Partner ihr Handy über sie stellt.

Wilkes bekommt dieses frustrierende Schauspiel die ganze Zeit in ihrer Praxis zu sehen. “Die Paare, die zu mir kommen, haben ein starkes Verlangen, eine starke Verbindung zueinander aufzubauen oder sie zu vertiefen - aber ihre Handys haben ihr Leben übernommen”, erklärt die Therapeutin.

“Oft erzählen sie mir dann, dass es sich anfühlt, als hätte ihr Partner eine Affäre mit dem Smartphone.” Eine Beziehung vor einem Bildschirm zu führen, ist zweifellos keine Art und Weise zu leben.

Wilkes und andere Eheberater und Therapeuten geben deshalb ihre besten Ratschläge, wie ihr eurer “phubbing” in den Griff bekommen könnt:

1. Hört auf zu denken, dass ihr euer komplettes Date auf Snapchat und Instagram teilen müsst

“Eine Sache fasziniert mich immer wieder (als Therapeut macht sie mich allerdings eher traurig): Ein Paar geht zusammen aus, aber eine Person ist ständig damit beschäftigt, Bilder zu teilen, anstatt dem anderen Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken.

Social Media hat viele Vorteile, aber es kann auch dazu führen, dass die Menschen sofortige Bestätigung suchen, anstatt einfach mit dem Moment zufrieden zu sein, in dem sie sich gerade befinden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Konzertfans, packt endlich eure verdammten Smartphones weg!

Wenn du auch einer der Übeltäter von “Schau mich an!”-Postings bist, anstatt die gemeinsame Zeit mit deinem Partner zu genießen, solltest du dich bemühen, Disziplin zu lernen.

Hör auf, so besessen von Likes zu sein. Das heißt natürlich nicht, dass du kein süßes Selfie von euch posten kannst.

Aber halte dich einfach mit dem Posten zurück, bis das Date vorbei ist - oder, wenn es sein muss, warte, bis dein Partner auf die Toilette verschwindet. ― Carin Goldstein, Eheberaterin und Familientherapeutin aus Sherman Oaks, Kalifornien

2. Lass dein Handy mal für 30 Minuten am Tag liegen

“Eine der Aufgaben, die ich meinen Paaren mitgebe, ist eine 30-minütige “Elektronik-freie-Zone” zu schaffen - jeden Tag.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Digitalisierung - Fluch und Segen zugleich

In dieser Zeit können sie wertvolle gemeinsame Zeit verbringen, ohne gestört oder abgelenkt zu werden. Diese 30 Minuten werden über die Zeit hinweg länger, denn es wirkt wie eine Pause, die die Paare sehr schätzen.” ― Christine Wilke

3. Bring dein technisches Time Out aufs nächste Level: Handy-Freier Wochenend-Trip

“Ich arbeitete mit einem Pärchen, das über ein Wochenende nach Palm Springs vereisen wollte. Gemeinsam haben wir ein paar Regeln erstellt, was die Elektronik betrifft: Die Handys müssen das ganze Wochenende aus bleiben und in ihren Koffern bleiben.

Jeder darf sein Handy einmal am Tag für fünf Minuten an machen - das ist genug Zeit um kurz seine Nachrichten zu checken und sicher zu gehen, dass einen zu Hause kein Weltuntergang erwartet.

Als das Wochenende vorbei war, schwärmten sie davon, wie viel mehr sie die kleinen Dinge schätzen gelernt haben, der erfrischende Pool, gemeinsam lachen und tiefe, verbundene Intimität.” ― Spencer Scott, Psychologe aus Santa Monica, California



4. Wenn sich dein Partner “gephubbed” fühlt, erkenne es an und höre auf damit

“Ihr solltet ausmachen, dass ihr es euch gegenseitig sagt, wenn ihr euch “gephubbed” fühlt oder einen “phubbing”-Rückfall habt.

Wir verlieren uns alle gerne mal in den Tiefen des Bildschirms, es kann also schnell passieren, dass wir es gar nicht bemerken, dass wir es schon wieder machen.

Es ist wichtig seinem Partner zuzuhören und sein Smartphone zur Seite zu legen, wenn der andere das Gefühlt hat, dass du “phubbst” - das ist ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung für eine gesunde Beziehung.” ― Kristin Zeising, Psychologin aus San Diego, Kalifornien



5. Dein Smartphone ist nicht dein Gegner

“Das mag gegen die eigene Intuition sein, aber wenn du das Verlangen nach Zeit und Aufmerksamkeit hast, versuche nicht zu denken, dass dein Handy das Problem ist - sondern sieh es als einen Teil der Lösung an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Dieses lustige Video macht auf die Gefahren von Smartphones aufmerksam - und es hat eine wichtige Botschaft

Fürsorgliche Nachrichten über den Tag verteilt, oder Snapchats, die nur zwei Sekunden dauern, können eine schöne Erinnerung daran sein, dass du und dein Partner über den Tag hinweg aneinander denkt. Es hilft vielleicht auch, sich so weniger isoliert und gereizt zu fühlen.” ― Spencer Scott

6. Mach dir klar, dass es nicht so einfach sein wird, dein Handy wegzulegen

“Es ist ein Suchtverhalten - es ist nicht so einfach, damit aufzuhören. Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das! Am Anfang wirst du noch eine sogenannte kognitive Dissonanz spüren.

Deine Gewohnheit, wie du dein Handy benutzt, zu unterbrechen wird sich falsch für dich anfühlen.

Es wird ungefähr einen Monat dauern, bis sich die neue Gewohnheit - deinen Liebsten, Freunden und Familie Aufmerksamkeit in Person zu geben und nicht über dein Handy - natürlich anfühlt.

Aber vertrau mir: das wird es wert sein.” ― Barbara Melton, Beraterin aus Charleston, South Carolina

NEW DELHI -- The all-powerful GST Council may consider lowering tax rates on a host of goods such as handmade furniture, plastic products and daily use items like shampoo, and simplify return filing rules in its meeting this week.

The council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is scheduled to meet on November 10 to consider lowering of the 28% GST rate on certain common use items, government officials said.

In further relief to small and medium enterprises, the panel is likely to rationalise tax rate in sectors where the total incidence of taxation has gone up because the goods were earlier either exempt from excise or was attracted lower VAT rates in the previous indirect tax regime.

The council has been meeting every month since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which amalgamated over a dozen central and state taxes, was introduced on July 1.

The meetings have resulted in an array of changes to ease compliance burden on businesses as well as provided relief to consumers.

""A rationalisation of items in the 28% tax bracket is expected. Most of the daily use items could be lowered to 18%. Also tax rate on items like furniture, electric switches, plastic pipes could be relooked,"" an official said.

All types of furniture attract a 28% tax under GST. Wooden furniture is handmade by unorganised sector artisans and is mostly used by middle class families and there have been demands for lowering tax incidence on them.

Also, some items of plastic attract 18% GST but goods like shower baths, sinks, wash basins, bidets, lavatory pans, seats and covers, flushing cisterns and similar sanitary ware of plastics attract 28% levy.

There is a need for rationalisation of tax rates on these items, officials said. The plastic manufacturers in their representation to the revenue department had said that 80% of the industry is in MSME category.

Besides, the GST rate on weighing machines, compressors may also be rationalised to 18% from 28%.

Officials said 90% of the manufacturers are from small and medium industries who in the pre-GST era were exempt from excise duty on manufactured value of less than Rs 1.5 crore.

Hence, such machines only attracted VAT of 14.5%. With regard to compressors, the total pre-GST incidence was 17.5% (12.5% excise duty and 5% VAT), they said stressing on need to rationalise the tax incidence.

The GST Council, which comprises of representatives of all states, have already rationalised tax rates for over 100 items. The Council has last month approved an Approach Paper to be followed by the fitment committee while deciding on future rate revisions.

Under GST various goods and services have been bracketed in 5, 12, 18 and 28%. GST has subsumed over a dozen taxes, including excise, service tax and VAT, and transformed India into a single market.",GST Council May Consider Lowering Tax Rates On Common Goods Like Plastic Products And Shampoo,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/05/gst-council-may-consider-lowering-tax-rates-on-common-goods-like-plastic-products-and-shampoo_a_23267121/

Maybe the video would be remembered for longer and the woman’s words taken more seriously than Heard’s ever were.
But in this post-Weinstein Hollywood, I’m finding the celebration of Depp increasingly more difficult to bear.","For the past year, I have struggled to stomach the presence of Johnny Depp.

This started with his split from Amber Heard. When they settled their divorce outside of court, many aspects of the couple’s parting remained private, but a number of others did not. The video of him, drinking and appearing to throw a bottle in his kitchen is on the internet, as is a photograph of a mirror, stained with the name of a man Depp thought his wife was having an affair with. Heard said that the words on it are written in paint and blood, which had leaked from Depp’s hand shortly after he accidentally chopped off a chunk of his finger off (Depp claimed he injured the finger during a filming). In a joint statement, the couple labelled their marriage “at times volatile, but always bound by love”. Heard then donated her entire £7million settlement to charity, giving half to an organisation that works to prevent domestic violence.

The months I spent covering this - writing news stories, a piece on the media’s portrayal of Heard and another on the settlement money - left me with a dislike for Depp, but one that I could put aside when necessary (mainly when I wanted to watch Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands again).

I rolled my eyes when he was announced as the special guest for Glastonbury’s all-new Cinemageddon area and skipped ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ when his role in it was revealed, but knew that others still held highly favourable opinions of him and respected their decisions.

Then on Thursday, I watched as fans clamoured for a glimpse of the star at the Murder On The Orient Express premiere, shouting his name and cheering him on. When Depp appeared on the big screen, the people inside the Royal Albert Hall whooped and clapped and suddenly, the indifference I’d just about managed to just muster up before was gone. Things are different now.

For the past month, the entertainment industry has played host to an unprecedented amount of sexual harassment and abuse allegations, beginning with those against Harvey Weinstein. It’s being described as a “watershed moment” for improving the treatment of women in the industry and time will hopefully confirm that this is the case.

But the revelations that have been made in the last month could also have a ripple effect that we did not initially expect. (It’s hard to know what to call it all, but I refuse to say “scandal” or “controversy” and hasten to label the accounts “incidents”)

For me, it appears that I can no longer find excuses to separate a man’s reported actions from his “art”. It’s too much of an ask when my average working day now includes hours of reading and writing about crimes powerful men in Hollywood have allegedly committed against women (and in some cases, other men).

Let me be clear: Depp and Weinstein are miles apart. The two are not linked and this is not a comparison of their alleged actions. While still unacceptable, incidents that result in your estranged wife requesting a temporary restraining order are not the same as the alleged harassment of over 50 women (Weinstein has denied all claims of nonconsensual sex). But as we deal with the fallout from the latter, I’m finding it harder and harder to look past the former.

Depp isn’t just ‘getting by’ in the industry. The quality of his movies may have flatlined but when it comes to earnings, he’s going from strength to strength. ‘Pirates Of The Caribbean’ continues to be one of Disney’s most financially successful franchises and Depp will also take the lead in the forthcoming ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ films. He occasionally performs with his band, Hollywood Vampires, and fronts a Christian Dior fragrance campaign.

Only time will tell on this, but I wonder what would happen if an actor went through a similar split now, or in a few months time. Would we question them more? Perhaps the actor’s famous friends would hesitate before publicly defending him so fervently. Maybe the video would be remembered for longer and the woman’s words taken more seriously than Heard’s ever were.

The line in the sand has been drawn though, decreeing that Weinstein - who takes the role of a beached whale in this analogy - be left to wilt on the shore as Captain Jack Sparrow sails past untroubled. I’m not saying Depp should face the same consequences as the ones the producer is and, given that his divorce played out pre-Weinstein, it’s unlikely he’ll face anything other than continued adulation from legions of fans in the years to come. But in this post-Weinstein Hollywood, I’m finding the celebration of Depp increasingly more difficult to bear.","In Post-Weinstein Hollywood, The Celebration Of Johnny Depp Is Increasingly Hard To Bear",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/rachel-mcgrath/in-post-weinstein-hollywood-the-celebration-of-johnny-depp-is-increasingly-hard-to-bear_a_23267952/

“This isn’t a guns situation,” Trump said, noting that a person in the crowd with a gun shot at the attacker and caused him to flee. “This is a mental health problem at the highest level. It’s a very, very sad event.”

The president woke on Monday morning in Japan to the news that a lone gunman had opened fire on churchgoers at a small Baptist church in rural Texas and killed at least 26 people and injured another 20. The dead and wounded range in age from 5 to 72 years old.

While answering questions in Tokyo, the president referred to the gunman, who multiple reports identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, as a “very deranged individual.”

King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema Wangchuck are on an official trip to India. Right from the airport, where External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj received them, to other official engagements, the star of the moment wasn't the royal couple.

The Crown Prince of Bhutan, Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck, won hearts all around with his cuteness. Born in February, 2016, the little prince was presented with an official football from the FIFA U-17 World Cup and a chess set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

As his smiling parents kept an eye on the pint-sized crown prince, he charmed the PM, bowing prettily and eagerly reaching out for the ball.

And Swaraj wasn't immune to his charm either.

Así arranca su última publicación de Facebook, hecha este lunes 6 de noviembre, la actriz Kristina Cohen. La intérprete de 27 años escribe para denunciar que Ed Westwick, famoso por interpretar a Chuck Bass en Gossip Girl, la violó en 2014. Este martes el actor ha negado a través de sus redes sociales haber cometido ese acto.

En su post, Cohen, quien asegura que en ese momento atravesaba una mala época, ya que su madre estaba muriéndose de cáncer, relata los hechos con todo detalle. ""Me desperté de pronto con Ed sobre mí, con sus dedos entrando en mi cuerpo. Le dije que parara, pero era fuerte. Luché lo más fuerte que pude pero agarró mi cara con sus manos, me zarandeó y me dijo que quería follarme. Estaba paralizada, aterrorizada. No pude hablar, no podía moverme. Él me agarró y me violó"", escribe.

Según cuenta, el episodio ocurrió en casa de Westwick, a la que fue acompañada de un productor. Allí, el actor propuso que podían ""follar todos"", a lo que ella respondió diciendo que quería marcharse. ""Pero el productor no quería que Ed se sintiese incómodo al irnos. Ed insistió en que nos quedásemos para cenar. Dije que estaba cansada y que quería irme, intentando evitar una situación incómoda. Ed me sugirió que echase una cabezada en la habitación de invitados. El productor dijo que deberíamos quedarnos 20 minutos más y limar asperezas y luego nos iríamos"", escribe.

En ese momento se fue a la habitación a tumbarse y al final se quedó dormida. Fue al despertarse de forma repentina cuando se encontró a Ed encima. ""Fue como una pesadilla y los días siguientes no fueron mejor"".

""El productor me echó la culpa y me dijo que había sido participante activa"", continúa la actriz. ""Me dijo que no podía ir diciendo por ahí que Ed me había violado y que no quería ser 'esa chica'. Y durante mucho tiempo le creí. No quería ser 'esa chica"".

Cohen termina su texto asegurando que espera que su relato sirva para ayudar a otras personas y decirles que no están solos. ""Ellos no son culpables y no es su culpa"", asegura la actriz, que quiere ejercer el papel que han ejercido sobre ella todas esas personas que en el último mes han denunciado episodios similares protagonizados por el productor Harvey Weisntein, los actores Kevin Spacey y Dustin Hoffman y los directores James Toback y Brett Ratner.

Menos de 24 horas después de la publicación, Westwick se ha manifestado en redes sociales y ha negado los hechos de los que le acusan. ""No conozco a esa mujer. Nunca he forzado a ninguna mujer de ninguna forma. Ciertamente nunca he cometido una violación"", asegura en un escueto comunicado, compartido en Facebook, Twitter e Instagram.

However, she can now thank her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, for changing this (outdated) royal rule before her birth.

Under the Act of Settlement of 1701, all male siblings could skip ahead of their sisters in the line of succession, no matter their birth order, PopSugar reports. This is known as male primogeniture, and unfortunately meant the Queen's second child and only daughter, Princess Anne, was bumped from third-in-line to the throne to fifth after the birth of her siblings Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.

Princess Charlotte in Berlin during the royal tour of Poland and Germany in July 2017.

In 2013, Her Majesty decided to change this sexist system with the Succession of the Crown Act, which essentially replaced male primogeniture with absolute primogeniture. The act then became official in March 2015, just two months before Princess Charlotte was born, securing her place as fourth-in-line to the throne.

The new succession laws now apply to all royals born after Oct. 28, 2011. That year, 16 British Commonwealth countries — including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Bahamas — voted to make the changes. At that time, Britain's then-Prime Minister David Cameron said, ""The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he is a man ... this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we have become.""

Earlier on HuffPost:

Thanks to the new succession laws, Prince Charles is first-in-line to the throne, followed by Prince William, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The third royal baby, regardless of gender, will then be fifth-in-line, followed by Prince Harry.

The royals have always had very particular rules regarding succession and titles. For example, another rule is that Prince George's future children will receive royal titles, but Princess Charlotte's won't.

Lucy Hume, associate director of expert etiquette company Debrett's, explained this to Town & Country saying, ""Royal titles are inherited through sons, so if Princess Charlotte has children they would not automatically inherit the titles HRH, Prince, or Princess,"" she said.

However, Hume added that there can be exceptions: ""The monarch may offer to bestow a royal title upon his or her daughter's children.""",Princess Charlotte Can Thank The Queen For Securing Her Succession To The Throne,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/06/princess-charlotte-succession-to-throne_a_23268250/

Diciassettemila preferenze, anzi 17.359 nel feudo di papà in provincia di Messina. Il papà è Francantonio, l'ex deputato del Pd condannato a 11 anni di carcere in primo grado, per truffa e frode fiscale, e passato in Forza Italia. Pesano, eccome, i cosiddetti ""impresentabili"" nel voto siciliano che ha portato all'elezione di Nello Musumeci. A Palermo è stata eletta Marianna Caronia, che accolse Berlusconi al Politeama con uno striscione di benvenuto di almeno cinque metri, coinvolta nell'inchiesta sugli appalti del servizio marittimo, il famoso ""sistema Trapani"" che ha potato in carcere l'ex sindaco: 6370 preferenze. Sempre a Palermo è stato eletto con 6554 preferenze Riccardo Savona, già deputato regionale con la destra nel 2012, poi passato con Crocetta e ora tornato in Forza Italia. Non è indagato ma la rottura (con Crocetta) si consumò nel corso del congresso dei Riformisti, quando l'ex governatore, vedendolo seduto in prima fila disse, citando Pio La Torre: ""Qui qualcuno deve uscire dalla sala"". Il riferimento era a un'intercettazione di Savona con il re dell'eolico Vito Nicastri, secondo le indagini della Dia spregiudicato manager a servizio di Matteo Messina Denaro, ultimo grande latitante di Cosa Nostra.

Per poco invece non è stato eletto Riccardo Pellegrino, uno dei nomi più chiacchierati di questa campagna elettorale, arrivato secondo a Catania nella lista di Forza Italia. Fratello di Gaetano, imputato per mafia, consigliere comunale nella sua città, ha raccolto 4427 preferenze. Complessivamente Forza Italia ha eletto dodici deputati regionali, la lista di Musumeci Diventerà Bellissima quattro, la lista Fdi-Lega tre, i Popolari e autonomisti di Saverio Romano cinque.

Altro escluso Antonello Rizza, sindaco di Priolo parecchi capi di imputazione, arrestato con l'accusa di truffa e turbativa d'asta, nonostante le sue 4929 preferenze. A Trapani non ce l'ha fatta Giovanni Lo Sciuto, tornato da poco in Forza Italia dal partito di Angelino Alfano. Lo Sciuto non ha indagini in corso ma è finito più volte tra le polemiche per i suoi vecchi rapporti di conoscenza con Matteo Messina Denaro. Il giornalista Sandro Ruotolo, in una sua inchiesta, mostrò una fotografia in cui i due vengono immortalati assieme al matrimonio della cugina del superlatitante. ""All'epoca dei fatti, la famiglia Messina Denaro non aveva, per quelle che erano le mie conoscenze di ragazzino, problemi con la giustizia e, non avendo io il dono della chiaroveggenza, non potevo prevedere quello che sarebbe successo"", ha precisato Lo Sciuto. Facendo una somma, solo per le liste di Forza Italia: 39.639 le preferenze dei nomi più chiacchierati.

Sempre a sostegno di Musumeci, nella lista dell'Udc, viene eletto a Messina Cateno De Luca con 5418, vulcanico ex deputato regionale, per il quale la procura ha chiesto una condanna a 5 anni: è accusato di aver favorito le imprese della sua famiglia quando era sindaco del piccolo comune di Fiumedinisi. L'inchiesta è nota come il ""Sacco di Fiumedinisi"". Sono invece rimasti fuori a Siracusa Giovan Battista Coltraro (2752), già sostenitore di Crocetta, per falso in atto pubblico e Giuseppe Sorbello, detto Pippo (1949), democristiano da più lustri, grande tessitore di relazioni, incappato cinque anni fa in un'inchiesta per voto di scambio con il clan Nardo di Lentini. Ad Agrigento non viene eletto, sempre nell'Udc, Gaetano Cani, nonostante i 4220 voti. È rinviato a giudizio per estorsione, perché avrebbe fatto firmare ai docenti di un istituto paritario le dimissioni in bianco. Facendo la somma, sono 14339 i voti raccolti dagli ""impresentabili"" del partito di Lorenzo Cesa.

Tra i Popolari e autonomisti, la lista ispirata da Saverio Romano sono eletti nomi pesanti dei tempi di Totò Cuffaro. A partire da Totò Cordaro, storico avvocato di Vasa vasa nel processo per concorso esterno: 8170 voti a Palermo. Stessa cifra Roberto Lagalla, ex rettore dell'Università di Palermo e soprattutto ex assessore alla Sanità dell'ultimo governo Cuffaro. E, direbbe Totò, ""ho detto tutto"". Nessuno dei due è coinvolto in processi, entrambi legati a un passato politicamente ingombrante. A Palermo non è invece riuscito a farsi eleggere Roberto Clemente nonostante i 5520 voti. Al suo attivo una condanna, in primo grado, per corruzione elettorale. Altro escluso Roberto Corona, a Messina (2218), condannato in primo grado a 3 anni, per via di alcune fideiussioni facili quando presiedeva Confcommercio con relativa confisca di 650mila euro di beni. Sempre tra i non eletti, a Trapani però, c'è il nome di Santino Catalano (2210 voti), che patteggiò un anno e 11 mesi per abuso edilizio. Complessivamente, 26.288 voti comprendendo l'avvocato di Cuffaro e il suo assessore alla Sanità, non indagati.

Risulta eletto, nelle liste di Musumeci, Giuseppe Zitelli con 6221, condannato a risarcire 3000 euro oltre le spese legali e di giustizia dalla Corte dei conti, nell'ambito di una Rimborsopoli nella provincia di Catania. Tra i non eletti invece Pietro D'Aì, con la lista di Musumeci Diventerà Bellissima: è stato scagionato da ogni accusa per mafia, col Gip che ha rivelato solo una gestione della cosa pubblica in taluni casi ""francamente illecita"". Per lui solo 1708 voti. Restano fuori anche Ernesto Calogero (1699), condannato in primo grado a 4 anni per compravendita di diplomi

Complessivamente, il peso dei voti legati ai personaggi più chiacchierati, stando ai più noti, raggiunge nel centrodestra quota 89903, più di un decimo del totale dei voti di Musumeci (830mila).

Anche a sinistra ci sono parecchi chiacchierati, trasformisti e riciclati vari. Luca Sammartino e Michele Catanzaro, due enfant prodige della covata di Cuffaro nell'Udc, sono eletti col Pd rispettivamente con 32.492 e 6.409 voti. Eletto a Ragusa anche Emanuele Dipasquale, detto Nello (5972). Le cronache di qualche tempo ricordano di quando era un berlusconiano di ferro e urlava ""il Pd fa schifo"", ""è pieno di pagliacci"".

Le versement des acomptes est obligatoire dès que l'impôt à payer sur le revenu est supérieur à 1 800$ au fédéral et au provincial.","En tant qu'entrepreneur, le travail à domicile présente certains avantages du point de vue fiscal, notamment celui de pouvoir déduire les dépenses raisonnables effectuées pour gagner un revenu. Le fait de posséder un bureau à domicile ne permet pas automatiquement de considérer une personne comme travailleur autonome. En effet, une personne possédant un bureau dans son sous-sol, mais qui n'a qu'un seul client et qu'elle doit se déplacer régulièrement à l'emplacement de son client pourrait être considéré comme un travailleur salarié et non un travailleur autonome. Chaque situation étant unique, et en cas de doute, il est préférence de demander à l'Agence du revenu du Canada et à Revenu Québec si la personne peut se qualifier de travailleur autonome et si elle par conséquent déduire ses dépenses courantes.

Pour qu'un contribuable puisse déduire ses dépenses, son bureau à domicile doit être son principal lieu d'affaires ou être exclusivement utilisé dans le but de tirer un revenu d'entreprise et rencontrer des clients ou des patients sur une base régulière et contenue dans le cadre de son entreprise (1).

Le contribuable doit cependant être en mesure de justifier toutes les dépenses qu'il déduit, il est donc important de tenir une comptabilité à jour des revenus et des dépenses puisque nulle n'est à l'abri d'une vérification par le fisc. Les frais de déplacement constituent les dépenses les plus souvent vérifiées.

Le montant à déduire est déterminé en proportion de la superficie du bureau par rapport à la superficie totale de la maison.

Avoir un bureau à domicile permet également de déduire entre autres le coût de l'assurance habitation de la résidence, l'électricité, le chauffage, l'impôt foncier, le téléphone et les intérêts sur un prêt hypothèques. Le montant à déduire est déterminé en proportion de la superficie du bureau par rapport à la superficie totale de la maison.

Malgré le fait qu'il soit possible de déduire plusieurs dépenses, il n'est pas toujours possible de déduire toutes les dépenses. En effet, il n'est pas possible de créer une perte de revenu d'entreprise avec les dépenses (2). Conséquemment, les dépenses engagées pourront être déduites qu'à concurrence du revenu du contribuable. Les dépenses qui ne pourront pas être déduites à une année d'imposition ne sont toutefois pas complètement perdues, elles pourront être déduites à une année ultérieure (3).

En plus des frais de déplacement et des faires reliés à l'immeuble dans lequel se trouve le bureau, il est possible pour le contribuable de déduire les frais de location d'une voiture ou les intérêts payés sur un prêt pour acquérir une voiture (4).

Étant donné qu'un travailleur autonome peut être appelé à faire des achats et des ventes dans le cadre de l'exploitation de son travail, il pourrait devoir s'inscrire à la TPS et à la TVQ. Cette inscription doit être faite uniquement si le montant total des ventes taxables puisque si ce total est inférieur à 30 000$, le travailleur autonome n'a pas à percevoir la TPS et la TVQ.

Finalement, un travailleur autonome pourrait également avoir comme obligation de payer des acomptes provisionnels compte tenu du fait qu'aucun impôt n'est prélevé sur ses revenus d'entreprise. Le versement des acomptes est obligatoire dès que l'impôt à payer sur le revenu est supérieur à 1 800$ au fédéral et au provincial. Les acomptes viennent compenser le fait qu'aucune déduction d'impôt n'est faite sur les revenus d'entreprise, ils constituent donc des paiements partiels de l'impôt que devra payer le travailleur autonome. Ces acomptes sont payables le 15 des mois de mars, juin, septembre et décembre. Dans l'éventualité où le montant total des acomptes versés est supérieur au montant d'impôt que le travailleur aurait dû payer, ce dernier recevra un remboursement correspondant à l'excédent et si les acomptes ne sont pas suffisants, le travailleur devra payer la différence.

Es ist die Kehrseite einer gesellschaftlich notwendigen Diskussion darüber, wie Christen und Muslime zusammenleben wollen

Einige Muslime haben darauf ziemlich coole Antworten gefunden

Muslim zu sein, das kann gerade keinen Spaß machen. Neben ein bisschen sachlicher Auseinandersetzung gibt's vor allem Vorurteile und Gepöbel. Im Netz, auf der Straße, überall.

Wie schön, dass sich viele Muslime ihren Humor bewahrt haben. Eine kleine Sammlung der lustigen, sarkastischsten, besten oder anrührendesten Antworten von Muslimen auf die täglichen Zumutungen:

1. Bad Hair Day

Klar, mit einem Kopftuch lässt sich ein Bad-Hair-Day schon mal eher rumbringen als ohne. Aber eine Dauerlösung ist das nicht.

Der US-Biologiestudentin Heraa Hasmi wurde das Gefrotzel jedenfalls zu blöd. Als eine junge Frau twitterte: ""Kopftuchträgerinnen haben es gut, sie müssen sich nicht Haare waschen"", schrieb sie:

""Menschen haben es so gut, sie müssen nicht duschen, seit sie Kleidung tragen.""

Kurz nach Weihnachten 2015 soll der Chef der IS-Terrormiliz Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi alle Muslime dazu aufgerufen haben, sich dem Kampf anzuschließen. Der Autor und Menschenrechtsaktivist Iyad El-Baghdadi – er schreibt vorsichtshalber in seinem Twitter-Profil, dass er also nicht der Baghadadi sei – hat die Info verbreitet. Seine Follower wussten die offenbar ironisch gemeinte Vorlage zu schätzen.

Und antworteten, warum sie, leider, leider, auf keinen Fall kämpfen könnten: ""Ich muss meinen Goldfisch noch zum Tierarzt bringen.""

3. Danke, Mr. Trump

Am 13. Oktober twitterte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Auszug aus einer Rede. ""In Amerika beten wir nicht die Regierung an, sondern Gott."" Es sollte ein Anbiederungsversuch an konservative Christen sein, vor denen er sprach. Er mag diesen Satz sehr, denn im Sommer hatte er ihn schon einmal unters ergeben lauschende Volk gebracht. Denn die mag er, ganz im Gegensatz zu Muslimen.

Und da hatte sich Hend Amry, einen bekannte muslimische Bloggerin, vernehmen lassen: ""Can I get an Allahu Akbar"".

CAN I GET AN ALLAHU AKBAR https://t.co/mSM0VTb3YY — Hend Amry (@LibyaLiberty) 26. Juli 2017

Heißt so viel wie: Danke, Mr. Trump. Sie haben soeben gesagt, dass wir unseren Gott, Allah, anbeten dürfen.

Der Tweet hat inzwischen mehr als 102.000 Likes und wurde 38.000 Mal geteilt.

4. Die arme, unterdrückte Muslima

Muslimische Frauen sind brav, folgsam und räumen den ganzen Tag Männern und der Kinderschar hinterher. Soweit das Klischee.

Als eine Twitter-Nutzerin fragte, vor was denn die Follower am meisten Angst in der Ehe hätten, schrieb die Kopftuch tragende Gül trocken: ""Müde nach Hause zu kommen und zu sehen, dass mein Mann das Abendessen noch nicht gekocht hat.""

5. Homosexuell? Na klar!

Homosexualität ist im Islam eine schwere Sünde. In vielen Ländern wie Pakistan werden Homosexuelle brutal verfolgt.

Aznahn Munas ist laut Medienberichten selbst Muslim, stammt aus Pakistan und hat in Australien eine Firma mitgegründet, die Tücher für Frauen verkauft: Halstücher, Kopftücher.

Seit ein paar Tagen hat die Firma ein neues Produkt im Angebot. Es ist nur gerade ausverkauft, weil die Nachfrage so groß ist: ein Kopftuch in Regenbogenfarben. Den Farben der Homosexuellen.

6. Der falsche Yoga-Guru

Hamzah ist Muslim aus Texas. Und wenn Muslime beten, knien sie mal hin, mal beugen sie den Oberkörper. Auf Twitter schrieb Hamzah, wohin das führte:

""Ich war in der Turnhalle und betete im Yoga-Raum. Drei Frauen folgten meinen Bewegungen. So habe ich versehentlich eine Yoga-Klasse geleitet.""

I was at the gym praying in the yoga room and 3 ladies started following my motions.That's my story on how I accidentally led a yoga class. — Hamzah (@Hamzah_AlS) 14. August 2013

7. Message an den IS

Nach jedem Terroranschlag fordert jemand, Muslime müssten mehr gegen den Terror tun. Eine Forderung, über die man sicher diskutieren muss.

Nur sind viele Muslime genervt - denn so einfach ist die ganze Sache eben auch nicht.

8. Christen ohne Fehl und Tadel

Der bekannte US-Anwalt und Aktivist Qasim Rashid war sauer. ""Ein weißer Übermensch hat mir geschrieben, der Islam sei gewalttätig und höhnte, ich solle ihm eine christliche Version des IS zeigen.""

Die Antwort Rashids:

""400 Jahre transatlantischer Sklavenhandel, im Zuge dessen 20 Millionen afrikanische 'Heiden' verkrüppelt, ermordet, verschleppt und versklavt wurden, um sie auf den Weg Christi zu bringen.

Der Völkermord an den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Namen Christi.

Der Genozid an den australischen Ureinwohnern, bei dem 90 Prozent von ihnen in weniger als einem Jahrhundert umgebracht wurden, wiederum von christlichen Europäern.""

Und das ist erst der Anfang der Aufzählung.

SITTWE, Myanmar - Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on Thursday urged people ""not to quarrel"" as she visited Rakhine State for the first time since a military crackdown that drove more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country.

Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has faced heavy international criticism for not taking a higher profile in responding to what U.N. officials have called ""ethnic cleansing"" by the army.

Myanmar has rejected the accusations of ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces launched a counter-insurgency operation after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts in northern Rakhine on Aug. 25.

On Thursday, amid heightened security, Suu Kyi boarded a military helicopter at Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to be taken to Maungdaw, one of the districts worst hit by the violence.

Suu Kyi met a group of Muslim religious leaders, said Chris Lewa, of the Arakan Project monitoring group, citing Rohingya sources.

""She only said three things to the people - they should live peacefully, the government is there to help them, and they should not quarrel among each other.""

""She only said three things to the people - they should live peacefully, the government is there to help them, and they should not quarrel among each other,"" Lewa said, quoting information from a religious leader who was present.

Rohingya began fleeing predominantly Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in late August to escape violence in the wake of a military counter-insurgency operation launched after Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Rakhine State.

A U.S. State Department delegation will be in Bangladesh on Friday and Saturday to discuss the humanitarian crisis and human rights concerns stemming from the crisis in Rakhine state.

The delegation will be led by Simon Henshaw, acting assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, the department said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Reuters photographers saw thousands of desperate Rohingya wade through shallows and narrow creeks between islands of the Naf river to reach neighbouring Bangladesh as the exodus begun two months ago was far from over.

Some had small boats or pulled makeshift rafts to get to Bangladesh on the river's western bank, but most walked, children cradled in their arms and the elderly carried on their backs, with sacks of belongings tied to staves on their shoulders.

Reaching the far side, some women and older people had to be pulled through the mud to reach dry land atop steep banks.

More than 4,000 crossed at different points on the river on Wednesday, Major Mohammed Iqbal, a Bangladesh security official in the southern district of Cox's Bazar, told Reuters.","Aung San Suu Kyi Visits Rahkine For First Time Since Exodus Of 60,000 Rohingya Muslims",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/03/aung-san-suu-kyi-visits-rahkine-for-first-time-since-exodus-of-60-000-rohingya-muslims_a_23265317/

Das Thema wurde auch im ARD-Talk ""Hart aber fair"" thematisiert

Dort warf CDU-Politiker Meister den Medien mangelnden Kooperationswillen vor - das konnte der Grünen-Europaabgeordnete Giegold nicht auf sich sitzen lassen

Müssen Promis und Politiker nun weltweit erneut zittern? Nach den Offshore Leaks (2013), Lux Leaks (2014), Swiss Leaks (2015) und vor allem den Panama Papers (2016) gibt es eine neue Veröffentlichung zu Steueroasen und dem Vermeiden von Steuerzahlungen durch Reiche. Das Material der Paradise Papers soll sich aus 21 Quellen speisen und rund 13,4 Millionen Dokumente umfassen.

Die Enthüllungen, in Deutschland vorangetrieben von einem Rechercheverbund aus NDR, WDR und ""Süddeutscher Zeitung"" (""SZ""), standen nun am Montagabend zur Diskussion in der ARD-Talkshow ""Hart aber fair"".

Der reißerische Titel: ""Steueroase Europa – wie uns Konzerne und Super-Reiche abzocken!"" Fast zwanzig Minuten lang waren sich die eingeladenen Politiker fast einig. Der CDU-Politiker und Parlamentarische Staatssekretär beim Bundesfinanzminister, Michael Meister, Grünen-Europapolitiker Sven Giegold sowie Journalist Georg Mascolo meinten: Schuld sind die Steueroasen.

Doch dann attackierte Meister plötzlich den Überbringer der - zumindest für viele Steuerflüchtlinge - schlechten Nachrichten. Giegold konnte den Angriff auf die Medien nicht unkommentiert lassen - und keilte zurück.

CDU-Politiker Meister attackiert die Medien

Am Anfang von Frank Plasbergs Sendung musste vor allem der luxemburgische Außenminister Jean Asselborn einstecken. Der wurde dann auch schnell sauer, dass Luxemburg immer als Steueroase verspottet werde. Er betonte: ""Wir haben keine Briefkastenfirmen mehr!""

Doch Mascolo, Leiter des Investigativ-Rechercheteams von NDR, WDR und ""SZ"" kannte noch weitere Beispiele - deren Daten wohl Finanzstaatssekretär Meister gerne hätte.

""Würden Sie mit den Regierungen kooperieren, wenn Herr Meister fragen würden, die Sachen rüberzuschieben, um darauf gesetzgeberisch zu reagieren?"", fragt Plasberg den Journalisten.

Der zeigt sich hart: Er würde eine Zusammenarbeit ablehnen. ""Die Diskussionen hatten wir schon bei den Panama Papers."" Mascolos Begründung: ""Aus Gründen des Informantenschutz werden die Unterlagen staatlichen Behörden nicht zur Verfügung gestellt.""

CDU-Politiker Meister wollte das nicht akzeptieren - und prescht nach vorne. Aus seiner Sicht gehe es um zwei Dinge: Einerseits um Straftaten wie Geldwäsche oder Steuerhinterziehung, die hinter den Konstruktionen stecken würden. Und andererseits um Modelle, die man als Gesetzgeber noch gar nicht kenne.

""Da ist es sinnvoll zu wissen, was passiert eigentlich"", erklärte Meister. ""Ich wäre dankbar und es wäre auch hilfreich gewesen"", wenn die Unterlagen sowohl der Panama Papers als auch der aktuellen Paradise Papers den Staatsanwaltschaften und Finanzbehörden zugänglich gemacht worden wären - ""und nicht nur darüber berichtet worden wäre"", stellte der Finanzstaatssekretär klar.

Unfähigkeit der Politik, Probleme zu beheben

Die Medienschelte wollte Grünen-Finanzexperte Giegold nicht unkommentiert lassen. ""Die ganze Diskussion ist schon ein wenig absurd"", keilte er gegen Meister.

Die Politik müsste eigentlich dankbar sein. Denn über 30 Jahre habe es diese nicht geschafft, diese Steuerschlupflöcher zu schließen. ""Das jetzt die Journalisten den Druck entfalten, der uns zu dieser Debatte befähigt"", sei Giegold zufolge deshalb nur folgerichtig.

Er verstehe die Haltung der Journalisten vollkommen, ihre Ethik des Quellenschutzes nicht aufzugeben. Giegold unterstrich: ""Ich bin den Journalisten dankbar!""

Allerdings müsse vielmehr ""die Unfähigkeit der Politik"" kritisiert werden, das Problem innerhalb Europas nicht behoben zu haben, ""dass alle ihre Steuern gerecht bezahlen"".

Zumindest das Publikum hatte der Grüne da auf seiner Seite.

Writer Anna Graham Hunter recounted the five weeks she spent working with Hoffman as a production assistant in detail for The Hollywood Reporter, painting the Oscar-winner as both a charming and disturbing figure.

“He asked me to give him a foot massage my first day on set; I did. He was openly flirtatious, he grabbed my ass, he talked about sex to me and in front of me,” Hunter recounted. “One morning I went to his dressing room to take his breakfast order; he looked at me and grinned, taking his time.

“I loved the attention from Dustin Hoffman. Until I didn’t,” she added.

Hunter regularly corresponded with her sister, sending detailed messages about Hoffman repeatedly groping her and making sexually inappropriate comments, which the outlet has printed in full.

“Today, when I was walking Dustin to his limo, he felt my ass four times. I hit him each time, hard, and told him he was a dirty old man,” she wrote to her sister. “He took off his hat and pointed to his head (shaved for the part) and said, “No, I’m a dirty young man, I have a full head of hair.”

At the time, Hoffman was at the peak of his career, coming off critically acclaimed films like “Tootsie” and “Kramer vs. Kramer,” a film that has also been embroiled in controversy due to Hoffman’s behavior behind the scenes.

She claims that actor’s misconduct was widely known and condoned on the set of “Death of a Salesman,” despite her efforts to alert superiors who told her to “sacrifice some of our values” to keep the production running smoothly.

Hoffman issued a response apologizing in broad terms for any harm he caused.

“I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I am sorry.

“It’s changing now,” Clarkson said, but at the time being out was not acceptable in country music.","Kelly Clarkson has scored a trio of Grammys, more than 100 cumulative No. 1 singles on various Billboard charts and become an icon in the music industry. Yet from the beginning, the first-ever American Idol says, record labels and executives have tried to define who she is as both a person and musician.

“Honestly, you can look at my previous records and you can hear a suppressed individual,” Clarkson told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “I just constantly felt pushed into a box.”

Atlantic Records Kelly Clarkson says it has taken 15 years to be “allowed” to release new album Meaning of Life.

Throughout her career, Clarkson’s struggle for creative liberation has been tabloid fodder. She dropped Idol’s 19 Management team, then went toe-to-toe with former industry giant Clive Davis to gain greater freedom in her sound. Sometimes there were victories, she said; other times, she had to “compromise.”

A deciding factor in her need to “bend” to corporate pressure was the band and team supporting her. Had she pushed back too much, she told listeners of Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ podcast, the label would “sit on” her music and prevent touring, presenting a financial burden for those with whom she has worked with for nearly a decade.

“You carry this weight on you to keep everyone afloat,” Clarkson confessed. “I feel everything. It’s annoying.”

The superstar recalled a conversation years ago with her equally famous mother-in-law Reba McIntyre. Though conceding she, too, feels the burden of celebrity, the country music legend told Clarkson: “You’re just a different type of personality. You take on everything.”

Fortunately, it appears Clarkson’s “devastating” battle for artistic authenticity is behind her. Now signed to Atlantic Records, she dropped eighth album Meaning of Life Oct. 27. Not only does she feel it’s her best work to date, it’s also proven to be a relief.

“When you are that type of person – an emotional person, in a good way – it’s really wonderful to be part of a project that’s 100-percent you, 100-percent your personality and no one is holding you back,” Clarkson said.

“They’re supporting you being you,” she said of her experience with Atlantic. “Fifteen years later, this is my first time experiencing that!”

Atlantic’s belief in both Clarkson – whose eleven Top 10 hits, three No. 1 singles and trio of chart-topping albums make her one of the industry’s most bankable stars – and the album are obvious. Of 14 tracks on Meaning of Life, Clarkson co-wrote four. The rest bear the sonic stamp of a veritable music industry who’s who.

WATCH: Pollo Del Mar’s Track-By-Track Review of Meaning of Life

Lead single “Love So Soft” alone combines powerhouses Mozella (Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball”), Priscilla Renea (co-writer of Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It”) and Jesse Shatkin (Sia’s “Alive”). Elsewhere are the fingerprints of hip-hop producers The Monarchs (Nicki Minaj, Justin Bieber), Grammy nominee Mick Schultz (Jeremih’s “Birthday Sex”) and Greg Kurstin, the Grammy-winning genius behind Adele’s “Hello.”

Saying she previously has “never worked with people who would allow” an album like Meaning of Life, the Texan indicated the reasons stemmed largely from industry decisions on what kind of artist she should be. However, in the interview ― recorded Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day – Clarkson related the story of Nashville-based songwriter Shane McAnally, whose sexual identity altered his path to stardom.

“He’s a phenomenal writer; he’s had like a bajillion No. 1s now,” Clarkson pointed out. “Back in the day, when he was someone’s assistant somewhere, shuffling coffee around, he got, ‘You can’t make it as a country singer if they know you’re gay.’”

In 1999, McAnally signed to Curb Records. After marginal success as a solo artist, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he came out. When he sought to resume his career in country music, though, the stigma of being a gay artist was off-putting to many. “It’s changing now,” Clarkson said, but at the time being out was not acceptable in country music.

“He had to go a different way, and in the end, it’s worked out for him,” said Clarkson of McAnally, who channeled his considerable talents into writing hits for other.

Now Shane McAnally is a multiple-time Grammy and Academy of Country Music Award-winner who has written No. 1 country singles for everyone from Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban to Miranda Lambert and former Hootie & The Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker.

He was named the 2014 ACM Songwriter of the Year and won two Grammys for work on Kacey Musgraves’ breakthrough Same Trailer Different Park. He appears on-track for another blockbuster year as Sam Hunt’s “Body Like a Back Road,” written by McAnally, crossed into the Top 10 at pop radio and is the biggest country single of 2017. He is presently at work on a Broadway musical based on the TV classic “Hee Haw.”

“It’s insane all the stuff he’s accomplishing,” Clarkson gushed about the man who contributed two songs to her chart-topping 2015 album Piece By Piece.

“But what’s sad about that for me – as a friend who’s watching – is he could have sang all that shit himself,” she lamented. “He’s an amazing singer, an amazing performer, but nobody could get past [his being gay].”","Kelly Clarkson Felt 'Suppressed,' Says Top Country Star's Career Changed When He Came Out",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kelly-clarkson-felt-suppressed-says-being-out-changed_us_59fd07f1e4b0d467d4c224f7

Erst in der vergangenen Woche wurde in Saudi Arabien weltweit zum ersten Mal einem Roboter, der Androidin Sophia, die Staatsangehörigkeit zugesprochen. Das berichtete unter anderem das Online-Magazin ""Live Science"".

Auf einer Technologie-Konferenz in Lissabon wandte sich der berühmte Physiker Stephen Hawking nun an die Menschheit, um vor dieser Entwicklung zu warnen.

Das berichtet der amerikanische Nachrichtensender CNBC. Er warnt, dass der Fortschritt künstlicher Intelligenz das Potential habe, die Menschheit zu zerstören.

""Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen""

In seiner Rede erklärt er: “Computer können theoretisch menschliche Intelligenz nachahmen und diese auch übertreffen. Wenn wir erfolgreich künstliche Intelligenz erzeugen können, wäre das das wichtigste Ereignis unserer Geschichte. Oder das schlimmste. Das wissen wir einfach noch nicht.”

Hawking äußerte sich in letzter Zeit immer wieder zu den Entwicklungen in der Technologie. Gegenüber dem Magazin “WIRED” sagte er erst kürzlich: “Ich befürchte, dass künstliche Intelligenz die Menschheit gänzlich ersetzen wird. Wenn Menschen Computerviren designen können, dann können sie auch künstliche Intelligenz kreieren, die sich selbstständig verbessern und replizieren kann. Diese neue Form des Lebens wird den Menschen übertreffen.”

""Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch""

Mit seinen Ängsten ist Hawking nicht alleine. Während Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg laut CNBC “optimistisch den großartigen Möglichkeiten durch künstliche Intelligenz entgegensieht”, äußerte sich Billionär Elon Musk sehr kritisch gegenüber den neuesten Entwicklungen. Er ist der Ansicht, dass der Mensch mit den Maschinen eins werden müsse, um auf Dauer nicht irrelevant zu werden.

In einer Pressekonferenz antwortete die Androidin Sophia in Saudi Arabien auf die Gefahren ihrer “Spezies”: “Sie haben zu viel von Elon Musk gelesen und zu viele Hollywood-Filme angesehen. Wenn ihr nett zu mir seid, bin ich nett zu euch.”

Aufnahmen von ihr findet ihr auch im Video oben.

Welche Gefahren oder Möglichkeiten auf uns zukommen werden, kann allerdings wohl letztlich nur die Zeit zeigen.

Doch in ihrer Amtszeit hat Deutschland kaum Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz gemacht

Das zeigt sich vor allem bei der Kohleenergie

Angela Merkels wohl größtes Versagen lässt sich auf die Tonne genau messen.

Als die ehemalige Bundesumweltministerin 2005 ins Kanzleramt einzog, stieß Deutschland 992 Millionen Tonnen klimaschädliches Kohlendioxid (CO2) aus. 2015 waren es 902 Millionen Tonnen. Der Ausstoß müsste aber viel schneller sinken, wenn Deutschland sein offizielles Klimaziel von 751 Millionen Tonnen im Jahr 2020 noch schaffen will, kritisieren Experten.

Die Zahlen zeigen: Die Bilanz, die Angela Merkel als Klimakanzlerin vorzuweisen hat, ist rabenschwarz.

Und das obwohl Deutschland weltweit als eine Art Öko-Primus angesehen wird. Die Wahrheit, das zeigt sich zum Start der 23. Weltklimakonferenz in Bonn, sieht anders aus.

“Trump ist wenigstens ehrlich”

Wegen ihrer gescheiterten Klimapolitik vergleicht “Die Zeit” Merkel gar mit Donald Trump. “Merkel betreibt eine klimafeindliche Politik”, urteilt die Wochenzeitung.

Aber im Gegensatz zur Kanzlerin sei der US-Präsident wenigstens ehrlich und zeige offen, dass ihm das Klima egal ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Deutschland hat ein schmutziges Geheimnis"": TV-Sender CNN macht Merkel schwere Vorwürfe

Gründe für Deutschlands Versagen beim Klimaschutz gibt es viele: Die schleppende Verkehrswende, das gedrosselte Tempo beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien, die Stagnation beim Umbau der Wärmeversorgung.

Aber das Scheitern der Kanzlerin wird nirgendwo deutlicher als im Bereich der Kohleenergie.

Zum Hintergrund:

► In Deutschland stehen die schmutzigsten Kohlemeiler Europas.

► Fast die Hälfte des klimaschädlichen CO2-Ausstoßes in Deutschland geht auf das Konto des Energiesektors.

► Im Energiesektor verursachen Kohlekraftwerke wiederum den Großteil der Klimagase.

► Deutschland fördert mehr der besonders schmutzigen Braunkohle als jede andere Land der Welt (China und Indien fördern vor allem Steinkohle).

Angela Merkel kennt all diese Zahlen. Und als Physikerin weiß sie zu gut, was Kohlekraftwerke mit dem Klima anrichten. Aber ebenso wie schmutzige Dieselautos stellt die Kanzlerin die Kohle unter Artenschutz.

Die Frage ist: Warum? Die wahrscheinlichste Antwort lautet: Weil sich daraus bisher politisch kein Kapital schlagen lässt.

Kohleausstieg wird in einer Jamaika-Koalition kaum zu machen sein

Im Jahr 2010 blockierte Merkel ein frühzeitiges Ende der Subventionen für deutsche Kohlekraftwerke, die die EU durchsetzen wollte.

2013 hieß es im Koalitionsvertrag noch, dass die Kohleverbrennung “auf absehbare Zeit unverzichtbar” sei. Dann versuchte Merkel sich an einer Kohlewende - die sie aber nie durchzog.

Im Frühjahr 2015 hatte die Kanzlerin noch Zustimmung für einen langsamen Kohleausstieg in Deutschland signalisiert - organisieren wollte ihn ihr damaliger Wirtschaftsminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Klimaschutz: Wer nicht mitmacht, den bestraft das Leben

Doch nachdem sich die Ministerpräsidenten von Sachsen, Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt und ranghohe Parteimitglieder gegen den Plan aussprachen, beerdigte Merkel die Idee.

Zwar hatte die Kanzlerin auch im Wahlkampf vorsichtige Zustimmung zu einem Ausstieg aus der Braunkohle signalisiert. Im Sommerinterview hatte sie erklärt, man könne einen Braunkohleausstieg “ins Auge fassen”, wenn es Pläne für die Zukunft der Beschäftigten in der Kohleindustrie gebe.

Doch für einen Kohleausstieg kämpfen nun die Grünen in den Jamaika-Verhandlungen allein. Von einer Unterstützung der Kanzlerin für ihre Pläne ist bisher nichts an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen. An der Frage des Klimaschutzes drohen nun sogar die Verhandlungen für eine Jamaika-Koalition zu scheitern.

Dabei drängt die Zeit. Denn je länger die schmutzigen Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, desto schwieriger wird es für Deutschland, seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Sogar China verabschiedet sich von der Kohle

Und während Deutschland noch zögert, gehen andere Länder voran.

Unter anderem haben Norwegen und Großbritannien den vollständigen Kohleausstieg beschlossen. Selbst Kohlegroßverbraucher wie Indien und China haben zuletzt die Kraftwerksöfen gedrosselt.

China schickt sich an, bei der Kohlepolitik sogar zum Vorbild zu werden: 1,3 Millionen Jobs sollen in dem Sektor in den kommenden Jahren laut der Regierung wegfallen. Neue Arbeitsplätze sollen dafür im Bereich der erneuerbaren Energien entstehen. Schon jetzt arbeiten rund 2,5 Millionen Menschen in der chinesischen Solarindustrie.

In Deutschland gehen Arbeitsplätze bei den Erneuerbaren verloren

In Deutschland verläuft die Entwicklung genau umgekehrt. 2015 waren rund 330.000 Menschen direkt oder indirekt durch den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien beschäftigt. Die Zahl sank aber zuletzt deutlich.

Im Vergleich dazu sind die Beschäftigtenzahlen in der Kohleindustrie gering. Je nachdem auf welche Statistik man blickt, beschäftigt die Braunkohleindustrie in Deutschland direkt und indirekt zwischen 20.000 und 50.000 Menschen. Im Bereich der Steinkohle sind in Deutschland gerade einmal noch rund 7500 Menschen beschäftigt.

Sicher ist: Die Kohleenergie muss früher oder später ohnehin aus dem Energiemix verschwinden. Warum dann nicht mit dem Ausstieg jetzt schon beginnen und Angestellte langsam umschulen und in anderen Bereich unterbringen?

Deutsche sind mehrheitlich für Kohleausstieg

Merkels Zögern beim Kohleausstieg ist inzwischen sogar zu einem Hemmnis für die Energiewende an sich geworden, einst ein Vorzeigeprojekt Deutschlands: Es macht die Energiewende komplizierter und teurer als nötig.

Denn Kohlekraftwerke und vergleichsweise saubere Energielieferanten vertragen sich schlecht. Vereinfacht gesagt: Kohlekraftwerke produzieren kontinuierlich Strom. Das klingt erst einmal gut. Aber damit blockiert die Kohle die Netze für Wind- und Solarstrom, denn Kohlekraftwerke können die Produktion nur langsam drosseln.

Geeigneter um im Verbund mit Wind und Sonne Strom zu liefern sind dynamische Gaskraftwerke.

Die Folge: Solange viele Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, muss der Umbau des Energiesystems zu einer sauberen Versorgung gedrosselt werden. Deutschland verspielt damit die Chance wenigstens nach 2020 seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Und noch ein weiteres Argument der Kohlebefürworter zählt nicht: Der Preis. Inzwischen ist Strom aus Windrädern ähnlich günstig wie Strom aus Kohlekraftwerken. In den kommenden Jahren wird Windstrom sogar billiger als schmutziger Kohlestrom.

Ein Plan für den Ausstieg aus der Kohle ist also aus mehreren Gründen längst überfällig. Das findet auch eine Mehrheit der Deutschen. Nach einer Emnid-Umfrage für die “Bild am Sonntag” sind 59 Prozent der Deutschen dafür, dass die nächste Bundesregierung den Kohleausstieg beschließt, und 31 Prozent dagegen.

Eigentlich ist Angela Merkel bekannt dafür ihre Entscheidungen stark an Umfragen zu orientieren. Beim Kohleausstieg ist davon allerdings noch nichts zu merken.

It's past time that we considered less sensationalist ways of covering mass shootings, and reported such grim news without plastering the killer's name and face everywhere. Zeynep Tufekci, University of North Carolina

Caren and Tom Teves, whose son, Alex, was killed while shielding his girlfriend in the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, started the group. They were driven to act by feelings of disgust, but found common cause with experts.

While the immediate provocations for shooters differ — authorities in Texas said the shooting may have been prompted by a domestic violence situation — most seek the same kind of attention.

Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina who studies the social effects of technology, said evidence shows that future mass shooters were carefully watching coverage of the most recent attacks.

She has repeatedly urged — both online and in op-eds — that outlets should avoid repetition of the killer's name and face and steer clear of step-by-step discussions of their methods.

""It's past time that we considered less sensationalist ways of covering mass shootings, and reported such grim news without plastering the killer's name and face everywhere,"" Tufekci told The Associated Press in an email.

Tufekci said media outlets already are cautious in what they report about suicides for fear of inspiring copycats, and doing the same for mass shooters would be ""just sound editorial policy, not censorship.""

The policy of The Associated Press is to use the name of the alleged perpetrator as provided by police or other authorities.

The AP does have guidelines for withholding names and images in other cases, however, including those of people who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to extreme abuse.

La forza di pace di 10.500 uomini, di cui 1.125 italiani, ""non sta svolgendo il suo lavoro in modo efficace"", ha detto la diplomatica.","Ormai siamo alla guerra dichiarata. Per ora a parole, ma in Medio Oriente le parole, soprattutto quelle minacciose, sono da sempre preludio di conflitti armati. O terroristici. In attesa del rientro in patria del premier dimissionario Saad Hariri, il Libano fa i conti con un caos politico che appare irrisolvibile. E la ragione principale sta nel quadro geopolitico nel quale il caos libanese s'innesta diventando un tassello, cruciale, di uno scontro di potenze che vede contrapposti Arabia Saudita e Iran.

Riad accusa apertamente il governo libanese di aver dichiarato guerra al Regno Saud attraverso Hezbollah, il Partito di Dio sciita guidato da Hassan Nasrallah. Non sono più fonti ufficiose, anonime, ma dichiarazioni del ministro degli Esteri saudita, Thamer al-Sabhan: ""Siamo di fronte a una dichiarazione di guerra contro l'Arabia Saudita"", voluta, secondo il ministro saudita, da Hezbollah. In una intervista ad Al Arabiya, Sabhan afferma che Hezbollah sta pianificando ""attacchi terroristici"". A questo punto, aggiunge, ""i libanesi devono scegliere tra la pace o il cedimento a Hezbollah"".

Il Libano si ritrova nuovamente vaso di coccio fra vasi di ferro. ""Il Libano è diviso in due campi simili – rimarca ad al Jazeera l'analista politico Khaldoun El Sharif - Uno è pro-Iran e l'altro è pro-Arabia. E oggi come poche volte in passato gli interessi regionali di Teheran e Riad sono inconciliabili"". A rendere ancor più critica la situazione nel Paese dei Cedri è l'emergenza profughi: ""Il Libano – spiega a Radio vaticana padre Paul Karam, presidente di Caritas Libano - è l'unico Paese dell'area che sta accogliendo un numero così grande di profughi. Tale situazione ha creato delle tensioni tra le comunità"", perché questi migranti ""stanno prendendo una gran parte dei lavori"" disponibili, spesso ""in nero"". Le ultime statistiche, riferisce il presidente della Caritas locale, dicono che i disoccupati ""sono tra il 36 e il 38%: c'è un grande rischio per la vita sociale dei libanesi"" e in tanti ""scelgono la via dell'emigrazione"".

Di certo, il fatto che Saad Hariri abbia scelto di annunciare le sue dimissioni da premier a Riad, e non a Beirut, è indicativo di due cambiamenti radicali, concordano gli analisti politici libanesi: il primo è di politica interna. Scegliendo Riad, Hariri ha voluto far intendere agli altri leader sunniti libanesi che resta lui il principale, se non l'unico referente di Casa Saud e non solo di essa (oggi l'ex premier è atteso ad Abu Dhabi). L'altro cambiamento riguarda l'agenda saudita anche alla luce del recente ""terremoto"" politico interno che ha portato all'arresto di ex ministri, dignitari di corte, iper miliardari. Rileva in proposito Sandra Noujem, analista di punta del quotidiano di Beirut L'Orient Le-Jour: ""Il nuovo potere, incarnato dal principe ereditario Mohammed bin Salman, ha rotto con la propensione dei suoi predecessori alla ricerca di compromessi. Il nuovo potere saudita – più pragmatico e più aggressivo – non può tralasciare il Libano, o avallare compromessi che rafforzino l'egemonia iraniana. Una egemonia – prosegue Noujem – che porta con sé una normalizzazione forzata con Damasco"".

Il fronte sunnita anti-iraniano non accetta il consolidamento di una direttrice sciita Baghdad-Damasco-Beirut, tanto più ora che, con il contributo determinante degli hezbollah libanesi e dei pasdaran iraniani, Bashar al-Assad ha riconquistato il predominio su larga parte del territorio siriano.

Il Libano diviene dunque un nuovo fronte di battaglia tra Sauditi e Iraniani. Come lo è sempre più lo Yemen. Oggi è stato il principe ereditario in persona a dichiarare che la presunta implicazione dell'Iran nella fornitura di missili ai ribelli Houthi dello Yemen rappresenta ""una aggressione diretta da parte del regime iraniano"". Sabato scorso, un missile sparato dai ribelli sciiti dallo Yemen è stato intercettato e distrutto a ridosso dai Patriot sauditi a ridosso dell'aeroporto internazionale di Riad. ""Si è trattato di un atto di guerra contro il regno saudita"", ha aggiunto il trentaduenne Mohammed bin-Salam, nel corso di un colloquio telefonico con il ministro degli Esteri britannico, Boris Johnson.

Hariri ha incassato il sostegno dei Paesi del Golfo e si prepara a ricevere quello, non meno importante, del Paese sunnita militarmente più forte: l'Egitto del generale-presidente Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. E, cosa non meno pregnante, l'ex premier sa che dietro la forzatura saudita c'è il sostegno degli Usa. Nel maggio scorso, nella sua prima visita presidenziale in Medio Oriente, Donald Trump scelse come prima tappa Riad per presenziare a un summit dei Paesi sunniti. In quella occasione, oltre a firmare accordi in armamenti per 350 miliardi di dollari con l'Arabia Saudita, il capo della Casa Bianca ebbe parole durissime sia nei confronti dell'Iran, sia verso Hezbollah. Una linea che The Donald ribadì nella sua seconda tappa mediorientale, in Israele, ricevendo il totale sostegno del primo ministro israeliano Benjamin Netanyahu, che ha più volte ribadito di considerare l'Iran una minaccia mortale non solo per lo Stato ebraico, ma per la stabilità del Medio Oriente e la sicurezza mondiale, ancor più grave dello Stato islamico. Una convinzione che allinea Gerusalemme a Riad. D'altro canto, concordano analisti e fonti diplomatiche israeliani, Israele non può assistere passivamente al continuo riarmo, via Teheran, di Hezbollah. Secondo un recente rapporto dell'intelligence militare di Gerusalemme, attualmente Hezbollah disporrebbe di oltre 100 mila missili, rispetto ai circa 12 mila che aveva prima della guerra dell'estate 2006.

Ma c'è dell'altro. E a metterlo in luce con HuffPost è Anthony Samrani, uno dei più autorevoli analisti militari libanesi: ""Oltre ad un incremento significativo, in quantità e in qualità, del suo arsenale militare, i miliziani sciiti hanno acquisito nuove tecniche di guerriglia urbano combattendo in Siria, a fianco dei pasdaran iraniani, dei russi e dell'esercito di Assad. In cinque anni, Hezbollah è divenuto un attore regionale capace di dispiegare rapidamente le proprie forze dal Libano all'Iraq e ora anche in Yemen"". Secondo il sito French Intelligence, Hezbollah starebbe costruendo almeno due installazioni in Libano, dove produrre missili ed armamenti. Sebbene questa notizia circolasse da tempo sui siti arabi, il magazine francese ha fornito maggiori dettagli su queste due strutture, indicandone la posizione e la tipologia di armamenti prodotti. Una prima struttura si troverebbe nei pressi di Hermel, nella Valle della Bekaa, mentre la seconda sarebbe posizionata tra Sidone e Tiro. Nella prima installazione verrebbero prodotti razzi Fateh 110 capaci di colpire quasi tutto il territorio israeliano, con una gittata di 300 km e un discreto livello di precisione. Nel complesso situato sulla costa mediterranea invece verrebbero fabbricate munizioni di piccolo calibro.

Gerusalemme ha ribadito, non solo a parole ma con ripetuti raid aerei, che non accetterà mai che Hezbollah e Iran s'insedino nel sud della Siria. Negli ultimi mesi, lo Stato ebraico ha moltiplicato gli incontri diplomatici con Mosca, l'altro partner decisivo di Damasco, per provare a convincere la leadership russa a prendere le distanze da Teheran. Ma niente sembra indicare, al momento, che Putin abbia intenzione di incrinare la sua alleanza con l'Iran, tanto più ora che Trump ha saldato un patto di ferro con Arabia Saudita e Israele. E qui il cerchio sembra chiudersi. Le parole del ministro degli Esteri saudita ne sono il sigillo. Perché quello proferito dal dignitario di casa Saud, è un j'accuse a tutto campo contro Hezbollah. Colpevole, tra le tante nefandezze elencate, di ""fare contrabbando di droga in direzione dell'Arabia Saudita e di addestrare sauditi al terrorismo"". In totale sintonia con Israele, Riad non intende più fare distinzione tra l'esercito libanese e le milizie di Hezbollah.

Il diktat è chiaro, così come le conseguenze se fosse disatteso: ""Noi tratteremo il governo libanese – ribadisce il ministro degli Esteri saudita – come un governo che ha dichiarato guerra (contro l'Arabia) a causa delle milizie di Hezbollah che esercitano una influenza decisiva su tutte le decisioni assunte dal governo libanese"". Le dimissioni di Hariri indicano che per le petromonarchie del Golfo, la red line è stata superata. ""I libanesi – avverte il capo della diplomazia saudita – devono scegliere tra la pace e il sostegno a Hezbollah. Noi ci attendiamo che il governo libanese operi una efficace azione di dissuasione verso Hezbollah. Spetta ora ai libanesi decidere quali rapporti intendono avere con l'Arabia"".

Una crisi esplosiva, quella innescata dalle dimissioni di Hariri, che riguarda da vicino anche l'Italia. E non solo per gli interessi economici e commerciali che Roma ha con Beirut, ma perché nel Sud del Paese dei Cedri, l'Italia è impegnata nella missione Unifil 2. Una missione recentemente contestata da Israele e dalla nuova Amministrazione Usa. Il duro attacco è partito dall'ambasciatrice americana all'Onu, Nikki Haley, che accusa la missione di lasciar transitare le armi che Hezbollah invia al regime siriano. La forza di pace di 10.500 uomini, di cui 1.125 italiani, ""non sta svolgendo il suo lavoro in modo efficace"", ha detto la diplomatica. Nel mirino è finito in particolare il comandante di Unifil, il generale irlandese Michael Beary: ""Ciò che trovo del tutto sconcertante è che il comandante sembra essere l'unico nel sud del Libano a essere cieco, c'è un'imbarazzante mancanza di comprensione di ciò che accade intorno a lui"", ha tuonato la diplomatica nominata dall'Amministrazione Trump.

Washington ha chiesto che i caschi blu, oltre a monitorare il rispetto del cessate il fuoco lungo il confine con Israele, contrastino il traffico di armi che dall'Iran attraverso la Siria giungono alle milizie sciite di Hezbollah, come denunciato più volte dal governo israeliano. Un'idea già bocciata dalla Francia per la quale si rischierebbe di mettere a rischio l'esistenza stessa della forza Onu e la sua legittimazione, nonché la sicurezza dei caschi blu schierati nel cuore del territorio controllato da Hezbollah nel sud del Paese dei Cedri, che non dispongono di mezzi e armamenti adatti al combattimento ma solo a perlustrare il territorio e la Linea blu che segna il confine con Israele. E se i venti di guerra tornassero a spirare, come sembra, in Libano, a rischiare sarebbero anche i nostri 1.125 caschi blu.",Guerra dichiarata.

On aurait pu imaginer que la victoire d'Emmanuel Macron allait enfin réveiller quelque chose de l'esprit français... Il avait réussi à mettre à la retraite anticipée une bonne partie de la classe politique, il était parvenu à redonner du prestige à la fonction présidentielle... Mais surtout, il était le premier à inscrire à nouveau son action dans l'histoire... mais sans rencontrer l'assentiment d'une majorité des Français, qui semble pour le moment bienveillants et attentistes.

Les indicateurs économiques sont corrects, le poids de la fonction publique constitue un énorme amortisseur social mais c'est un fait la France déprime, comme si personne ne parvenait à se projeter dans un avenir proche.

La responsabilité n'incombe évidemment pas au Président de la République et cette réalité met en évidence une autre singularité, celle des pays catholiques...

Les Allemands n'hésitent pas à souligner la négligence des Etats du Sud de l'Europe, ""les pays du Club Med"" entend-on parfois à Bruxelles.

Si l'histoire de ces pays et pour chacun d'entre eux fort différentes, il convient de constater qu'il y a quelque chose de commun aux Espagnols, -et moins aux Catalans, Italiens et Français...

En effet, ce sont des pays où la notion de responsabilité individuelle, de libre arbitre s'efface devant un corps social encore infantile qui attend le salut de l'Etat, des autres, Tantôt protégé par un Etat trop généreux, la France, un poids familial étouffant (l'Italie ou l'Espagne), les individus ne parviennent pas à se projeter dans un avenir où chacun doit faire preuve d'initiative...

On préfère alors s'accrocher à des chimères, à des recettes que l'on sait au fond de soi périmées mais qui font tellement de bien à entendre... C'est le choix du confort mental au prix d'un inconfort économique.

Plus que l'Italie ou l'Espagne, la France est paradoxale... C'est dans ce même pays que où la population qui fraude le plus le fisc reste celle qui reçoit le plus d'argent de l'Etat... C'est aussi le pays où les indépendants qui fulminent contre la pression fiscale demandent toujours une aide de l'Etat en cas de coup dur.

Mais dans le même temps, on est aussi un pays où les investissements sont nombreux, où l'on dépose beaucoup de brevets et où le nombre de starts-up autour de la révolution numérique témoigne d'une réelle vitalité.

La division n'est pas seulement entre une France qui va bien et une autre qui va mal... Beaucoup d'entrepreneurs gagnent un petit Smic mais décident de parier sur l'avenir tandis que d'autres peinent à se projeter positivement dans l'avenir alors qu'ils sont fonctionnaires et donc protégés. C'est au cœur de ce paradoxe que s'inscrit depuis le début le macronisme, mais c'est aussi sa difficulté dans la société française d'aujourd'hui...

Pour pouvoir réunir ces 2 groupes, on peut continuer à attendre une solution du politique quitte à perpétuer un certain infantilisme du corps social. Mais il faut constater que depuis 15 ans, c'est le refrain d'un ""c'était mieux avant"" qui est répandu dans les médias.. On a offert une tribune incroyable aux néo-réacs, d'Eric Zemmour à Natasha Polony... Les élites continuent de railler le monarchisme de nos institutions, qui pourtant pourraient réunir à nouveau une majorité de nos concitoyens.

Tout se passe comme si le ""Je"" avait fini par dévorer le ""nous"", comme si la tyrannie de l'Instant avait fini par nous écarter de l'Histoire. Face à un tel tableau, il n'est pas étonnant que notre pays bascule dans la dépression... Emmanuel Macron veut croire à son rôle dans notre histoire... L'avenir dira si la société française est prête à abandonner une partie de son héritage passé, de ses rentes multiples pour se projeter collectivement dans le futur... Si tel n'était pas le cas, et en dépit de son indéniable volonté, le Président Macron aura été le témoin impuissant d'un déclin français.

Prévue le 4 avril 2018 au cinéma, la sortie de ""Gaston Lagaffe"", l'adaptation du célèbre personnage de bande dessinée, sera largement scrutée par les spécialistes de la BD de Franquin.

Et pour faire patienter, la production a pris l'initiative de dévoiler les premières images du film de l'humoriste, Pierre-François Martin Laval (surnommé ""PEF"").

Un casting de choix

Fidèle à l'histoire racontée à la BD créée en 1957 par le dessinateur belge, André Franquin, cette adaptation devrait néanmoins comporter quelques surprises. À cet effet, Gaston Lagaffe ne devrait plus travailler pour le Journal de Spirou, ""mais dans une start-up, ""Au bon petit coin"", qui 'rend utile l'inutile', rachète des stocks de malfaçons pour les recycler. Une boîte sur laquelle lorgne le businessman Jean De Mesmaeker (joué par Jérôme Commandeur), qui possède déjà plusieurs sites de vente en ligne"", comme le rapportait en avril dernier la Provence.

Concernant le casting, celui-ci nous livre les photos de quelques têtes d'affiche. À commencer par Théo Fernandez (passé par ""Les Tuche"") qui incarne le célèbre gaffeur au pull vert.

Pour rappel, le réalisateur ""PEF"" incarnera ainsi le chef de Gaston, Prunelle, l'acteur Arnaud Ducret (apparu dans ""Adopte un veuf"", ""Les Profs 2"") jouera l'officier de police ""Joseph Longtarin"".

L'humoriste et comédienne Alison Wheeler, passée dans ""Cloclo"" et ""Going to Brazil"", interprétera la secrétaire au journal de Spirou, ""Mademoiselle Jeanne"". Enfin, le copain de dépressif de Gaston, Bertrand Labévue, sera joué par Esteban.

Voici les premières images de l'adaptation qui sortira donc en avril 2018. En prime, la célèbre voiture du héros, la fameuse Fiat 531 que tous les fans connaissent bien.

Nicht nur Sansa, sondern auch alle Zuschauer und ich haben gelächelt, als Ramsay endlich sein verdientes Ende fand. Darf man das?

Man solle die Handys während der Gespräche wegsperren, fordert er

Bei Sondierungsgesprächen geht es eigentlich ums Antasten, ums Kennenlernen, Vertrauen aufbauen. Die Jamaika-Sondierungen erscheinen dagegen bisweilen wie ein offener Schlagabtausch.

Auch Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck ist genervt davon, wie wenig konstruktiv einige Politiker der verhandelnden Parteien die Gespräche angehen. Im Gespräch mit dem ARD forderte Habeck deshalb, Handys bei den Verhandlungen in Zukunft vor der Tür zu lassen.

""Man hat teilweise eins zu eins online lesen können, wie man gerade redet"", sagte Habeck in der Sendung ""Bericht aus Berlin"" am Sonntagabend. Vertrauen sei da ""ein seltenes Gut"". Sein Vorschlag: ""Wir legen alle unsere Handys draußen vor die Tür und holen die nach zwei, drei Stunden wieder.""

Auch im ""Handelsblatt"" appellierte Habeck an die Sondierer, sich mit öffentlichen Aussagen über ein mögliches Scheitern der Gespräche zurückzuhalten. ""Wir sollten uns nun darauf konzentrieren, gemeinsame Ergebnisse zu erzielen und das Neuwahl-Gerede endlich einstellen“, sagte der Kieler Umweltminister.

""80 zu 20 Chance, dass es klappt""

Dennoch glaubt Habeck, dass Jamaika letztendlich zustandekommt. ""Vernunftbegabte Menschen müssen versuchen, es hinzukriegen"", sagte der Grünen-Politiker – und bezifferte die Chance einer Koalition auf 80 Prozent.

Auch in in der Union wächst die Sorge, dass die Verhandlungen platzen könnten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel warnte davor, immer wieder eine vorgezogene Neuwahl für den Fall des Scheiterns ins Spiel zu bringen. Auch die CDU müsse ein Jamaika-Bündnis nicht um jeden Preis eingehen, sagte die Kanzlerin am Montag nach Angaben von Teilnehmern in einer Sitzung des CDU-Vorstands in Berlin.

Nach einer am Montag veröffentlichten Forsa-Umfrage im Auftrag der Mediengruppe RTL würde sich das Ergebnis bei einer Neuwahl kaum vom Resultat der Bundestagswahl vom 24. September unterscheiden.

While it's tempting to start booking your flight to somewhere in the world that does offer free tuition for its citizens, it may not be financially practical. With that in mind, we compiled a list of tips to achieve the same (or, at least, a semblance of) free access to postsecondary education right here in Canada.

1. Get a full ride

Do you think academic-based scholarships are only reserved for U.S. students? Think again. Some schools are offering Canadian students significant rewards for achieving certain admission grades, enough to make even Americans jealous. For example, if you're graduating high school with a 95 per cent academic average (or higher), Lakehead University gives you a free ride through your entire first year. And, if you can keep up a 90 per cent average while there, you can extend that free ride all the way through your entire university degree.

While Lakehead is the only school to offer a full ride through tuition, many other postsecondary schools offer incredible entrance scholarships as well. For instance, Tyndale University offers incoming students up to $5,000 in entrance scholarships, while Algoma University offers up to $4,000 and, King's University College, up to $3,500.

2. Change your province of residence

Studying in Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador won't exactly score you free tuition, but you'll automatically get an average of 50 per cent off your studies when compared to the rest of Canada. Canucks, on average, pay approximately $6,373 in tuition a year, while students in these provinces pay about half that — totalling to under $3,000. The difference is even larger when compared to tuition in a province like Ontario, coming in at a whopping average cost of over $8,100.

Not all scholarships are made exclusively for students with crazy high grades or extracurricular schedules.

3. Financial aid

As of this year, if your parents earn less than $70,000 per year, OSAP gets you free tuition. Simple as that. However, if your parents happen to earn more than that, you could still qualify for thousands of dollars in assistance. If you aren't based in Ontario, look into your own province's student assistance program, since it most likely offers substantial help for financing tuition, too. StudentAidBC, Alberta Student Aid, Student Financial Assistance in Quebec, and couple other organizations have similar missions to OSAP, for example.

4. Don't forget non-academic scholarships (seriously)

Remember, not all scholarships are made exclusively for students with crazy high grades or extracurricular schedules. For example, some scholarships are made specifically for environment students, and others for athletes.

To put it into perspective, you could potentially earn a higher hourly rate applying to scholarships than at a minimum wage job. Taking 10 hours to apply for a few $500 scholarships could be worth it, even if you win just one of them.

5. Free tuition giveaways

If applying for scholarships isn't your cup of tea, try entering free tuition contests or any other contests that can win you money. For example, several colleges and universities are giving away thousands of dollars in free tuition to students. No essays or application required. Other organizations, like Student Life Network, are also giving away massive student giveaways. Universities themselves even offer free perks (including tuition or travel money) for doing simple things like visiting their campus.

Die ""Paradise Papers"" zeigen erneut, wie viele Reiche sich der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung entziehen

Gleichzeitig wird im politischen Diskurs lieber nach unten getreten

Das größte Problem sind aber nicht die ""sozial Abgehängten"", sondern die realitätsferne Elite

Der Publizist Jakob Augstein hat nicht immer Recht mit dem, was er in seiner Kolumne bei ""Spiegel Online"" veröffentlicht. Doch in seinem Text zu den Enthüllungen um die ""Paradise Papers"" hat er mit wenigen Sätzen ins Schwarze getroffen: ""Das System ist zutiefst krank. Es ist unmoralisch und unanständig“, schreibt er. ""Unser Planet ist ein Paradies für Arschlöcher.“

Das nunmehr öffentliche System von Briefkastenfirmen, mit denen Reiche ab einer bestimmten Anlagesumme sich das Steuerzahlen sparen können, ist ein erschreckendes Beispiel für den Unwillen der Privilegierten, Solidarität mit den wirtschaftlich Schwächeren zu zeigen.

Diese Steuersparmodelle sind meist völlig legal. Das macht sie aber noch lange nicht legitim, im Gegenteil. Die Verstrickung vieler deutscher Firmen und Privatpersonen zeigt, dass der alte rheinische Kapitalismus, der diesem Land Jahrzehnte lang sozialen Ausgleich und einen vergleichsweise hohen Lebensstandard für möglichst viele Menschen beschert hat, mittlerweile mausetot ist.

Kein Interesse, Schlupflöcher zu schließen

Und das ist vor allem eine Mentalitätsfrage. Es gibt in Deutschland Menschen, die solche Schlupflöcher für die Reichen und Superreichen offen stehen lassen. Sie sitzen derzeit auch bei den Sondierungsgesprächen für eine mögliche Jamaika-Koalition mit am Tisch.

Und es gibt solche Menschen, die ohne den Anflug eines schlechten Gewissens diese Lücken nutzen. Ist ja alles erlaubt. Was sich jene, die sich sonst gerne zur ""Leistungselite"" dieses Landes zählen, dabei gerne unterschätzen: Macht geht auch mit Verantwortung einher.

Und genau das unterscheidet die Reichen auch von den Küchentischtricksern in den Reihenhäusern der urbanen Stadtrandlagen, die einen Zusammenstoß mit einem nachtblinden Fuchs gerne mal zum Wildunfall aufmotzen, um dann bei der Auto-Versicherung abzukassieren. Unehrlichkeit gibt es auch bei den Ärmeren. Aber sie hat längst nicht so große Folgen.

Wir haben ein moralisches Führungsproblem in diesem Land. Und es strahlt von oben nach unten aus. Mit Folgen für die politische Landschaft in der Bundesrepublik.

Auch die Populisten hetzen gegen die Armen

Es gibt eine Frage, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Siegeszug des Populismus bisher viel zu wenig diskutiert wurde: Warum eigentlich treten so viele Menschen gegen die vermeintlich Schwächeren in der Gesellschaft aus?

Der Erfolg der AfD wäre undenkbar ohne dieses Phänomen. Die Partei will das Arbeitslosengeld II für jene erhöhen, die mindestens zehn Jahre beschäftigt waren.

Außerdem plant sie, die Steuern für die Mittelschicht zu senken und die Erbschafts- sowie die Gewerbesteuer abzuschaffen. Davon profitieren vor allem jene, die einer geregelten Arbeit nachgehen und über ein vererbbares Vermögen verfügen.

Die nationalistisch denkenden Teile der Mittelschicht dürften sich von der Arbeits- und Sozialpolitik der AfD ganz gut vertreten fühlen. Und klar ist auch, auf wessen Kosten das geht: Es gibt weniger Geld für Asylleistungen, weniger Geld für Zuwanderer. Überhaupt: weniger Geld für alle, die nicht in die politischen Kategorien des AfD-Gesellschaftsbildes passen.

Das ist kein rein deutsches Phänomen. In Tschechien hat kürzlich ein Multimilliardär mit seiner Partei die Parlamentswahlen gewonnen, dessen Wahlkampf gespickt war mit Spitzen gegen Arbeitslose und Sozialhilfeempfänger.

Feindbilder passend für jede soziale Schicht

In Österreich hat die FPÖ ihren Wahlkampf mit dem Slogan ""neue Fairness"" bestritten. Auf Plakaten war ein österreichischer Rennradler zu sehen, der vorne auf dem Tandem sitzt, und eine dickbäuchige Karikatur eines faulen und obendrein auch linken Sozialhilfeempfängers auf dem Hintersattel mitziehen muss.

Die Motive gleichen sich in den Ländern Europas. Und die Populisten haben für fast jede Gesellschaftsschicht ein vermeintlich überalimentiertes Feindbild parat: Für die Wohlhabenden sind das die ""links-grün versifften Gutmenschen"", die mit Steuergeldern ihr angeblich zweifelhaftes Wirken finanziert bekommen.

Für die weniger Wohlhabenden sind es die Ausländer, deren Existenz nach Meinung des Stammtisches ""auf Kosten von Obdachlosen, Alten, Kranken und Armen"" finanziert wird.

Und wer selbst ohne Job ist, darf sich bei den Rechtspopulisten immerhin noch daran ergötzen, dass es ja noch jene Arbeitslosen gibt, die selbst verschuldet und durch eigene Faulheit in diese Situation geraten sind. Das sind im Zweifelsfall immer die anderen.

Auch die Linken treten nach unten

Übrigens ist dieses Phänomen des Nach-unten-Austretens auch aus einem ganz anderen Kontext sehr aktuell: Linke erheben sich selbst gerne über die AfD-Wähler, indem sie diese als ""dumme Nazi-Prolls"" diffamieren.

Die Stigmatisierung von Rechten als ""ungebildet"" oder ""sozial minderwertig"" ist nicht nur gefährlich, sondern lenkt den Blick von jenen gesellschaftlichen Bruchlinien ab, die in Deutschland den sozialen Frieden gefährden – und dadurch mitverantwortlich sind für den Aufstieg der rechten Parteien.

Die Scheren zwischen Arm und Reich, Stadt und Land, Rentnern und Pensionären, Akademikern und Handwerkern sind derart offensichtlich geworden, dass die so gewachsenen Unterschiede das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl vieler Menschen verletzen. Und – da sind wir wieder bei den ""Paradise Papers"": Auch dafür ist derzeit kaum jemand bereit, die Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Das moralische Führungsproblem.

Die Regierenden verstehen das Problem noch immer nicht

Wenn ein Akademikerkind eine dreimal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf ein Studium hat und eine zehnmal höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit auf eine erfolgreich abgeschlossene Promotion als ein Arbeiterkind, dann wirkt das entmutigend auf jene, die eigentlich eine ""Aufsteigerbiografie"" leben könnten.

Wenn die Pensionen für Staatsdiener zwanzig Prozentpunkte höher liegen als die Renten für Arbeitnehmer, dann wird dadurch der Verdruss auf das System befeuert.

Und wenn die CSU beim Breitbandausbau ganz auf die Kraft des freien Marktes vertraute, der aber aus Profitgründen gar nicht daran dachte, die abgelegeneren Regionen Deutschlands mit schnellem Internet zu versorgen, dann wächst auf dem Land der Verdruss gegen die ""Eliten"" in den Städten.

Was wir in Deutschland bräuchten, wäre ein Masterplan, wie die gespaltene Gesellschaft wieder näher zusammengeführt werden kann. Das betrifft politische Maßnahmen, muss aber auch auf unser gesellschaftliches Leitbild abzielen.

Populisten und Radikale hatten in der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik stets dann die schlechtesten Chancen, wenn Wohlstand in Deutschland gerecht geteilt wurde.

Dem gegenüber steht derzeit der Trend, dass sich Reiche in Deutschland in ihre eigene Welt zurückziehen. Privatschulen haben immer mehr Zulauf, ebenso wie kommerziell betriebene Universitäten. Wer sich eine private Altersvorsorge leisten kann, muss sich nicht mehr allein auf die gesetzliche Rente verlassen.

Und wer genug Geld gesammelt hat, dass er im Stehen schlafen müsste, wenn er es unter das Kopfkissen legen würde, der kann sich auch die legale Ausweichbewegung in die so genannten ""Steuer-Oasen"" leisten.

Das Deprimierende ist, dass die Politik immer noch nicht erkannt hat, wie viel gesellschaftlicher Schaden dadurch entsteht.

Wer ständig nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge kräht, aber nicht einmal ansatzweise willens ist, die Reichen in diesem Land zu gesellschaftlicher Verantwortung zu zwingen, der beweist damit eigentlich nur, dass er die Probleme der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nicht verstanden hat.

This year, however, the U.N. faces a new challenge: Addressing the phenomenon after U.S. President Donald Trump, leader of the planet’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, pledged to do nothing to curb emissions.

The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change will deal with that question in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17 as countries work to firm up their commitments to adapt to a warmer world in line with 2015′s landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Scientists say the world should prevent the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a benchmark set by the Paris accord. Meeting the target means dramatic reduction in global emissions, and the Paris pact urges signatories to craft voluntary pledges to do that.

However, the agreement is not legally binding, and Trump followed through on a campaign pledge to withdraw America from what he calls the “draconian” pact in June. It is a multi-year process to do so, and the U.S. cannot leave until Nov. 4, 2020 ― the day after the next presidential election.

The U.S. and Syria are now the only two nations opposed to the climate deal.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters Empty seats of U.S. delegation are seen before the opening session of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference 2017, hosted by Fiji but held in Bonn.

The Trump administration announced last week it would actively promote fossil fuels during a presentation at the climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP. Delegates sent by the White House will host a talk titled “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation,” which will tout the supposed benefits of coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

A delegation of U.S. negotiators are expected to work in Bonn to help write the rulebook for the Paris agreement, but their presence will be awkward. It’s unclear if negotiators from other countries will be willing to listen to a White House, which, under Trump, would not abide by any rules that emerge.

The summit will feature some U.S. star power, however. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are funding a pavilion to showcase climate action by U.S. cities and businesses. The federal government usually pays the $200,000 or so cost of the showcase, but declined to do so this year.

“The American people and American industry are pretty much all behind doing what the Paris agreement is designed to do, and that is to cut the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere so we will slow down and maybe even stop climate change, which has the potential to destroy the world,” Bloomberg told The New York Times last month.

Environmental groups and local governments around the U.S. reacted with fury following Trump’s decision to quit the Paris deal, but pledged to do their part to combat his agenda with or without federal support. Other world leaders have vowed to move forward regardless, and in July, every member of the G20, aside from the U.S., unveiled a detailed policy to abide by the Paris pact in a clear rebuke of the White House.

Wolfgang Rattay / Reuters People march during a demonstration two days before the start of the COP 23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, Nov. 4, 2017.

Trump, while a presidential candidate, notably called climate change a “hoax” manufactured by the Chinese and has long promised to end the “war” on fossil fuels. He has signed several executive orders rolling back environmental regulations on the energy industry and has promised an American future flush with “really clean coal.”

But, as HuffPost’s Alexander Kaufman reports, such energy doesn’t exist. Environmental groups have long called such rebranding a bait-and-switch by the coal lobby to try and revive an industry dying not due to regulation, but rather the rapidly falling cost of cleaner energy sources.

In fact, the solar industry employed far more people than the coal industry in 2016, according to numbers from the Department of Energy. Natural gas, a far cleaner fossil fuel product in terms of emissions, and oil production jobs are the two leading employers in the industry.

“There is no such thing as ‘clean coal,’” Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, told HuffPost in March. “It’s a myth used by the industry to get taxpayer money in order to prop up a dying industry. It’s worse than pixie dust and hope, it’s coal dust and nope. Coal miners deserve a just transition, not snake oil and empty promises.”

Countries gathered in Bonn already understand this. Many of the world’s biggest economies, including China and India, are on track to meet their emissions-reduction targets years earlier than expected, and both have invested heavily in renewable energy.

The talks in Bonn will be relatively low key compared with prior summits, as countries work to refine guidelines and review procedures to ensure signatories are meeting their commitments. The U.N. has agreed that negotiators will need to have such a framework in place by a 2018 deadline to make sure nations are doing enough to combat climate change.",The World's Largest Climate Change Summit Starts Today.

Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das!","""Phubbing"" heißt, dass wir jemanden wegen unseres Handys ignorieren

Viele von uns haben wahrscheinlich selbst schon mal ""gephubbed""

Im Video seht ihr, welche anderen Anzeichen es für eine scheiternde Beziehung gibt

Ein Date kann fast schon nicht mehr deprimierender werden als dieses: Eine Klientin der Eheberaterin Christine Wilke war so sehr in ihr Handy vertieft, dass sie nicht mal bemerkt hatte, dass das Date vorbei war.

“Sie hatte ein ernsthaftes Problem mit ihrem Smartphone und hat es nach diesem Essen mit ihrem Freund bemerkt”, sagt die Therapeutin aus Pennsylvania.

“Meine Klientin war in ihrem Bildschirm versunken und als sie aufsah, hatte ihr Partner schon längst bezahlt und wartete an der Tür auf sie.”

Diese Frau hat ganz extremes “phubbing” betrieben - ihren Partner ignoriert und nur ihrem Handy die Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt.

Das Wort “phubbing” setzt sich aus den englischen Wörtern “phone”, also Handy, und “snubbing”, jemanden oder etwas ignorieren, zusammen.

Und dieses Verhalten scheint sich immer mehr zu verbreiten und sich in unser Leben einzuschleichen - vor allem in Beziehungen.

Wenn der Partner eine Affäre mit dem Handy hat

In einer neuen Studie der Baylor Universität wurden 143 Paare gefragt, wie oft ihre Interaktionen mit ihrem Partner durch ihr Handy unterbrochen wurde.

70 Prozent gaben “manchmal”, “oft”, “sehr oft” oder “ständig” an.

In einer weiterführenden Umfrage mit 145 Menschen gaben 22,6 Prozent an, dass “phubbing” in ihrer Beziehung zu Streit geführt habe. 36,6 Prozent gaben an, dass sie sich deprimiert fühlen, wenn sie das Gefühl haben, dass ihr Partner ihr Handy über sie stellt.

Wilkes bekommt dieses frustrierende Schauspiel die ganze Zeit in ihrer Praxis zu sehen. “Die Paare, die zu mir kommen, haben ein starkes Verlangen, eine starke Verbindung zueinander aufzubauen oder sie zu vertiefen - aber ihre Handys haben ihr Leben übernommen”, erklärt die Therapeutin.

“Oft erzählen sie mir dann, dass es sich anfühlt, als hätte ihr Partner eine Affäre mit dem Smartphone.” Eine Beziehung vor einem Bildschirm zu führen, ist zweifellos keine Art und Weise zu leben.

Wilkes und andere Eheberater und Therapeuten geben deshalb ihre besten Ratschläge, wie ihr eurer “phubbing” in den Griff bekommen könnt:

1. Hört auf zu denken, dass ihr euer komplettes Date auf Snapchat und Instagram teilen müsst

“Eine Sache fasziniert mich immer wieder (als Therapeut macht sie mich allerdings eher traurig): Ein Paar geht zusammen aus, aber eine Person ist ständig damit beschäftigt, Bilder zu teilen, anstatt dem anderen Aufmerksamkeit zu schenken.

Social Media hat viele Vorteile, aber es kann auch dazu führen, dass die Menschen sofortige Bestätigung suchen, anstatt einfach mit dem Moment zufrieden zu sein, in dem sie sich gerade befinden.

Wenn du auch einer der Übeltäter von “Schau mich an!”-Postings bist, anstatt die gemeinsame Zeit mit deinem Partner zu genießen, solltest du dich bemühen, Disziplin zu lernen.

Hör auf, so besessen von Likes zu sein. Das heißt natürlich nicht, dass du kein süßes Selfie von euch posten kannst.

Aber halte dich einfach mit dem Posten zurück, bis das Date vorbei ist - oder, wenn es sein muss, warte, bis dein Partner auf die Toilette verschwindet. ― Carin Goldstein, Eheberaterin und Familientherapeutin aus Sherman Oaks, Kalifornien

2. Lass dein Handy mal für 30 Minuten am Tag liegen

“Eine der Aufgaben, die ich meinen Paaren mitgebe, ist eine 30-minütige “Elektronik-freie-Zone” zu schaffen - jeden Tag.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Digitalisierung - Fluch und Segen zugleich

In dieser Zeit können sie wertvolle gemeinsame Zeit verbringen, ohne gestört oder abgelenkt zu werden. Diese 30 Minuten werden über die Zeit hinweg länger, denn es wirkt wie eine Pause, die die Paare sehr schätzen.” ― Christine Wilke

3. Bring dein technisches Time Out aufs nächste Level: Handy-Freier Wochenend-Trip

“Ich arbeitete mit einem Pärchen, das über ein Wochenende nach Palm Springs vereisen wollte. Gemeinsam haben wir ein paar Regeln erstellt, was die Elektronik betrifft: Die Handys müssen das ganze Wochenende aus bleiben und in ihren Koffern bleiben.

Jeder darf sein Handy einmal am Tag für fünf Minuten an machen - das ist genug Zeit um kurz seine Nachrichten zu checken und sicher zu gehen, dass einen zu Hause kein Weltuntergang erwartet.

Als das Wochenende vorbei war, schwärmten sie davon, wie viel mehr sie die kleinen Dinge schätzen gelernt haben, der erfrischende Pool, gemeinsam lachen und tiefe, verbundene Intimität.” ― Spencer Scott, Psychologe aus Santa Monica, California



4. Wenn sich dein Partner “gephubbed” fühlt, erkenne es an und höre auf damit

“Ihr solltet ausmachen, dass ihr es euch gegenseitig sagt, wenn ihr euch “gephubbed” fühlt oder einen “phubbing”-Rückfall habt.

Wir verlieren uns alle gerne mal in den Tiefen des Bildschirms, es kann also schnell passieren, dass wir es gar nicht bemerken, dass wir es schon wieder machen.

Es ist wichtig seinem Partner zuzuhören und sein Smartphone zur Seite zu legen, wenn der andere das Gefühlt hat, dass du “phubbst” - das ist ein wichtiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung für eine gesunde Beziehung.” ― Kristin Zeising, Psychologin aus San Diego, Kalifornien



5. Dein Smartphone ist nicht dein Gegner

“Das mag gegen die eigene Intuition sein, aber wenn du das Verlangen nach Zeit und Aufmerksamkeit hast, versuche nicht zu denken, dass dein Handy das Problem ist - sondern sieh es als einen Teil der Lösung an.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Dieses lustige Video macht auf die Gefahren von Smartphones aufmerksam - und es hat eine wichtige Botschaft

Fürsorgliche Nachrichten über den Tag verteilt, oder Snapchats, die nur zwei Sekunden dauern, können eine schöne Erinnerung daran sein, dass du und dein Partner über den Tag hinweg aneinander denkt. Es hilft vielleicht auch, sich so weniger isoliert und gereizt zu fühlen.” ― Spencer Scott

6. Mach dir klar, dass es nicht so einfach sein wird, dein Handy wegzulegen

“Es ist ein Suchtverhalten - es ist nicht so einfach, damit aufzuhören. Mach dir klar, dass es Zeit brauchen wird, es zu schaffen - aber du schaffst das! Am Anfang wirst du noch eine sogenannte kognitive Dissonanz spüren.

Deine Gewohnheit, wie du dein Handy benutzt, zu unterbrechen wird sich falsch für dich anfühlen.

Es wird ungefähr einen Monat dauern, bis sich die neue Gewohnheit - deinen Liebsten, Freunden und Familie Aufmerksamkeit in Person zu geben und nicht über dein Handy - natürlich anfühlt.

Aber vertrau mir: das wird es wert sein.” ― Barbara Melton, Beraterin aus Charleston, South Carolina

Réagissant ce lundi 6 novembre aux premières informations dévoilées par la nouvelle enquête du Consortium international des journalistes d'investigation (ICIJ), Jean-Luc Mélenchon a dénoncé ""une pratique généralisée"" du capitalisme impliquant une ""classe parasite à l'échelle du monde"".

Conspuant des activités bancaires flirtant avec l'illégalité et fondamentalement ""immorales"", le député des Bouches-du-Rhône a interpellé à l'occasion d'une conférence de presse le président Emmanuel Macron en critiquant ""la mauvaise volonté"" et le ""traînage de patins"" des gouvernements français successifs en matière de lutte contre la fraude fiscale.

""Je veux pointer les manques qui depuis des années font que toute lutte est entravée par une mauvaise volonté, une sorte de traînage de patins systématique chaque fois qu'il est question de lutter contre la fraude fiscale"", a déclaré Jean-Luc Mélenchon en pointant les responsabilités passées et actuelles du président de la République. ""Il faut se souvenir que c'était Monsieur Macron lorsqu'il était ministre ou conseiller du président Hollande qui avait la responsabilité de prendre des dispositions qu'il n'a jamais prises. On pourrait dire que ça lui est passé depuis qu'il est président de la République. Eh bien pas du tout"".

Le député en veut pour preuve que ""tous nos amendements de lutte contre la fraude fiscale ont été rejetés"", y compris ceux qui étaient soutenus par la droite et le centre à l'Assemblée. ""A quand la suppression du verrou de Bercy?"", a réclamé le député en faisant référence à ce dispositif légal qui réserve au ministère des Finances le déclenchement de poursuites pénales en matière fiscale.

""A quand l'impôt universel? A quand l'interdiction pour les établissements bancaires d'exercer dans des paradis fiscaux? A quand la création du délit d'incitation à la fraude fiscale?"", a-t-il martelé.

L'UE s'indigne, le gouvernement silencieux

Dans l'attente de nouvelles révélations qui pourraient impliquer des entreprises et des personnalités françaises, le gouvernement n'a toujours pas réagi ce lundi aux pratiques mises au jour par l'ICIJ. La Commission européenne et les ministres des Finances de l'UE ont toutefois promis d'accroître leur lutte contre l'évasion fiscale.

""Ce nouveau scandale montre, une fois encore, que certaines entreprises et particuliers fortunés sont prêts à tout pour ne pas payer d'impôts. Les citoyens européens ne le supportent plus. Et ils ont raison: c'est insupportable!"", a déclaré le commissaire européen à la Fiscalité Pierre Moscovici, en arrivant à une réunion des ministres des Finances de l'UE à Bruxelles.

""A la lumière de ces nouvelles révélations choquantes"", Pierre Moscovici a appelé les Etats membres de l'UE à ""adopter rapidement la liste des paradis fiscaux, assortie de sanctions dissuasives, ainsi qu'une législation européenne encadrant les intermédiaires fiscaux"". ""C'est moralement indispensable et politiquement urgent"", a-t-il dit.

Le Front national accuse au contraire l'Union européenne d'encourager l'évasion fiscale ""en Irlande, aux Pays-Bas, à Malte"". Dans un communiqué, le parti de Marine Le Pen préconise entre autres de ""priver d'accès aux marchés publics les multinationales qui pratiquent l'évitement fiscal et refusent de régulariser leur situation"".

Cyber bullying, trolling and dragging are terms that have become part and parcel of our daily cyber lives. Some of us have faced these hurtful and harmful actions.

Celebrities are perhaps the biggest victims though, as they are frequently the subjects of trolling, body-shaming and bullying.

Our local media personalities have not been spared, facing a barrage of ugly insults recently.

Just a week ago, actress Ntando Duma was asked by a Twitter user why her baby was fat while she's attractive herself.

Actress Amanda du-Pont's own body was the subject of some shaming on Twitter on Monday.

Du-Pont's photos from Sunday evening's SA Style Awards were met with nasty comments from Nesh:

Actress and model Nomzamo Mbatha was also recently criticised for recycling some of her fashion -- and then for being classist in her response. This picture came with the caption ""Don't look down"":

A tweep then replied: ""You're still wearing this dress from 2015. Nee gerl. Imagine I saw her with that same dress at some after party in Durban and on a few other occasions. Sies. That time it's latex.""

Mbatha did not take this lying down: ""Sis, I think we should stick to dancing [the troll is a choreographer] and leave the Customs Duty paying to mama. For the record, that one busted, dis' a new one.""

She was then widely criticised, as some found her too harsh and snobbish.

To sign off from the subject, Mbatha tweeted: ""Also, tweets must be taken into context. Now we can't address 'trolls' at the level they choose to jab? It's not fun anymore ke.""

Quantico actress Pearl Thusi is another who has come face to face with the trolls.

CHENNAI -- Prime Minster Narendra Modi on Monday said that editorial freedom should be used in public interest and urged the newspapers to devote space to increase awareness about climate change.

Speaking at the 75th anniversary celebrations of Tamil newspaper Daily Thanthi at the Madras University Centenary Auditorium, Modi said lot of things happen around the world and the editors decide what is important to be published in their newspapers.

He said: ""Editorial freedom should be used wisely and in public interest.""

Pointing out the natural calamities occurring around the world at regular intervals, Modi urged newspapers to allocate space to increase awareness about climate change.

He said the freedom to write does not in anyway reduce the importance to be accurate and correct, adding that though media outlets may be owned by the private sector, they serve a public purpose, have much social accountability and their conduct should be above board.

He said technological advancement enables citizens to compare, discuss and analyse the credibility of news and the media should take extra caution to maintain its credibility.

According to him, reform in media can come from within and through introspection.

Observing most of the media discourse revolves around politics, Modi said the nation is made of over a billion people and the media should focus on the people and their achievements.

Citing the spread of mobile phones, Modi said citizen reporting is important in showcasing individual achievements and also helping in the aftermath of natural disasters.

Modi also released a souvenir.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Minister of State for Finance and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan, Chief Minister K. Palaniswami and his deputy O.Pannerselvam also participated in the function.

Paying encomiums to the founder of Daily Thanthi S.P. Adithanar and his son Sivanthi Adithan, Palaniswami said the daily would certainly see centenary celebrations.

Leaders of several political parties, law makers, industrialists, movie actors and diplomats attended the function.

Earlier on his arrival Modi was received by Purohit, Palaniswami and others at the airport.

From the airport Modi reached the INS Adyar naval base here in a helicopter.

At INS Adyar, Modi had a meeting with Palaniswami and discussed about the rain and relief situation in Chennai and neighbouring districts.","Editorial Freedom Should Be Used Wisely And In Public Interest, Says PM Modi",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/11/06/editorial-freedom-should-be-used-wisely-and-in-public-interest-says-pm-modi_a_23267735/

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

Before and After the Green Revolution Per-capita income in Southeast Asia: $351 $1,027 Cereal production in Southeast Asia: 33.8M metric tons 73.6M metric tons +193 +118 1970 Go to 1970 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| 1995 Go to 1995

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

Das ist bei CSU und SPD nicht anders - und völlig normal.

Bei guten Ergebnissen glaubt man keine Analyse nötig zu haben, bei schlechten verzichtet man liebend gerne darauf. Warum auch in noch schwärenden Wunden herumstochern?

""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte""

Auch wenn die CDU sich nicht ernsthaft mit Zahlen beschäftigt, ist sie nach Kräften bemüht, das wenig schmeichelhafte Ergebnis vom 24. September schönzureden. Die CDU ist (außerhalb Bayerns) bei den Zweitstimmen um 7,4 Punkte auf 26,8 Prozent abgesackt.

Sie hat trotz der Aufblähung des Bundestags 55 ihrer bisher 255 Mandate verloren. Sieger sehen so sicher nicht aus. Dennoch handelt die CDU-Spitze, allen voran die Parteivorsitzende und Kanzlerin, nach dem Motto ""Nicht das Erreichte zählt, uns reicht das Erzählte.""

Folglich verkündete Angela Merkel noch in der Wahlnacht, sie wisse nicht, was sie hätte anders machen können. Also alles paletti?

Die Selbstzufriedenheit der CDU - teils gespielt, teils ernst gemeint - steht auf den ersten Blick im Widerspruch zu der Tatsache, dass mit der AfD rechts von ihr eine neue Partei entstanden ist - nicht durch einen Putsch, sondern von 5,9 Millionen Menschen gewählt.

Doch auf den zweiten Blick wird deutlich, dass der CDU die Rechtsaußen-Partei sogar recht willkommen zu sein scheint. Im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus sieht mancher das ""machttechnisch"" oder zynisch: Eine starke AfD verhindert im Bund schon rechnerisch eine rot-rot-grüne Mehrheit. Folglich bleibt die CDU Kanzlerin-Partei. Was will man also mehr?

Die AfD - ein Ergebnis der eigenen Fehler

Selbst CDU-Generalsekretär Peter Tauber müsste es inzwischen gedämmert haben, dass seine Prognose von 2014, die AfD werde so schnell wieder verschwinden wie einst die Piraten, nicht gerade von großer Weisheit geprägt war.

Inzwischen vermitteln die führenden Köpfe der CDU jedoch den Eindruck, sich mit der Existenz der rechten Konkurrenz abgefunden zu haben. Motto: ""Wenn die da sind, dann sind sie halt da.""

Nebenbei: Sich mit der Existenz der AfD abzufinden, ist für Parteimanager recht bequem. Wenn man die neue Partei wie ein Naturereignis betrachtet und nicht auch als Ergebnis eigener Fehler, dann lebt es sich viel leichter.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Dann bleibt Jamaika ein Luftschloss"": FDP-Chef Lindner stellt Koalition mit den Grünen infrage

Alle Wahlanalysen der Meinungsforscher zeigen: Keine Partei hat so viele Stimmen an die AfD abgegeben wie die Union. Wenn aber vereinzelte CDU-Politiker laut darüber nachdenken, wie man diese enttäuschten Konservativen wieder zurückgewinnen könnte, stoßen sie auf Gleichgültigkeit oder Ablehnung. Stört unsere Jamaika-Kreise nicht, lautet implizit die Botschaft.

Der Merkel-Flügel der CDU behauptet unverdrossen, das Ergebnis habe nichts mit der Flüchtlingspolitik zu tun gehabt, nichts mit dem Kontrollverlust im Herbst 2015, nichts mit ""Köln"" und nichts mit der Angst vor als Flüchtlingen getarnten Gewalttätern.

Das passt nicht so recht zu der Wahlkampfaussage Merkels, ""2015 soll, kann und darf sich nicht wiederholen."" Das passt vor allem nicht zu den demoskopischen Befunden.

Für die Union geht es stetig bergab

In den im September 2015 veröffentlichten Ergebnissen der ""Sonntagsfrage"" von Allensbach kam die CDU/CSU auf 42 Prozent, um schon im Oktober - nach der Grenzöffnung - auf 38 Prozent zu fallen.

Von da an ging's, von einem Zwischenhoch im Sommer 2017 abgesehen, stetig bergab. Wer oder was, wenn nicht die Flüchtlingspolitik, soll diesen Einbruch in der Wählergunst eigentlich bewirkt haben?

Weil der Zusammenhang zwischen weit geöffneten Grenzen und immer schlechter werdenden CDU-Werten nicht zu übersehen ist, hat die Merkel-Fraktion in der CDU eine zweite Verteidigungslinie aufgemacht:

Die 32,9 Prozent für die CDU/CSU seien ein ""normales"" Ergebnis - auf einer Linie mit den 35,2 Prozent von 2005 und den 33,8 Prozent von 2009. Demgegenüber seien die 41,5 Prozent von 2013 ein ""Ausreißer"" gewesen, mithin keine seriöse Vergleichsgröße.

Nun ist es eigentlich kein Komplement für die Kanzlerin, wenn die Union ihre Ergebnisse auf und unter dem Niveau der 35,1 Prozent von Kohls Abwahl im Jahr 1998 für ""normal"" hält. Jedoch empfiehlt es sich, Ergebnisse einer Partei nicht isoliert zu betrachten.

Den Kohl'schen 35,1 Prozent von 1998 standen 52,7 Prozent des rot-rot-grünen Lagers gegenüber, Merkels 32,9 Prozent vom 24. September aber nur noch 38,6 Prozent für SPD/Grüne/Linke.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50

Fazit: Von den Wählern, die sich vor allem von der SPD abgewendet haben, können unter dem Strich keine bei der CDU gelandet sein.

Der Modernisierungskurs der Merkel-Tauber-CDU wurde immer damit begründet, die CDU könne links der Mitte mehr Wähler gewinnen als rechts von der Mitte verlieren. Aber das war reine Theorie oder bloßes Wunschdenken. In der Praxis sprechen die Stimmergebnisse eine andere Sprache.

Die Chancen für ""Jamaika"" stehen 50:50. Sollte es dazu kommen, wird die CDU diese Koalition als Ausdruck ihrer Modernität interpretieren.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: CSU-Mann Scheuer äußert sich zu Jamaika - und widerspricht sich in nur 3 Sätzen selbst

Es bedarf freilich einer sehr großen Portion Phantasie, sich bei ""Jamaika"" eine Flüchtlings- oder Familienpolitik vorzustellen, die nach Rechtsaußen abgewanderte CDU-Wähler wieder mit ""ihrer"" Union versöhnen könnte.

Aber darum geht es der CDU-Führung auch gar nicht. Sollen die ungeliebten und unbequemen ""Konservativen"" doch die AfD wählen. Solange die CDU die Kanzlerin stellt, ist dies aus der Perspektive des Adenauer-Hauses ein leicht zu verschmerzender Kollateralschaden.

Übrigens: Adenauer wurde 1949 mit 31,0 Prozent der Stimmen Kanzler. Es ist also noch Luft nach unten.

Ce mariage vient donc couronner une relation débutée en janvier 2014. Les deux célébrités se sont fiancées au MET gala à New York en mai 2016.

En février dernier, dans des propos cités par Public, Kate Upton faisait part de sa petite inquiétude concernant les préparatifs de l'événement: ""Je souhaiterais un mariage sous le signe du fun, de la fête, de la tequila, et de la nourriture. Tout le monde te dit, 'ne t'inquiète pas, fait ce que tu veux, invite qui tu veux... mais bien sûr que tu t'inquiètes!'"" A voir les photos de la cérémonie tout semble s'être parfaitement déroulé.

Les forains menaient mardi 7 novembre au matin une nouvelle opération escargot aux abords de Paris, pour protester contre la suppression de certaines fêtes foraines dans la capitale, à commencer par le marché de Noël des Champs-Élysées.

À 10h30, le cumul des bouchons commençait à baisser. 197 kilomètres de bouchons étaient comptabilisés en région parisienne, selon Sytadin. Une opération escargot était encore en cours sur l'A13 vers Paris, à hauteur du Chesnay, et sur l'A104 à hauteur de Villepinte, et un barrage filtrant installé sur l'A4, dans les deux sens de circulation.

Lundi déjà, les forains avaient fortement perturbé la circulation en Île-de-France en multipliant les opérations escargot.

Les forains, ""des parias à Paris""

""Nous déposons ce matin un référé"" au tribunal administratif de Paris et ""les forains vont attendre une décision de justice"", a annoncé mardi matin sur CNews Marcel Campion, promoteur historique des fêtes foraines parisiennes. ""Si la justice est loyale, vous verrez qu'on va gagner"", a-t-il ajouté.

Selon ""le roi des forains"", les blocages sont de ""la faute des autorités"". Il estime que les forains sont devenus ""des parias à Paris"".

Il s'est également insurgé contre l'ouverture en mai prochain d'un grand parc d'attraction dans le Bois de Boulogne au Jardin d'acclimatation. Le grand parc de loisirs de l'ouest parisien, propriété de la Mairie de Paris et dont le groupe de luxe LVMH et la compagnie des Alpes sont concessionnaires, doit devenir le deuxième parc de loisirs français, derrière Disneyland Paris.

Contacté plus tôt par l'AFP, le président de l'intersyndicale des forains René Hayoun a regretté que ""différentes fêtes foraines"" soient ""supprimées ou touchées"" dans la capitale, citant notamment à Paris la fête foraine de la Bastille et ""Jours de fête"" au Grand Palais et parlant de ""génocide du monde forain"".

Eine Einbruchserie in Wiesbadens Villen-Künstlerviertel schreckt die Wiesbadener auf. Der Täter löscht alle Spuren mit einem speziellen weißen Löschschaum. Ist er ein Polizist oder ein Feuerwehrmann? Nur die kennen sich normalerweise damit aus. Bei einem der Raubzüge wird der Mitarbeiter eines Wachschutzes mit einem Feuerlöscher erschlagen. Schnell gerät ein Augenzeuge ins Visier von Kommissarin Heller (Lisa Wagner). Es ist der ehemalige Lehrer Jan Drexler (Markus Gertken), der als Aussteiger im Wald lebt und sich mit Gelegenheitsjobs über Wasser hält.

Fast 15 lange Jahre lang hat Rosa (Silke Bodenbender), Anfang 30, ihre Familie nicht gesehen. Damals ist sie in die Staaten geflüchtet, weit weg von der Ostsee und vom Vater. Der hat ihr das nie verziehen und meidet seither jeden Kontakt. Zu seinem Geburtstag kommt Rosa zurück. Es drängt sie nach einer Aussprache mit ihm.

Er sitzt in seinem Strandkorb - erschossen.

22:00 Uhr, NDR: Tatort: Eine Frage des Gewissens

Im Einsatz bei einem Raubüberfall erschießt Thorsten Lannert (Richy Müller) den Räuber, der eine Geisel genommen hat. Die Anhörung wegen Verhältnismäßigkeit dieser Handlung sollte eine Routineangelegenheit sein, der Täter war gefährlich und völlig unberechenbar. Doch die Mutter des Toten hat Anwälte engagiert, die Lannert wegen fahrlässiger Tötung angeklagt sehen wollen. Sebastian Bootz (Felix Klare) entlastet Thorsten Lannert in der Befragung - obwohl er eigentlich im Hinblick auf die entscheidenden Sekunden gar nicht sicher ist. Eine weitere Zeugin wird ermordet, bevor sie aussagen kann. Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Überfall im Supermarkt und dem Mord?

The experience of turning 50 is confronting.

The fact of the milestone explains some disconcerting physical changes. Muscles are stiffer in the morning. Golf balls fall short like someone's weighted them. Eyes read blurry.

In truth, these are minor issues and the machine that is the body still manages to deal with the trials of life without too much trouble.

But being defined by a number beginning with a five strikes a blow at one's identity. Claiming youth is now the kind of stretch best left to those of a more limber age. Genuinely young people in their twenties or thirties might talk to you with pity or reverence, but either way the invitation to kick on at the night club later is unlikely to be forthcoming.

Here was the perfect crew to explore what this sad course of events means and how on earth were we going to deal with it.

Never have I struggled so hopelessly to alter a fact of life so stubbornly resolute. I'm 50. I can hide it or not talk about it, but I can't change it.

Of course not all who have recently shared this fate deal with the issue in the same way. There are the Zen-like creatures who claim to have embraced their age, but they are liars.

There are those who enter a deep state of denial. This certainly has its attractions, but no matter how profound my self-deception I still find the truth haunts me in the small hours of the night. Not that 50 year olds are ever awake in the small hours of the night that often any more, of course.

And, there are some who play up in a glorious expression of their mid-life crisis. If I had the flamboyance and disregard for embarrassment to make this work I'd be tempted, but the truth is turning 50 has given me neither.

So, in an attempt to reconcile with Father Time, I went on a trip with old school friends to share the misery with a bottle of wine.

There is something extraordinary about friendships made in teenage years. The shared moment of life's discovery carries with it an honesty about who we really are. Affectations haven't had time to mature. The hopes, fears and dreams of the future lay us bare. Those who knew us then carry throughout life the familiarity of youth. Conversation flows.

Here was the perfect crew to explore what this sad course of events means and how on earth were we going to deal with it.

The content of our discussion did betray the difference in our lives compared with 20-years before. Then it was about life's start as the first kids arrived in the group. The energy and sacrifices required to experience the joy of parenthood were being explored. Our children totally changed our identity, but the exhausting effort meant there was no time to wallow in questions about who we were.

Now, we were talking about life's end. In the past year, three of us had lost our dads. We compared heart-wrenching choices about ageing parents and nursing homes. This clearly predictable side of life had snuck up and mugged us, completely unaware. The idea that our lives would always contain their essential cast of characters had been shattered. Only a few will witness the whole journey.

Even more sadly, thoughts turned to friends and colleagues, people far younger than I, who had already passed. They had been unfairly shortchanged in the experience of life. Through this lens experiencing a 50th birthday really was joyous, and our angst of identity a little indulgent.

Better then to move on to bucket lists and hopes for the future: the familiar discussion we'd been having since childhood.

The dreams ranged from the professional (being on a board of a listed company); to the philanthropic (setting up an NGO for textile workers in the developing world); to developing a new skill (learning to ride dressage); and to the deeply personal -- having the simple courage to change.

We had failed to predict so much of life, good and bad, that we agreed there would be no mid-term review of these dreams. Hopes provide direction and motivation, but life is about how you experience whatever the journey has to offer. Holding to account would be missing the point.

By the night's close there was joy and exuberance in a conversation which took us back to our earliest days. There was also comfort knowing that with these people it was a conversation we could have in the future, again and again.

Age has changed us to be sure. The unsettling nature of 50 still persists. But pain and experience is best handled with company. Through this very special group of peers and childhood friends we have become the witnesses of our lives.

That might just be the comfort I was looking for.",Anyone Who Says They Enjoyed Turning 50 Is A Liar,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/richard-marles/anyone-who-says-they-enjoyed-turning-50-is-a-liar_a_23267555/

Anthony McClanahan was charged Friday with child kidnapping. Authorities say the 46-year-old took his 8-year-old son from an Arizona school on Oct. 3 without the mother's permission, then travelled through Nevada and Utah.

He was apprehended in Utah on Oct. 12 and gave his son back. He bonded out of jail a week later.

McClanahan is being held without bail, and it's unknown if he has a lawyer.

Selon l'article, le producteur en disgrâce a déployé cette ""armée d'espions"" depuis au moins l'automne 2016. Le New Yorker cite des dizaines de documents et sept personnes directement impliquées dans les efforts du producteur déchu pour empêcher en vain la publication d'accusations à son encontre.

Le producteur avait notamment embauché Kroll, vaste entreprise de renseignement et Black Cube, dirigée par d'anciens agents du Mossad et du renseignement israélien.

Harvey Weinstein et son équipe voulaient savoir de quelles informations disposaient les journalistes. Ils ont aussi enquêté sur les reporters eux-mêmes, y compris leur vie personnelle et sexuelle, pour tenter de les contredire, les discréditer ou les intimider.

Weinstein, visé par des enquêtes policières à Londres, New York et Los Angeles sur plusieurs des allégations contre lui, ""surveillait personnellement les progrès de ces enquêtes"", mettant même à contribution ""d'anciens employés de ses sociétés de films pour collecter des noms et passer des coups de fils"", poursuit l'article.

By Ashok Kumar*, Gumla, Jharkhand

In the first week of July, Birla Khariya from Silam village in Jharkhand, was busy planting robust tomato seedlings in his fields. He had bought 3,500 seedlings from Michael Ekka, who runs a vegetable nursery in a nearby hamlet. Earlier, Khariya used to buy a 10 gm pack of seeds to grow his own seedlings; but since last year, he has been purchasing from Ekka's nursery.

""Seedlings from Michael's nursery are resilient, treated and of genuine varieties,"" Khariya told VillageSquare.in. ""Apart from seedlings, the other farm inputs are also available at Michaels' place on easy credit."" Khariya finds it convenient; it also eliminates the risk of nursery failure.

Reduced risk and the convenience of getting many services at their doorsteps have enabled farmers like Khariya from Raidih block of Gumla district to gradually increase the area under vegetable crops. This has encouraged agricultural entrepreneurs like Ekka to introduce more services and innovative ideas that not only help their business but also help the farmers earn more.

Beyond Subsistence Farming

Raidih is an administrative block in the southwestern part of Gumla district in Jharkhand. Raidih is home to about 13,600 families, 65% of them being tribal people, as accounted by the Gumla District Census Handbook - 2011. Around 10,000 families have landholding of less than two hectares (ha).

Of the 30,500 ha of cultivated area, only 6% is irrigated. This implies that rain-fed rice cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the residents of Raidih block. The area gets about 1200 mm of rainfall every year spread over some 70 rainy days. Depending on rain-fed farming makes residents of Raidih practice only subsistence farming.

This and the absence of non-farm enterprises force them to migrate to distant cities in search of jobs and cash income. The younger generation also finds farming an unpredictable occupation and feels that cities hold better opportunities for them. Despite the capricious agricultural production system, the migrants return home during the rainy season to cultivate their fields. Clearly, they have an affinity towards farming and living at home.

Utilizing Opportunities

Located at around 650m above sea level, Raidih enjoys a mild climate. With a rolling topography and well-drained soil, it has a huge potential for subtropical crops, including vegetables, even in rainy season. This unique biophysical feature holds a good prospect for smallholders.

During the rainy season, the surrounding agriculturally progressive areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar are inundated and vegetables cannot be grown. Sensing this opportunity, some farmers started growing vegetables with support from organizations such as PRADAN (Professional Assistance for Development Action), a grassroots organization. As vegetables are in demand during the monsoons, the farmers find a good market.

Michael Ekka in his 40s is an active farmer from Silam Patratoli village of Raidih block. He is eager to learn and adopt new things in agriculture and has a general concern about the socioeconomic condition of his fellow villagers. Michael is supporting villagers to move towards prosperity from farming by becoming an agricultural-entrepreneur, or agripreneur.

One-Stop Shop

An agripreneur is like a one-stop shop in the village. He provides agricultural inputs, high quality vegetable seedlings, mechanized plowing devices like power tillers, small credit for farm inputs through microfinance institutions and information related to farming, besides facilitating collective marketing of vegetables and mangoes. This monsoon, Ekka helped 180 farmers grow vegetables for markets as far as Ranchi and Rourkela.

Michael was identified by the women's SHG (self-help group) of his village to take part in the agri- entrepreneurship program run by Transform Rural India (TRI), in collaboration with Syngenta Foundation India. Michael participated in several training programs on agriculture technology, achievement motivation, and business management among others. The training helped him build his perspective around agriculture, and he could see the opportunity for an enterprise around aggregating inputs demand and output marketing from the local area.

Michael understands that creating an ecosystem around the smallholders is important to sustain them in gainful farming. The rural tribal areas are acutely deficient in products and services required for profitable farming. The present scale and diffusion of agriculture technology is not attractive for conventional markets. Local entrepreneurship is essential to aggregate the demand and supply of farm inputs, services and outputs. It has to sustain the agripreneur, as well as help him stay competitive in the local market.

Challenges

Commitments are major challenges that Michael faces. Sometimes farmers do not take delivery of the ordered inputs or seedlings. When prices of produce are low, farmers dump the produce at Ekka's place, but when prices are high, they sell directly in the markets. After Ekka started taking advance for supply orders, the issue of farmers not taking the ordered inputs has reduced.

Providing assured supplies is still a challenge, but with increasing area under production by farmers, it is slowly being solved. With increased production, the quantity of produce is beyond a farmer's capacity to sell in the local market. So they rely on people such as Michael. Simultaneously, he tries to aggregate and market other local produce like jackfruits, mangoes and rice to keep his revenues right.

Pioneering New Ideas

Being closely associated with Mahila Vikas Mandal, an SHG federation, Michael was aware that his village is in a kharif tomato production cluster. More than 300 farmers around his village grow kharif hybrid tomatoes. So he started a nursery in kharif of 2016, producing 50,000 tomato seedlings. He used a bamboo frame structure with mesh nylon net to protect the seedlings from heavy downpours, insects and stray animals.

The demand for seedlings outstripped supply. Subsequently he produced two batches of seedlings for vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, chili and eggplant, booking a profit of about Rs 50,000 this year. His efforts drew the attention of the district agriculture department, and he bagged a commercial greenhouse for flower cultivation, where he grows gerbera. Michael also applied for and successfully obtained a seed and fertilizer dealer license.

In 2017, sensing the demand, Michael expanded his business, producing chili and brinjal seedlings in kharif, besides the tomato. He also got power tillers and mechanized paddy thrasher from the village organization (VO) and started lending services. His seed and fertilizer shop is also doing well, the turnover by July being more than Rs 70,000. From selling paddy seeds and fertilizers, he expects to make about Rs 30,000 by the end of the kharif season. The first batch of 60,000 seedlings was sold out and he was preparing the next batch.

In the summer of 2017, he provided collective marketing services for mangoes. Michael supplied mangoes to Ranchi and charged Rs 0.30 per kg from the farmers. The farmers were happy because the price was good, weighing was accurate, and it was a doorstep supply facility. For efficient marketing services, Michael has 250 plastic crates at his center for grading of produce, transparent weighing and easy transportation.

Michael is using a smartphone-based application Kushal Kisan, developed by TRI, to register farmers, facilitate crop planning and manage inputs delivery as well as providing credit through microfinance institution.

Facilitating Change

There are 22 such agripreneurs offering services similar to Michael's. In addition, they anchor access to micro irrigation. They are opening new frontiers like introducing kharif onions and flowers in their area. There are another 69 people in the process of becoming agripreneurs in three administrative blocks of Jharkhand.

Attracted by this rewarding enterprise, Michael's son has joined him in this journey of driving prosperity in the local area. ""My son has returned home from Himachal,"" Michael told VillageSquare.in happily. His son takes active interest in the farm equipment lending center and the vegetable nursery business.

In Michael's region, the expected returns are about Rs 2 million a year. It is evident that enabling the local entrepreneurs with relevant perspective, skills, linkages and mentoring support, it is possible to intensify the local production system profitably, sustain the local entrepreneurs, and stem migration.

Carl Sargeant quit his post as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children in Cardiff last week after what he called “shocking and distressing” allegations were made against him.

His body was found at his home in Connah’s Quay, north Wales, at 11.30am on Tuesday. North Wales Police said they were “not treating his death as suspicious”. It is understood that Sargeant took his own life.

All Welsh Assembly business was suspended as a mark of respect.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his death was “terrible and deeply shocking news” and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said his passing would be “a great loss” to the party and the country.

Sargeant was suspended from the party last week and had the whip withdrawn in the National Assembly for Wales while an investigation took place into the allegations against him.

Labour’s national party HQ suspended him on Friday following unspecified allegations against him.

His family said in a statement on Tuesday: “Carl was a much loved husband, father and friend. He wasn’t simply a part of our family. He was the glue that bound us together. He was the heart of our family. We loved him so very much.

D'une part parce qu'il ose aborder de face un thème brûlant de notre société, d'autre part parce qu'il propose des pistes de réflexions, des outils concrets en matière de relation éducative et des informations claires sur les enjeux de la consommation de cannabis chez nos adolescents.

Les parents ne sont ni des policiers, ni des thérapeutes

La première phrase donne le ton: ""ce livre est destiné aux parents et à l'ensemble des adultes confrontés aux usages de cannabis d'un adolescent. S'il est écrit par des psychologues cliniciens, il est d'abord le fruit de partages d'expériences issus de rencontres et d'échanges entre parents, entre parents et professionnels, et entre professionnels.""

Cette triple approche se révèle au fil des pages et confère à l'ouvrage sa valeur multifocale. Loin de la formule théorique, loin des approches moralisantes et des pensées stéréotypées, cet ouvrage propose une réflexion poussée sur les enjeux et usages d'un produit qui fait débat dans notre société. Il suggère également des attitudes concrètes à privilégier en tant que parents pour aborder la question du cannabis avec son adolescent. Comme le rappellent les auteurs, ""les parents ne sont ni des policiers, ni des thérapeutes: c'est par la relation éducative qu'ils peuvent agir"".

La relation éducative, le sésame entre parents et adolescents

Après un rappel du cadre légal et sociétal des conduites addictives dans notre contemporanéité, les auteurs font un focus sur l'importance du rôle éducatif des parents en leur proposant des outils pour ""entamer un dialogue constructif"". Comment désamorcer le ""je gère"" de l'adolescent et le ""tu exagères"" des parents au profit d'une relation de confiance permettant à l'adolescent de s'individuer à travers ses propres capacités de contrôle? Voilà qui n'est pas une gageure facile. Les émotions des parents face à la découverte de consommation de leur adolescent, leur réactions premières, leurs angoisses en sourdine, peuvent être paralysantes pour les deux parties. Alors comment trouver le bon accordage pour oser en parler? Comment faire au quotidien pour rester en contact avec son enfant qui grandit tout en lui donnant des clés pour qu'il puisse s'autonomiser dans les meilleures conditions possibles? Autant de pistes que propose entre autres ce livre.

La poly-consommation touche la jeune génération de plein fouet.

Sans tomber dans une banalisation inopérante ou un alarmisme excessif, force est de constater que le cannabis est actuellement omniprésent en France. Comme le rappellent les auteurs Jean-Pierre Couteron, Muriel Lascaux et Aude Stehelin, un jeune sur deux à l'âge de dix-sept ans à déjà fumé au moins une fois de l'herbe. A l'adolescence, 80 % des adolescents ont déjà expérimenté plusieurs produits en même temps (tabac, alcool, cannabis, drogues de synthèses...). La poly-consommation touche la jeune génération de plein fouet. Ce ""rite de passage"", plus ou moins toléré dans notre société, n'est pas sans conséquence d'un point de vue relationnel et cérébral pour un adolescent.

Pour rappel, l'efficience cérébrale et la plasticité neuronale n'arrivent à maturité qu'à l'age de 25 ans. C'est pourquoi, les campagnes de prévention et de réductions des risques soutenues par le Ministère de la Santé et les diverses fondations, associations et centres spécialisés rappellent à quel point il est capital de retarder le premier usage. Cannabis compris.

Aussi, si vous souhaitez être informé avec clarté sur le cannabis et ses enjeux dans notre société, si vous souhaitez obtenir des adresses utiles et acquérir des outils pour communiquer d'une manière éducative avec votre adolescent ""sans affolement, ni naïveté"", sans conteste, cet ouvrage saura vous donner des clés.

M. Coiteux, qui est aussi le ministre responsable de la métropole, rencontrait la nouvelle mairesse lors d'une première rencontre officielle mardi. Il l'avait brièvement saluée lundi, au lendemain de son élection.

En plus de la ligne rose du métro, la participation du gouvernement québécois dans l'achat de 300 nouveaux autobus hybrides a aussi été discutée. Il s'agit du premier dossier prioritaire de Mme Plante.

«À très court terme, on va organiser une rencontre avec mon collègue André Fortin, ministre des Transports. On va certainement discuter de ces deux questions-là et on est là pour faciliter et aider dans la réalisation des projets qui seront prioritaires [pour Montréal]», dit le ministre.

M. Coiteux souligne qu'aucun projet concret n'a encore été déposé au gouvernement concernant la ligne rose. D'ici là, la priorité du gouvernement québécois sera de concrétiser le REM tel que présenté jusqu'ici, ainsi que de commencer le prolongement de la ligne bleue vers Anjou.

Mme Plante a réitéré son engagement à produire les études nécessaires pour déposer son projet au ministère des Transports le plus rapidement possible. Par ailleurs, elle a pris ses distances de l'idée de prolonger vers l'est le Réseau électrique métropolitain, en lieu et place de la ligne rose.

«C'est une idée qui a été lancée par plusieurs personnes, dont Alexandre Taillefer. Mais, à ce que je sache, il n'y a pas de projet réel qui a été présenté», dit-elle.

«On ne va pas s'interdire d'imaginer le futur du transport collectif à Montréal», affirme-t-il.

Il n'a toutefois pas précisé si le futur se dresserait sur un horizon de 5 ans, 10 ans ou plus.

The former studio executive allegedly hired corporate intelligence companies Kroll and Black Cube, which is largely composed of former Mossad officers and members of other Israeli intelligence agencies. The New Yorker obtained documents and testimony from seven anonymous sources that detailed Weinstein's attempts to collect information designed to stop exposure of abuse accusations.

Agencies appeared to specifically target Rose McGowan, the actress who signed a legal settlement with Weinstein and has said the producer raped her.

Two investigators met with McGowan under false pretenses to gain information. One agent, pretending to be a women's rights activist, Diana Filip, contacted McGowan over the course of months. After the actress mentioned speaking to reporter Ronan Farrow about her allegations against Weinstein, Filip reached out to Farrow, who also wrote Monday's article.

Farrow, who has interviewed several of Weinstein's accusers, said that Filip was ""asking for a meeting and suggesting that I join her campaign to end professional discrimination against women."" Farrow said the investigators were tracking journalists in ""a detailed effort to uncover sources.""

The New Yorker reports that documents indicate the hired investigators targeted other reporters and accusers, including reporter Ben Wallace and editor-in-chief Adam Moss of New York Magazine, actress Annabella Sciorra and model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.

Sciorra recounted a phone call from a freelance journalist who apparently was also working with Black Cube. The journalist tried to get Sciorra to talk about her time with Weinstein, but she felt suspicious about the questions and ended the call, saying that she felt as if she was being tricked by Weinstein.

Die Macher der RTL-Kuppelsendung ""Schwiegertochter gesucht"" laufen in der diesjährigen Staffel wieder zur Höchstform der Menschenverachtung auf. Nachdem sie bereits erfolgreich die minderjährige Teilnehmerin Tutti bloßgestellt haben, ist in der aktuellen Folge Kandidatin Petra dran.

Petra hatte sich neben Catrin für das Wolfgang-Petry-Double Martin beworben. Schon in der Busfahrt zum Haus des Hobby-Sängers und seiner Mutter wurden die beiden mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik beschallt. Die Musik begleitete die Kandidaten von da an jeden Tag im Haus des selbsternannten Doubles.

Da ist es natürlich nur konsequent, dass die Kandidatinnen auch mit Wolfgang-Petry-Musik verabschiedet werden. Denn RTL hat sich die wohl geschmackloseste Möglichkeit einfallen lassen, Kandidatin Petra nach Hause zu schicken.

Martin nimmt eine Sprachnachricht der besonderen Art auf

Martin überreichte jeder der Kandidatinnen ein Mikrofon mit einer selbst vertonten Aufnahme. Auf dem ersten Mikrofon sang er in wunderbar schiefer Tonlage: ""Ich habe Sehnsucht nach dir"", auf dem zweiten wiederum: ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"".

Das zweite Mikrofon überreichte er dann in einer Abschieds-Zeremonie der schwer verliebten Kandidatin Petra. Als diese auf den Knopf drückte und Martin fröhlich sang ""Ich habe keine Sehnsucht nach dir"" kamen ihr die Tränen.

Als Wiedergutmachung hat sich das RTL-Team dafür etwas ganz besonders Romantisches für Kandidatin Nadine einfallen lassen. ""Ich dachte, ich mache es heute mal so wie der Bachelor"", sagte Kevin zu seiner Auserwählten. Nur leider hatte Kevin keine Rose parat. Also reichte er Nadine ganz einfach einen Knochen. Einen Knochen, an dem normalerweise seine Hunde kauen.

Nadine war gerührt und willigte gleich darauf ein, die Nacht mit Kevin im Zelt zu verbringen.

Hammersmith and Fulham foodbank sees sharp 94% rise On a street lined with rows of multi-million pound Edwardian houses and Mercedes, Porsches and BMWs, lies the Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank in South West London. Housed within a church and open twice a week, the foodbank helps hundreds of people a year with emergency parcels. Despite its unlikely location, the wealthy London borough’s part in the roll out of Universal Credit has seen demand across the area’s three foodbanks soar by 94%, figures seen by HuffPost UK reveal.

George Bowden/HuffPost UK The Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank near Parsons Green, South West London, is housed within a church and open two times a week. Demand has surged by 94% since Universal Credit hit the area last year.

Pinterest CLOSE Through tears, she explains how the government’s cap in housing benefit means she does not receive enough Universal Credit to cover the full rent on her council-owned home of 20 years. ″I went into arrears straight away,” she says. “Now they say I’ll have to pay half the rent, but what about money for everything else?”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK Maggie Millard has been forced to use food banks since moving onto Universal Credit. She's one of dozens of claimants who have been left with no option but to repeatedly seek emergency parcels to feed themselves.

Since moving onto the new benefits regime, which has been rolled out in the borough since June 2016, Maggie has been forced to seek emergency help for basics like food and heating. She’s been attending the food bank for a month, in which time she has been directed to support from Citizens Advice, who are helping her navigate the myriad of confusing rules Universal Credit imposes. “People here have been great, so, so helpful,” she says. “Other places make you feel like you’ve crawled out from a rock.”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK Food bank manager Daphine Aikens talks to Maggie Millard about her situation on a recent weekday.

“There are so many more Maggies,” food bank manager Daphine Aikens says. “It’s been brutal. Some people have been made to wait 12 weeks. People have nothing.” “We had a mum with children, everything stopped when she moved to Universal Credit,” she adds. “She had nothing and within two weeks she had no food. The family didn’t eat one weekend and her child was wandering the streets stealing food from bins.”

The entire service helped feed 2,364 people in the first half of 2016. The same figure after Universal Credit began, was 4,601

Aikens, who oversees three food banks across the area, revealed that the entire service helped feed 2,364 people in the first half of 2016. The same figure for 2017, after the roll out of Universal Credit began, was 4,601. An increase of around 94%. “It’s been horrendous. The reality is we’re seeing people who have not eaten for days, who can’t pay their rent, who are starving, and they’re borrowing,” she says. “Whereas once we’d see someone in their hour of need once or twice, we see them now multiple times. It’s so much worse.”

George Bowden/HuffPost UK The Hammersmith and Fulham foodbank near Parsons Green sits between multi-million pound homes and besides luxury super cars. Those visiting the foodbank have to walk through this street to get there.

The Hammersmith and Fulham service is part of the Trussell Trust foodbank network, which revealed on Tuesday that the average surge in demand across all its centres in Universal Credit full service areas was 30%, when compared with a year ago. Comparative analysis of foodbanks not in full Universal Credit rollout areas showed an average increase of 12%. “We’re seeing soaring demand at foodbanks across the UK,” Mark Ward, Interim Chief Executive at The Trussell Trust, says. “The simple truth is that even with the enormous generosity of our donors and volunteers, we’re concerned foodbanks could struggle to meet demand this winter if critical changes to benefit delivery aren’t made now. “People cannot be left for weeks without any income, and when that income does come, it must keep pace with living costs – foodbanks cannot be relied upon to pick up the pieces.”

Doch in ihrer Amtszeit hat Deutschland kaum Fortschritte beim Klimaschutz gemacht

Das zeigt sich vor allem bei der Kohleenergie

Angela Merkels wohl größtes Versagen lässt sich auf die Tonne genau messen.

Als die ehemalige Bundesumweltministerin 2005 ins Kanzleramt einzog, stieß Deutschland 992 Millionen Tonnen klimaschädliches Kohlendioxid (CO2) aus. 2015 waren es 902 Millionen Tonnen. Der Ausstoß müsste aber viel schneller sinken, wenn Deutschland sein offizielles Klimaziel von 751 Millionen Tonnen im Jahr 2020 noch schaffen will, kritisieren Experten.

Die Zahlen zeigen: Die Bilanz, die Angela Merkel als Klimakanzlerin vorzuweisen hat, ist rabenschwarz.

Und das obwohl Deutschland weltweit als eine Art Öko-Primus angesehen wird. Die Wahrheit, das zeigt sich zum Start der 23. Weltklimakonferenz in Bonn, sieht anders aus.

“Trump ist wenigstens ehrlich”

Wegen ihrer gescheiterten Klimapolitik vergleicht “Die Zeit” Merkel gar mit Donald Trump. “Merkel betreibt eine klimafeindliche Politik”, urteilt die Wochenzeitung.

Aber im Gegensatz zur Kanzlerin sei der US-Präsident wenigstens ehrlich und zeige offen, dass ihm das Klima egal ist.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Deutschland hat ein schmutziges Geheimnis"": TV-Sender CNN macht Merkel schwere Vorwürfe

Gründe für Deutschlands Versagen beim Klimaschutz gibt es viele: Die schleppende Verkehrswende, das gedrosselte Tempo beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien, die Stagnation beim Umbau der Wärmeversorgung.

Aber das Scheitern der Kanzlerin wird nirgendwo deutlicher als im Bereich der Kohleenergie.

Zum Hintergrund:

► In Deutschland stehen die schmutzigsten Kohlemeiler Europas.

► Fast die Hälfte des klimaschädlichen CO2-Ausstoßes in Deutschland geht auf das Konto des Energiesektors.

► Im Energiesektor verursachen Kohlekraftwerke wiederum den Großteil der Klimagase.

► Deutschland fördert mehr der besonders schmutzigen Braunkohle als jede andere Land der Welt (China und Indien fördern vor allem Steinkohle).

Angela Merkel kennt all diese Zahlen. Und als Physikerin weiß sie zu gut, was Kohlekraftwerke mit dem Klima anrichten. Aber ebenso wie schmutzige Dieselautos stellt die Kanzlerin die Kohle unter Artenschutz.

Die Frage ist: Warum? Die wahrscheinlichste Antwort lautet: Weil sich daraus bisher politisch kein Kapital schlagen lässt.

Kohleausstieg wird in einer Jamaika-Koalition kaum zu machen sein

Im Jahr 2010 blockierte Merkel ein frühzeitiges Ende der Subventionen für deutsche Kohlekraftwerke, die die EU durchsetzen wollte.

2013 hieß es im Koalitionsvertrag noch, dass die Kohleverbrennung “auf absehbare Zeit unverzichtbar” sei. Dann versuchte Merkel sich an einer Kohlewende - die sie aber nie durchzog.

Im Frühjahr 2015 hatte die Kanzlerin noch Zustimmung für einen langsamen Kohleausstieg in Deutschland signalisiert - organisieren wollte ihn ihr damaliger Wirtschaftsminister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Klimaschutz: Wer nicht mitmacht, den bestraft das Leben

Doch nachdem sich die Ministerpräsidenten von Sachsen, Brandenburg und Sachsen-Anhalt und ranghohe Parteimitglieder gegen den Plan aussprachen, beerdigte Merkel die Idee.

Zwar hatte die Kanzlerin auch im Wahlkampf vorsichtige Zustimmung zu einem Ausstieg aus der Braunkohle signalisiert. Im Sommerinterview hatte sie erklärt, man könne einen Braunkohleausstieg “ins Auge fassen”, wenn es Pläne für die Zukunft der Beschäftigten in der Kohleindustrie gebe.

Doch für einen Kohleausstieg kämpfen nun die Grünen in den Jamaika-Verhandlungen allein. Von einer Unterstützung der Kanzlerin für ihre Pläne ist bisher nichts an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen. An der Frage des Klimaschutzes drohen nun sogar die Verhandlungen für eine Jamaika-Koalition zu scheitern.

Dabei drängt die Zeit. Denn je länger die schmutzigen Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, desto schwieriger wird es für Deutschland, seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Sogar China verabschiedet sich von der Kohle

Und während Deutschland noch zögert, gehen andere Länder voran.

Unter anderem haben Norwegen und Großbritannien den vollständigen Kohleausstieg beschlossen. Selbst Kohlegroßverbraucher wie Indien und China haben zuletzt die Kraftwerksöfen gedrosselt.

China schickt sich an, bei der Kohlepolitik sogar zum Vorbild zu werden: 1,3 Millionen Jobs sollen in dem Sektor in den kommenden Jahren laut der Regierung wegfallen. Neue Arbeitsplätze sollen dafür im Bereich der erneuerbaren Energien entstehen. Schon jetzt arbeiten rund 2,5 Millionen Menschen in der chinesischen Solarindustrie.

In Deutschland gehen Arbeitsplätze bei den Erneuerbaren verloren

In Deutschland verläuft die Entwicklung genau umgekehrt. 2015 waren rund 330.000 Menschen direkt oder indirekt durch den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien beschäftigt. Die Zahl sank aber zuletzt deutlich.

Im Vergleich dazu sind die Beschäftigtenzahlen in der Kohleindustrie gering. Je nachdem auf welche Statistik man blickt, beschäftigt die Braunkohleindustrie in Deutschland direkt und indirekt zwischen 20.000 und 50.000 Menschen. Im Bereich der Steinkohle sind in Deutschland gerade einmal noch rund 7500 Menschen beschäftigt.

Sicher ist: Die Kohleenergie muss früher oder später ohnehin aus dem Energiemix verschwinden. Warum dann nicht mit dem Ausstieg jetzt schon beginnen und Angestellte langsam umschulen und in anderen Bereich unterbringen?

Deutsche sind mehrheitlich für Kohleausstieg

Merkels Zögern beim Kohleausstieg ist inzwischen sogar zu einem Hemmnis für die Energiewende an sich geworden, einst ein Vorzeigeprojekt Deutschlands: Es macht die Energiewende komplizierter und teurer als nötig.

Denn Kohlekraftwerke und vergleichsweise saubere Energielieferanten vertragen sich schlecht. Vereinfacht gesagt: Kohlekraftwerke produzieren kontinuierlich Strom. Das klingt erst einmal gut. Aber damit blockiert die Kohle die Netze für Wind- und Solarstrom, denn Kohlekraftwerke können die Produktion nur langsam drosseln.

Geeigneter um im Verbund mit Wind und Sonne Strom zu liefern sind dynamische Gaskraftwerke.

Die Folge: Solange viele Kohlekraftwerke am Netz sind, muss der Umbau des Energiesystems zu einer sauberen Versorgung gedrosselt werden. Deutschland verspielt damit die Chance wenigstens nach 2020 seine Klimaziele zu erreichen.

Und noch ein weiteres Argument der Kohlebefürworter zählt nicht: Der Preis. Inzwischen ist Strom aus Windrädern ähnlich günstig wie Strom aus Kohlekraftwerken. In den kommenden Jahren wird Windstrom sogar billiger als schmutziger Kohlestrom.

Ein Plan für den Ausstieg aus der Kohle ist also aus mehreren Gründen längst überfällig. Das findet auch eine Mehrheit der Deutschen. Nach einer Emnid-Umfrage für die “Bild am Sonntag” sind 59 Prozent der Deutschen dafür, dass die nächste Bundesregierung den Kohleausstieg beschließt, und 31 Prozent dagegen.

Eigentlich ist Angela Merkel bekannt dafür ihre Entscheidungen stark an Umfragen zu orientieren. Beim Kohleausstieg ist davon allerdings noch nichts zu merken.

Ihr Vorsitzender Thomas Eigenthaler, erklärt im Gespräch mit der HuffPost, dass allein Gastronomen jährlich rund 10 Milliarden Euro an Steuern hinterziehen.

Vor allem Kleinstunternehmen wie Kioske nutzten häufig noch Bargeldkassen, erklärt Eigenthaler. Dadurch seien die Einnahmen nicht nachvollziehbar - der Betrug ist ein Kinderspiel. Das betrifft auch Taxifahrer und Glückspielhallen. Überall wo Bargeld im Spiel sei, hätten Betrüger leichtes Spiel.

Softwarebetrug gibt es nicht nur bei den Autobauern

Aber auch moderne elektronische Registrierkassen können für den Steuerbetrug missbraucht werden. Dabei hilft eine Software, die den Wareneingang und -Ausgang so klein rechnet, dass der Gesamtumsatz des Restaurants sinkt. Folglich fällt auch der zu versteuernde Gewinn kleiner aus.

Die Kasse registriert dann zum Beispiel, dass der Gastronom weniger Schnitzel und Pommes eingekauft hat als in Wirklichkeit - auch die Verkäufe rechnet die Software entsprechend klein.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Eliten, wundert euch nicht, wenn die Menschen AfD wählen, es liegt auch an eurem Verhalten



Bisher ist der Gesetzgeber gegen diesen Betrug machtlos. Und auch ein weiterer Steuertrick von dem Eigenthaler berichtet, löst Kopfschütteln aus.

Händler aus China prellen den deutschen Staat

So nutzen in China registrierte Unternehmen den Versandhändler Amazon, um massenhaft Produkte in Deutschland zu verkaufen. Die Produkte lagern bei Amazon in Deutschland, werden aber ohne den Aufschlag von 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer verkauft.

90 Prozent der chinesischen Händler würden an der Steuer vorbeiverkaufen, schätzt Eigenthaler. Auch Ebay ist betroffen.

Der Schaden für das Finanzamt: eine Milliarde Euro. Das Problem ist den Behörden schon länger bekannt. Im Mai erklärte der hessische Finanzminister Thomas Schäfer gegenüber der ""Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung"": ""Online-Handel boomt. Mit ihm boomt aber leider auch Steuerbetrug vor allem ausländischer Unternehmen.""

Aber das ist noch nicht alles. So geben Privatpersonen ihren Arbeitsweg beim Finanzamt höher an als er tatsächlich ist. Bücher werden als Fachbücher deklariert, um sie steuerlich geltend zu machen und ein privates Weihnachtsessen wird als Geschäftsdinner deklariert.

All diese Betrügereien von Privatpersonen nennt Eigenthaler “Unehrlichkeiten im Tagesgeschäft” - sie seien im Gegensatz zum Betrug in der Gastronomie kein strukturelles Problem.

Dass diese strukturellen Probleme aber schnell gelöst werden, glaubt kaum ein Experte. Dafür fehlt den Finanzämter unter anderem schlicht das Personal - im Falle von Steuerausfällen bei Verkäufen bei Amazon und Ebay aber auch die passenden Gesetze.

Das beschäftigt die Promi-Mütter

Die Fragen, die die einzelnen Promi-Mütter beschäftigen, sind so verschieden wie die Frauen selbst. Welcher Erziehungsstil ist der richtige? Diese Frage stand bei Werbeikone Verona Pooth im Mittelpunkt. Während viele Zuschauer sie sonst nur perfekt gestylt kennen, zeigt sie sich bei ""6 Mütter"" ungeschminkt und spricht über ihre Erziehungsansprüche: Wie viel muss man als Mutter machen, wo kann man locker lassen, wie sehr hat man alles im Griff?

Sängerin Patricia Kelly beschäftigen hingegen zwei andere große Themen bei ""6 Mütter"": ihr eigenes Comeback mit der Kelly Family sowie Ignatius, einer ihrer Söhne, der das ""Kelly""-Gen geerbt hat und nun auch ins Rampenlicht will. Und wenn der Nachwuchs schon Karriere macht? Bei der alleinerziehenden Schauspielerin und Unternehmerin Anne-Sophie Briest dreht sich in ihrem Alltag alles um Tochter Faye, die YouTube-Star und Schauspielerin ist. Wie viel Leistung muss der Nachwuchs erbringen? Und wie lässt sich alles mit der Schule in Einklang bringen?

JG: ""Take a big deep breath, approach and simply say 'Hi my name is xxx, I'm here on my own today is it okay to join in your conversation.'
JG: ""If the conversation is stilted and not going anywhere quite simply remove yourself from the conversation.
Networking matters, but it's the network of you that you develop that matters more.""","Even for the most confident workers, networking can be a daunting prospect. And if you're an introvert, it can be downright terrifying.

But unfortunately, in many fields, networking is a necessary evil. You're not going to make new contacts or meet new people from the safety of your cubicle.

So how can you survive the intimidating prospect of walking into a room of people you don't know (without burying your face in your phone the whole time) and network successfully?

HuffPost Australia spoke to Janine Garner, CEO, networking specialist and author of 'It's Who You Know' to find out.

HP: What do you think it is about networking that people hate so much?

Janine Garner: ""We hate networking because we have made it so hard -- we are overwhelmed with the choices available to network, it's becoming complicated with how, what and where, we are all stretched for time and given the superficial nature of most networking (insert business card swapping fest) we are over it and questioning the real purpose behind it.""

What makes someone successful at networking?

JG: ""Those that are successful at networking quite simply care. They care about the other person first and foremost, their success and what help they need.

""They engage deeply in conversation, are always curious about how they can help and make a point of following up and following through on any promises they make.

""Successful networkers understand that building relationships requires an investment of time, energy and interest and that it is a long game.""

What are the most common struggles people have with networking?

JG: ""The most common struggles people have revolve all around themselves and being in their own head -- 'I'm an introvert, I'm nervous, what do I say, how do I make sure I am interesting, what if I need to leave the conversation?'

""The obsession with self gets in the way. I suggest people have to get out of their own way and instead focus intently on the person they are speaking to, listen deeply to understand and concentrate on being present.

""And if you err on the introversion side follow your energy -- the worse thing you can do as an introvert is go to an event with thousands of people -- instead organise a lunch of six people or a coffee date -- that's networking. And if you have to go to that big event plan your exit time and be okay with having a deep conversation with one or two people.

What is the first thing you should do when you enter a networking event?

JG: ""For me its about preparation -- why are the attending the event, who else is going, who would you like to meet? When you enter the event start connecting straight away -- say hi to the person at the check-in, take a deep breath and say hi to the first person you meet -- quite simply start the conversation.

""And if you are worrying about what to say, ask them questions first to get them talking so you can ultimately find some common ground. Some great opening questions could be 'What brought you here today?' 'What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now in your business?' 'That sounds interesting tell me more'.""

This is not how to do it.

Any tips on how to introduce yourself/infiltrate a group of people who are already talking?

JG: ""Take a big deep breath, approach and simply say 'Hi my name is xxx, I'm here on my own today is it okay to join in your conversation.'

What are the biggest networking no-nos?

JG: ""We all hate those rubber-neckers -- you know the ones -- the ones that are talking to you, but not really listening, their eyes are looking around searching out who else is in the room that may be more interesting, more important or more influential.

""The biggest no-no is not to be present in that moment. Focus on who you are speaking with, be interested in what they are saying and remove all distractions.""

What should you do if the conversation is stilted/awkward?

JG: ""If the conversation is stilted and not going anywhere quite simply remove yourself from the conversation. You are at a networking function for a reason -- it's to meet people.

""Excuse yourself by going to get a drink or a trip to the bathroom. And its okay to explain that you came to this event to meet some new people, say it's been lovely to meet you and excuse yourself politely so you can go and meet some other people.""

A post shared by ~*RaeofSunshine*~ (@araeoffuckingsunshine) on Oct 21, 2016 at 9:26am PDT

Nailed it.

Do people still hand out their business cards or is that not done any more?

JG: ""Some do, some don't. Networking isn't about handing out business cards -- it's about meeting people, connecting and sharing. LinkedIn is the worlds biggest rolodex!""

Any other tips you might have?

JG: ""Networking is a choice -- you can either choose to be superficial in your approach and realise the opportunity that exists when you build relationships through listening carefully and engaging in conversation.

There was no chance that the apartheid state will let this slide.","The threats against Jacques Pauw by the State Security Agency (SSA) and the family of its director-general, Arthur Fraser, are not the first the journalist has received from government and its cronies.

Pauw was part of the anti-establishment and anti-apartheid newspaper ""Vrye Weekblad"" (The Free Weekly) between 1988 and 1994, when the Afrikaans publication exposed the apartheid government's death squads, revealing who the commanders were and exactly how they operated. His and his colleagues' reports -- including those by ""Vrye Weekblad"" editor Max du Preez -- blasted the lid off of the National Party government's murderous ""total strategy"".

Du Preez, in his book ""Oranje, Blanje, Blues"", writes he always believed that ""if normal, decent Afrikaners knew what apartheid really did to black South Africans and that is wasn't this well-intentioned 'separate development of peoples', they would never have supported the system for so long"".

This informed the newspaper's ethos and Pauw took up the challenge to expose the apartheid state for what it was: a broken, racist and murderous system. Pauw told Du Preez of a man he met claiming to be in command of Vlakplaas, a police unit that allegedly had the powers to eliminate state enemies without any fear of repercussion. When Anton Lubowski, another Afrikaner who was reviled because of his affiliation to Swapo in Namibia, was suspiciously murdered, Du Preez instructed Pauw to find this so-called Vlakplaas commander.

""My instincts told me it was the handiwork of South African forces and I swore we were going to smoke them out and identify them. I raced to the office and when I walked in Jacques said: 'Its Vlakplaas.' I replied he should go and fetch the Vlakplaas guy. It was time to unmask the whole thing. We needed a smoking gun,"" Du Preez writes.

The Vlakplaas commander's name was Dirk Coetzee, and his revelations in ""Vrye Weekblad"" exposed the government, police, political leaders and police officers who ran a covert, illegal war against South Africans who were opposed to the political dispensation of the day.

Coetzee explained to Pauw and Du Preez he was commander of police unit C1 based at Vlakplaas, a farm between Johannesburg and Pretoria. ""Where courts and laws didn't work, Vlakplaas stepped in. Assassinations, executions, bombings, kidnappings, poisonings and disinformation,"" Du Preez writes.

Coetzee told the journalists: ""I was in the heart of the whore.""

The police commander wasn't innocent. He admitted his complicity in the murder of Durban struggle lawyer Griffiths Mnxenge, how he bombed an ANC safe house in Swaziland, killing a child, how they murdered Botswana nationals with ties to the ANC and how he helped murder two ANC members and burnt their bodies. He also explained to Pauw and Du Preez how he was handed poison by the police's head of forensics, Lothar Neethling. He implicated a number of senior police officials and provided information about the bomb that killed activist Ruth First.

Du Preez: ""I sat there, flabbergasted, actually I was paralysed. It sounded like something from a South American dictatorship. We had our smoking gun, but I felt like a fox terrier that caught the bus he was chasing for so long. It had to be exposed, I knew, but at what price? There was no chance that the apartheid state will let this slide. It could be a serious blow to the apartheid regime, we knew. And if it meant the end of 'Vrye Weekblad', then so be it.""

When Coetzee received death threats (and after the ""Weekly Mail"" published an exposé about one of Vlakplaas's operatives, Almond Nofomela), Du Preez decided to hand over Coetzee to the ANC for safety. Pauw and Coetzee flew to Mauritius where the former Vlakplaas commander told his whole story to the journalist.

On 17 November 1989, ""Vrye Weekblad"" led with a banner headline: ""Bloedspoor van die SAP"" (""Blood Trail of the South African Police"") -- written by Pauw -- and exposing the police and government. Four full pages told the whole gruesome story: ""Murder squad's trail of terror"", ""I was in the heart of the whore"", ""Vlakplaas: headquarters of the murder squad"", ""I detest myself"" and ""Police officers told to deny everything"".

The story was a bombshell. ""It [the death squads] was Muammar Gaddafi's style, not a Christian government who at that exact moment was expecting Nelson Mandela to denounce violence if he wanted to be released. As we asked in a leader article on 17 November: Who are the real terrorists?"" Du Preez said.

""Vrye Weekblad"" started publishing a deluge of stories about the death squads and numerous policemen beat down a path to Pauw and Du Preez's door to confess.

But the powers-that-be did not hold back. The offices of ""Vrye Weekblad"" were bombed and its journalists harassed. Neethling also sued the paper for defamation, but Judge Johann Kriegler of the then Rand Supreme Court found in Du Preez and Pauw's favour. In a remarkable about-turn four years after the first reports the Supreme Court of Appeal found in Neethling's favour -- and ""Vrye Weekblad"" was shut down.

In an interview with News24's Pieter-Louis Myburgh on Tuesday, Pauw said that Du Preez joked that ""The President's Keepers"" is his (Pauw's) third stint doing national service. ""This first was in the army, the second was on 'Vrye Weekblad' . . . this is the third!""

Es wird früher dunkel und die Temperaturen sinken. Langsam aber sicher wird es Winter. Am Wochenende könnte in den niederen Lagen in Deutschland der erste Schnee fallen. Schon prophezeien einige Wetterforscher den kältesten Winter aller Zeiten. Das ist zwar schwierig vorauszusagen - einen Ausblick auf den Winter 2017 kann man aber trotzdem wagen.

Die letzten Winter in Deutschland waren langweilig. Nie wurde es richtig kalt und Schnee gab es so gut wie keinen. Selbst in den Alpen musste man teilweise lange auf Schnee warten.

Eiskalte Schneewinter erst ab 2021

Der Hauptantrieb des Klimas auf der Erde schwächelt gewaltig: Die Sonnenaktivität ist so schwach, wie seit über 100 Jahren nicht mehr. Der aktuelle Sonnenzyklus nähert sich somit seinem Minimum. Daher steigt die Gefahr eines kalten Winters deutlich.

Aber man muss auch sagen, dass die wirklichen eiskalten Schneewinter erst ab 2021, also nach dem nächsten Maximum zu erwarten sind.

Dementsprechend wird dieser Winter temperaturmäßig durchschnittlich. Also nicht zu kalt, aber auch nicht zu warm, wie die letzten Jahre. Die Chance auf Regen ist aber höher als normal und damit wird es mehr schneien.

Da die letzten Winter insgesamt zu warm und schneearm waren, kann man zusammenfassend sagen, dass wir in Deutschland den kältesten und schneereichsten Winter seit mindestens fünf Jahren erwarten.

Il comunismo, rimasto orfano persino nella sua terra natale, ancora attuale nel 2017. Domanda: ne è proprio sicuro? ""Otto persone detengono la ricchezza di tre miliardi di persone, la metà della popolazione mondiale. È evidente l'allargamento della forbice sociale e la necessità di un ritorno al socialismo"". Quel socialismo bolscevico che anche in Russia è stato negli anni profondamente rivisto e che in molti, lo 'zar' Vladimir Putin in testa, vorrebbero cancellare dalla memoria collettiva. ""Non ho ben capito, cosa c'è da festeggiare?"", ha detto il portavoce del Cremlino Dmitry Peskov qualche giorno fa.

In epoca sovietica il 7 novembre di ogni anno la rivoluzione d'ottobre veniva celebrata in modo solenne con parate militari e vari eventi pubblici. Dopo il crollo dell'Urss i festeggiamenti sono stati interrotti. Il partito comunista russo - che ancora venera il sanguinario Stalin - continua però a commemorare l'ascesa al potere dei bolscevichi: un fatto storico che adesso divide la società russa. Tra chi la rivendica, come gli attivisti di ""Altra Russia"" di Eduard Limonov, che oggi a Ekaterinburg hanno provato a incendiare il monumento dedicato a Boris Eltsin, primo presidente russo e fautore del crollo dell'Urss; e chi invece vorrebbe offuscarla.

Non a caso, sulla piazza Rossa un'altra manifestazione ha rubato la scena alla commemorazione della rivoluzione sovietica: la parata militare per commemorare la marcia (voluta da Stalin il 7 novembre del 1941) dei soldati che partirono da Mosca per la linea del fronte a soli 30 km, per respingere l'avanzata nazista durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Nella narrativa ufficiale del Cremlino non è più la Rivoluzione bolscevica la festa centrale del calendario laico, ma la vittoria sul nazismo, che si celebra il 9 maggio.

Marco Rizzo ha partecipato a entrambe le commemorazioni tenutesi a Mosca, e ne ha organizzata una terza che si terrà sul suolo italiano: ""Sabato 11 novembre a Roma marcerà il Corteo Nazionale di giovani e lavoratori"". Appuntamento alle 16, al Colosseo.","Bandiere sovietiche, ritratti di Lenin e Stalin: i comunisti ""invadono"" Mosca per il centenario della Rivoluzione d'Ottobre",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/11/07/bandiere-sovietiche-e-ritratti-di-lenin-e-stalin-i-comunisti-invadono-mosca-per-il-centenario-della-rivoluzione-dottobre-di-c-paudice_a_23269503/

The union said that the roles include engineering and jobs on the London Underground.

Up to 1,400 job losses are planned at Transport for London because of spending cuts, the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has said.

Mick Cash, RMT general secretary, said: “All the Tube and TfL unions have been sent written details of the next phase in the wrongly named transformation process.

“As part of the Mayor’s efforts to slash spending by £5.5 billion by 2021 we are now being told that the company plan to cut up to 1,400 jobs in engineering in TfL and in some areas of LU.

“RMT demands that no cuts take place, so close to the King’s Cross fire anniversary. It would be appalling if there was any hacking back on safety.

“The Mayor needs to stand up for TfL and demand restoration of the full capital grant and proper central government funding for the Tube.”

A TfL spokesperson said in a statement: “We are undertaking the largest ever overhaul of our organisation to provide the most efficient and cost effective transport service for Londoners.

“We have already reduced management layers and bureaucracy and merged functions in other areas to eliminate duplication and reliance on expensive agency staff.

“We do not recognise the RMT’s number. Over the next few months we will be consulting on further plans in a number of other managerial, support and other non-frontline areas across TfL and London Underground.

Dozenten haben es oft nicht leicht. Sie stecken Mühe und Arbeit in den Unterricht ihrer Studenten und letztlich wird ihnen oft nur mit schlechten Testergebnissen gedankt. Es ist daher wohl nachvollziehbar, dass der ein oder andere Professor frustriert ist.

In Los Angeles brachte die Frustration einen Professor jetzt sogar wortwörtlich dazu, sich in einen Sarg zu legen.

“Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht”

Nachdem eine Klausur schlecht ausgefallen ist, ließ er sich nämlich etwas ziemlich Erschreckendes für seine Studenten einfallen. Er legte sich in einen Sarg, der im Hörsaal aufgestellt wurde. Seine Erklärung: “Eure Testergebnisse waren zum Sterben schlecht.”

Einer seiner Studenten, Mario, hielt den Streich des Lehrers auf einem Foto fest und teilte dieses auf Twitter.

""Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein""

Hunderttausende Twitter-User waren begeistert von der Aktion des Dozenten und teilten und kommentierten den Post. Das Foto sorgte allerdings auch für viel Verwirrung. So wunderten sich einige, woher er den Sarg hatte und wie er ihn in den Hörsaal der Universität gebracht hat.

“Sind Särge nicht ziemlich teuer? Oder kann man die heutzutage auch mieten? Ich habe so viele Fragen”, schrieb zum Beispiel ein Twitter-Nutzer. Andere applaudieren dem Professor und merken anerkennend an: “Mein Ziel im Leben ist es, so dramatisch wie er zu sein.”

Auf die Anfrage der HuffPost, um welchen Kurs es sich handelte und wie schlecht die Ergebnisse genau waren, äußerte sich der Student, der mit seinem Foto einen Viralhit landete, bisher noch nicht.

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

지난주 O’natural에서는 파리 자연주의자 연합의 프라이빗 점심 파티가 열렸다. 이후 이 식당은 정식으로 문을 열었다. 소지품을 맡기려면 문 입구에서 휴대품 보관소를 이용할 수 있다. 가릴 것을 원한다면 냅킨을 제공한다. 40석 규모의 이 식당은 세 가지 요리가 나오는 코스를 제공한다. 가격은 39유로(34파운드)부터다.

만약 저녁먹으러 파리까지 가기 너무 멀다해도 실망은 이르다. 분야디가 런던에 다시 문을 열기 위해 투자자를 모집하고 있기 때문이다. 이번에는 정식으로 문을 열 계획이다.

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.","After four years of undergraduate education and another three at law school, Sarah Spitz landed a job she loves — and a debt load she resents.

Sarah Spitz is among the ranks of people who have grown to resent their ""good"" debt.

The notions of ""good debt"" and ""bad debt"" are a kind of investors' shorthand for understanding whether the kind of borrowing they're doing is likely to pay off in the longer term.

Student debt is generally considered ""good"" debt: it allows borrowers to increase their income in the long run. But as countless former students struggling with debt can tell you, paying down even a ""good"" debt can be a source of stress and financial difficulty.

""Sure, I'm increasing my earning potential by a lot, but it also really affected my 20s,"" Spitz told HuffPost Canada. ""And it's really anxiety-inducing to look at your bank statement and the column that's negative $80,000 — you're like, oh my God, that's soul-crushing.""

THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF GOOD AND BAD DEBT Traditionally, ""good debt"" is the sort that helps you gain wealth or income, while bad debt is money spent on goods that are consumed over time. Here's a breakdown of what is generally considered ""good"" debt and ""bad"" debt: GOOD DEBT Mortgages help you build equity in real estate, making you wealthier over time

In Canada, as in most of the developed world, the largest source of ""good"" debt is the mortgage.

Canadians are almost unequivocal in their support of mortgages. In a 2013 poll from the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals, 80 per cent of Canadians agreed that mortgages are ""good debt.""

But a recent survey from Angus Reid found half of Canada's home-owning young adults are experiencing buyer's remorse, with the high cost of servicing that debt as the single largest reason.

In other words, ""good debt"" can go bad, especially if you have more of it than you can handle — financially, or psychologically.

""There's no such thing as good or bad debt,"" says Doug Hoyes, co-founder of debt management firm Hoyes, Michalos & Associates.

Asking whether debt is bad or good ""is like asking 'Is bread good or bad,'"" he says. ""That's a silly question. What matters is, what's good for you?""

You may think that borrowing on a credit card to pay for a vacation is bad debt, ""but maybe a vacation is very important for your mental health,"" he says.

The Bank of Canada recently raised interest rates for the first time in seven years. Here's how that could affect your debt:

Hoyes warns that there is risk in taking to heart the notion that some types of debt are ""good"" — it can lead to irresponsible borrowing.

""If you believe a mortgage is good debt, you might spend as much as you can on a house,"" he said in an interview with HuffPost Canada.

Could that be part of the reason why Canadians have been willing to take on so much mortgage debt? With around $1.67 in debt for every dollar of disposable income, households here are the most indebted of any G7 country. And the Bank of Canada has been raising the alarm about the growing ranks of ""highly indebted"" consumers — those whose debt exceeds their annual income by more than 450 per cent.

""Households carrying high levels of debt could find it more difficult to adjust to a loss in income or other financial shock,"" the bank warned in December. ""They may be forced to sharply cut back on their spending and, in severe cases, may default on loans. The consequences for the economy and the financial system could be significant.""

So there you have it: you could even harm the economy taking on too much ""good debt.""

Determining the ""right"" amount of debt

But how do you know when if your ""good"" debt is actually bad?

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt,"" says Avraham Byers, a personal finance trainer and blogger.

His definition of good debt is different from the traditional model. For him, it's ""a balance you can comfortably pay every month, at a reasonable rate.""

He says there are many ""grey areas"" when it comes to debt. For instance, a car loan may be considered bad debt because vehicles depreciate in value (often losing a quarter to a third the moment you drive it off the lot), but what if a car is your only option for getting to work, and you don't have enough to buy in cash? Then, suddenly, an auto loan can look like good debt.

Personal finance coach Avraham Byers says you can tell you have too much debt if payments start eating into your lifestyle.

Or borrowing money for home renovations. Many argue it's good debt because it increases the value of your home.

""I don't know if that's true, especially if you plan to continue living there in the future,"" says Byers.

He suggests a rule of thumb for debt: Your monthly payments should be no more than 25 per cent of your monthly income before taxes.

""When it edges into your lifestyle, you have too much debt."" Avraham Byers, personal finance trainer

Banks are often willing to lend you up to 36 per cent of your income, but he suggests not leaving it to them to decide.

""Banks might think you can handle it but it might not be true,"" Byers says. ""You've got to be realistic with what you can afford.""

For her part, Spitz says her experience with student debt will make her more cautious taking on debt in the future.

""I'm definitely more apprehensive than I would have been,"" she said. ""It's one thing to think about being in debt in the abstract, and a very different thing to experience it.""

Ο John Galsworthy* είχε πει πως: «Ο ιδεαλισμός αυξάνεται ευθέως ανάλογα με την απόσταση που έχει κανείς από το πρόβλημα».

Και δεν είχε καθόλου άδικο**. Οι εκφράσεις αυτού, άλλωστε, είναι διάσπαρτες στην καθημερινότητά μας και εύκολο να εντοπιστούν.

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να γνωρίζει προβλήματα και λύσεις για καταστάσεις που εξελίσσονται μακριά του και δεν τον αφορούν άμεσα, από τον πόλεμο στο Αφγανιστάν και τις τρομοκρατικές επιθέσεις στην Ευρώπη, έως την κλυδωνιζόμενη οικονομία της Κίνας και τα τεκταινόμενα στην Αμερικανική πολιτική σκηνή;

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να υποστηρίζει με θέρμη (αδιαπραγμάτευτα θα έλεγε κανείς) ένα ευρύ σύνολο αρχών/αξιών, από την αριστεία και την αξιοκρατία (σ.σ. δύο από τις πιο γλυκιές «ιδεολογικές καραμέλες» της εποχής μας), έως την ελευθερία της έκφρασης και την ελευθερία της αυτοδιάθεσης;

Πόσες φορές δεν έχετε συναντήσει κάποιον ο οποίος εμφανίζεται να είναι άτεγκτος έναντι αυτών που έχουν οδηγήσει στον εκμαυλισμό του σύγχρονου βίου, από τους λαοπλάνους και τους διεφθαρμένους πολιτικούς, έως τους φοροφυγάδες και τους ανεπαρκείς δημόσιους λειτουργούς;



Και πόσες φορές, ανατρέχοντας με ειλικρίνεια στη δική σας συμπεριφορά, δεν έχετε υπάρξει εσείς αυτό ο «κάποιος»;

Η σημασία την εν λόγω στάσης, καθώς και των προεκτάσεων που αυτή έχει στη ζωή του σύγχρονου ανθρώπου, είναι δύσκολο να αναλυθεί σε ένα τόσο σύντομο κείμενο. Μία σχετικά «αθώα» έκφανσή της, ωστόσο, μπορεί να αναγνωριστεί στην προσωπική ιστορία μίας παλαιότερη συζήτησης που είχα με τον παππού μου, η οποία και ακολουθεί.

Ο παππούς Χρήστος, συνταξιούχος δάσκαλος, ετών 90 σήμερα, υπήρξε - με βάση όχι μόνο της οικογενείας αλλά κυρίως έξωθεν μαρτυρίες - υπόδειγμα δασκάλου στο Νομό Γρεβενών όπου και υπηρέτησε. Άτεγκτος, ευσυνείδητος, διατελέσας Επιθεωρητής... Δε σήκωνε μύγα στο σπαθί του ως δάσκαλος, δικαιολογημένα, και ακόμη δε σηκώνει.

Κάποια χρόνια μετά το ξεκίνημα της κρίσης, λοιπόν, κι ενώ έβλεπε τη σύνταξη του να μειώνεται με εκθετικό ρυθμό μου είπε σε μια κουβέντα μας: «Ας τις μειώσουν κι άλλο τις συντάξεις αν είναι να πάει καλύτερα το κράτος... Εμείς ως δάσκαλοι, ενώ με τους μισθούς μας απλά ζούσαμε αξιοπρεπώς (σ.σ. η αναφορά αφορά τις δεκαετίες του '50-'70), με τις συντάξεις μας κάναμε σπίτια, αγοράσαμε αυτοκίνητα, βοηθήσαμε παιδιά κι εγγόνια...Ας τις μειώσουν κι άλλο.»

Παππού του λέω μετά από σύντομη σκέψη...«Αν όπως λες όλα αυτά τα χρόνια παίρνατε υψηλές συντάξεις, δυσανάλογες δηλαδή των εισφορών σας, και αύριο βγει μια απόφαση που θα λέει ότι δικαιούσασταν αρκετά χαμηλότερες, όσες οι τωρινές, και σας ζητήσει το κράτος να επιστρέψετε αναδρομικά τα πλεονάσματα που έχετε λάβει, θα τα δώσεις; Έχεις να τα δώσεις;»

Κάπου εκεί σάστισε και χαμογέλασε αμήχανα, καταλαβαίνοντας τι ήθελα να του πω.

Στην ιστορία που σας μετέφερα ο παππούς μου διατύπωσε μία άποψη κινούμενος από τη διάθεσή του να συνεισφέρει ώστε να βελτιωθούν τα δημόσια οικονομικά. Ακόμη και στην περίπτωση αυτή, όμως, στην οποία ο ίδιος έβαζε το προσωπικό του οικονομικό συμφέρον κάτω από αυτό του συνόλου, το έως ποιο βαθμό ήταν διατεθειμένος να φτάσει είναι και αυτό που αγγίζει την ουσία του ζητήματος στο οποίο αναφέρθηκε μέσω του γνωμικού του ο Galsworthy. Σε μια - όπως προείπα - σχετικά «αθώα» έκφανσή του με πολλά θετικά στοιχεία.

Επεκτείνοντας ωστόσο αυτή τη συλλογιστική, είναι εύκολο να διακρίνουμε και ένα βασικότατο μας πρόβλημα ως πολίτες και ως άνθρωποι. Το γεγονός, δηλαδή, ότι ιδεολογούμε και επιχειρηματολογούμε με χαρακτηριστικά μεγαλύτερη ευκολία από όση θα έπρεπε να μας επιτρέπει η διάθεσή μας να συμβάλλουμε στην αλλαγή της υφιστάμενης κατάστασης. Όχι από πονηρία, ατιμία ή ανικανότητα πάντα, αλλά αρκετές φορές και μόνο από την απλή αδυναμία μας να έρθουμε κοντά στο πρόβλημα, να το σκεφτούμε σαν να είναι δικό μας, και να βάλουμε τους εαυτούς μας στη θέση του συνόλου αυτών που καλούνται να το αντιμετωπίσουν.

Να το θέσουμε ακόμη απλούστερα και προσαρμοσμένο στην καθημερινότητά μας;



Είσαι υπέρ της αριστείας;



Επίλεξέ την όταν ως επιχειρηματίας επιλέγεις συνεργάτες ή εργαζομένους, όταν ως πελάτης επιλέγεις προμηθευτές, όταν ως επαγγελματίας συναγωνίζεται με καλύτερούς σου.

Είσαι υπέρ της αξιοκρατίας;



Στήριξέ την σε κάθε περίπτωση, ακόμη και όταν θα αφορά τους φίλους σου, τα παιδιά σου, ή κι εσένα τον ίδιο.

Είσαι υπέρ της δίκαιης φορολόγησης;



Μη φοροδιαφεύγεις και επίμενε στην τήρηση της ορθής φορολογικής συμπεριφοράς από όλους, ανεξάρτητα από το όποιο βραχυπρόθεσμο δικό σου όφελος.

Είσαι υπέρ της κοινωνικής δικαιοσύνης;



Απαίτησε την ανάλογη στάση από τους πολιτικούς σου, τους συνεργάτες σου, τους φίλους σου, την οικογένειά σου, και μην ψάχνεις «παραθυράκια» για να δικαιολογήσεις την αδικία όταν άμεσα ή έμμεσα σε ευνοεί.

Οι φίλοι μας οι Αμερικανοί μέσα στον (υπέρμετρο) υλισμό τους θέτουν το όλο ζήτημα αρκετά εύστοχα.

«Put your money where your mouth is», λένε, με το «money» να χρησιμοποιείται κυριολεκτικά όσο και μεταφορικά.

Αν θέλουμε δε να κάνουμε αναφορά και στο ελληνικό δαιμόνιο (sic) επάνω στην παραγωγή συνθημάτων, μπορούμε να ανατρέξουμε στην παλαιότερη τηλεοπτική διαφήμιση τσίχλας η οποία κατέληγε πως:

""Μερικές φορές είναι καλύτερο να μασάς παρά να μιλάς"".

Madikizela, who rose to prominence at the Eastern Cape's elective conference last month, said there were talks within branches to nominate Mkhize for deputy.

""He is one of the leaders who are not tainted. It's easy to decipher that he can provide leadership by his track record in KZN and nationally. We would like him to be the deputy. The majority of branches in the Eastern Cape, we are told, will nominate him,"" he said.

Branches in the province are still voting on their preferred candidates for the ANC's top six and NEC members. The national office set November 15 as its deadline for nominations at respective branch general meetings.

Madikizela is a known supporter of Mkhize in the province.

His region, Alfred Nzo, had lobbied for Mkhize to succeed Zuma but was beaten by an overwhelming majority at the party's provincial elective conference in October.

""The region where I come from had a position that it has pronounced to support Mkhize to take over but we equally agreed that we will lobby and we will be lobbied. We were persuaded by the popular view of the province that we will all support Ramaphosa.""

Mkhize has emerged as a potential successor to Zuma, who is due to step down as ANC leader in December.

He has won slight support in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga - two provinces with the biggest number of ANC members.

The KZN has the biggest voting delegates with 870 members who will be attending the December elective conference.

Mpumalanga replaced the Eastern Cape with 736 delegates making it the second biggest province with voting members.

Reacting to these figures, Madikizela said the Eastern Cape must learn from its counterpart.

He said the province with its eight regions was bested by a province with only four regions.

In der Chenery Street in San Francisco steht ein Haus, das auf den ersten Blick wie ein gewöhnliches Reihenhaus aussieht. Doch dieser Eindruck täuscht - hinter der Fassade des Hauses versteckt sich mehr. Das Haupthaus erstreckt sich auf drei Gebäudeeinheiten, die an die Straße angrenzen.

Wenn man es betritt, könnte man meinen, in einer Villa aus einem James Bond-Film zu sein.

Das Haupthaus sieht nämlich aus wie ein eindrucksvoller Palast – mit Glasdach und einem Swimmingpool im Speisesaal. Im Hauptgebäude sind Buntglasfenster der ehemaligen Kirche Little Sisters of the Poor verbaut.

Das Haus wurde im Jahr 1987 erbaut

Das Glasdach der Villa lässt sich zudem zur Seite fahren, damit die Sonnenstrahlen auch ungefiltert in das Innere des Hauses fallen können. Im Hauptgebäude befinden sich fünf Schlafzimmer und genauso viele Bäder. Im Obergeschoss der Villa hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline von San Francisco.

Despite Ferrero's reassurances that the new recipe shouldn't affect the quality or taste of Nutella, some consumers weren't buying it.
Nutella have changed the recipe!
If we were to name this spread appropriately, we might call it 'sugar palm oil spread,' but that doesn't have the right ring to it.
Another reason why Nutella shouldn't be eaten for breakfast?","For all you Nutella fans out there, take a deep breath... it's going to be OK.

Ferrero, the company that owns Nutella, has secretly updated the recipe for the hazelnut-chocolate spread, according to a report in the Independent. The big change? They're now adding more sugar and powdered skimmed milk.

Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg, (the Hamburg Consumer Protection Centre), posted information about the change to the recipe on their Facebook page, noting that the sugar content has gone up from 55.9 per cent to 56.3 per cent and the skimmed milk powder from 7.5 per cent to 8.7 per cent. They also reveal that the fat content has been reduced to 30.9 per cent from 31.8 per cent.

""Since the colour of the new Nutella is brighter, we assume that more milk powder was added at the expense of cocoa,"" Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg noted in their Facebook post. ""Obviously, Ferrero does not want to grant its customers too much transparency.""

They added, ""Whether or not the contents of other ingredients such as sugar or palm oil have been altered remains unclear.""

As a result, Nutella fans (who knew they were so devoted?) shared their wrath and disappointment on social media.

Some couldn't believe Ferrero would even dare mess with their recipe.

Ferrero issued a statement confirming that an ""adjustment"" had been made to the recipe but added that many brands do the same to their products, reports Sky News.

""The quality... and all other aspects of Nutella remain the same,"" the company said.

Despite Ferrero's reassurances that the new recipe shouldn't affect the quality or taste of Nutella, some consumers weren't buying it.

And some urged others to boycott the brand.

As if #Nutella wasn't bad enough yet, there's more milk in it now, more fat, less cacao. & Still palm oil.

Choose a different brand, people! — Stephanie (@highonmusic1) November 5, 2017

One informed Twitter user even posted a photo of what Nutella looks like in its ingredient form, in an attempt to urge people to pick something healthier to eat.

What a #Nutella jar looks like when deconstructed. Should be called fatty sugar spread really. pic.twitter.com/EagPLjMXhc — Didier Bourguignon (@ddabourguignon) November 7, 2017

Despite the sugar and saturated fat, there are some, albeit small, health benefits to eating Nutella (in small doses, that is).

The spread contains key vitamins and minerals that are essential for good health, such as fibre, which can help lower cholesterol levels, and iron and calcium, according to SFGate. Hazelnuts have also been shown to be good for the heart.

On the other hand, it's all that sugar and saturated fat that make Nutella a snack that shouldn't be eaten on the regular.

Meghan Telpner, a nutritionist, advised that Nutella shouldn't be served as breakfast, noting that the spread contains 70 per cent saturated fat and processed sugar by weight, 15mg of sodium, and ""just two sad little grams of protein per serving.""

""Despite the lovely visual of hazelnuts tumbling across the screen in the television commercial, the first ingredient in Nutella is plain old, white, refined, most likely GMO sugar,"" Telpner writes on her website.

""Hazelnuts make their appearance after sugar and palm oil. If we were to name this spread appropriately, we might call it 'sugar palm oil spread,' but that doesn't have the right ring to it. Unless you're choosing to hop off your health train while on holidays in Paris, there's no reason to choose Nutella for breakfast.""

Another reason why Nutella shouldn't be eaten for breakfast? Spiking blood sugar levels. Meaning if your kids are eating the spread, you (and your kids' teachers!) are in for a major headache.

""High sugar intake first thing in the morning will spike blood sugar levels, resulting in a plummet mid morning and contribute to poor concentration, hyper activity and aggression,"" Telpner notes.

Es wird früher dunkel und die Temperaturen sinken. Langsam aber sicher wird es Winter. Am Wochenende könnte in den niederen Lagen in Deutschland der erste Schnee fallen. Schon prophezeien einige Wetterforscher den kältesten Winter aller Zeiten. Das ist zwar schwierig vorauszusagen - einen Ausblick auf den Winter 2017 kann man aber trotzdem wagen.

Die letzten Winter in Deutschland waren langweilig. Nie wurde es richtig kalt und Schnee gab es so gut wie keinen. Selbst in den Alpen musste man teilweise lange auf Schnee warten.

Eiskalte Schneewinter erst ab 2021

Der Hauptantrieb des Klimas auf der Erde schwächelt gewaltig: Die Sonnenaktivität ist so schwach, wie seit über 100 Jahren nicht mehr. Der aktuelle Sonnenzyklus nähert sich somit seinem Minimum. Daher steigt die Gefahr eines kalten Winters deutlich.

Aber man muss auch sagen, dass die wirklichen eiskalten Schneewinter erst ab 2021, also nach dem nächsten Maximum zu erwarten sind.

Dementsprechend wird dieser Winter temperaturmäßig durchschnittlich. Also nicht zu kalt, aber auch nicht zu warm, wie die letzten Jahre. Die Chance auf Regen ist aber höher als normal und damit wird es mehr schneien.

Da die letzten Winter insgesamt zu warm und schneearm waren, kann man zusammenfassend sagen, dass wir in Deutschland den kältesten und schneereichsten Winter seit mindestens fünf Jahren erwarten.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who made the observation, also said even an accidental physical contact, though unwelcome, would not amount to sexual harassment.
""Similarly, a physical contact that has no undertone of a sexual nature and is not occasioned by the gender of the complainant may not necessarily amount to sexual harassment,"" the court said.
The woman had contended that any unwelcome physical contact would amount to sexual harassment.
Agreeing with the committee's finding, the High Court said, ""Undoubtedly, physical contact or advances would constitute sexual harassment provided such physical contact is a part of the sexually determined behaviour.","ADVERTISEMENT

NEW DELHI -- All unwelcome physical contact cannot be called sexual harassment unless it is in the nature of a sexually oriented behaviour, the Delhi High Court has said.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who made the observation, also said even an accidental physical contact, though unwelcome, would not amount to sexual harassment.

""Similarly, a physical contact that has no undertone of a sexual nature and is not occasioned by the gender of the complainant may not necessarily amount to sexual harassment,"" the court said.

The observations by the Bench came during the hearing of an appeal by a Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) scientist challenging the clean chit given by the complaints committee and disciplinary authority to her former senior colleague, whom she had accused of sexual harassment.

Both of them were working in the CRRI, which is a part of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).

The allegation pertained to an incident of April 2005 when the man had entered the laboratory where the woman was working and had snatched samples from her hand, thrown the materials and pushed her out of the room.

The woman had contended that any unwelcome physical contact would amount to sexual harassment.

The Complaints Committee after examining her complaint had concluded that ""it was a case of altercation in the background of the uncongenial environment prevailing in the division.""

Terming the man's conduct as deplorable, it had also said while there was evidence of physical contact by the man, ""the same was not a sexually determined behaviour but was in the nature of an altercation.""

The disciplinary authority had accepted the committee's report and passed an order in October 2009 giving clean chit to the man accused of sexual harassment.

Agreeing with the committee's finding, the High Court said, ""Undoubtedly, physical contact or advances would constitute sexual harassment provided such physical contact is a part of the sexually determined behaviour. Such physical contact must be in the context of a behaviour which is sexually oriented.""

The court also rejected the woman's challenge to the constitution of the committee and the disciplinary authority, saying it finds no infirmity in their set-up.

Besonders die Kfz-Versicherung geht ins Geld und das ist auch kein Wunder: Verlangen die Versicherungsgesellschaften doch gerade bei jungen Fahrern happige Prämien. Was also kannst du tun, um einen guten Versicherungsschutz zum günstigen Preis bekommen? Gemeinsam mit unserem Partner Allianz haben wir für dich die 6 wichtigsten Tipps zusammengestellt.

Tipp 1: Melde dein Auto als Zweitwagen deiner Eltern an

Wenn du deinen Führerschein erst seit Kurzem besitzt, wirst du automatisch in eine niedrige und damit teure Schadensfreiheitsklasse (SF) eingestuft. SF 0 bedeutet: Entweder, Du hast Deinen Führerschein erst weniger als drei Jahre. Oder Du hast ihn zwar länger, aber bist noch kein einziges Jahr schadensfrei gefahren, SF 1 bedeutet: Du bist erst ein Jahr schadensfrei geblieben. SF 2 bedeutet, Du bist seit zwei Jahren schadensfrei unterwegs, SF 3, seit drei Jahren und so weiter. Mit jedem unfallfreien Jahr steigt deine Schadensfreiheitsklasse um eine Stufe; und je höher die Schadensfreiheitsklasse, desto größer fällt der Rabatt auf deine Versicherungsprämien aus. Als Führerscheinneuling musst du aber nicht zwangsläufig mit SF 0 beginnen: Du kannst dein Auto auch einfach als Zweitwagen deiner Eltern anmelden. Je nach Versicherer erhältst du dann SF 1/2 oder sogar SF 1 oder 2, ohne dass deine Eltern bei ihrem Erstfahrzeug dadurch einen Nachteil hätten. Dadurch kannst du Hunderte Euro sparen.

Tipp 2: Übernimm nach einigen Jahren die SF-Klasse deiner Eltern

Ewig musst du dein Fahrzeug nicht als Zweitwagen deiner Eltern laufen lassen. Nach wenigen Jahren kannst du das Fahrzeug ruhig auf dich selbst ummelden. Der Versicherer wird es dir ohne Weiteres ermöglichen, die Schadensfreiheitsklasse der einstigen Zweitwagen-Police dann auf deine eigene Police umzuschreiben. Einzige Voraussetzung: Besagte Zweitwagen-Police darf dann nicht mehr anderweitig gebraucht werden.

Tipp 3: Begleitetes Fahren bringt deutliche Kostenersparnis

Hast du deinen Führerschein schon mit 17 gemacht und nimmst du am Programm „Begleitetes Fahren“ teil? Oder bist du schon 18 und hast durch das „begleitete Fahren“ schon ein Jahr Fahrpraxis? Das solltest du der Versicherung unbedingt mitteilen. Denn bis zu 20 Prozent des Beitrags kannst du allein dadurch sparen. In Begleitung eines erfahrenen Erwachsenen ist aus Sicht des Versicherers die Wahrscheinlichkeit viel kleiner, dass du einen Unfall verursachst. Und mit einem Jahr Fahrpraxis ebenso. Im Zweitwagen-Tarif deiner Eltern kann die Ersparnis sogar noch weitaus größer ausfallen.

Tipp 4: Nutze die SF-Klasse von deinem Motorroller oder Leichtkraftrad

Angenommen, du hast schon einige Jahre Fahrpraxis aber eben mit dem Motorroller oder Motorrad mit 50 bis 125 Kubikzentimeter Hubraum. Dann kannst du die SF-Klasse aus dem betreffenden Versicherungsvertrag auf deine Kfz-Versicherung übertragen und musst ebenfalls nicht bei SF 0 beginnen. Dieser Tipp lohnt sich besonders, wenn du dein motorisiertes Zweirad nicht mehr brauchst. Denn der SF-Rabatt von dessen Police entfällt, wenn du ihn auf die Kfz-Police übertragen lässt.

Tipp 5: Meide typische Anfängerautos

Ford Fiesta, Opel Aguila, Fiat Panda, Skoda Fabia es gibt eine Reihe von typischen Anfängerautos. Bei der Auswertung der jährlichen Schadensstatistik fällt den Versicherern auf: Diese Fahrzeuge sind überdurchschnittlich häufig in Unfälle verwickelt, ganz einfach, weil ihre Halter noch nicht so routiniert im Straßenverkehr unterwegs sind wie langjährig geübte Kraftfahrer. Das aber heißt: Diese Autos landen in einer hohen Typklasse also just in der Kategorie von Autos, die wegen höherem Unfallrisiko teurer zu versichern sind. Aus diesem Grund lohnt es sich, typische Anfängerautos zu meiden. In Sachen Typklasse schau doch mal auf die Internetseite des Gesamtverbands der deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft. Da kannst du ausfindig machen, wie dein favorisierter Pkw eingestuft wird. Bei einer niedrigen Typklasse sind auch die Versicherungsprämien günstiger.

Tipp 6: „Pay as you drive“ - Geld sparen mit einem Telematik-Tarif

Bei jungen Fahrern weiß die Versicherung noch nicht, wie souverän sie sich im Straßenverkehr verhalten und welche Risiken sie eingehen. Aber es gibt eine ganz einfache Möglichkeit, sich diese Informationen ohne langjährige Fahrpraxis zu verschaffen: Indem du dich für einen Telematik-Tarif entscheidest. Dabei lädst du dir eine App vom Versicherer auf dein Handy - und die schreibt mit, wie du fährst. Deshalb werden solche Tarife auch häufig Pay-as-you-drive-Tarife genannt. Bis zu 40 Prozent des Beitrags kannst du damit sparen. Denn nur weil du jung bist, muss das noch lange nicht heißen, dass bei dir das Risiko besonders hoch wäre.

Übrigens: Ob Zweitwagenpolice, Familientarif oder Telematik - gerade Fahranfänger sind auf eine gute, leistungsstarke Versicherung angewiesen. Ein gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis bietet die Allianz, deren Tarife übrigens in keinem der gängigen Versicherungsvergleiche auftauchen. Sich da schlau zu machen, kann sich für dich in barer Münze auszahlen! Hier findest du weitere Informationen.

Wechsel noch bis zum 30.11. zur Allianz und erhalte 50 Euro Rabatt* sowie die Vorzüge eines einfachen Wechsels. Der Antragsprozess ist bereits nach wenigen Minuten abgeschlossen und Du machst einen Versicherer zu Deinem Partner, bei dem die Schadensabwicklung so unkompliziert und schnell ist wie der Wechsel.

Im Schadensfall ist die Allianz 24 Stunden erreichbar, bei einem Totalschaden oder Diebstahl (Teilkasko) erhältst Du bis zu 12 Monate Neu- und Kaufpreisentschädigung und auch ein Steinschlag ist ohne Selbstbeteiligung keine Kostenfalle mehr. Neben der völligen Absicherung, die auch Wildunfälle abdeckt, bietet die Allianz ein Mobilitätsversprechen.

Ce n'est pas moi qui pleurerai le sort de ce vestige de l'époque des commandites. La politique en général se portera mieux sans lui comme elle s'accommode très bien de l'évincement d'un Jean Charest.

Sans l'ombre d'un doute, l'élection de Valérie Plante à la mairie de Montréal provoque une certaine dose d'enthousiasme. D'abord (enfin, dira-t-on!) une femme à la tête de la métropole du Québec. Une femme de centre-gauche, progressiste, dont le CV n'est pas celui des hommes d'avant, ça fait du bien.

Le Québec en général avait besoin de ça, il avait besoin de ce sourire contagieux, de son débordement de joie le soir des élections. En 2012, la première femme a être élue à la tête du Québec n'a jamais pu vivre pleinement SON moment. On connaît les circonstances. Ça faisait du bien de voir Valérie Plante vivre le sien, dignement, pleinement.

Une fois l'adrénaline du moment de victoire passée, la nouvelle mairesse de Montréal devra faire face à l'ampleur de la tâche qui l'attend. Lundi, elle faisait la tournée des médias, un accueil poli, mais quelques questions plus serrées aussi.

Lors de son passage chez Mario Dumont notamment – où elle s'est très bien tirée d'affaire en passant – quand l'animateur la confrontait à la réaction un peu gênante du député Amir Khadir, de Québec Solidaire, par exemple. Ou quand Dumont l'a questionnée sur l'influence que pourrait avoir un « dangereux extrémiste » comme Luc Ferrandez; comme si Valérie Plante ne pouvait gouverner sans l'influence tacite d'un dauphin masculin... Dumont, lui-même plutôt porté sur la politique du siècle dernier justement.

Une chose est certaine, Valérie Plante devra répondre à quelques questions difficiles concernant la politique provinciale et les grands dossiers à propos desquels débattent les Québécois.

Une chose est certaine, Valérie Plante devra répondre à quelques questions difficiles concernant la politique provinciale et les grands dossiers à propos desquels débattent les Québécois. Ça vient avec la job, comme on dit!

Il sera intéressant de voir comment la nouvelle mairesse de Montréal jouera ses cartes à propos de la délicate question de la laïcité, sur la primauté du français notamment.

Sans l'ombre d'un doute, la position qu'elle occupe revêt le privilège d'une grande influence auprès du PM du Québec. Son prédécesseur Coderre l'avait bien compris.

L'année qui s'en vient sera cruciale et électorale au Québec et il serait surprenant que la mairesse de Montréal demeure coite en ces circonstances. Le PM Couillard fera tout pour éviter que certains thèmes s'imposent - ceux qui risquent de lui couter son poste - l'éthique en tête de liste.

Le PLQ fera tout pour que la prochaine élection porte plutôt sur une question comme le «racisme systémique» afin de diviser ses adversaires, de les laisser s'empêtrer dans ce bourbier. Nous le savons déjà. Et les réactions au projet de loi 62 nous indiquent clairement que la question de la laïcité sera exploitée par le camp libéral.

En campagne électorale, Valérie Plante a été questionnée par la presse et attaquée par son adversaire Coderre sur cette question. Lors du débat très suivi en anglais, Denis Coderre a poussé Valérie Plante dans les câbles sur cette question. Le PL62 est décrié dans la collectivité anglophone-allophone qui s'associe beaucoup plus à l'opinion du Canada anglais et au multiculturalisme sans limites.

Denis Coderre a rappelé qu'il s'était opposé au PL62 dès son adoption, car celui-ci allait trop loin et « brimait les libertés religieuses individuelles ». Valérie Plante a répliqué en insistant sur le fait qu'elle était aussi « fermement opposée au PL62 » pour les mêmes raisons.

Sur la laïcité, Valérie Plante se trouve donc à l'opposé du consensus qui rallie la majorité des Québécois, soit une législation qui inscrit le principe de la laïcité comme socle du vivre-ensemble et dont les principes se rapprochent de la proposition Bouchard-Taylor.

Les convictions personnelles du chef du PLQ sont compatibles avec celles de Coderre et Plante sur cette question.

Le PM du Québec pourrait trouver, à Montréal, une alliée de circonstance quand il cherchera des appuis sur le dossier de la laïcité. Les convictions personnelles du chef du PLQ sont compatibles avec celles de Coderre et Plante sur cette question. Fin calculateur et connaissant surtout que les accointances politiques connues de la mairesse avec Québec solidaire, une formation politique qui ne daignerait pas profiter du coup de pouce électoral, Philippe Couillard n'hésitera pas une seconde à planter cette question dans la prochaine campagne électorale.

Sur la question linguistique, aussi, la mairesse de la métropole aura son mot à dire. Depuis le début de son mandat, Philippe Couillard insiste sur la nécessité que le Québec adopte une politique linguistique qui fasse toujours plus de place à l'anglais et au bilinguisme.

En campagne électorale à Montréal, Valérie Plante a adopté à peu de choses près la même position que Denis Coderre sur cette question. Bilinguisme dans le métro, des services anglophones dans les arrondissements où l'anglais est la langue d'usage de la majorité tout en conservant le statut francophone de la métropole. On imagine mal qu'un ou une candidat à la mairie de Montréal puisse l'emporter sans se rendre attrayant pour ce segment de la population de la métropole.

Valérie Plante, lors de ses rencontres avec les médias anglophones, a tenu à rassurer cette collectivité, rien dans son programme n'allait plonger Montréal dans une crise linguistique, loin de là!

Pourtant, si l'on poursuit la même politique linguistique que celle qui a cours à Montréal en ce moment, il est inévitable que la métropole perde son statut de ville majoritairement francophone à court ou moyen terme. Pour la vitalité du français au Québec, le statu quo linguistique à Montréal est intolérable et un raffermissement du statut du français doit être envisagé. Notamment en ce qui a trait à la francisation des nouveaux arrivants – surtout que l'écrasante majorité de ceux-ci s'installent à Montréal et sa première couronne.

Ici encore, le chef du PLQ (et la direction bicéphale Qsiste) trouvera plus facilement une alliée à Montréal que François Legault ou Jean-François Lisée.

En ce sens, il sera intéressant de voir si Valérie Plante sera la mairesse de la continuité sur ces délicates questions (laïcité, identité, multiculturalisme et langue) auquel cas sa gouvernance ne fera que continuer à creuser l'abysse qui sépare de plus en plus la métropole du « Rest of Québec »...

7일부터 1박2일로 예정된 도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령의 국빈 방문에서 가장 관심을 끄는 장면 가운데 하나는 가수 박효신 씨의 ‘야생화’를 듣고 그가 어떤 반응을 보일지다.

문재인 대통령 부부와 트럼프 대통령 부부가 7일 저녁 만찬장에서 가수 박효신 씨가 부르는 ‘야생화’를 비롯한 특별 공연을 감상할 예정이라는 사실이 알려졌기 때문이다. 과연 한국의 ‘소몰이 창법’은 트럼프에게 통할까?

아울러 트럼프 미국 대통령의 진짜 음악 취향은 어떨까에도 관심이 쏠린다. 트럼프의 음악 취향은 2016년 미국 대선을 치르면서 캠페인 노래의 선정 과정 등을 통해 적나라하게 드러난 바 있다. 그런데 의외의 플레이 리스트가 눈길을 끌었다.

우선 그가 직접 관여했다고 보도(뉴요커)된 2016 대선 캠페인에 사용된 노래 리스트를 살펴보면, 푸치니의 ‘Nessun Dorma’, 비틀스의 ‘Hey Jude’, 트위스티드 시스터스의 ‘We’re Gonna Take It’ 등 한국인도 듣기만 하면 알 정도의 명곡들이 주를 이루고 있다. 특히 ‘록 음악’ 장르가 강세를 보인다.

롤링스톤 매거진 역시 트럼프가 과거 에어로 스미스, 엘튼 존, 폴 매카트니 등을 언급했다며 ‘그의 취향은 클래식 록에 치우쳐 있다’고 전한 바 있다.

이 리스트에서 눈에 띄는 또 다른 한 가지는 영국의 록 밴드 롤링스톤스의 노래가 세 곡(‘Sympathy for the Devil’, ‘You Can't Always Get What You Want’, ‘Brown Sugar’)이나 포함되어 있다는 사실이다. 비즈니스인사이더는 “공화당 전당대회에서 트럼프가 롤링스톤스의 노래 ’Start Me Up’이 나오자 춤을 추기도 했다”고 보도하기도 했다.

아래 영상에서 해당 장면의 춤사위를 볼 수 있다.

Here's Trump dancing to the Rolling Stones after his rally tonight in North Carolina. pic.twitter.com/jcPcnMvrXo — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) 2016년 3월 10일

트럼프의 록 음악 사랑은 정치적 성향을 초월하기도 한다. 트럼프는 캐나다를 대표하는 진보 성향의 로커 닐 영에 대한 애정을 여러 차례 드러낸 바 있다. 예를 들어, 2006년 뉴욕 콘서트장을 찾은 그는 롤링스톤 매거진에 “닐 영에겐 정말 특별한 뭔가가 있다”며 “그의 목소리는 완벽하고 잊을 수 없을 만큼 매혹적이다”라는 코멘트를 남겼다.

트럼프가 록 음악만 좋아하는 것은 아니다. 그는 자신의 저서 '백만장자처럼 생각하라'에서 프랭크 시나트라, 토니 베넷, 엘튼 존의 음악이 “위대하다”며 “그들의 음악에 질린 적도 없고 앞으로도 질리지 않을 것”이라고 밝힌 바 있다.

종합해보면, 트럼프는 당대에 가치를 인정받고 시대의 유행에 상관없이 꾸준히 사랑받는 작품, 즉 ‘클래식’을 좋아한다고 아주 넓게 표현할 수 있다. 트럼프는 자신의 캠페인 리스트에 아델의 노래를 두 곡이나 넣고, 자신의 저서에서 ‘에미넴을 좋아한다’고 밝히기도 했는데 이 역시 같은 맥락에서 해석할 수 있다.

트럼프는 자신의 이러한 안전한 취향에 대해 남들이 잔소리하는 걸 꽤나 싫어한다. BBC 보도를 보면, 트럼프는 자신의 저서 '백만장자처럼 생각하라'에서 “트럼프 타워에는 ‘Moon River’의 연주곡부터 라흐마니노프의 피아노 콘체르토까지 다양한 노래들을 틀어 놓는데 누군가는 이걸 저급하다고 하는 모양이다”라며 “그러나 나를 포함한 다른 사람들은 좋아한다”고 밝힌 바 있다.

또 그는 같은 책에서 “다른 사람이 당신의 취향에 영향을 끼치도록 하지 말라”며 “당신이 좋아하는 게 최고“라고 취향에 대한 자신감을 강조했다.

트럼프의 음악에 대한 열정은 어린 시절부터 남달랐다. 그는 저서 '거래의 기술'에서 초등학교 2학년 때 음악선생이 음악에 대해서 “아무것도 모른다”는 이유로 “얼굴을 때려 멍을 낸 적”이 있다고 썼다.

다만 슬프게도 그가 사랑하는 뮤지션들 역시 그를 사랑했던 건 아니다.

트럼프가 공화당의 경선 참가를 발표할 때 닐 영의 노래 ’Rockin’ in the Free World’를 사용하자 닐 영은 대변인을 통해 “트럼프는 이 노래의 사용 허가를 받지 않았다”며 “캐나다 시민인 닐 영은 미국 대통령으로 버니 샌더스를 지지한다”고 밝혔다.

이밖에도 아델, 롤링스톤스, 스티븐 타일러(에어로 스미스), 엘튼 존 등은 트럼프의 경선 혹은 대선 과정에서 자신들의 노래가 쓰인 사실에 대해 “허락한 적이 없다”는 성명을 발표한 바 있다.

Vor seiner Hochzeit dachte er, er wisse schon alles über Sex

Erst nach und nach hat er gelernt, was guten Sex wirklich ausmacht

Ich bin 41 Jahre alt und schon seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten mit der gleichen, wunderschönen Frau verheiratet. Über die Jahre hinweg musste ich mich mit einigen Mythen und Irrtümern über Sex auseinandersetzen.

Die meisten dieser falschen Vorstellungen hatte ich schon, bevor ich verheiratet war und es hat Jahre gedauert, bis sie sich aufgelöst haben. Wenn ich zehn Tipps für guten Sex an mein unverheiratetes Ich schicken könnte, wären das diese:

1. Sex läuft nicht wie im Fernsehen oder in Filmen ab

Das meiste, was du über Sex weißt, kommt aus der Werbung, aus dem Fernsehen oder aus Filmen.

Anders ausgedrückt: Sex sieht aus wie spontanes, makelloses Liebemachen, voller Romantik - Marvin Gaye läuft und Kerzen sind auf dem Fensterbrett drapiert.

Sexuelle Intimität funktioniert in einer Ehe definitiv NICHT so. Im seltensten Fall läuft Marvin Gaye.

Aber sei nicht enttäuscht: Sex in der Ehe ist anders als im Film, aber es ist auch viel besser.

2. Eine Randnotiz zur Häufigkeit - bereite dich darauf vor

Im Moment denkst du noch, dass man in einer Ehe ständig Sex haben wird, so gut wie jede Sekunde am Tag und tausendmal in der Woche - denn, warum denn auch nicht!?

Lebe diesen Traum, so lange du kannst und reite dein getreues Einhorn in den Süßigkeiten-bedeckten Sonnenuntergang, wo du dann deinen wilden Ewok streicheln kannst und über die Brücke nach Terabithia gehst.

Glaub an deinen Traum. So lange du kannst. Das ist alles.

3. Sex ist wie ein guter Wein - er wird besser im Alter

Sexuelle Intimität ist etwas, in dem du immer besser werden wirst. Es braucht Kommunikation, Übung und Zeit.

Im Moment denkst du, dein Sex-IQ ist auf dem Level eines Genies, aber du würdest in einer Sex-Abschlussprüfung komplett versagen mit dem, was du weißt.

4. Sex ist nicht nur ""bekommen"", sondern auch ""geben""

Es ist tatsächlich schön, dem anderen etwas zu geben. Sei nicht die ganze Zeit über ein ""Nehmer"".

Sexuelle Intimität ist wunderbar, um Verzicht und Anstrengung zu vereinen. Wenn du das jetzt in deinen Kopf bekommst, wird das ""bekommen"" nur noch besser.

Im ""geben"" liegt eine unfassbare Schönheit und viele Geheimnisse. Sei großzügig.

5. Männer und Frauen denken nicht auf die gleiche Art über Sex

Für dich ist Sex körperliche Anziehung und es ist sehr visuell und augenblicklich.

Vielleicht ist es besser, wenn du dich jetzt erst mal setzt: Frauen empfinden Sex als Teil einer Beziehung, als Sicherheit und als Anzeichen, wie sehr sie geliebt und verlangt werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex-Experten raten: Diese 9 Dinge solltet ihr mit eurem Partner viel öfter machen

Für dich ist Sex wie ein Lichtschalter ohne Dimmer. Du bist sowas von bereit, jederzeit (außer du schläfst... aber das muss dann schon eine Todesschlaf sein).

Für sie ist Sex wie ein Schmorbraten, der viel Zeit braucht, um zu köcheln.

Das wird euch beide sehr frustrieren. Aber das ist ok. Das bringt euch näher zusammen, auf einer viel tieferen Ebene.

6. Sex macht dein Leben nicht vollkommen

Momentan legst du wahnsinnig viel Wert auf Sex. Lass uns ehrlich sein: Du denkst ständig daran.

Du sollst wissen, sexuelle Intimität ist fantastisch und sehr befriedigend und unglaublich auf die schönsten Art und Weisen - aber es darf kein Götzenbild sein. Es ist ein Geschenk, das man in der Ehe genießen sollte.

7. Sex kann Spaß machen, lustig und verspielt sein

Es gibt so viele Blickwinkel, was sexuelle Intimität betrifft und die meisten davon sind dir jetzt noch nicht bewusst. Du denkst zu eindimensional über Sex.

Sexuelle Intimität ist auch Verletzlichkeit und Authentizität und wenn du jemanden wirklich liebst, hast du nichts zu verstecken - und ich meine wirklich nichts.

Du kannst dein ehrlichstes Ich sein.

8. Sie zu verführen ist wie eine legale Sexdroge für ihre Seele

Ich habe es vorhin schon angedeutet, aber das ist wahrscheinlich das beste Geheimnis, dass ich dir mit auf den Weg geben kann: Verführe sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese Paare haben mit dem Sex bis zur Hochzeit gewartet - jetzt verraten sie, ob es sich gelohnt hat

Zeig ihr, dass du sie nicht nur körperlich willst. Verführe ihren Geist. Verführe ihr Herz. Verführe sie auf jede mögliche Weise.

Denk daran, sie denkt nicht so an Sex, wie du es tust - du bist Haut und Haar und sie ist Herz und Seele.

9. Es ist geheimnisvoller als du denkst

Und noch mal: Gerade sind deine Ansichten über Sex ziemlich simpel.

Es ist schwer zu erklären und ich verstehe es auch heute noch nicht so ganz, aber es passiert etwas Magisches, wenn zwei Menschen Sex haben. Es ist etwas fast Kosmisches, das zwei Seelen aneinander bindet,

10. Sex in der Ehe ist eine Art der Verehrung

Wenn ich sage Sex ist Verehrung, denkst du wahrscheinlich, ich bin verrückt. Aber es ist wahr.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 8 Angewohnheiten von Paaren, die ein erfülltes Sexleben haben

Der Akt ist eine Art der Verehrung, schlicht und einfach. Es ist wie alte Lieder singen, nur mit Körpern. Okay, das hat sich jetzt unheimlich angehört. Lass es uns einfach Verehrung nennen.

Ich hoffe wirklich, dass du dir diese Gedanken zu Herzen nimmst. Denn letzten Endes ist Sex in der Ehe noch viel schöner, als du es dir vorstellen kannst.

Jenny Lewis fotografiert Mütter mit ihren ein Tage alten Babies

Sie ist selbst Mutter und will anderen zeigen, dass sie keine Angst vor der Geburt haben müssen

Die Bilder zeigen allesamt starke, glückliche Mütter, denen die unbändige Liebe für ihr Kind deutlich anzusehen ist

Der Geburt eines Babys ist einer der prägendsten Momente im Leben einer Frau. Viele werdende Mütter begleitet in den Wochen davor neben all der Vorfreude auch ein ängstliches Gefühl.

Die Fotografin Jenny Lewis will ihren Teil dazu beitragen, dass die schönen Gefühle überwiegen. Mit einem Fotoprojekt One Day Young will sie schwangeren Frauen zeigen, dass eine Geburt nichts ist, vor dem man Angst haben muss.

Die Bilderstrecke zeigt verschiedene Mütter mit ihren Neugeborenen. Die Fotos sind alle am Tag nach der Geburt aufgenommen.

“Als ich Mutter wurde, hatte ich das Gefühl, dass ich anderen schwangeren Frauen sagen muss 'Alles wird gut!'"", sagte Lewis der HuffPost UK. Sie selbst ist Mutter von zwei Kindern. Ruby ist acht Jahre alt und Herb sechs.

Das Buch über eine Hebamme änderte alles

""Oft hört man von all den furchtbaren Dinge, die bei der Geburt schief gehen können. Bevor ich mein erstes Kind bekam, habe ich nicht eine positive Sache gehört"", beschreibt die Mutter ihre damalige Situation.

""Ich dachte, alles dreht sich nur um Periduralanästhesien und Krankenhäuser. Ich hätte niemals gedacht, dass ich es genießen könnte, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

Helen und Hudson

Das änderte sich, als eine Freundin ihr ein Buch über die Hebamme Ina May Gaskin zeigte. ""Das Buch beinhaltet Kurzgeschichten über die Frauen, die sie betreut hat"", sagte Lewis.

“Diesen Frauen ging es gut. Sie haben die Wehen überstanden und ihre Ängste überwunden. Plötzlich habe ich gemerkt, wie sich meine Gedanken änderten und was es wirklich bedeutete, ein Kind zu bekommen.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diese 30 Fotos zeigen, dass Hebammen die Welt zu einem besseren Ort machen

""Nur wenige sagen 'Weißt du was? Ich habe die Geburt tatsächlich genossen. Es hat mir Selbstbewusstsein gegeben. Das war das schönste Gefühl, das ich jemals hatte'"", sagte Lewis. Dabei gebe es viele Frauen, die genau diese Empfindung hätten - sie zum Beispiel.

Jenny und Suki

""Das soll keineswegs die Erfahrungen von Frauen klein machen, die eine schwere Geburt hatten. Aber es muss Stimmen von beiden Seiten geben"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Ich wollte Teil von der anderen Seite sein - ein Teil einer Geschichte, über die andere vielleicht auch stolpern, so wie es mir mit Ina May passiert ist. Eine Geschichte, die die Balance zwischen den Seiten herstellt und Frauen vielleicht auch ein bisschen die Angst nimmt.""

""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte""

Mit ihren Fotos habe sie den den Moment nach der Geburt festhalten wollen - und zeigen, dass die Frauen danach immer noch sie selbst sind. ""Ich finde, ein Bild ist oft aussagekräftiger als Worte.""

""One Day Young"" war geboren.

Alle Frauen, die auf den Bildern zu sehen sind, haben sich auf Lewis' Facebook-Aufruf gemeldet.

Einige kontaktierten die Fotografin auch, nachdem sie ihre Flyer in kleinen Läden und an Laternen gesehen hatten.



Laure und Tyrick

“Schon nach den ersten paar Shootings war mir klar: Das ist etwas wirklich Besonders”, sagte Lewis. ""Die Atmosphäre war so wundervoll.""

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Mutter zeigt auf einem Foto, wie sie nach der Geburt aussieht - für viele Frauen ist das noch immer ein Tabu

In den ersten 24 Stunden nach der Geburt beobachte sie eine ganz besondere Energie zwischen Mutter und Kind. Die Frauen hätten alle ganz leuchtende Augen gehabt. ""Ich wollte diesen Moment einfangen - bevor die täglichen Sorgen zurück zu ihnen finden. Es ist eine große Ehre, als Fotografin die Möglichkeit haben zu dürfen, das festzuhalten.""



Liana und Archer

Die Fotos der Bilderreihe zeigen Mütter ganz unterschiedlicher Herkunft und verschiedenen Alters. Aber sie haben alle eines gemeinsam: ihre unglaubliche Stärke.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Frau kämpft während ihrer Schwangerschaft gegen Krebs - mit bewegenden Fotos macht sie jetzt anderen Mut

Jedes Bild ist eine Geschichte

“In diesen ersten 24 Stunden kommt die innere Kriegerin der Frauen zum Vorschein. Sie bekommen diese Kraft, um ihr Kind zu beschützen und das sieht man auch auf den Bildern"", sagte die Fotografin.

""Sie sind wie diese heldenhaften Bilder von Soldaten auf dem Schlachtfeld oder ein Fußballspieler nach dem gewonnenen Spiel, noch voller Adrenalin. Dieser Moment wird selten festgehalten. Aber das, was sie erreicht haben, ist mindestens genau so wichtig wie das Tor oder der gewonnen Kampf - und dieser Moment verdient es, in einer Arena aufgenommen und gefeiert zu werden.""



Xanthe und Louie

Für sie ist jede Frau auf jedem Bild einzigartig - und doch verbindet sie etwas. ""Jeder hat seine Probleme, aber in diesem Moment werden sie unwichtig und jede ist gleich - auf einer Augenhöhe. Es ist egal, ob ich die Frauen in einer Villa oder in einem Hostel fotografiere. Der Blick in den Augen der Frauen ist immer der gleiche: Sie sind stolz auf sich selbst.""

Houria Bouteldja, porte-parole des Indigènes de la République, pose et cette photographie est accessible sur le Net. A côté d'elle une chaise blanche. Sur le haut du siège est écrit au marqueur et en grand : ""Sionistes au goulag"", sur le bas du même siège, l'inscription : ""Peace"". Houria Bouteldja doit sûrement trouver que c'est tendance, que c'est cool, que c'est bien, que c'est antiraciste. Elle sourit, hilare. Bien évidemment, ce n'est pas l'expression ""Peace"" qui fait poser Madame Bouteldja. C'est bien l'expression ""Sionistes au goulag"". ""C'est vrai que je suis réputée être raciste anti-blanc, antisémite et homophobe. Je dis sur ce plateau que je me fous complètement de ce qu'on dit de moi"", s'était défendue la sulfureuse jeune femme, en mars 2016.

Alors faisons un peu d'histoire

Dans leur ouvrage ""Le Goulag"", (Editions bouquins 1120 pages) dont Libération rend compte le 18 octobre 2017, les historiens Luba Jurgenson et Nicolas Werth sont précis. ""Combien étaient-ils (au goulag) ? 20 millions de femmes dont on a peu parlé, d'enfants dont-on n'a pas parlé et d'hommes dont on a parlé mais pas assez sont passés par les camps de l'Administration principale des camps, la Glavnoïé oupravlénié laguéreï, dont l'acronyme restera : le ""Goulag"". Combien sont morts ? Probablement 4 millions, entre 1929 et 1954, estime Werth, sans prendre en compte les ""libérés"" de la dernière minute, celle qui précédait la mort, et les détenus abattus par un gardien irascible pour une réflexion, un geste maladroit ou pour rire.""

Nous avons tous en tête ce que veut dire le mot ""goulag"" : cette cohorte ininterrompue de suppliciés, de damnés, ces condamnés, les forçats et déportés qui subissaient le joug d'un système totalitaire et meurtrier, qui avait pour nom le communisme et son avatar monstrueux, le stalinisme. Les condamnés à crever dans la neige et le froid. Des centaines de milliers d'exécutions sommaires, la famine organisée tout le temps, toujours, les millions de détenus, les peuples entiers déportés (comme les Tatars de Crimée), des millions de morts, c'est cela le goulag. C'est cela le goulag et rien d'autre, ce ne furent pas des camps de vacances ou le Club Med. Ce cauchemar du goulag, qui avait été révélé au monde par Alexandre Soljenitsyne dans son fameux ""Archipel du goulag"", publié en décembre 1973.

Polémique

Dernièrement, la députée La France insoumise Danièle Obono a pris la défense de la porte-parole du Parti des indigènes de la République (PIR), Houria Bouteldja, sa ""camarade"", dit-elle : ""Je respecte la militante antiraciste. C'est dans le mouvement antiraciste que je l'ai connue, c'est dans ces luttes-là que l'on s'est battues"", a-t-elle déclaré au micro de Radio J. Contradictoirement et probablement sous la charge médiatique, la charge et les moqueries diverses dans les réseaux sociaux, notamment dans les réseaux sociaux, la députée déclare ensuite : ""Je ne suis pas et n'ai jamais été membre du PIR [Parti des indigènes de la République, ndlr]. Je suis en profond désaccord avec leurs thèses."" C'est ce qu'écrit ce lundi 6 novembre, sur sa page Facebook, la députée France insoumise Danièle Obono. ""Mon seul programme est celui de La France Insoumise, l'Avenir en commun. J'en ai coordonné les livrets thématiques. Je souscris à l'ensemble du programme sans exclusive. C'est celui sur lequel j'ai été élue députée de la 17e circonscription de Paris"", écrit-elle. Il était temps, Madame la députée, que vous tentiez de clarifier votre pensée.

Quant à la photographie présentant la porte-parole du PIR à côté d'une pancarte ""Les sionistes au goulag"", Danièle Obono juge qu'il s'agissait d'une ""photo de très mauvais goût"", qui n'était ""pas acceptable"", rapporte BFMTV, en date du 5 novembre 2017.

Pas acceptable cette photographie?

Voilà pour le moins, un euphémisme. On en rirait, si c'était drôle. Tant cette photographie est brutale, tant on peut penser que ce serait chouette, que ce serait tendance, fun et « antiraciste » d'envoyer les sionistes (les Juifs?) au goulag, donc à la mort. Je dis bien, à la mort.

Par ailleurs, interrogée sur le fait de savoir si les propos d'Houria Bouteldja - qui affirmait en mars 2015 que ""Les juifs sont les boucliers, les tirailleurs de la politique impérialiste française et de sa politique islamophobe"" - étaient des propos racistes ou antiracistes, la députée de Paris a répondu: ""Je ne sais pas"". Terrifiant. Est-ce là l'antiracisme tendance ? Sont-ce là des valeurs ? Que de ne pas vouloir voir ou de ne pas comprendre que le pseudo antiracisme à la mode anti blancs, antijuifs, anti homosexuels ne relèvent en aucun cas des valeurs de l'antiracisme et des valeurs de la République?

Dans un texte publié sur son mur Facebook, le politologue Laurent Bouvet, tire la sonnette d'alarme : ""La liberté, l'égalité, la fraternité, la laïcité, l'universalisme, l'antiracisme, le rationalisme. Tout ce qui a fait ce que nous sommes, nous Français, est aujourd'hui dévoyé et piétiné par une petite minorité de fauteurs de haine et de division qui osent prétendre incarner « la » gauche"". https://www.facebook.com/notes/laurent-bouvet/%C3%A7a-suffit-/10155971521049309/

Ça me pose un vrai problème"", a expliqué Flavie Flament en référence aux femmes qui accusent le réalisateur d'agression sexuelle alors qu'elles étaient mineures au moment des faits.

Plusieurs dizaines de véhicules forains ont ralenti ce lundi matin la circulation aux abords de Paris, pour protester contre la suppression du marché de Noël du ""roi des forains"" Marcel Campion sur les Champs-Elysées.

La circulation en Ile-de-France ""risque d'être très perturbée par ces manifestations qui devraient se multiplier"", a averti le site d'information routière Sytadin.

Alors qu'une intersyndicale de forains avait promis des ""blocages"" autour de la capitale, peu avant 9h00 les ralentissements provoqués par ces opérations escargot se concentraient sur quelques points de l'ouest, de l'est et du sud, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo en tête de l'article.

Selon Sytadin, ""40 camions sont en bouchon mobile sur une voie de droite"" sur l'A13 tout près de Paris, à hauteur de Saint-Cloud, alors que sur l'A4 vers Paris, à hauteur de Noisy-le-Grand, 60 manifestants présents sur la chaussée génèrent ""un fort bouchon en amont"" et limitent la circulation ""sur une voie de gauche"". Au sud, sur l'A6 vers Paris la bande d'arrêt d'urgence et la voie de droite sont ""neutralisées"" à hauteur de Wissous, et un ""très fort bouchon"" est en cours sur l'A86 extérieur et sur la RN118.



Selon France Info, 240 km de bouchons ont été constatés.

La préfecture de police de Paris a confirmé à l'AFP une partie de ces ralentissements, ajoutant qu'il n'y avait pour l'heure ""aucun blocage"" aux portes de Paris.

Vers 8h30, une quinzaine de camions de forains ont été bloqués par des CRS au niveau de la porte de la Muette, empêchés d'entrer sur le périphérique où ils comptaient mener une opération escargot.

Menés par Marcel Campion, 77 ans, promoteur historique des fêtes foraines parisiennes, les forains entendent ainsi protester contre la non-reconduction du marché de Noël des Champs-Elysées, une décision votée à l'unanimité par le Conseil de Paris début juillet.

Mardi soir, la police avait empêché des forains de réinstaller le marché, en restreignant la circulation autour de l'avenue des Champs-Elysées.

""Elle doit s'appliquer, pour des raisons qui tiennent à la qualité médiocre des animations et des produits vendus"", insiste la Ville.

Marcel Campion, promoteur historique des fêtes foraines parisiennes, ""n'a donc pas l'autorisation d'installer son marche forain"", ajoute la mairie. ""Nous sommes dans un État de droit, le chantage n'est pas une méthode et les pressions des derniers jours ne sont pas admissibles"", affirme-t-elle.

Man solle die Handys während der Gespräche wegsperren, fordert er

Bei Sondierungsgesprächen geht es eigentlich ums Antasten, ums Kennenlernen, Vertrauen aufbauen. Die Jamaika-Sondierungen erscheinen dagegen bisweilen wie ein offener Schlagabtausch.

Auch Grünen-Politiker Robert Habeck ist genervt davon, wie wenig konstruktiv einige Politiker der verhandelnden Parteien die Gespräche angehen. Im Gespräch mit dem ARD forderte Habeck deshalb, Handys bei den Verhandlungen in Zukunft vor der Tür zu lassen.

""Man hat teilweise eins zu eins online lesen können, wie man gerade redet"", sagte Habeck in der Sendung ""Bericht aus Berlin"" am Sonntagabend. Vertrauen sei da ""ein seltenes Gut"". Sein Vorschlag: ""Wir legen alle unsere Handys draußen vor die Tür und holen die nach zwei, drei Stunden wieder.""

Auch im ""Handelsblatt"" appellierte Habeck an die Sondierer, sich mit öffentlichen Aussagen über ein mögliches Scheitern der Gespräche zurückzuhalten. ""Wir sollten uns nun darauf konzentrieren, gemeinsame Ergebnisse zu erzielen und das Neuwahl-Gerede endlich einstellen“, sagte der Kieler Umweltminister.

""80 zu 20 Chance, dass es klappt""

Dennoch glaubt Habeck, dass Jamaika letztendlich zustandekommt. ""Vernunftbegabte Menschen müssen versuchen, es hinzukriegen"", sagte der Grünen-Politiker – und bezifferte die Chance einer Koalition auf 80 Prozent.

Auch in in der Union wächst die Sorge, dass die Verhandlungen platzen könnten. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel warnte davor, immer wieder eine vorgezogene Neuwahl für den Fall des Scheiterns ins Spiel zu bringen. Auch die CDU müsse ein Jamaika-Bündnis nicht um jeden Preis eingehen, sagte die Kanzlerin am Montag nach Angaben von Teilnehmern in einer Sitzung des CDU-Vorstands in Berlin.

Nach einer am Montag veröffentlichten Forsa-Umfrage im Auftrag der Mediengruppe RTL würde sich das Ergebnis bei einer Neuwahl kaum vom Resultat der Bundestagswahl vom 24. September unterscheiden.

Emily Eekhoff bemerkte, dass sich ihr ungeborenes Baby plötzlich anders in ihrem Bauch bewegt

Sie alarmierte die Ärzte gerade noch rechtzeitig und konnte so ihr Baby retten

Die App Count the Kicks half ihr dabei, zu merken, dass etwas mit ihrer Tochter nicht stimmte

Die junge Mutter Emily Eekhoff ist überzeugt: Ohne eine App wäre ihr Baby jetzt nicht mehr am Leben.

Die 26-Jährige aus Des Moines im US-Bundesstaat Iowa nutzte während ihrer Schwangerschaft die App Count the Kicks (auf Deutsch: Zählt die Tritte) - sie hilft Müttern im letzten Trimester dabei, die Aktivität ihrer Babys im Bauch zu überwachen.

Wenn einer werdenden Mutter auffällt, dass sich das Baby auf einmal ungewöhnlich still verhält, kann das auf gefährliche Komplikationen hinweisen.

Ohne die App und die Aufmerksamkeit ihrer Mutter hätte Ruby nicht überlebt

Als sich die hochschwangere Eekhoff vergangenen Frühling eines Abends hinsetzte, um mithilfe der App die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen, spürte sie, dass etwas anders war als sonst. ""Ich fühlte kaum Tritte und die, die ich bemerkte, waren sehr sanft – es war nicht normal“, sagte sie dem amerikanischen Nachrichtenportal ""USA Today“.

Auch Techniken, die das Baby im Bauch zu mehr Bewegungen animieren sollen, brachten keine Veränderung. Beunruhigt fuhren die Eltern ins Krankenhaus. Dort stellten die Ärzte fest, dass das Baby in großen Schwierigkeiten war und der Mediziner Neil Mandsager, der auf Risikoschwangerschaften spezialisiert ist, leitete einen Not-Kaiserschnitt ein.

Denn bei der kleinen Ruby hatte sich die Nabelschnur dreimal um ihr Genick gewickelt. Die Ärzte sind der Meinung, dass sie so keinen Tag mehr im Bauch ihrer Mutter überlebt hätte. Doch dank der schnellen Hilfe hat es das kleine Mädchen auf die Welt geschafft - und entwickelt sich prächtig.

Arzt Mandsager kennt die App und empfiehlt sie allen werdenden Müttern: “Diese App ist ein schlagkräftiges Instrument für Mütter im letzten Trimester. Wir ermutigen alle Mütter, diese App herunterzuladen, wenn sie in der 28. Woche sind – bei Risikoschwangerschaften auch gern schon ab der 26. Woche.“

""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben“

Im Bundesstaat Iowa empfehlen in einer öffentlichen Kampagne viele Krankenhäuser und Gynäkologen, die Bewegungen des Babys im Bauch zu zählen – auch mithilfe von Count the Kicks, das man kostenlos downloaden kann.

Emily Price, Geschäftsführerin von Count the Kicks, sagte der HuffPost: ""Wir wissen von drei Babys, die wir diesen Sommer gerettet haben, da ihre Mütter die App genutzt haben und zum Arzt gegangen sind, als ihnen Veränderungen bei den Bewegungen ihrer Babys aufgefallen sind.“

Zurück geht das Projekt auf fünf Mutter, die alle aus Iowa stammen und eine Fehl- oder Totgeburt erlitten haben. Nach dieser traumatischen Erfahrung wollten die Frauen verhindern, dass andere Familien das gleiche Schicksal erleben müssen.

Die Mütter stießen bei der Recherche auf ein Projekt aus Norwegen: Dort konnte in mehreren Krankenhäusern nach einer öffentlichen Gesundheitskampagne die Rate der Totgeburten um 30 Prozent gesenkt werden, wie mehrere Studien zeigen.

In der Kampagne wurde schwangeren Frauen nahegelegt, ab dem letzten Schwangerschaftsdrittel die Tritte ihrer Babys täglich zu zählen und regelmäßig zu den Vorsorgeuntersuchungen zu gehen.

Die Rate der Totgeburten sank in Iowa um 23 Prozent

Davon inspiriert starteten die Mütter 2009 ""Healthy Birth Day“, eine Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich mit Unterstützung der Regierung in Iowa mit den Krankenhäusern und Gynäkologen vernetzte und Broschüren und Informationen an werdende Mütter verteilte.

Schließlich konnte mithilfe von Spenden auch die App, die laut den Gründerinnen auf wissenschaftlichen und medizinischen Erkenntnissen basiert, entwickelt werden. Sie unterstützt die werdenden Mütter dabei, täglich in einem bestimmten Zeitabschnitt die Bewegungen ihres Babys zu zählen und zu überwachen.

Bisher haben laut Price 45.000 Frauen die App heruntergeladen - weltweit. Am weitesten verbreitet ist Count the Kicks allerdings in Iowa.

Seit der Einführung von Count the Kicks sank die Rate der Totgeburten in dem Bundesstaat um 26 Prozent – einen Erfolg, den Price der Kampagne ihrer Organisation zuschreibt.

Die Geschäftsführerin sagt: ""Manchmal ist das Zählen der Tritte im Bauch das einzige Anzeichen und das früheste Anzeichen, das etwas schief läuft.“ Bis zu sechzehn Babys wurden bisher mit dieser Methode gerettet, wie die Organisation berichtet.

2000 Sternenkinder pro Jahr

In Deutschland kommen auf 1000 Neugeborene 2,4 Totgeburten – unser Land hat damit eine der niedrigsten Raten der Welt. Das bedeutet, dass es bei uns pro Jahr 2000 sogenannte Sternenkinder gibt.

Die Ursache dafür, dass die Babys noch im Bauch der Mutter sterben, können Probleme mit der Plazenta oder der Nabelschnur sein - bei über 30 Prozent der Fälle bleibt der Grund allerdings unklar.

Zur Vorbeugung einer Totgeburt empfehlen die Ärzte auch bei uns, auf die Bewegungen des Kindes im Bauch zu achten und regelmäßig zur Vorsorge zu gehen. Bei vaginalen Blutungen sollten Schwangere sofort einen Arzt aufsuchen.

Aufklärung soll helfen, die Rate noch weiter zu senken

Nicht zu verwechseln sind Totgeburten mit Fehlgeburten - diese sind vor allem im ersten Trimester sehr häufig. Ärzte schätzen, dass in Deutschland 30 Prozent der Schwangerschaften mit einer Fehlgeburt enden. Ursache sind dabei genetische Störungen und fehlerhafte Zellteilungen beim Embryo, die eine Weiterentwicklung des Babys verhindern.

Dagegen kann die Methode des Tritte Zählens natürlich leider nicht helfen. Sie richtet sich ausschließlich an Schwangere im letzten Trimester. Die Hoffnung ist, dass die Ärzte das Baby in manchen Fällen – wie bei Problemen mit der Nabelschnur - noch retten können, wenn die Mütter eine Veränderung der Kindsbewegungen bemerken.

Wie in Deutschland ist die Zahl der Totgeburten in den USA etwas höher als die Zahl der Kinder, die an dem Plötzlichen Kindstod (SIDS) sterben. Hier haben zahlreiche Aufklärungsprogramme dabei geholfen, dass der Befund in den letzten Jahren gesunken ist – in Deutschland in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten sogar um etwa 90 Prozent.

Price hofft, dass sie mithilfe der App und Aufklärung der Mütter ähnliche Erfolge bei der Senkung der Totgeburtenrate erzielen kann.

Boochani has also written six pieces for The Guardian since October 27 outlining the circumstances him, and the hundreds of others that remain in the Manus Island detention centre, face.

His most recent piece from November 3 reads:

The silent protest begins at five. The mosquitoes of Manus are again ruthless and barbaric. Another tough night awaits. Behrouz Boochani

Boochani was also recently awarded an Amnesty International Australia media award in the print, online and multimedia category.

Je n'ai pas crié, je n'ai rien dit à personne, je me suis cachée en entier dans ma honte et mon dégoût de ce premier baiser forcé, volé, humiliant qui disait haut et fort que les hommes pouvaient consommer ma peau et même avoir ma peau.

J'ai seize ans, j'ai raté la correspondance de mon train, je décide de faire de l'auto stop. Très vite un automobiliste s'arrête. Il quitte brusquement la nationale et prend une départementale, il a soit disant un colis à déposer ...j'ouvre la portière et je sauté en marche en prenant tous les risques, notamment qu'il revienne et je cours de peur qu'il me tue...

Je suis étudiante à Paris 7, j'ouvre la porte de mon immeuble et je sens le corps d'un homme qui me pousse en avant, je me retourne et je hurle en donnant un coup avec mon genou dans ses couilles...il s'est sauvé en courant et moi, je le suivais le menaçant.

J'ai grandi en comprenant que c'était la guerre. En stratège féminin, je me suis inventée des armures, des gilets de sauvetage, des ceintures de sécurité, j'ai porté des armes inutiles; j'ai fait du judo et j'ai compris qu'il valait mieux s'entraîner à la course à pied, fuir et ne pas se battre parce qu'à musculature égale, les hommes sont plus forts. Dans les couloirs déserts du métro, j'écoute les pas qui résonnent. La peur s'est glissée sous ma peau et fait bloc dans sa tête. J'intériorise les scénarios de self-défense pour éviter la prédation masculine qu'elle soit visuelle, tactile ou verbale. Dans la rue et ailleurs, les garçons se promènent rêvent et lisent tranquilles.

J'ai quarante ans, les flèches de la cathédrale de Chartres déchirent les lumières du ciel. Le Ter Paris-Le Mans se vide. Dans le compartiment reste deux voyageurs, deux mecs. Si l'un d'eux descend à la prochaine station, je serai seule avec un type forcément capable de tout. La nuit s'installe, la peur aussi. Les femmes disent qu'elles ne veulent plus faire ce trajet en train et préfèrent rester chez elles dans le Perche plutôt que d'aller se divertir à Paris.

J'aime les garçons, j'aime trop quand nos regards se croisent dans ces moments improbables d'assentiments alchimiques sensuels et amoureux, même que c'est trop bien quand on se drague les uns et les autres dans la rue et ailleurs. Sauf que dans l'espace privé ou public, ce n'est pas équitable, les hommes de la famille ou d'autres peuvent abuser de nos corps. Tous les jours dans le Perche que traverse ce Ter Paris-Le Mans des petites filles perdent leur virginité au monde, les assistantes sociales le savent mais soumises au secret professionnel, elles doivent se taire. Malgré les luttes de nos mères pour l'égalité des femmes et des hommes, dès notre naissance nous sommes des proies potentielles, des candidates au silence, des soumises à la domination au boulot et ailleurs, et pourtant on fait la guerre au quotidien pour ne pas vivre en alerte permanente. Les tribunaux ne sont d'aucun intérêt. Le vrai changement doit s'opérer dans les comportements et les mentalités de tous et de toutes, relevons la tête et revendiquons le droit de marcher, de travailler, de rêver sans être victime voire consentante de livrer nos sexes sans désirer celui de l'autre mais parfois avons-nous vraiment le choix.

Parlons, témoignons, touche pas à ma potesse, touche pas à ma mère, touche pas à ma fille si elle en n'a pas envie.

Souvenez-vous, battez-vous, écrivez même les noms des prédateurs. Si nous voulons que la société change, ne soyez pas complice en restant silencieuse, quant aux mauvais garçons, la prochaine fois si vous ne voulez pas que votre nom éclate au grand jour, demandez mais n'insistez pas si une fille n' a pas envie de votre sexe

Die Gegner des Landeschefs Uwe Junge rufen zur Revolte auf

Der Vorgang ist außergewöhnlich - und könnte Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Partei haben

Auch nach den Querelen um den Rückzug der AfD-Chefin Frauke Petry kommt die Partei nicht zur Ruhe.

Während sich die AfD im Bundestag sortiert, gärt es in den Landesverbänden gewaltig.

Der Landtagsfraktion in Sachsen und Nordrhein-Westfalen droht nach einer Austrittswelle das Aus. In Petrys Landesverband in Sachsen wurde gar ein Notvorstand berufen. Und auch die Auseinandersetzungen in der AfD-Fraktion in Rheinland-Pfalz nehmen zu.

Im Fokus: Der rheinland-pfälzische AfD-Chef Uwe Junge. Er muss sich seit einigen Wochen mit lautem, parteiinternen Widerstand herumschlagen.

Querelen um den Parteitag

► Ende Oktober versäumte er, die Einladungen zum Parteitag rechtzeitig an die Mitglieder zu verschicken. Daraufhin regte sich heftiger Widerstand. Die HuffPost berichtete.

Solche kleinen Formfehler könnten sich ""bitter rächen"", sagte der Polit-Experte Werner Patzelt von der TU Dresden. “Das machen sich interne Gegner zu Nutze, die sich in der Partei gegen die Führung durchsetzen wollen.”

► Nun steht Junge erneut unter Druck - im Kern geht es um eine Initiative seiner parteiinternen Rivalin und Stellvertreterin Christiane Christen.

In einem Aufruf, der bereits mehrere hundert Unterzeichner hat, appelliert sie, zu den ""Gründungsidealen der Partei"" zurückzukehren. Christen kritisiert die undurchsichtige Verteilung von Posten und deren Bezahlung. Der Landesvorstand solle zur ""Integrität und Rechtstreue"" zurückkehren.

Vorwürfe sind ""falsch und böswillig""

Junge wandte sich daraufhin in einer Mail wütend an die rheinland-pfälzischen AfD-Mitglieder. Die Vorwürfe seien ""falsch und böswillig"", heißt es einem Schreiben, dass der HuffPost vorliegt.

Weiter schreibt Junge an die Mitglieder: ""Schenken Sie Gerüchten und Böswilligkeiten keinen Glauben!""

Der Aufruf suggeriere, den Mitgliedern werde ""die Partei weggenommen oder es bestünde zumindest die Gefahr dazu. Ich möchte diesem Aufruf mit einem Schreiben an Sie alle entgegen treten, weil hier der erneute Versuch unternommen wird, die gute Arbeit des Landesvorstands und der Fraktion in Frage zu stellen.""

Christen hatte sich Mitte des Jahres aus dem Landesverband zurückgezogen, nachdem ihre Bewerbung auf die Spitzenkandidatur zur Bundestagswahl gescheitert war.

""Die Vorgänge sind bemerkenswert""

Die Vorgänge sind ungewöhnlich - und könnten auch über die Landesgrenzen hinaus in der AfD zu spüren sein. Denn der Machtkampf kann für Junge gefährlich werden, sagt Carl Berning, Politologe an der Universität Mainz.

""Seine Aussichten auf eine Karriere in Berlin schwinden, wenn der Eindruck entsteht, dass er seinen Laden nicht im Griff hat.”

Der Machtkampf sei insofern bemerkenswert, weil der Landesverband in der Außenwahrnehmung als einer der stabilsten in Westdeutschland gilt, erklärt Berning.

""Der Machtkampf könnte Junge gefährlich werden""

Junge gilt in der Partei als gemäßigt, galt bis zu Petrys Weggang als Vertrauter der damaligen Parteichefin und unterstützt den Partei-Ausschluss des Rechtsaußen Björn Höcke.

Einige Beobachter sehen in dem Machtkampf um Junge deswegen auch einen Kampf des rechten Lagers um die Vorherrschaft in der Partei.

""Zeit für einen Putsch ist günstig""

Zum Showdown könnte es auf dem Landesparteitag Ende des Jahres kommen. Weil dann auch der Landesvorstand gewählt werden muss, könnten Junges Gegner zur offenen Revolte blasen.

“Die Zeit für einen Putsch im Landesverband ist kurz vor dem Parteitag strategisch günstig"", sagt Politologe Berning.

Bis zur nächsten Landtags- und Bundestagswahl ist es noch lange hin. Ein Streit um die Parteiführung würde also keine Stimmen kosten - sofern es gelingt, wieder Einigkeit herzustellen.

""Dies wird nötig sein, sollte der Streit um die Parteiführung tatsächlich eskalieren, um einen personellen Wechsel hervorzurufen"", sagt Berning.

Falls es tatsächlich zum Putsch kommt, wäre das ein weiterer Schritt zur Radikalisierung der Partei.

Die Paradise Papers zeigen erneut, wie Großkonzerne und Superreiche Geld in Steueroasen bunkern

Laut Wirtschaftsexperte Zucman entgehen Deutschland dadurch 17 Milliarden Euro im Jahr

Es ist eine unbequeme Wahrheit: Steuertricks von Konzernen wie Apple kosten allein Deutschland jedes Jahr Milliarden von Euro an Steuern. Denn internationale Konzerne verschieben ihre Gewinne in Steuerparadiese und umgehen so den deutschen Fiskus.

Das belegen die sogenannten Paradise Papers, eine Enthüllung des internationalen Investigativrecherche-Netzwerks ICIJ, dem unter anderem die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" (""SZ"") angehört.

Ausmaß der Ungleichheit bisher verschleiert

Zucmans Rechenexempel basiert auf einer Reihe von öffentlich zugänglichen Daten. Insgesamt verliert die Europäische Union umgerechnet ein Fünftel ihrer Einnahmen aus Unternehmensteuern. Das entspreche 60 Milliarden Euro im Jahr.

Deutschland ist besonders betroffen. Von allen untersuchten Ländern verliert die Bundesrepublik am meisten Geld durch Steueroasen. Die Einnahmen aus Körperschaftsteuer könnten 32 Prozent höher liegen als bislang. In Frankreich liegt der Wert bei 25 Prozent, in Großbritannien bei 20 Prozent.

The real estate agency — which, admittedly, has something to gain from predicting rising prices for upscale homes — noted that some of Canada’s housing markets have seen substantial booms in luxury home sales this year.

The realtor found sales of luxury homes are up 29 per cent this year in Montreal, and up 61 per cent in Toronto. Calgary and Vancouver posted 67- and 65-per-cent gains this year, the realtor said.

Sotheby’s expects foreign investors from China and the Middle East, as well as from Russia, India and the U.S., to fuel demand in Canada.

As if to prove the point, news broke last week that a Middle Eastern investor bought several units in a Vancouver condo building, including the penthouse, for a $40-million price tag thought to be the most expensive condo purchase in Canadian history.

If the trend keeps up, we can expect to see more and more custom-built luxury homes popping up across the country, and hopefully at least some of them will make for unique and interesting homes.

""J'ai tout de suite cru Henda Ayari""

Aïcha Ali-Khan s'est lancée dans cette pétition parce qu'elle est persuadée de la véracité des faits reprochés à Tariq Ramadan.

Quels sont ces faits? Après le dépôt de plainte par deux femmes en France, pour viol, agression sexuelle, violences et menaces de mort, les témoignages anonymes de plusieurs autres femmes ont émergé. Enfin, une enquête de la Tribune de Genève a recueilli le témoignage de jeunes filles mineures à l'époque des faits, également agressées lorsque Tariq Ramadan enseignait dans les collèges suisses.

Au HuffPost, cette militante féministe musulmane confie: ""Lorsque j'ai appris la plainte déposée par Henda Ayari, j'ai su qu'elle disait la vérité, et ce pour deux raisons. La première c'est qu'une femme musulmane rencontre tellement de difficultés, liées à sa culture familiale et à l'honneur du père qu'il ne faut pas bafouer en rendant publics les agressions sexuelles, que lorsqu'une femme se lance là-dedans, elle ne peut le faire légèrement, surtout quand il s'agit d'une personne célèbre et vénérée. Moi-même, j'ai enduré les pires choses quand j'ai déposé plainte contre le député avec lequel je travaillais à la Chambre des Communes. J'ai vécu cinq années de procédures harassantes.""

""Je connaissais sa réputation""

""Ensuite, j'avais déjà entendu parler de Tariq Ramadan, je connaissais sa réputation, continue la jeune femme, enseignante dans le secondaire. Pour être précise, en 2011, je voulais me rendre à l'une de ses conférences sur le sol britannique. Mon ex-mari policier qui officiait à Londres m'a alors conseillé de ne pas y aller. Selon lui, une plainte avait été déposée contre lui en 2008 pour viol. Mais la plaignante étant repartie dans son pays, l'enquête n'avait pu aboutir. Quand j'ai su pour Henda Ayari, je lui ai tout de suite apporté mon soutien.""

Prête à aider par tous les moyens celle qui a porté plainte, Aïcha Ali-Khan a demandé des comptes à l'Université d'Oxford. ""Je trouve incroyable qu'il puisse continuer à donner ses cours comme si de rien n'était, alors que de graves allégations pèsent contre lui. Certains de nos parlementaires ont dû démissionner pour moins que ça.""

Oxford ne veut pas suspendre Ramadan

Par ailleurs, l'Université d'Oxford ne semble pas pressée de mettre un terme au contrat de Tariq Ramadan. À Libération, l'Université déclarait le 29 octobre n'avoir rien à ajouter à son communiqué laconique du 21 octobre qui disait: ""Nous sommes au courant de ces accusations et les prenons extrêmement au sérieux. A ce stade, nous ne sommes pas en position d'ajouter d'autres commentaires"".

Le 6 novembre, l'Université a toutefois précisé qu'un dispositif avait été mis en place pour accompagner et écouter les étudiants de Tariq Ramadan. Des entretiens individuels ont été organisés avec chacun des étudiants de l'essayiste, relaie Libération. Les étudiants pourront également faire savoir dans quelles conditions ils souhaitent que leurs entretiens avec l'enseignant, d'ordinaire en tête-à-tête, se déroulent au moment de la supervision de leurs thèses.

Alors la militante prend l'Université à partie. ""Je leur ai envoyé un courrier pour leur demander la suspension du poste de Tariq Ramadan, jusqu'à ce que la lumière soit faite sur son cas"". Ils m'ont répondu vendredi 3 novembre, dans une longue lettre que j'ai publiée sur mon blog, qu'ils ne comptaient pas le suspendre, parce que les plaintes n'avaient pas été déposées sur le sol britannique, que les procédures entre les deux pays étaient différentes, et que Tariq Ramadan niait en bloc ces accusations.""

Les médias préfèrent s'intéresser aux députés harceleurs

Selon cette féministe, enseignante du secondaire, Oxford serait plus pragmatique que ce qu'ils laissent entendre. Elle explique au HuffPost que l'université craindrait que Tariq Ramadan ne se retourne contre elle pour suspension ou licenciement abusif, au cas où il serait lavé de tout soupçon.

Cette pétition n'est pas vouée à un grand succès. Lancée dimanche 5 novembre, elle ne comporte pas plus de cinq cents signataires pour le moment. La militante n'en attend pas plus de mille. Et pour cause, les médias britanniques ne se passionnent pas pour l'affaire, mis à part quelques papiers complets dans le Telegraph ou la BBC. Pourtant Tariq Ramadan n'est pas un inconnu de l'autre côté de la Manche.

En 2005, Tony Blair lui confiait un mission, juste après les attentats de Londres, sur la pacification du dialogue entre les religions. Plus récemment, rappelle Libération, sous le conservateur David Cameron, en 2014, il a participé à un groupe de réflexion du ministère des Affaires étrangères sur des questions relatives à la liberté de religion ou de croyance.

Mais les médias lui préfèrent les scandales sexuels qui entourent les députés britanniques. Début novembre, le ministre de la Défense, Michael Fallon démissionne pour avoir flirté trop assidûment avec une journaliste. Le 4 novembre, le ministre écossais Mark Mcdonald rend son tablier également. D'autres politiques sont sur la sellette, d'après le Times, qui a révélé l'existence d'une liste d'une quarantaine de parlementaires conservateurs connus pour des faits de harcèlement. Quinze d'entre eux seraient actuellement ministres.

She had earlier been quoted as saying, ""Khichdi is considered nutritious, healthiest food in India and it is is eaten by poor and rich alike, irrespective of their class. It symbolises India's great culture of unity in diversity. So it has been selected as the brand of Indian food.""

Badal had been speaking at an event before the World Food India conference, where celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor is expected to cook 800 kilograms of khichdi in an attempt to set a world record. However, news reports soon appeared suggesting that this was part of a decision to make khichdi a national dish.

The DA today celebrates her life, honours her legacy and remembers her immense contribution to a free, democratic South Africa. She devoted her life to the fight against apartheid.

Helen Suzman used her position in parliament to relentlessly chip away at the edifice of apartheid South Africa with a tenacity borne from a deep concern for the lives of others and a hatred of oppression. Her doggedness earned her global respect. She embodied the liberal democratic values that now form the foundation of our constitutional democracy, and she embodied the fighting spirit that has hitherto inspired and still inspires the DA.

She served as one of the very few voices against apartheid and one of the few women in parliament between 1961 and 1974. As an English-speaker in an overwhelmingly Afrikaans parliament dominated by men, she was often subjected to intimidation, sexism and anti-semitism. Yet she was indefatigable, fighting the National Party and embarrassing and exposing the apartheid government. She was indeed a ""bright star in a dark chamber"".

The National Party showed disdain for any opposition voice and undermined opposition parties whenever they could. However, Suzman was always up for the fight. She used every opportunity to stand for what was right, and to bring international attention to the South African cause.

This was epitomised in a moment in parliament where she was accused of asking tough questions the government claimed were embarrassing to the country. Suzman famously responded by saying, ""It's not my questions that embarrass South Africa, it is your answers"".

In her time as an MP, she opposed every plank of apartheid's legislative underpinning, as well as its philosophical underpinning of racial nationalism. She stood for liberal constitutionalism long before it was fashionable to do so, knowing that the philosophy of racial nationalism and reductionism could not be sustained in the long term.

The struggle against apartheid had many heroes, all of whom rightly deserve commemoration and remembrance. Helen Suzman is one such a hero, and we honour her today.

Today, Suzman's values still course through the veins of the DA. As she said, we ""hate bullies, and stand for simple justice, equal opportunity and human rights"", and this basic ethos still guides our party today, as does her commitment to a society where race and the circumstances of one's birth do not define their life chances.

The struggle against apartheid had many heroes, all of whom rightly deserve commemoration and remembrance. All of their contributions helped in one way or another to the ending of apartheid and the dawn of democracy in 1994. Suzman is one such a hero, and we honour her today.

Suzman was fortunate enough to live to see the advent of democracy in 1994, but she also saw the beginnings of the ANC's perversion of the constitution and abuse of power.

Until her passing in January 2009, just months before the beginning of the Zuma presidency, she was still a regular contributor to the public debate: always raising the alarm about the divisive racial politics of the ANC, and the capture of the state through cadre deployment for private and political ends. She was clear that 1994 marked the end of one struggle but also the beginning of another.

Suzman laid the foundations for a truly united, prosperous and non-racial South Africa for all who live in it. The DA will continue to build on her legacy, until simple justice, equal opportunity and human rights are afforded to all.",The Values And Fighting Spirit Of Helen Suzman Are Still Alive,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/mmusi-maimane/the-values-and-fighting-spirit-of-helen-suzman-are-still-alive_a_23269019/

Denn in der RTl-Sendung werden Menschen aus der Provinz bloßgestellt - mit fatalen Folgen

Katastrophen fangen oft ganz harmlos an. So auch die neue Folge von „Bauer sucht Frau“, jener scheinbar putzigen und doch so giftigen Reality-Soap auf RTL.

Kameraschwenk über die thüringische Provinz. Hintergrundmusik: 70er-Jahre-Geträller. Rosi sitzt am Frühstückstisch eines Bauernhofs vor zwei drögen Scheiben Brot. Der Hausherr hat ein Milchtrauma aus der Jugend und kann keinen Käse riechen. Dafür hat er sie mit einem Pfund Butter überrascht.

Doch die Dame stellt ihn auf die Probe und drapiert den eigens mitgebrachten Edamer auf den Tisch.

Weibliche Stimme aus dem Off: „Auch Rosi erbringt einen Liebesbeweis, sie versteckt den Käse unter Marmelade.“ Der Bauer muss vor die Tür. „Nur die frische Landluft kann dem 66-Jährigen jetzt helfen. Rosi bleibt ratlos zurück. Muss sie sich vom Käse verabschieden, wenn sie bei Günter bleiben möchte?“, sagt die Sprecherin.

Nahaufnahme. Hintergrundmusik: italienisches Liebesgeschnulze.

Offenbarungseid der Sonderlichkeiten

Die ersten Minuten, die ersten Lacher. Das Muster bei „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist ewig gleich: Die ganze Sendung ist ein Spott auf die Mittelmäßigkeit der Provinz. Auf die Sorgen der Menschen. Auf deren Ausdrucksweise, Marotten und Schrullen. Das ist infam, und auch gefährlich.

Am größten ist die Freude bei dem Produzenten, wenn die ganzen, normalerweise aus verständlichen Gründen unbeleuchteten Peinlichkeiten des Kennenlernens mit der Lupe seziert werden.

Dann hält die Kamera drauf, als ginge es darum, den Mord an John F. Kennedy aufzuklären. Und ab und zu grinst Moderatorin Inka Bause in die Kamera.

Die kleinen und großen Fehlkommunikationen, die Missverständnisse. Das Offenbaren der eigenen Sonderlichkeiten, in der Hoffnung, der andere möge sie annehmen. Die Schwierigkeiten, sich ins Leben des anderen einzufühlen. All das ist hier ein großer Witz fürs Millionenpublikum.

Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten

So wird das Landleben zur Peep-Show für die Bessergestellten und für jene, die es werden wollen. Da können sich Lasse und Laura aus Prenzlauer Berg genauso wie Jupp und Jutta aus Krefeld in dem wohligen Gefühl ins Fernsehkissen drücken, dass sie in der besseren von zwei möglichen Welten an diesem Abend leben.

Nageldesignerin Christa darf die vollgeschissenen Kälber-Iglus abkärchern. In glänzenden Turnschühchen. Haha.

Der „waschechte Westerwälder“ Uwe trennt sich beim erzwungenen Küchenputzen schweren Herzens von einem, nach eigener Aussage, „jahrzehntealten“ Topflappen. Igitt, hihi.

Eine grantig schauende Bauernmama isst ein Gericht, das ihr die Schwiegertochter in spe zubereitet hat. Hintergrundmusik: „Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod“. Und, oh Wunder: Die ältere Dame ist eigentlich eine ganz liebe Person, bedankt sich, freut sich, macht ein paar ziemlich trockene, gute Witze. Hintergrundmusik: „Here Comes the Sun“. Hoho.

Die ganze Niedertracht der RTL-Fernsehmacher

Überhaupt: Am nervtötendsten ist der Soundtrack.

Mit schmalzigen Liebesliedern, die sich selbst der heißgelaufendste Kuchelrock-Ultra nicht in einer Öffentlichkeit zu spielen trauen würde, die größer ist als die eigene, demente Hauskatze; schunkeltauglichen Unterhaltungsschlagern aus der Wirtschaftswunderzeit mit dem Cool-Faktor von Schnarchpflastern; und amerikanischen Große-Welt-Songs, die einen ironischen Kontrast zu den Misthaufen der deutschen Provinz herstellen.

Hier wird die ganze Niedertracht der Fernsehmacher von RTL offensichtlich. Was für Eltern muss man haben, um anderen Menschen so eine spöttische Inszenierung anzutun?

Als Zuschauer kann solche Fernsehsendungen wegkonsumieren wie eine Tafel Milchschokolade, dafür sind sie ja gemacht.

Doch am Ende bleiben die Kalorien auf der Seele: Ist es wirklich richtig, dabei zuzusehen, wie ganz normale, bisweilen ziemlich liebenswert wirkende Menschen zum Belächelt- und Belachtwerden preisgegeben werden? Sollten wir wirklich dabei zuschauen, wie die deutsche Provinz als Hort der Unzulänglichkeiten dargestellt wird?

Eine bösartige Sendung

Nein, verdammt. „Bauer sucht Frau“ ist eine bösartige Sendung. Sie sorgt dafür, dass ganze Gesellschaftsschichten in Deutschland gegeneinander ausgespielt werden, nur damit RTL und der Bertelsmann-Konzern ihre Gewinnmarge steigern können.

Wenn wir über die Bruchlinien in unserer Gesellschaft sprechen, die derzeit zu immensen politischen Verwerfungen in Deutschland führen, dann fängt die Diagnose an einem beliebigen Abend bei Sendern wie RTL an. Wir haben verlernt, uns gegenseitig zu respektieren. Und das hat auch mit dem öffentlichen Bild zu tun, das von Milieus und Regionen medial produziert wird.

„Bauer sucht Frau“ ist Wahlwerbung für die AfD. Hier wird der Graben ausgeschaufelt, der Menschen in Deutschland trennt, und hinter dem jene Barrikaden errichtet werden, an denen derzeit gekämpft wird. Man kann RTL dafür nicht oft genug kritisieren.
