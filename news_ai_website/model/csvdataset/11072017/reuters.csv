Renzi - che parlerà stasera in diretta in un‘intervista su La7 - nella sua eNews respinge l‘accusa di essere il responsabile della sconfitta del centrosinistra in Sicilia.

“Siamo pronti ad allargare ancora al centro e alla nostra sinistra”, dice. “Sono mesi che cercano di mettermi da parte, ma non ci riusciranno nemmeno stavolta...qui non si molla di un centimetro”.

L‘obiettivo principale dei dirigenti dem non sembra però quello di “abbattere” Renzi, quanto di mettere insieme una coalizione di centrosinistra che abbia qualche chance di conquistare Palazzo Chigi, e decidere dopo il voto chi dovrà governare, sulla base dei voti ottenuti dai vari partiti alleati.

“Renzi è il nostro leader e il suo ruolo non è in discussione”, dice a Reuters il capogruppo Pd alla Camera, Ettore Rosato. “Dobbiamo però allargare la coalizione, e se avremo la ventura di arrivare al governo, chi ha più filo, tesserà”.

“Abbiamo Paolo Gentiloni che oggi è a Palazzo Chigi ed è un nome spendibile”, aveva detto in precedenza lo stesso Rosato alla trasmissione Radio Anch‘io di Rai Radio 1.

“Ce ne sono tanti, di nomi spendibili e Renzi lo ha detto chiaramente: lavoro per portare il Pd a Palazzo Chigi e non per portare Matteo Renzi”.

In un‘intervista pubblicata oggi dal “Corriere della Sera”, il ministro della Cultura Dario Franceschini esclude una “resa dei conti” nel Pd e ipotizza una sfida a tre per guidare un eventuale governo di centrosinistra, sulla base di quanti voti prenderanno le rispettive liste: Renzi, un centrista e un esponente di sinistra.

Il Pd lavora a un‘alleanza di centrosinistra, cercando di arrivare a un accordo almeno con Campo progressista (l‘area che fa riferimento all‘ex sindaco di Milano Giuliano Pisapia, e che potrebbe raccogliere anche Radicali e Verdi) e Mdp, composto da ex Pd in rotta proprio con Renzi. Più difficile invece il confronto con Sinistra Italiana, ex Sel, che pure era alleata del Pd alle elezioni del 2013.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving unit is launching a ride-hailing service for the general public with no human driver behind the steering wheel and has been testing such fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday.

The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon is a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.

Waymo said that members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology -- and without human drivers -- in the next few months.

At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car. The service will start free, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.",Waymo launching ride-hailing service in Phoenix with no human behind wheel,https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-selfdriving/waymo-launching-ride-hailing-service-in-phoenix-with-no-human-behind-wheel-idINKBN1D72CR

New Jersey voters are picking a new governor, to succeed outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several big cities are selecting mayors, and conservative Utah is holding a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended.

In Virginia, opinion polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor’s race that will offer clues about the U.S. political mood.

Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but has embraced the president’s combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

The ads put Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in polls in recent weeks in the Southern state, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points in last year’s presidential race.

“The momentum is clearly on our side,” Gillespie told Fox News on Monday.

Gillespie, however, has not won over Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and lives in Democratic-leaning Arlington. Peacemaker considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s nomination last year. Clinton won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington County, the most densely populated part of Virginia, nestled against the border of Washington, D.C.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” Peacemaker, who voted for Clinton, said on Tuesday

Trump’s influence on the race is significant even though the president was not highly engaged until the campaign’s final days, Peacemaker said. After winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies, Peacemaker added.

ANOTHER SETBACK FOR DEMOCRATS?

A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who lost four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.

Democrats fear such a victory would give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

“Gillespie’s ads played on every fear and dark impulse, and if we lose, we are going to see a lot more of that,” Democratic strategist Dane Strother said.

Gillespie rejected that characterization and said he was gaining ground against Northam because of his substantive policies and plans to bolster Virginia’s economy. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but never campaigned for him, backed that view on Monday.

“The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!” he wrote on Twitter.

In response, Northam tweeted that voting for him was “the best way to refute Trump’s lies.” The Virginia economy had an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in September, better than all but 13 states and below the national rate of just over 4 percent.

Trump’s argument resonated with Lee Hernandez, who works in finance and voted for Gillespie because he found the Republican’s message on economic improvement more persuasive.

Hernandez, a swing voter who also lives in Arlington, said he was bothered by Northam’s emphasis on “keeping Virginia blue (Democratic) or making it blue, and that really was a big turnoff.”

Gillespie’s campaign has blasted an ad aired by an outside pro-Northam group - quickly taken down - that showed a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie sticker chasing down minority children.

In the governor’s race in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead in polls over Republican Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor, who has been hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

In local races, Democratic Mayors Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston are expected to cruise to re-election, while Detroit, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina; and Seattle also will pick mayors.

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

They added that the number is continuing to rise.

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain.

Since Sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.

The banker did not name the companies affected but said they included listed and unlisted firms across many sectors.

He added that if the freezes stayed in place for long, they could start to hurt day-to-day business activities such as paying staff and creditors or making other transactions.

A second banker said, however, that most of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals rather than companies, and that banks were being allowed by the regulator to continue to fund existing commitments.

A central bank spokesman was not available to comment.

Among top business executives detained in the probe are billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of investment firm Kingdom Holding; Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar, founder of Al Tayyar Travel; and Amr al-Dabbagh, chairman of builder Red Sea International.

The stocks of all three companies, which have issued statements saying they continue to operate as normal, plunged between 9 and 10 percent on Tuesday.

One of the bankers speaking to Reuters said the central bank had met with some foreign banks this week to reassure them that the freezing of accounts targeted individuals, and that firms linked to those people would not be damaged.","Saudi banks freeze more than 1,200 accounts in probe, number still rising: sources",https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-accounts/saudi-banks-freeze-more-than-1200-accounts-in-probe-number-still-rising-sources-idINKBN1D725P

U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been “milking” Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power.

Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world’s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.

“Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it’s corruption that delays society’s development,” Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.

“God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,” said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see “correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.”

But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself.

Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom’s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts.

Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said.

INVESTOR NERVES

The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent.

Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.

In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index losing 2.8 percent.

The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry.

Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis.

A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.

“He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,” wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.

“In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.”

PIVOTAL POWER BASE

Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne.

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began.

The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.

“This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,” he said.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard’s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash. “I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,” he said.

But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.

“There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,” said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.

“Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.”","Saudi mass arrests jolt markets, play to ire over corruption",https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests/saudi-mass-arrests-jolt-markets-play-to-ire-over-corruption-idINKBN1D724C

Fox’s shares jumped 9.9 percent to close at $27.45 on Nasdaq, and Disney shares climbed 2.0 percent to $100.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The two sides are not currently talking, but had held talks in the last few weeks, CNBC reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

The discussions reflect a view among Fox executives that the media company could not reach the size needed to compete with Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and other major media players, according to CNBC. cnb.cx/2hgHcPA

Representatives of Disney and Fox had no comment.

For Disney, a deal could bring additional programming it could use to lure audiences as the company tries to navigate consumers’ rapid migration to digital viewing and compete with heavy spending by technology companies pushing further into Hollywood. It also could extend Disney’s reach into international markets.

Disney, which under U.S. rules could not own two broadcast networks, would not purchase all of Fox, CNBC reported. It would not seek to buy Fox’s sports programming assets for fear of running foul of antitrust laws with its own ESPN network, and also would not buy Fox News or Fox’s broadcast network or local broadcasting affiliates, the report said.

It did discuss buying Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and European pay TV provider Sky Plc, CNBC said.

Fox has bid $14.5 billion to acquire the remaining 61 percent of Sky it does not own, but the acquisition has been delayed by British regulators.

“I see lots of synergies for Disney. It’s a no-brainer,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. “The confusion is what it means for Fox.”

Traditional media giants are scrambling to increase their scale and add new businesses, particularly after AT&T’s bid for HBO and CNN owner Time Warner Inc, which is awaiting regulatory approval. Other media companies also could be interested in Fox’s assets, Wieser said.

Credit Suisse analysts said the talks increase uncertainty around the Sky transaction. Disney may want Sky as part of an international streaming strategy, but a deal also would deepen its exposure to traditional businesses that have been under pressure.

“It is not clear whether the main Disney shareholders will agree and give their support to management on this point,” the analysts said in a research note.

Disney has been struggling with subscriber declines at ESPN, its biggest network, and is planning to launch direct-to-consumer video streaming services to reach younger audiences that have shunned traditional cable and satellite offerings.

Chief Executive Bob Iger has said he plans to retire from Disney in July 2019, and the company is searching for a successor.

Much of Fox’s revenue has come from its cable division, which houses Fox News, FX and other channels. Fox said in August that it expects to see high single-digit domestic affiliate fee growth every quarter in fiscal 2018.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that Manafort had offered as security to get the court to lift house arrest and allow him to stop wearing an electronic monitoring device.

Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump associates.

They are charged with conspiring to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

Jackson said she was especially worried about life insurance policies Manafort had offered as part of an effort to secure better bail conditions.

The policies, valued at about $4.5 million are held in trust and in his wife’s name. But having a relative serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, Jackson said, “is very problematic.” Anyone serving in this capacity needs to provide details about their assets and liabilities, she said.

Life insurance policies held in trust tend to have many restrictions and can also be subject to asset forfeiture in the case of a conviction, the judge said.

“A lot of these details need to be nailed down” she said.

Prosecutors also say they are not yet satisfied they have enough details on how to value Manafort’s properties, including a condo he has in Trump Tower, the president’s signature building in New York.

Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election. Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt.

Slideshow (5 Images)

The judge last week also denied requests from Manafort and Gates for an easing of their bail conditions.

Jackson did grant a request from Gates to be allowed to leave his Virginia home on Tuesday to vote.

On Monday, the judge said she is not very likely to grant any requests for the freedom to travel internationally and is inclined to require the pair to stay in the Washington area for work, unless such trips are cleared in advance.

Currently, Manafort has promised to pay $10 million and Gates $5 million if they fail to appear for future court appearances.

Manafort is seeking permission to travel to New York where he has clients, as well as Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his attorney Kevin Downing said he has a telecommunications business involving secure and “virtually indestructible” cell phones.

NMDC plans to shortly send a team to Bhopal for talks with state authorities, one of the sources said.

“We initially wanted the central government to directly give us the mine through nomination but it was turned down,” another of the sources said, adding that the government wanted the mine to be sold via auction due to the large amount of interest.

The Bunder deposit, which is estimated to hold around 32 million carats of diamonds, was abandoned by global miner Rio Tinto earlier this year.

The state government is likely to auction the deposits later this month following planned changes to the National Mineral Policy that could enable wider participation, a senior state government official said on condition of anonymity.

The new policy is expected to lower the eligibility criteria for bidders on big projects, allowing bidders with a net worth of 2 percent of the value of a project’s resources, down from 4 percent currently, according to a draft.

“By Nov. 30, we will be issuing the notice inviting tender,” Manohar Lal Dubey, Madhya Pradesh’s top mineral resources official, told Reuters by phone.

NMDC did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comments.

RACE FOR DIAMONDS

Rio spent about $90 million over 14 years on Bunder, located in a forested area important to tiger and wildlife habitats, but the project was hampered by delays in obtaining environmental permissions.

Small teams from both Vedanta Resources, controlled by London-based Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, and fellow billionaire Gautam Adani’s Adani Group visited the site in recent months, three sources told Reuters last month.

NMDC already mines diamonds in the neighboring Majhgawan mine at Panna, Madhya Pradesh, where the company has extracted about 1 million carats of diamonds, according to information on the company’s website.

For the new round of bidding for Bunder, the Madhya Pradesh government has more than halved the mining area to 364 hectares (899 acres).

Separately to the current bidding process, NMDC plans to explore the remaining 590 hectares of the mine area after seeking approval from the National Mineral Exploration Trust, the sources said.

The environment ministry earlier this year gave an unofficial assurance of speedy forest clearance, the state government official said.

“We have their in-principle approval that there will not be delays.”

The area is, according to the environment ministry, a corridor between the Panna Tiger Reserve and the Navardehi Wildlife Sanctuary and has seen protests from environmentalists.

“The site is a protected forest not a reserve, so the density of trees isn’t the way the activists are claiming it is,” the official said.",Exclusive: India's state miner NMDC plans bid for $9 billion diamond mine - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-mining/exclusive-state-miner-nmdc-plans-bid-for-9-billion-diamond-mine-sources-say-idINKBN1D70Q6

CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last week announced that it would launch the futures contract of bitcoin, marking a major step in the digital currency’s path toward mainstream acceptance.

Melamed said he expects major investors to take part in bitcoin futures, which the exchange plans to start by the end of year.

“That’s a very important step for bitcoin’s history... We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,” Melamed told Reuters in an interview.

The futures will allow investors to short-sell bitcoins, making two-way bets possible, a development that he expects will attract major institutional investors, not just speculators.

Six-fold gains in the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP so far this year have stirred a debate among financial professionals on whether the digital currency represents a revolution in financial technology or just another tech bubble.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in September that bitcoin “is a fraud” and will blow up while regulators in many countries tightened their grip on its trading.

Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.

“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.

He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology.

Pundits say blockchain will enable the transfer of assets without a centralized system such as banks and sharply reduce costs of money transfer.

“My whole life is built abound new technology. I never said no to technology. People who say no to technology are soon dead. I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change. That’s what bitcoin represents,” he also said.

Melamed was elected chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. He moved to Chicago in his youth, having fled Nazi-occupied Poland with his family.

Melamed’s parents were among a small number of Jews to flee to Lithuania after Germany invaded their native town of Bialystok in Poland, he said.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year.","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

The case, in which a conservative Christian bakery owner seeks the right to discriminate against gay couples, is the latest attempt by conservatives to carve out special exemption for business owners to civil rights laws.

If the briefs filed by the petitioner and its most influential allies are any indication, the strategy will likely be to portray this case as a unique one that would warrant a very narrow constitutional exception. But don’t be fooled. If the state of Colorado’s application of its laws is found to be unconstitutional, it would unleash a widespread assault on civil rights protections.

In 2012, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to arrange for a cake to be made for their wedding reception. They were told by Jack Phillips, the store’s owner, that he could not fulfill their order because his religious beliefs prevented him from preparing goods for same-sex wedding ceremonies (although he was otherwise willing to serve LBGT customers). Mullins and Craig sued Masterpiece under Colorado civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations” (businesses or other institutions that are regularly open to the public). Mullins and Craig won: the Colorado Civil Rights Division agreed that Masterpiece had illegally discriminated against them, and its decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Masterpiece appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

It would be natural to assume that this case will be argued on the basis of freedom of religion protections in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has recently given companies broad freedom to ignore laws in deference to the owner’s religious faith. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court held that employers could reject requirements that taxpayer-subsidized employer-provided health insurance cover contraception if doing so would violate the religious beliefs. But while Masterpiece has raised religious freedom objections, the case is unlikely to turn on these grounds. Since the 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment is not violated when a religion-neutral law incidentally burdens an individual’s religious beliefs, as long as that law did not intentionally target religious minorities. Colorado’s application of civil rights law clearly did not violate the free exercise clause based on this precedent, so an argument solely on free religion grounds would be a certain loser.

The Hobby Lobby ruling was based not on the First Amendment but on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute passed in response to Employment Division. Since the 1997 Supreme Court ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, however, RFRA does not apply to state governments. It would therefore be nearly impossible for Masterpiece to prevail on a religious freedom claim.

Backed up by a brief from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, Masterpiece will almost certainly focus on another part of the First Amendment: the free speech clause. The shop is arguing that, given the artistry involved in creating a custom wedding cake, compelling it to create a cake for a ceremony it morally disapproves of would violate its rights to freedom of speech and expression.

Creating religious exceptions to generally applicable laws would make civil rights statutes very difficult to enforce, since discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation can all be defended on religious grounds. If applied logically, a religious exemption would quickly mean that civil rights laws exist only at the pleasure of the employer.

Recognizing this liability in a free expression argument, Masterpiece will likely claim that a free expression exemption applies only in the very narrow context of a mom-and-pop bakery being asked to make something for a particular ceremony. Most employees of most companies, they will argue, are not engaged in activity that is similarly expressive.

But as the libertarian legal scholars Dale Carpenter and Eugene Volokh argue in their persuasive amicus brief on behalf of Colorado, if Masterpiece’s free speech claim were accepted by the Court, it would “apply to a vast range of conduct.” Many of the activities employees and their supervisors engage in on the job have elements as potentially “expressive” as baking a cake, and this is true of both tiny storefronts and Fortune 500 corporations. “[Restaurant chain] Subway calls its sandwich-makers ‘sandwich artists,’” Carpenter and Volokh observe, “[b]ut a restaurant may not refuse to cook or prepare a table for certain customers on the ground that it would be a free speech compulsion.” Similarly, a florist who didn’t want to participate in a same-sex wedding could declare themselves “floral artists,” hotel receptionists could declare themselves “phone answering artists,” and so on.

It is unclear about where the line would end up being drawn should the Court accept Masterpiece’s free speech argument. But even if it ended up being fairly narrow, it would still require extensive litigation to find out. And it’s likely that in practice the exceptions would not be narrow at all. The wise approach for the Supreme Court would be to follow the lead of the Colorado court and uphold the sound judgement of the state’s civil rights commission: that while Jack Phillips is entitled to his beliefs, when he opens a business to the public he is required to follow state laws and treat his customers equally.

“God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,” said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see “correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.”

But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself.

Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom’s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts.

Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said.

INVESTOR NERVES

The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent.

Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.

In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index losing 2.8 percent.

The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry.

Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis.

A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.

“He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,” wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.

“In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.”

PIVOTAL POWER BASE

Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne.

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began.

The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.

“This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,” he said.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard’s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash. “I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,” he said.

But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.

“There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,” said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.

“Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.”","Saudi mass arrests jolt markets, play to ire over corruption",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-mass-arrests-jolt-markets-play-to-ire-over-corruption-idUSKBN1D71NN?il=0

With Iranian power winning out in Iraq and Syria, and Riyadh bogged down in a war with Iran-allied groups in Yemen, the new Saudi approach could bring lasting political and economic turmoil to a country where Tehran had appeared ascendant.

The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh and blamed on Iran and Hezbollah, is seen by many as the first step in an unprecedented Saudi intervention in Lebanese politics.

“The Saudis appear to have decided that the best way to confront Iran is to start in Lebanon,” a European diplomat said.

Riyadh is blaming Hezbollah for the resignation of Lebanon’s preeminent Sunni politician, accusing it of “hijacking” Lebanese politics. But Saudi Arabia is also widening blame to Lebanon as a whole, saying it too has declared war on the Kingdom.

A Saudi minister has made the near impossible demand that Lebanese act against a group that is a major part of Lebanon’s political fabric and far more powerful than the weak state, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military.

Coinciding with a major anti-corruption purge of top Saudis, Hariri’s shock announcement has given rise to suggestions from Hezbollah and others that his Saudi business interests had embroiled him in the probe and he was forced to resigning.

Saudi Arabia and Hariri’s allies deny that, and assertions that Hariri is under house arrest. They say his hand was forced by Hezbollah interventions in Arab countries in service of Iran.

POWER VACUUM

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Hezbollah had been “calling the shots” in the Hariri government, which included two Hezbollah ministers and was formed last year in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, head of state.

Hezbollah and its allies will struggle to form a government without Hariri or his blessing, leaving Lebanon in a protracted crisis that could eventually stir Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions, though there is no sign of this yet as all sides urge calm.

Announcing his resignation, Hariri cited an assassination plot against him and slammed Iran and Hezbollah for sowing strife and trying to “kidnap” Lebanon away from the Arab world. The declaration came as a surprise even to Hariri’s aides.

It is not clear what comes next: Saudi-backed efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon failed badly a decade ago, ending with a bout of Sunni-Shi‘ite fighting on the streets of Beirut that only underlined Hezbollah’s military dominance.

The regional struggle moved elsewhere in recent years, notably neighboring Syria where years of Saudi investment in rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad failed to withstand direct military intervention by Iran and Hezbollah.

In Iraq, Tehran-backed militias and Iranian commanders have often seemed as powerful as the U.S.-backed Iraqi military, most recently in an operation to retake Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.

So emboldened was Iran that top Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati trumpeted his regional alliance’s success from Beirut last Friday, declaring victories in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His statement to the media after a meeting with Hariri was seen as a major provocation to regional Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia.

Hariri left for Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards, cancelling previously scheduled engagements and catching even his closest advisors off guard the next day with a declaration first broadcast by Saudi-owned media.

The regional standoff flared in the Gulf hours later, with Iran-allied groups firing a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen. Saudi Arabia says it was launched by Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has not responded to the accusation.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government responded on Tuesday to the Saudi accusation, voiced by Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war.

“The Lebanese government will be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia, and all Lebanese must realize these dangers and work to resolve the issues before we reach the point of no return,” he said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.

Crown Prince Mohammed told Reuters last month the war in Yemen would continue to prevent the Iran-allied Houthi movement from becoming another Hezbollah at Saudi’s border.

SANCTIONS CALL

Hezbollah was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli troops in Lebanon. Its last major war with Israel was in 2006, since when Hezbollah has grown stronger.

While Sabhan vowed that Hezbollah would be forced back into “its caves” in southern Lebanon, any Saudi military action in Lebanon - such as air strikes - would come as a major surprise.

Political paralysis and tension is however a big threat to an already stagnant economy, and could derail next year’s parliamentary elections - Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Policymakers have scrambled to calm concern over the financial stability of the heavily indebted state. They say the Lebanese pound - pegged against the dollar at the same rate for 20 years - is stable.

Hariri was spearheading efforts to garner international aid to help Lebanon deal with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of the population.

Leaders on all sides say there should be no further escalation. Both Hezbollah and Hariri’s Future Movement have worked to contain Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions during the war in neighboring Syria.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for calm and patience in the face of Hariri’s resignation. Okab Sakr, a member of Hariri’s Future Movement, noted that protests in solidarity with Hariri had been canceled to avoid trouble.

Sabhan, the Saudi minister, has called for “real sanctions” and alliances “to find a fundamental solution to this cancerous disease”, saying Hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of government.

Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, led years of political struggle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. But his Saudi-backed “March 14” coalition failed to make any progress toward Hezbollah’s disarmament as demanded by U.N. resolutions.

Echoing the Saudi position, the United States has also taken new measures targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump takes a tougher stance toward Iran.

It has offered a bounty for two Hezbollah officials, and the House of Representatives has backed new sanctions targeting entities found to support it.",Saudi reopens Lebanon front in struggle with Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D72B7

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen expanded on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly detained in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The reported arrest of Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar followed the detention of dozens of top Saudis including billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a crackdown that the attorney general described as “phase one”.

The purge is the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astounded that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader.”

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing 4080.SE and Red Sea International 4230.SE separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

“It’s mostly princes from the previous system who made a lot of money in business. That’s the common denominator,” Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics told Reuters.

“Perhaps they can’t go after all at the same time so possibly ones who are least popular or have a beef with the current leadership (have been held). It’s pretty systematic.”

The allegations include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

Trump’s address to South Korea’s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America’s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict.

It contrasted markedly with Trump’s earlier threats to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea’s doorstep, will build on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue.

Trump’s official “talking points” for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea’s “amazing rise” with North Korea’s “sad, backward state” and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record.

PRESSING BEIJING TO EXERT LEVERAGE

Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions.

Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea’s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.

“President Xi … has been very helpful. We’ll find out how helpful soon,” Trump said.

But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests.

“On this issue, China’s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday. “Everyone can see clearly that we don’t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.”

But with Trump appearing to crack open the door to diplomacy with North Korea – something that China has long urged – he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea.

For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April.

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday.

Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details.","Trump to give major North Korea speech, then press China to do more",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia/trump-to-give-major-north-korea-speech-then-press-china-to-do-more-idUSKBN1D725C

It is estimated that seven million people are facing famine there.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country to stem the flow of arms from Iran.

The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.

The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden, to discuss the humanitarian situation in Yemen, diplomats said in New York.

“We call for all air and sea ports to remain open to ensure food, fuel and medicines can enter the country,” Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs said in Geneva.

He said humanitarian operations are currently “blocked” because air and sea ports in Yemen are closed,

The Saudi-led coalition has told the world body to “inform all commercial vessels at Hodeidah and Saleef ports to leave”, Laerke said, referring to Red Sea ports controlled by the Houthis.

The price of fuel jumped 60 percent “overnight” in Yemen and the price of cooking gas doubled, he said. “This is an access problem of colossal dimensions right now.”

SUPPLY LINES

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the call.

“Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year,” Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement.

The ICRC said that a shipment of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera did not get clearance at Yemen’s northern border. It voiced fears for 50,000 vials of insulin for diabetics due to be delivered by next week, which require constant refrigeration.

ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said that a ship carrying 500 metric tonnes of rice, which arrived in Hodeidah port in October after a three-month trip from Pakistan, had to leave the port last week without offloading because the ship’s crane had broken.

The port itself lacks adequate cranes after repeated coalition bombing.

Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, said it would study whether the blockade amounted to “collective punishment”, banned under international law, but hoped that it would be temporary.

Attacks in Yemen over the past week that have killed dozens of civilians, including children, at markets and homes, he said.

These included at least nine air strikes on the Houthi-held city of Sanaa since Saturday, when a missile was fired from Yemen toward the Saudi capital of Riyadh, he said.

A cholera epidemic has caused 908,702 suspected cases and 2,194 deaths since the outbreak began in April, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.

Ali is the first person to announce he is running against Sisi, a former military commander who led the ouster of former President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood over four years ago.

Ali told a news conference he would have a socialist platform, aiming to end austerity and redistribute wealth, and fight terrorism without compromising freedom.

He criticized Sisi’s administration, accusing it of suppressing freedoms and causing deteriorating economic and security conditions.

“In spite of all the darkness, there is still hope. I call on all segments of society to unite in collective struggle to reclaim this hope and to rescue this nation,” he said.

“It is because of this that I have decided today to launch a presidential campaign.”

Sisi himself has yet to declare if he will run but is widely expected to do so. He won 97 percent of the vote in 2014.

Many in Egypt see him as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy.

Under Sisi’s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed. The government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls.

Ali said earlier on Monday security forces had raided a printing press and seized materials for his campaign, after media reports that he was expected to announce his candidacy.

Security forces accused the owner of the press of printing “documents that harm national security”, Ali told Reuters.

State news agency MENA said a “high ranking security source” denied police had raided a printing press.

If it appeared elections were being rigged, Ali said, he would call for a boycott by opposition candidates, forcing Sisi to be the sole contender.

Egypt’s presidency could not be reached for comment on Ali’s plan to run.

RED SEA ISLANDS

State-owned newspaper al-Gomhuriya ran an article on Monday with the headline “Khaled Ali and the ploys of dwarves”, attacking him as an attention-seeker.

It said Ali had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and received illegal foreign funding. It did not provide evidence for its claims, which Ali denies.

A Cairo court sentenced Ali in September to three months in jail for public indecency, over an allegedly rude hand gesture.

Ali has appealed, denying the charges which he says are politically motivated. If the guilty verdict is upheld he will not be allowed to run, even if he is not jailed.

The 45-year-old gained prominence in January when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests. It was after winning that case that Ali is alleged to have made the gesture.

Egypt’s reclaiming of the islands would be a cornerstone of his campaign, he said. He told Reuters in an interview in June the case had swayed the opinion of many former Sisi supporters who oppose ceding sovereign territory.

Ali ran for president in 2012 and came seventh. He was the youngest candidate at 40, the minimum age required to run.

He now leads the leftwing Bread and Freedom Party, at least eight of whose members have been arrested since April on charges including “misusing social media to incite against the state” and insulting the president.",Egyptian rights lawyer says he'll run for president in 2018,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D70ME-OZATP

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year.","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

Gigaba shocked financial markets last month by flagging wider deficits and rising government debt in a closely watched budget speech, attributing the dismal forecasts to sluggish growth and low tax receipts.

On Tuesday he told a news conference that Zuma had granted his request for an inquiry by a judge into the administration and governance of the South African Revenue Service (SARS).

He added that the inquiry would be set up soon.

“It is critical for government to determine the cause of the tax revenue under-collection in order to enable government to take urgent remedial steps to ensure that SARS is able to meet its revenue targets,” Gigaba told reporters.

South Africa’s strained public finances are in the spotlight ahead of ratings reviews scheduled by major international agencies Moody’s and S&P Global later this month.

If Moody’s and S&P downgrade South Africa’s local-currency rating one notch to sub-investment grade, or “junk” status, that could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of the country’s bonds.

The gloom is compounded by allegations of influence-peddling in government that have hurt investor confidence, as well as infighting in the ruling African National Congress as it prepares to elect a new leader to succeed Zuma in December.

Zuma’s two terms as president have seen growth slow to a near-standstill and have been marred by a series of corruption scandals, including over spending of state money on upgrading his private Nkandla home.

SAA TURNAROUND

Gigaba also addressed concerns about struggling state-owned South African Airways (SAA) on Tuesday, saying liquidity issues at the national airline had been attended to.

SAA relies on government guarantees to keep it solvent and has been cited by the ratings agencies as a threat to South Africa’s public finances.

Introducing new board members appointed to help turn around SAA, Gigaba said there were many investors interested in taking an equity stake in the airline and that he wanted to consolidate its assets.

He said: “We will continue ... to have discussions about the strategic equity partner for South African Airways because ultimately we are going to need not only private sector capital, but also expertise for us to move forward and bring SAA back to sustainability.”",South Africa to investigate tax service after Zuma gives go-ahead,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1D70XY-OZABS

Republicans plan to bring their tax overhaul bill for a vote next week, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said on Tuesday, adding that he expects the plan to pass.

House Republicans last week unveiled a first draft that proposed a range of cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

“The market is waiting for the next catalyst, which is the tax bill,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.

“It looks like, unless some major unforeseen event occurs, tax cuts will get passed in some shape or form. Whether (corporate tax cuts) it’s 20 percent or 25 percent, a big tax cut is coming.”

The S&P has risen about 15 percent in 2017 on the back on strong earnings, an improving economy and Trump’s promise to cut taxes.

With more than 400 of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings for the third quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared with expectations of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid.

“I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager told a news briefing on the sidelines of an international tech summit in Lisbon.

“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said.

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland.

“We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said.

She also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any investigation.

“That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.”

The European Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple.

Slideshow (5 Images)The judge last week also denied requests from Manafort and Gates for an easing of their bail conditions.
Currently, Manafort has promised to pay $10 million and Gates $5 million if they fail to appear for future court appearances.
A spokesman for Manafort could not immediately provide details on the business when asked by Reuters on Monday.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. district judge again declined to ease bail conditions for President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business associate Richard Gates on Monday, saying they still needed to provide more financial information.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that Manafort had offered as security to get the court to lift house arrest and allow him to stop wearing an electronic monitoring device.

Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump associates.

They are charged with conspiring to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

Jackson said she was especially worried about life insurance policies Manafort had offered as part of an effort to secure better bail conditions.

The policies, valued at about $4.5 million are held in trust and in his wife’s name. But having a relative serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, Jackson said, “is very problematic.” Anyone serving in this capacity needs to provide details about their assets and liabilities, she said.

Life insurance policies held in trust tend to have many restrictions and can also be subject to asset forfeiture in the case of a conviction, the judge said.

“A lot of these details need to be nailed down” she said.

Prosecutors also say they are not yet satisfied they have enough details on how to value Manafort’s properties, including a condo he has in Trump Tower, the president’s signature building in New York.

Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election. Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt.

The judge last week also denied requests from Manafort and Gates for an easing of their bail conditions.

Jackson did grant a request from Gates to be allowed to leave his Virginia home on Tuesday to vote.

On Monday, the judge said she is not very likely to grant any requests for the freedom to travel internationally and is inclined to require the pair to stay in the Washington area for work, unless such trips are cleared in advance.

Currently, Manafort has promised to pay $10 million and Gates $5 million if they fail to appear for future court appearances.

Manafort is seeking permission to travel to New York where he has clients, as well as Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his attorney Kevin Downing said he has a telecommunications business involving secure and “virtually indestructible” cell phones.

A spokesman for Manafort could not immediately provide details on the business when asked by Reuters on Monday.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed's investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04","RIYADH (Reuters) - A campaign of mass arrests of Saudi Arabian royals, ministers and businessmen expanded on Monday after a top entrepreneur was reportedly detained in the biggest anti-corruption purge of the kingdom’s affluent elite in its modern history.

The reported arrest of Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar followed the detention of dozens of top Saudis including billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a crackdown that the attorney general described as “phase one”.

The purge is the latest in a series of dramatic steps by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

The campaign lengthens an already daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015, including going to war in Yemen, cranking up Riyadh’s confrontation with arch-foe Iran and reforming the economy to lessen its reliance on oil.

Both allies and adversaries are quietly astounded that a kingdom once obsessed with stability has acquired such a taste for assertive - some would say impulsive - policy-making.

“The kingdom is at a crossroads: Its economy has flatlined with low oil prices; the war in Yemen is a quagmire; the blockade of Qatar is a failure; Iranian influence is rampant in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq; and the succession is a question mark,” wrote ex-CIA official Bruce Riedel.

“It is the most volatile period in Saudi history in over a half-century.”

The crackdown has drawn no public opposition within the kingdom either on the street or social media. Many ordinary Saudis applauded the arrests, the latest in a string of domestic and international moves asserting the prince’s authority.

But abroad, critics perceive the purge as further evidence of intolerance from a power-hungry leader keen to stop influential opponents blocking his economic reforms or reversing the expansion of his political clout.

Prominent Saudi columnist Jamal Kashoggi applauded the campaign, but warned: “He is imposing very selective justice.”

“The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism - the demand for complete loyalty with a significant ‘or else’ - remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader.”

“The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country,” he wrote in the Washington Post.

ACCOUNTS FROZEN

The Saudi stock index initially fell 1.5 percent in early trade but closed effectively flat, which asset managers attributed to buying by government-linked funds.

Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE plunged 10 percent in the opening minutes after the company quoted media reports as saying board member Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar had been detained in the anti-corruption drive.

Saudi Aseer Trading, Tourism and Manufacturing 4080.SE and Red Sea International 4230.SE separately reported normal operations after the reported detentions of board members Abdullah Saleh Kamel, Khalid al-Mulheim and Amr al-Dabbagh.

Saudi banks have begun freezing suspects’ accounts, sources told Reuters.

Dozens of people have been detained in the crackdown, which have alarmed much of the traditional business establishment. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s best-known international investor, is also being held.

The attorney general said on Monday detainees had been questioned and “a great deal of evidence” had been gathered.

“Yesterday does not represent the start, but the completion of Phase One of our anti-corruption push,” Saud al-Mojeb said. Probes were done discreetly “to preserve the integrity of the legal proceedings and ensure there was no flight from justice.”

Investigators had been collecting evidence for three years and would “continue to identify culprits, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions and bring offenders to justice”, anti-graft committee member Khalid bin Abdulmohsen Al-Mehaisen said.

“THE NOOSE TIGHTENS”

The front page of leading Saudi newspaper Okaz challenged businessmen to reveal the sources of their assets, asking: “Where did you get this?”

Another headline from Saudi-owned al-Hayat warned: “After the launch (of the anti-corruption drive), the noose tightens, whomever you are!”

A no-fly list has been drawn up and security forces in some Saudi airports were barring owners of private jets from taking off without a permit, pan-Arab daily Al-Asharq Al-Awsat said.

Among those detained are 11 princes, four ministers and tens of former ministers, according to Saudi officials.

“It’s mostly princes from the previous system who made a lot of money in business. That’s the common denominator,” Steffen Hertog of the London School of Economics told Reuters.

“Perhaps they can’t go after all at the same time so possibly ones who are least popular or have a beef with the current leadership (have been held). It’s pretty systematic.”

Slideshow (4 Images)

The allegations include money laundering, bribery, extortion and taking advantage of public office for personal gain, a Saudi official told Reuters. Those accusations could not be independently verified and family members of those detained could not be reached.

The new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known. Investors worry the crackdown could ultimately result in forced sales of equities, but the extent of the authorities’ intentions was not immediately clear.

“OVERKILL”

Among those detained is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June which ousted his elder cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne.

The moves consolidate Prince Mohammed’s control of the internal security and military institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.

Consultancy Eurasia Group said the “clearly politicized” anti-corruption campaign was a step toward separating the Al Saud family from the state: “Royal family members have lost their immunity, a long standing golden guarantee”.

Yet many analysts were puzzled by the targeting of technocrats like ousted Economy Minister Adel Faqieh and prominent businessmen on whom the kingdom is counting to boost the private sector and wean the economy off oil.

“It seems to run so counter to the long-term goal of foreign investment and more domestic investment and a strengthened private sector,” said Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University.

“If your goal really is anti-corruption, then you bring some cases. You don’t just arrest a bunch of really high-ranking people and emphasize that the rule of law is not really what guides your actions.”

Over the past year, MbS has become the top decision-maker on military, foreign and economic policy, championing subsidy cuts, state asset sales and a government efficiency drive.

The reforms have been well-received by much of Saudi Arabia’s overwhelmingly young population, but resented among some of the more conservative old guard.

The crown prince has also led Saudi Arabia into a two-year-old war in Yemen, where the government says it is fighting Iran-aligned militants, and into a dispute with Qatar, which it accuses of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denies. Detractors of the crown prince say both moves are dangerous adventurism.

The Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would temporarily close all air, land and sea ports to Yemen to stem the flow of arms from Iran to Houthi rebels after a missile fired toward Riyadh was intercepted over the weekend.

Officials said Sumgong, who became the first Kenyan woman to win an Olympic marathon title when she struck gold in Rio last year, had failed an out of competition test in April, days before she was due to defend her London Marathon title. Her four-year ban has been backdated to April 3.

The matter was taken to the Sports Disputes Tribunal by ADAK, as recommended by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code.

The ruling said that the athlete owned up to her “unfortunate offense and unintended mistake.” She did not request that her B sample be tested after her A sample was returned from Lausanne.

The 32-year-old’s claim that she failed the test after undergoing treatment at a Kenyan hospital for an ectopic pregnancy was rejected as “not authentic” by the tribunal, as the hospital in question denied treating the athlete.

Sumgong became Kenya’s latest high profile athlete to fail a drugs test after former Boston and Chicago Marathon champion, Rita Jeptoo, also tested positive for EPO in 2014 and was banned for four years.

Up to 40 athletes from the east African nation have failed tests in the past five years.

With Iranian power winning out in Iraq and Syria, and Riyadh bogged down in a war with Iran-allied groups in Yemen, the new Saudi approach could bring lasting political and economic turmoil to a country where Tehran had appeared ascendant.

The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh and blamed on Iran and Hezbollah, is seen by many as the first step in an unprecedented Saudi intervention in Lebanese politics.

“The Saudis appear to have decided that the best way to confront Iran is to start in Lebanon,” a European diplomat said.

Riyadh is blaming Hezbollah for the resignation of Lebanon’s preeminent Sunni politician, accusing it of “hijacking” Lebanese politics. But Saudi Arabia is also widening blame to Lebanon as a whole, saying it too has declared war on the Kingdom.

A Saudi minister has made the near impossible demand that Lebanese act against a group that is a major part of Lebanon’s political fabric and far more powerful than the weak state, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military.

Coinciding with a major anti-corruption purge of top Saudis, Hariri’s shock announcement has given rise to suggestions from Hezbollah and others that his Saudi business interests had embroiled him in the probe and he was forced to resigning.

Saudi Arabia and Hariri’s allies deny that, and assertions that Hariri is under house arrest. They say his hand was forced by Hezbollah interventions in Arab countries in service of Iran.

POWER VACUUM

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Hezbollah had been “calling the shots” in the Hariri government, which included two Hezbollah ministers and was formed last year in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, head of state.

Hezbollah and its allies will struggle to form a government without Hariri or his blessing, leaving Lebanon in a protracted crisis that could eventually stir Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions, though there is no sign of this yet as all sides urge calm.

Announcing his resignation, Hariri cited an assassination plot against him and slammed Iran and Hezbollah for sowing strife and trying to “kidnap” Lebanon away from the Arab world. The declaration came as a surprise even to Hariri’s aides.

It is not clear what comes next: Saudi-backed efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon failed badly a decade ago, ending with a bout of Sunni-Shi‘ite fighting on the streets of Beirut that only underlined Hezbollah’s military dominance.

The regional struggle moved elsewhere in recent years, notably neighboring Syria where years of Saudi investment in rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad failed to withstand direct military intervention by Iran and Hezbollah.

In Iraq, Tehran-backed militias and Iranian commanders have often seemed as powerful as the U.S.-backed Iraqi military, most recently in an operation to retake Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.

So emboldened was Iran that top Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati trumpeted his regional alliance’s success from Beirut last Friday, declaring victories in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His statement to the media after a meeting with Hariri was seen as a major provocation to regional Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia.

Hariri left for Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards, cancelling previously scheduled engagements and catching even his closest advisors off guard the next day with a declaration first broadcast by Saudi-owned media.

The regional standoff flared in the Gulf hours later, with Iran-allied groups firing a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen. Saudi Arabia says it was launched by Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has not responded to the accusation.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government responded on Tuesday to the Saudi accusation, voiced by Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war.

“The Lebanese government will be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia, and all Lebanese must realize these dangers and work to resolve the issues before we reach the point of no return,” he said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.

Crown Prince Mohammed told Reuters last month the war in Yemen would continue to prevent the Iran-allied Houthi movement from becoming another Hezbollah at Saudi’s border.

SANCTIONS CALL

Hezbollah was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli troops in Lebanon. Its last major war with Israel was in 2006, since when Hezbollah has grown stronger.

While Sabhan vowed that Hezbollah would be forced back into “its caves” in southern Lebanon, any Saudi military action in Lebanon - such as air strikes - would come as a major surprise.

Political paralysis and tension is however a big threat to an already stagnant economy, and could derail next year’s parliamentary elections - Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Policymakers have scrambled to calm concern over the financial stability of the heavily indebted state. They say the Lebanese pound - pegged against the dollar at the same rate for 20 years - is stable.

Hariri was spearheading efforts to garner international aid to help Lebanon deal with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of the population.

Leaders on all sides say there should be no further escalation. Both Hezbollah and Hariri’s Future Movement have worked to contain Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions during the war in neighboring Syria.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for calm and patience in the face of Hariri’s resignation. Okab Sakr, a member of Hariri’s Future Movement, noted that protests in solidarity with Hariri had been canceled to avoid trouble.

Sabhan, the Saudi minister, has called for “real sanctions” and alliances “to find a fundamental solution to this cancerous disease”, saying Hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of government.

Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, led years of political struggle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. But his Saudi-backed “March 14” coalition failed to make any progress toward Hezbollah’s disarmament as demanded by U.N. resolutions.

Echoing the Saudi position, the United States has also taken new measures targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump takes a tougher stance toward Iran.

It has offered a bounty for two Hezbollah officials, and the House of Representatives has backed new sanctions targeting entities found to support it.",Saudi reopens Lebanon front in struggle with Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-hariri-analysis/saudi-reopens-lebanon-front-in-struggle-with-iran-idUSKBN1D72BA

Pressed on whether he would retain the interest in Navigator Holdings, Ross told Bloomberg Television: “I’ve been actually selling it anyway, but that isn’t because of this.”

Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, was criticized when several media outlets reported that he had failed to disclose that one of Navigator’s clients is Russian gas and petrochemical company Sibur.

Sibur’s owners include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions.

The information is based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L). They were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets and published on Sunday.

Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Ross said in multiple media interviews that he had fully disclosed his stake in Navigator Holdings as part of government ethics requirements.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which was included in Ross’ 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest holdings that posed conflicts.

Blumenthal called for an investigation and hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC.

Senate Commerce Committee spokesman Frederick Hill said that Ross’ interest in Navigator was disclosed to the panel, but added: “The committee expects Secretary Ross will follow the advice of his department’s ethics officials should there be a determination that any holding creates a conflict of interest.”

Navigator did not come up at Ross’ confirmation hearing in January, but he was asked about his decision to retain an interest in Diamond S Shipping, which operates 33 petroleum product tankers.

Ross said his research showed that no ocean shipping cases had ever come before the Commerce Department. Ocean shipping is regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission, an independent agency.

But asked by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell if he would look at additional areas for possible further recusals from potential conflicts of interest, Ross replied: “I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal in any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of a doubt.”

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified with investigations into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

Officials from Navigator could not be reached for comment.

Appleby released a statement late on Sunday saying that the release of its documents was the result of “an illegal computer hack” and not a leak.

“An agreed leave of absence implies no presumption or acceptance of guilt and allows Professor Ramadan to address the extremely serious allegations made against him, all of which he categorically denies,” it added.

The Geneva-born academic, the grandson of Hasan al-Banna, an Islamist thinker and activist who founded the Muslim Brotherhood, has denied allegations made by the two women, including author Henda Ayari, who said he raped her at a Muslim convention in 2012.

The Paris prosecutor last month opened a preliminary probe over the accusations following Ayari’s complaint. Ramadan filed a complaint for slander against her.

On Tuesday Ramadan published on his Facebook page, in French, the same statement as Oxford University, adding that he welcomed the university’s handling of the situation.

Separately, prosecutors on Monday opened an investigation into death threats on Twitter against satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo for a front page cover it published over the rape accusations targetting Ramadan.

Despite dominating the sector in Brazil, Uber has joined forces with three smaller apps for a public campaign that helped convince senators last week to scrap parts of a bill that would have effectively turned the companies into regular taxi services.

With Uber facing a possible ban in London and several U.S. federal investigations, the company’s new Chief Executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, needed a win in Brazil. The South American country is its second-largest market after the United States and Sao Paulo, Brazil’s economic capital, has more Uber rides than New York.

Together with Spain’s Cabify and Brazilian apps 99 and Lady Driver - which focuses on women drivers and customers - Uber recruited digital influencers and flooded social media with messages asking their users to call their lawmakers.

Under the slogan “Together for Mobility,” the apps got thousands of their drivers onto the streets of Brazil’s cities in protest, while the country managers of Uber, 99 and Cabify made a video together warning Brazilians that ride-hailing was in danger of being suffocated by red tape.

The collaboration with competitors may be an early sign of Khosrowshahi’s strategy of fighting unwanted regulation with a less confrontational approach than his outspoken predecessor Travis Kalanick.

“We called on drivers and users to mobilize by gathering signatures in support of alternative regulation for the apps,” said Fabio Sabba, chief spokesman for Uber in Brazil, adding that 816,000 people signed the petition presented to Congress.

In their amended bill, senators dropped requirements that drivers own their cars and use the same red license plates used by public taxis, though they left a ban on rides outside the city where the car is registered.

While drivers will still have to register with municipal authorities, they will not be classed as public transport if the amendments stand, and no city would be able ban car-hailing services or limit their numbers.

“Together we boosted public awareness of the issue and the Senate accepted the amendments,” said Daniel Bedoya, Brazil manager at Cabify, which operates in 11 countries and had never teamed up with Uber before.

The ride-booking firms said they are confident public pressure will sway Brazil’s lower house to accept the Senate’s amendments, a milestone in efforts to roll back a regulatory crackdown that could jeopardize their rapid global expansion.

But the battle is far from over. There is no date scheduled for the final vote and the leftist Workers Party, backed by taxi unions, has vowed to undo the changes.

ATTRACTING INVESTMENT

Tough regulation would slam the brakes on foreign investment into the fast-growing Brazilian market, where car-hailing apps have taken off explosively due to disastrous public transport and the belief that online booking is safer in crime-ridden cities.

In January, China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, announced plans to invest $100 million in 99, an on-demand taxi and ride-sharing service. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) followed suit in May with its own $100 million investment in the Brazilian app.

Stricter regulation would be a blow for Uber, which has 80 percent of the Brazilian market, as Japan’s SoftBank and other investors are negotiating the terms of a $10 billion investment in the company.

The debate in Brazil comes shortly after authorities in London decided not to renew Uber’s operating license and highlights the legal threats against its foreign operations as the company prepares for an initial public offering IPO as soon as 2019.

With the stakes high, Khosrowshahi flew at short notice to Brasilia last week to join lobbying efforts on the day the bill went to a Senate vote in the country’s capital.

Striking a more conciliatory style than the combative Kalanick, Khosrowshahi kept his cool after senators refused to meet with him but publicly warned that Uber’s future in Latin America’s largest economy depended on the decision.

The company was careful to emphasize the impact on ordinary Brazilians, saying the bill would leave its 500,000 drivers out of work by making it too expensive to operate.

Uber’s allies played their part. Lady Driver founder Gabriela Corrêa said she lobbied the 13 women senators in the corridors of Congress, telling them many of her drivers were mothers who depended on the app for their families’ livelihood.

Lady Driver began in February in Sao Paulo and is expanding fast in an activity long-dominated by men. The app has 9,500 drivers and will launch in November in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second-largest city.

“Congressmen won’t undo the amendments because they have realized that ride-hailing is needed today,” she said. “If we go back to the past, women will lose ground.”","Uber, rival apps join forces in Brazil to stem tide of regulation",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D71KE-OCATC

Fresh NATO personnel will not have a combat role but the alliance hopes more soldiers can train the Afghan army and air force to complement U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to send more American counter-terrorism troops to the country.

“We have decided to increase the number of troops ... to help the Afghans break the stalemate, to send a message to the Taliban, to the insurgents that they will not win on the battleground,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday.

NATO defense ministers are expected to approve the deployment in the latter part of a two-day meeting that starts on Wednesday.

The troops would be deployed from the start of 2018, a NATO official said.

The West says it is determined to stabilize a country facing resurgent rebels 16 years after the United States sought to topple the Taliban rulers who had harbored the al Qaeda militants behind attacks on New York and Washington.

Stoltenberg said an attack on Tuesday on a television station in Kabul underlined the importance of fighting militants and supporting Afghan security forces. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault, without giving evidence.

Trump’s envoy to NATO, Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchinson, said the U.S. goal was to show Taliban militants they could not win in military combat.

Trump’s strategy in Afghanistan, unveiled in August, rests on providing more troops, a stronger Afghan army, support from regional allies such as India and a harder line with Pakistan.

U.S. officials say Pakistan provides refuge and support to the Taliban and other extremist groups, which Pakistan denies.

“We’d like to see Pakistan come in, in a positive effort to help stabilize Afghanistan,” Hutchinson said.

There have been several attempts in recent years to broker a settlement between the Western-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban, but all have failed. Without the militants at the table, experts say it is hard to envisage a peace settlement.

NATO allies have already promised almost $3 billion to help the United States fund the Afghan military until 2020, which is developing an air force to complement its ground forces.

Troop contributions had rested on NATO allies seeing more details about Trump’s strategy, diplomats said.

NUMBERS GAME

The NATO contribution would boost the training mission, called Resolute Support, to around 16,000 troops, Stoltenberg said. About half the additional troops would come from the United States and the rest from NATO allies and partner countries.

U.S. Army General John Nicholson, the commander of the Resolute Support mission and of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in February that a few thousand more troops would make a difference.

About 11,000 U.S. troops are serving in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said in August, including almost 7,000 in Resolute Support, according to NATO data.

Under Trump’s new strategy, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in September that more than 3,000 additional U.S. troops would be deployed to Afghanistan.

Taken together, the new deployments could take the total number of Western troops in the country to above 20,000, according to current and projected troop numbers -- well below a 2011 peak of more than 100,000.",NATO to send more troops to Afghanistan after U.S. shift,https://www.reuters.com/article/nato-afghanistan/nato-to-send-more-troops-to-afghanistan-after-u-s-shift-idINKBN1D71G1

Last year’s Panama Papers helped to topple elected leaders. Now an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists into 13.4 million financial statements, emails, loan agreements and other paperwork has uncovered politicians, financiers and companies using secrecy to hide transactions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had an investment in a shipping firm with significant ties to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ICIJ says. Even Queen Elizabeth invested through offshore companies.

There can be legitimate reasons for wanting to hide business interests offshore, especially for those living in turbulent countries. But getting away from tax and law-enforcement authorities is getting more complicated, and therefore dearer.

More than 100 jurisdictions – including several offshore financial centres – have committed to automatically exchange tax information with foreign governments. About 50 started sharing data in September, making it harder for individuals and companies to hide their financial dealings. Meanwhile, countries including Britain and Sweden have passed legislation that forces foreign companies and legal entities operating within their borders to disclose their ultimate owner – bypassing the often complex chain of offshore vehicles and trusts. Others, including the United States, are also introducing or tightening beneficial ownership rules.

Regulation will not stop the global flow of illicit money. Loopholes can always be found, and there are enough dark spots on the planet. But technology which makes it easier to download, distribute and organise massive volumes of data also facilitates leaks.

Matthew Stafford threw his 200th career touchdown pass as the Lions beat the punchless Packers 30-17 on Monday.

Stafford passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns. Golden Tate had seven catches for 113 yards and Marvin Jones had seven receptions for 107 yards and two touchdowns.

A bye week did nothing to help the Packers. With Aaron Rodgers on injured reserve and Brett Hundley at quarterback, they have lost three in a row.

Before Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone, the Packers were averaging 27 points per game. In the three games with Hundley, they have scored 10, 17 and 17 points in losses to the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints and Lions.

Detroit (4-4) put the game away on a drive spanning the third and fourth quarters. Stafford’s 25-yard completion to Jones on third-and-10 was the key play, making the Lions six of nine on third down.

On first-and-goal at the 1, Packers linebacker Blake Martinez stripped the ball from running back Ameer Abdullah, but right tackle Ricky Wagner recovered. The Packers kept the Lions out of the end zone on second and third down, too, before Matt Prater’s 19-yard field goal made it 20-3.

Still, the 17-point lead was too much for the Packers (4-4).

Hundley did not surpass 100 passing yards until a 46-yard catch and run by Randall Cobb about four minutes into the fourth quarter. Hundley’s one-yard sneak pulled Green Bay within 20-10 with 9:52 remaining.

Detroit immediately answered with a perfectly timed screen to running back Theo Riddick against a Packers blitz, turning into a gain of 63 yards. One play later, Stafford threw his second touchdown pass of the night to Jones to make it 27-10.

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman lost his bid on Tuesday to win seats on the board of Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP.O) after a hostile, months-long proxy contest that was crucial to him retaining support from some of his own investors.

William 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

His Pershing Square hedge fund did not get any of its three nominees, including Ackman himself, elected to ADP’s board, with less than 25 percent of voting shares supporting his proxy campaign.

“This was an ass-whipping,” ADP Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez said after the vote tally was announced at the payroll processor’s annual shareholder meeting in Roseland, New Jersey.

For three months, Ackman and ADP have traded increasingly bitter barbs through securities filings, television appearances, conference calls, webcasts and private meetings with investors.

Ackman, who had expected to win, told Reuters he felt he accomplished a lot despite the loss, which he blamed on a flawed proxy voting system.

“The company, in order to win, made a number of very significant commitments to shareholders about growth,” he said at the meeting. “If they achieve those objectives and they exceed them, then I think shareholders will be happy, the stock will go up. If they don’t, we’ll be back next year.”

ADP’s stock was down 0.5 percent at $110.76 in early trading after the vote results were announced.

Ackman launched the ADP proxy contest as an underdog, taking aim at a company engaged in the unglamorous business of providing human resources technology and largely backed by Wall Street. ADP’s share price has more than doubled under Rodriguez’s tenure, and the company has posted relatively solid earnings growth.

But Ackman contends that management complacency has turned ADP into an inefficient corporate slugabed pushing outmoded products that even a top sales force could not sell. ADP has countered that Ackman brings no new ideas to the table, risks disrupting the company’s steady path to growth and behaves like a “spoiled brat.”

The 51-year-old billionaire had asked ADP shareholders to approve his proposal to seat three new directors, including himself, and oust three others, including Chairman John Jones. He has also suggested Rodriguez is the wrong person for the job, and called for the departure of ADP’s technology chief, Stuart Sackman.

Ackman posted double-digit losses in his key funds in 2015 and 2016 due to high-profile bets moving against him, and has produced underwhelming performance this year compared to major stock market indexes. Several Pershing investors who spoke to Reuters in the run-up to the ADP vote said the outcome would affect their confidence in his investment ability.

He said before the proxy battle that he would not exit the ADP investment if the shareholder vote went against him. Instead, he has said he plans to continue agitating for change loudly and publicly from the outside.

“Attualmente qui la questione più importante è gestire le sofferenze” ha detto Draghi durante una conferenza.

“Di conseguenza abbiamo bisogno di uno sforzo congiunto da parte delle banche, dei supervisori, dei regolatori e delle autorità nazionali per affrontare tale questione in maniera ordinata, prima di tutto e soprattutto creando un ambiente in cui gli Npl possano essere efficacemente gestiti e ceduti in maniera efficiente”, ha aggiunto il presidente della Bce.

Poco dopo, nel corso di una conferenza stampa a Bruxelles, l‘Italia, unica a parlare di questo all‘Ecofin, ha dato voce con il ministro Pier Carlo Padoan al proprio dissenso su “metodo e merito” con cui la vigilanza di Francoforte guidata da Danièle Nouy, ha proposto di trattare dal 2018 le coperture dei nuovi crediti deteriorati.

“Non c‘è stato intervento da parte dei ministri salvo che da chi vi parla. Sono intervenuto solo io sostenendo aspetti di metodo, sul fatto che l‘addendum va oltre i limiti dell‘Ssm per la sorveglianza”, ha detto Padoan, sottolineando anche perplessità nel merito.

L‘addendum Bce sui crediti deteriorati delle banche vigilate da Francoforte, in consultazione fino all‘8 dicembre, prevede che dal nuovo anno le nuove sofferenze siano coperte al 100% in sette anni se sono crediti garantiti e in due se privi di garanzie. La Bce ha anche detto che si occuperà separatamente dello stock entro il primo trimestre del nuovo anno.

L‘Italia, ma anche il presidente italiano del Parlamento europeo Antonio Tajani e oggi la federazione bancaria europea, hanno criticato la vigilanza della Bce per aver sconfinato nel campo della regolamentazione con questo addendum che, de facto, sostengono, ha l‘effetto di cambiare i requisiti di capitale.

Padoan ha anche parlato del rischio sottovalutato di creare un precedente in Europa che potrebbe poi riguardare anche altre materie, mentre si è detto “assolutamente a favore” di dare priorità nell‘aggredire questo problema dell‘enorme stock di crediti deteriorati che frena il credito, “ma in tempi e modi ragionevoli”.

Parole analoghe erano già state usate dal governatore della Banca d‘Italia Ignazio Visco che ieri da Madrid ha sottolineato come l‘obiettivo di velocizzare la soluzione per questi crediti difficili debba tener conto dell‘obiettivo di preservare la stabilità del sistema.

La Federazione bancaria europea, in una lettera indirizzata ieri a Commissione europea, Europarlamento e Bce, spiega che l‘addendum rischia di alterare “alcune metriche che costituiscono il fulcro del Primo Pilastro degli standard regolamentari internazionali e della regolamentazione Ue” e che non è chiaro “se l‘Addendum possa essere in definitiva applicato anche alle esposizioni esistenti, lasciando così non chiara una definizione dell‘ambito di applicazione”.

Oggi Nouy da Francoforte ha detto che la Bce guarderà caso per caso alle soluzioni per gestire l‘enorme massa di crediti deteriorati che pesano sul settore bancario della zona euro.

“Per quel che riguarda l‘eredità (degli Npl), beh, la situazione è assai variegata, quindi valutazioni e soluzioni dovranno essere fatte solo caso per caso” ha affermato durante una conferenza.

Ieri all‘Eurogruppo ha detto che ora è il momento di intervenire su questi crediti deteriorati, incassando “un generale consenso” da parte dei ministri, secondo quanto riferito dal presidente Jeroen Dijsselbloem.

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman lost his bid on Tuesday to win seats on the board of Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP.O) after a hostile, months-long proxy contest that was crucial to him retaining support from some of his own investors.

William 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

His Pershing Square hedge fund did not get any of its three nominees, including Ackman himself, elected to ADP’s board, with less than 25 percent of voting shares supporting his proxy campaign.

“This was an ass-whipping,” ADP Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez said after the vote tally was announced at the payroll processor’s annual shareholder meeting in Roseland, New Jersey.

For three months, Ackman and ADP have traded increasingly bitter barbs through securities filings, television appearances, conference calls, webcasts and private meetings with investors.

Ackman, who had expected to win, told Reuters he felt he accomplished a lot despite the loss, which he blamed on a flawed proxy voting system.

“The company, in order to win, made a number of very significant commitments to shareholders about growth,” he said at the meeting. “If they achieve those objectives and they exceed them, then I think shareholders will be happy, the stock will go up. If they don’t, we’ll be back next year.”

ADP’s stock was down 0.5 percent at $110.76 in early trading after the vote results were announced.

Ackman launched the ADP proxy contest as an underdog, taking aim at a company engaged in the unglamorous business of providing human resources technology and largely backed by Wall Street. ADP’s share price has more than doubled under Rodriguez’s tenure, and the company has posted relatively solid earnings growth.

But Ackman contends that management complacency has turned ADP into an inefficient corporate slugabed pushing outmoded products that even a top sales force could not sell. ADP has countered that Ackman brings no new ideas to the table, risks disrupting the company’s steady path to growth and behaves like a “spoiled brat.”

The 51-year-old billionaire had asked ADP shareholders to approve his proposal to seat three new directors, including himself, and oust three others, including Chairman John Jones. He has also suggested Rodriguez is the wrong person for the job, and called for the departure of ADP’s technology chief, Stuart Sackman.

Ackman posted double-digit losses in his key funds in 2015 and 2016 due to high-profile bets moving against him, and has produced underwhelming performance this year compared to major stock market indexes. Several Pershing investors who spoke to Reuters in the run-up to the ADP vote said the outcome would affect their confidence in his investment ability.

He said before the proxy battle that he would not exit the ADP investment if the shareholder vote went against him. Instead, he has said he plans to continue agitating for change loudly and publicly from the outside.

Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s comments were published after Saudi air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile that Saudi Arabia said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Iran-allied Houthi militia, which controls large parts of neighboring Yemen.

Saudi-led forces, which back the internationally-recognized government, have been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

The supply of rockets to the Houthi movement could “constitute an act of war against the kingdom,” state news agency SPA on Tuesday quoted Prince Salman as saying in a call with British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

In reaction to the missile, the Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country.

The United Nations on Tuesday called on the coalition to re-open an aid lifeline into Yemen, saying food and medicine imports were vital for 7 million people facing famine.

“The situation is catastrophic in Yemen, it is the worst food crisis we are looking at today,” Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told a briefing in Geneva.

The missile launch was “most likely a war crime” Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday but also urged Saudi Arabia against restricting aid access to Yemen, where the United Nations estimates nearly 900,000 people are infected with cholera.

“This unlawful attack is no justification for Saudi Arabia to exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe by further restricting aid and access to the country,” it said.

The coalition said aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen despite the temporary closure of ports but the United Nations said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday.

The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to northern Yemen, which is held by the Houthis.

The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

In an interview with CNN television on Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir accused the armed Lebanese Hezbollah group of firing the missile at Riyadh from Houthi-held territory.

“With regards to the missile...that was launched on Saudi territory, it was an Iranian missile launched by Hezbollah from territory occupied by the Houthis in Yemen.”

He said the missile was similar to one launched in July at Yanbu in Saudi Arabia and was manufactured in Iran, disassembled and smuggled into Yemen, then reassembled by the operatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah, “then it was launched into Saudi Arabia.”",Saudi crown prince calls Iran supply of rockets 'military aggression',https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D70QK-OCATP

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020. That is below an increase to 450,000 by 2021 recommended by the advisory council, to offset an aging population and strains on the social safety net.",Canada to take in migrants at 'gradual' pace amid integration concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D22N3-OCADN

FILE PHOTO: A Chinese national flag flutters outside the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the Chinese central bank, in Beijing, China April 3, 2014. REUTERS/Petar Kujundzic/File Photo

That strategy was amplified at the recently-concluded Communist Party Congress by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who set the tone for policy by emphasizing quality over quantity in boosting economic growth and pledging to win the war on pollution.

While the government splurged on infrastructure projects, keeping fiscal policy fairly loose and stoking surprisingly strong growth through the year, authorities have also ramped up efforts to reduce China’s years-long addiction to debt.

“We expect growth to slow in October,” said Wendy Chen, an economist for Nomura in Shanghai.

Chen expects the gradual slowdown to extend through to the end of the year as pollution curbs hit factory output and weaker property and infrastructure spending cool investment growth.

Indeed, growth in factory output is seen slowing to 6.3 percent year-on-year in October from September’s 6.6 percent, according to a Reuters poll of 32 economists.

The war on pollution was partly to blame for third quarter growth cooling slightly to 6.8 percent, from the first half’s 6.9 percent.

Yet those numbers defied market expectations for a sharper slowdown this year, as the government-backed construction boom drove up prices from cement to steel and glass in a boost to overall economic output.

And October data is again expected to show growth will easily hit Beijing’s 6.5 percent target for 2017 as surging profits see factories expanding output, albeit at a slower pace, and resilient consumer spending supports broad activity.

Policymakers could face a delicate balancing act over the next year, analysts say, as they target high-risk lending to firms and the property sector, while taking long-overdue steps to bring polluting factories to heel.

There are some mixed signals about how strict this winter’s anti-pollution measures will actually be.

A government official on Tuesday said pollution measures in October hurt output at some firms, which was reflected in an official survey of the sector, while iron ore futures prices rose on Friday after production cuts at steel plants appeared to be less than expected.

Fixed-asset investment is predicted to have increased 7.4 percent in the Jan-Oct period, down slightly from a 7.5 percent rise in the first three quarters of the year.

Retail sales growth is seen edging up to 10.4 percent on-year from 10.3 percent the previous month.

Industrial output, fixed asset investment and retail sales data are set to be published on Nov. 14.

TRUMP AND TRADE

China is set to announce October trade data on Wednesday, the same day United States President Donald Trump arrives in Beijing for his first visit to China.

Trump has railed against China’s massive trade surplus with the U.S., and bilateral trade is set to feature prominently in discussions.

China’s trade surplus with the U.S. in September was the highest ever for any single month, based on Reuters calculations of official data going back to 2008, even as its overall surplus narrowed.

Economists expect China’s exports to have risen 7.2 percent on-year in October, slower than 8.1 percent the previous month, while imports may have jumped 16.0 percent, producing a trade surplus of $39.5 billion.

LOAN GROWTH TO SLOW

The governor of the People’s Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan in comments over the weekend again warned about the risk from high leverage in China’s financial system, saying that China must prevent “black swan” events, which refers to major, unexpected occurrences.

Worries about a rapid build-up in China’s debt prompted S&P Global Ratings to downgrade China’s sovereign credit rating in September, following a cut by Moody’s in May.

China has mostly put the brakes on a buildup in corporate debt this year. Regulators have now also zoomed in on the risks from disguised property debt as investors look for ways around rules.

Economists expect that new loans in October dropped to a one-year low of 780 billion yuan ($117.59 billion) as banks restrict mortgage lending and corporates continue to shun bank loans.

Despite government rhetoric about the deleveraging drive, bank lending would have to drop sharply from this year’s trend for new loans not to surpass last year’s total and reach a new high.

The producer price index (PPI) is tipped to have risen 6.6 percent in October on-year, down from 6.9 percent in September when prices spiked on concerns supply would be short due to winter production restrictions.

The consumer price index (CPI) meanwhile is seen up 1.8 percent on-year in October, versus 1.6 percent in September.

China’s foreign exchange reserves are expected to have risen for a ninth month to $3.118 trillion in October, as capital curbs and a weakening dollar helped staunch fund outflows.

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California.

It is estimated that seven million people are facing famine there.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country to stem the flow of arms from Iran.

The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.

The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden, to discuss the humanitarian situation in Yemen, diplomats said in New York.

“We call for all air and sea ports to remain open to ensure food, fuel and medicines can enter the country,” Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs said in Geneva.

He said humanitarian operations are currently “blocked” because air and sea ports in Yemen are closed,

The Saudi-led coalition has told the world body to “inform all commercial vessels at Hodeidah and Saleef ports to leave”, Laerke said, referring to Red Sea ports controlled by the Houthis.

The price of fuel jumped 60 percent “overnight” in Yemen and the price of cooking gas doubled, he said. “This is an access problem of colossal dimensions right now.”

“Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year,” Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement.

The ICRC said that a shipment of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera did not get clearance at Yemen’s northern border. It voiced fears for 50,000 vials of insulin for diabetics due to be delivered by next week, which require constant refrigeration.

ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said that a ship carrying 500 metric tonnes of rice, which arrived in Hodeidah port in October after a three-month trip from Pakistan, had to leave the port last week without offloading because the ship’s crane had broken.

The port itself lacks adequate cranes after repeated coalition bombing.

Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, said it would study whether the blockade amounted to “collective punishment”, banned under international law, but hoped that it would be temporary.

Attacks in Yemen over the past week that have killed dozens of civilians, including children, at markets and homes, he said.

These included at least nine air strikes on the Houthi-held city of Sanaa since Saturday, when a missile was fired from Yemen toward the Saudi capital of Riyadh, he said.

A cholera epidemic has caused 908,702 suspected cases and 2,194 deaths since the outbreak began in April, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.

In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for increased aid to Yemen, citing alarm at the latest U.N. report. ”No one will be able to say later, particularly with respect to Yemen, that they didn’t know what was happening.”","U.N., Red Cross urge Saudi-led coalition to re-open aid lifeline to Yemen",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-un/u-n-red-cross-urge-saudi-led-coalition-to-re-open-aid-lifeline-to-yemen-idUSKBN1D71BM?il=0

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

Up to 14 of those killed were children, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt told NBC News on Monday.

The following describes some of the victims, as they were identified by family members and friends via media interviews and social media posts:

HOLCOMBE FAMILY

One couple, Joe and Claryce Holcombe, told the Washington Post they lost eight extended family members.

Bryan Holcombe, an associate pastor of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs where the shooting took place, was killed in the gunfire. His wife, Karla was also killed.

Bryan and Karla’s son, Marc Daniel Holcombe, was also killed with his infant child, Noah Holcombe.

Another son of Bryan and Karla, John Holcombe, survived, but his wife, Crystal Holcombe, who was pregnant, died with her unborn child and three of her children - Emily, Megan and Greg.

A GoFundMe page created for the Holcombe family had raised nearly $150,000 in the last 20 hours.

JOANN WARD

Joann Ward and her two daughters, Brooke, 5, and Emily, 7, were among other victims of the mass shooting.

Ward’s uncle, John Alexander, wrote on Facebook that she was “such a wonderful mother whose whole life was her children and family.”

During the attack, Ward was “shielding (her) babies from the shooter,” Vonda Greek Smith, a friend of Ward’s, said on Facebook.

Joann’s 5-year-old son Ryland was shot four times in the attack and flown by helicopter to University Hospital in San Antonio where he underwent surgery, according to the Dallas Morning News. Her 9-year-old daughter, Rihanna, survived.

ANNABELLE POMEROY

Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was among the first victims to be identified. Her father, Frank Pomeroy, the pastor of the First Baptist Church, was out of town with his wife when the gunman opened fire on his congregation.

Annabelle’s uncle, Scott Pomeroy, posted a tribute on Facebook, saying “Heaven truly gained a real beautiful angel this morning along with many more.”

RICHARD RODRIGUEZ

Richard Rodriguez, 51, is also among the dead, according to ABC News. His daughter Regina, who posted a picture of herself with her father on her Facebook on Monday, said he attended church every Sunday.

LULA WOICINSKI WHITE

Lula Woicinski White, 71, was the gunman’s grandmother-in-law, according to CNN, citing multiple friends of the victim.

White’s niece Amy Backus wrote on Facebook: ”I have no doubt where she is right now. She is in Heaven laying her crowns and jewels at the feet of Jesus and celebrating.“ Backus added: ”I love and will miss you Aunt Lula Woicinski White.”

TARA ELYSE MCNULTY

Tara Elyse McNulty was at the church on Sunday with her two children who were wounded but survived the attack, according to a GoFundMe page created by Amy Woodall who called McNulty, “a great employee.”

“She was conscientious, engaging, and always willing to do the little things. She was a sweet, kind and loving woman, mother and daughter and will be greatly missed by many,” Woodall wrote.

ROBERT CORRIGAN, SHANI CORRIGAN

A couple from Michigan, Robert Corrigan and his wife, Shani, were among the people killed in the massacre, according to the Clare County Director of Veterans’ Services.

“This is a huge tragedy, not only for the family, for this small town,” Renee Haley, director of Veterans Services for Clare County, said in a statement.

The couple, who graduated from Harrison High School in Farmington Hills, Michigan, lived in Floresville, Texas, according to media reports.

HALEY KRUEGER

Haley Krueger was “a beautiful, vibrant, 16 year old girl, and was excited about the bright future ahead of her. She loved babies, and had dreams of becoming a NICU nurse,” Tasha Niemann Wiatrek, a family friend, wrote on a GoFundMe page created for Krueger.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon is a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.

Waymo said that members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology -- and without human drivers -- in the next few months.

At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car. The service will start free, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics.

Though financial markets have been broadly skeptical about the ability of the Trump presidency to pass significant political reforms since he won the U.S. elections, funds have enjoyed inflows and have seen the value of their holdings rise as global financial markets enjoyed double-digit returns.

As the Trump presidency approached a one-year anniversary on Wednesday, total net assets under management of U.S. mutual funds including exchange-traded funds climbed by a sixth to $21.1 trillion over the one-year period ending Sept. 30, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Equity funds were the leaders with assets under management for stock funds seeing the biggest increase over that period with total assets rising by a fifth to $11.4 trillion as of end-September global stock markets hit new peaks.

U.S. stocks hit a record high on Monday with stocks up more than 15 percent year-to-date while an index of high yield U.S. bonds is up by a similar quantum in that period.

While performance has been a key driver as rising markets pushed up valuations, inflows have also been robust, especially to passively managed funds as active managers faced another year of fierce competition from their exchange-traded counterparts.

Of the $691 billion of net inflows that was pumped into U.S. mutual funds over the one-year period ending Sept. 30 2017, about $685 billion have gone into passively managed funds.

“Tennis Re-invented” is the catchphrase of the tournament launched this year by the ATP to showcase the young men it hopes will lead it towards a brave new world, together with a raft of innovations designed to catch a new wave of tennis fans.

Sunday’s botched draw ceremony branded as “sexist” and “trashy” was hardly what the ATP had in mind -- forcing them and sponsors Red Bull to apologize after players had to select glamorous models to determine their round-robin group.

And all the talk of new technology, gizmos and enhanced fan experiences looked a little lame when, minutes before Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev were scheduled to appear for the tournament’s opening salvos, workmen were still welding pieces of the temporary stadium together.

It hardly felt state-of-the-art.

Yet once the crowds, many of them children, eventually filled the humongous aircraft hanger-sized hall at the Fiera Milano, there was much to savor as Khachanov and Medvedev showcased their considerable skills -- and the new rules that would make traditionalists wince.

There is a school of thought that men’s tennis, still in the midst of its golden era, is not broken. So don’t fix it.

Yet the ATP knows the clock ticks ever louder on the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - who are all in their 30s.

Hence it wants to promote the “Next Gen” led by Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who withdrew from Milan to concentrate on playing with the ‘grown ups’ at next week’s ATP Finals in London.

With a black hole looming, that is why they have invested so much time and effort into making the Milan event rock.

Featuring the top seven players in the ATP rankings aged 21 and under - minus world number three Zverev - and with an Italian wildcard, it is tennis on fast forward.

On a two-tone blue singles only court, backdropped with a deep red mock-up of Milan’s iconic La Scala opera house, things did feel very different indeed.

For starters sets were played to four with a tiebreak at 3-3. With no advantage points, deuce effectively became ‘sudden death’. Five of the first six games of the match, eventually won by Medvedev in one hour 48 minutes, were decided that way.

A shot-clock ticked away in the corner to enforce the 25-second rule between points -- ironic considering the tardy start.

Electronic Hawkeye calls replaced line judges with an automated, rather unnerving, British accented voice calling instantaneously “OUT” or “FAULT”.

Italian crowds don’t need an excuse to make noise and the scrapping of any requirement for them to stay silent, or stay still during play, meant a constant hubbub soundtracked the action.

Experienced Brazilian chair umpire Carlos Bernardes still presided over the action -- yet even he got left behind.

In the second game of the third set he instinctively called out “let” when a Medvedev serve flicked the net -- forgetting that service, for this week at least, are fair game.

Another novelty was the sight of the players wearing headphones at the end of sets -- not to listen to their favorite tunes, but to take advice from their coaches.

Any notion that the tournament would be a “hit and giggle” affair was quickly put to bed by action between world number 45 Khachanov and Medvedev, ranked 20 places lower.

They did the organizers proud as Medvedev hit back to win the Group B match 2-4 4-3(6) 4-3(3) 4-2.","Tennis: Future arrives, a little late, as Next Gen revolution begins",https://www.reuters.com/article/tennis-nextgen/tennis-future-arrives-a-little-late-as-next-gen-revolution-begins-idINKBN1D72FT

I vertici del gruppo hanno sottolineato l‘impegno su ecommerce e digitalizzazione e non hanno escluso, una volta terminato il lavoro avviato, di alzare i prezzi, in particolare per il marchio Tod‘s, ha raccontato la fonte.

Tod’s intende concentrarsi sul rinnovo dei negozi esistenti (in programma una trentina di ristrutturazioni) mentre calerà il numero di nuove aperture, hanno riferito le fonti.

ROMA/MILANO, 3 novembre (Reuters) - Piaggio Aerospace dovrà assicurare la totale separazione tra il ramo jet privati che intende vendere a un consorzio cinese e il business militare, nonché reinvestire i proventi della vendita soprattutto nel programma del drone P2HH.

Sono due punti contenuti nel decreto del Presidente del Consiglio, adottato su proposta della ministra della Difesa Roberta Pinotti, dopo che Mubadala, il fondo sovrano di Abu Dhabi proprietario del gruppo italiano, ha notificato all‘esecutivo il progetto di vendita del ramo di azienda che produce il jet executive P180 nell‘ambito delle procedure previste per il golden power nel settore difesa.

Ad acquisire il ramo d‘azienda sarebbe infatti PAC-Investments, società con sede in Lussemburgo supportata da investitori cinesi sia privati che governativi, si legge nel documento.

Il decreto prevede che Piaggio Aerospace e Mubadala adottino “misure di tutela e di protezione, attive e passive, concernenti ogni elemento, di natura materiale o immateriale, con particolare riguardo ai diritti di proprietà industriale, al know-how, alle informazioni riservate, relativi ai programmi militari”, come quelli dei droni P1HH e P2HH e del velivolo multiruolo MPA.

SEUL, 7 Nov (Reuters) - O presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, alertou a Coreia do Norte nesta terça-feira que está preparado para usar todo o poder militar dos EUA para deter qualquer ataque, mas fez seu apelo mais conciliador até hoje pedindo que Pyongyang “faça um acordo” para encerrar o impasse nuclear.

Falando às portas da Coreia do Norte durante uma visita a Seul, Trump disse que, embora “reze a Deus” para não ter que usar todo o poderio militar norte-americano, está pronto para fazer o que for necessário para evitar que o “ditador norte-coreano” ameace milhões de vidas.

“Não podemos permitir que a Coreia do Norte ameace tudo que construímos”, disse Trump depois de conversar com o presidente da Coreia do Sul, Moon Jae-in, que apoia contatos diplomáticos com Pyongyang.

Mas em alguns momentos Trump adotou um tom mais ponderado e menos combativo, também pedindo que a Coreia do Norte “faça a coisa certa”, e disse: “De fato vejo alguma movimentação”, embora não tenha desejado elaborar.

“Realmente faz sentido os norte-coreanos se sentarem à mesa e fazerem um acordo”, disse Trump aos repórteres em uma coletiva de imprensa conjunta com Moon.

Apesar das ameaças reiteradas de Trump contra a Coreia do Norte, suas declarações ficaram longe da abordagem mais estridente que ele demonstrou nos últimos meses, incluindo sua rejeição prévia de quaisquer esforços diplomáticos com Pyongyang por vê-los como uma perda de tempo.

Depois de pousarem na base aérea de Osan, nos arredores de Seul, o presidente e a primeira-dama, Melania Trump, desceram do Força Aérea Um para iniciarem uma visita que pode agravar a tensão com a Coreia do Norte.

Mais tarde Trump voou de helicóptero ao Campo Humphreys, a maior base militar dos EUA no país, e se encontrou com tropas norte-americanas e sul-coreanas ao lado de Moon.

A Casa Branca disse que a viagem presidencial pretende demonstrar a determinação dos EUA com uma abordagem rígida diante das ameaças nucleares e de mísseis do regime norte-coreano – mas muitos na região expressaram o temor de que sua retórica beligerante com Pyongyang possa aumentar o potencial de um conflito militar devastador na Península Coreana.

Após se encontrar com comandantes militares para tratar da questão, Trump disse aos repórteres: “No final das contas tudo dará certo, sempre dá certo, tem que dar certo”, sem entrar em detalhes.

With foot traffic at their stores in decline, department stores that would have stocked up for the biggest shopping season of the year months ago are still in the process of placing new orders, according to nearly a dozen sources including company officials, vendors who work with the retailers and consultants who advise such chains.

The strategy is aimed to keep their inventory costs down and avoid the experience of previous holiday seasons, when large piles of unsold stock led to deep markdowns that eroded profits. But these retailers risk losing sales if supplies run out at a time when many are struggling to keep up with Amazon.com Inc and a steady shift towards online shopping.

Macy’s Inc, J.C Penney Co Inc Kohl’s Corp Nordstrom Inc, Dillard’s Inc and Hudson Bay Co’s Lord & Taylor are among the retailers buying in smaller batches with shorter lead times this year and relying on a more dynamic demand forecasting process than in the past, according to sources familiar with these companies’ practices.

Macy‘s, Kohl‘s, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney declined to comment. Lord & Taylor said it is working on preparing a carefully selected merchandise assortment for the holiday season but did not share anything specific. Dillard’s did not respond to a request for comment.

Keeping inventory levels low helps manage costs, and may also instill urgency in consumers to spend now rather than hold off on purchases in search of a better deal, according to the sources. But it also risks alienating customers who may end up having less choice, and is also putting strain on vendors to deliver on shorter lead times, the sources added.

The high-stakes strategy takes a page from the playbook of Inditex SA-owned Zara, Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M) and other so-called “fast fashion” retailers that consistently keep low inventories of trendy clothes and try to win customers with cheap prices.

“I think in some sections the choice is limited this year like cashmere sweaters and sweaters in general,” said Dakota Whitlow, a 46 year old marketing executive as she shopped for winter clothing at Macy’s State Street store in Chicago.

“But limiting choice is in many ways better than overcrowding the store with clothes, which makes it harder to shop,” she added.

Traditionally, retailers lock in most of their purchases nine months to a year in advance. This year, retailers started placing a large portion of their holiday orders three to four months before the holiday season, and are refreshing fast-selling items within as little as six to eight weeks, vendors and consultants said.

“There is a big push from department stores across the board this year to cut down lead times and manage inventory tightly,” said Robert D‘Loren, chairman and CEO of U.S.-based Xcel Brands, which supplies branded apparel to chains like Lord & Taylor and Dillard’s and private label clothing to other department stores.

“We are delivering orders on weekly cycles with plans that are six weeks out.”

The risk for department stores is whether suppliers can keep up with the new approach.

Department stores rely on vendors whose traditional supply chains are not built for a fast turnaround, because they handle orders for several brands. Fast-fashion chains, on the other hand, have designed their supply chain to shift on a week to week basis versus the traditional four for department stores and work with vendors who can deliver quickly on private label items they stock.

As a result, some smaller vendors of traditional department stores struggle to adapt to request for shorter lead times.

“We are refusing to take (last-minute) orders. We just don’t have that kind of idle capacity in our factories, our production lines. Cargo delivery contracts are not built to react that way,” said a Bangladeshi supplier to J.C. Penney and Kohl‘s, who would only be quoted on condition of anonymity.

WILLING TO LOSE A SALE

So far this year, retailers have been willing to sacrifice some orders for tighter inventory management.

“Between the risk of a lost sale and the risk of a loss of margin, department stores are willing to lose the sale this year,” said Greg Portell, a consultant with AT Kearney who advises retail chains on strategy.

Retailers are optimistic about their new strategy. Macy’s expects a ”marked difference this holiday versus last“ in the way it buys stock, Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said on an earnings conference call in August. ”We definitely are buying closer in... to make sure we have the right goods in time for holiday, but not too far in advance.

To be sure, ordering closer to demand can help a retailer cope with weak consumer spending, but it cannot offset its negative impact altogether.

While consumer confidence has improved overall, the National Retail Federation cautioned in October that U.S. consumers will remain hesitant to spend until there is more certainty about policy changes on issues such as taxes and trade. The trade group estimated holiday sales for the U.S. retail industry will grow between 3.7-4.2 percent in 2017, from 3.75 percent in 2016.

“(Retailers) simply don’t want to be stuck with excess stock. It takes up working capital and that was okay when times were good but not when things are this tough,” said Neil Stern, partner at McMillan Doolittle, a consultancy who works with retailers including department stores.",U.S. department stores tap brakes on stocking for holiday season,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-inventory/u-s-department-stores-tap-brakes-on-stocking-for-holiday-season-idUSKBN1D70HB

Studies have suggested the prevalence of mental health issues among militants working together on major strikes is very low but a string of killings by so-called lone wolves has fueled concerns mental illness could be a factor behind some attacks.

Authorities say some of those involved in four attacks in Britain this year blamed on Islamist militants appeared to people who had self-radicalized via the internet and whose mental state had been questioned.

To look more closely at the issue, British police launched pilot programs in April last year in England’s three biggest urban areas - London, Birmingham and Manchester - to embed mental health experts with counter-terrorism officers.

The aim was to give psychiatrists the chance to identify people referred to Britain’s counter-radicalization program Prevent who had mental health issues, and treat them.

“Anecdotally, I am surprised that there appears to be a much higher prevalence of people with mental health problems than you would expect,” said Professor Jennifer Shaw, the mental health lead for Greater Manchester Police, referring to the people her team had dealt with since the pilot was launched.

The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide, Shaw, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester, told Reuters.

But such is the secrecy around the work of Prevent and Channel - a de-radicalization program within the overall project - there are few details about its successes or failings and Shaw’s work has not previously been discussed in the media.

Some psychiatrists argue that no scientific link between mental health issues and terrorist attacks has yet been established and they worry the programs risk stigmatizing people suffering from mental illnesses.

Another psychiatrist gathering data under the pilot programs told Reuters that Britain’s Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism had told them not to disclose any details of their findings ahead of a final report.

Those findings are expected to be among a raft of data about people referred to Prevent due to be released this week.

Britain’s interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

‘WE WANT THE FACTS’

Dr Adrian James, registrar at Britain’s Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), said the link between mental health problems and terrorist acts had not been established.

He said a lack of evidence, partly because militant attacks were so rare, was at the heart of the problem, adding that an unnecessary level of secrecy about Prevent also meant many psychiatrists viewed the program with suspicion.

“If it is true that there is a link, we need to know and then need to look at the causes of that and what we can do about them,” James told Reuters. “We just want the facts.”

Past studies have disagreed about the significance of mental health issues among lone wolf attackers, with some academics concluding that such illnesses are blamed to try to explain often complex reasons for attacks.

British police decided to launch the pilot programs because they believed that roughly half the 7,500 people referred to Prevent each year had a broad range of mental health and psychological difficulties.

Those working on the pilot projects hope the information being gathered will now help experts assess any possible links between mental health issues and attacks.

Shaw said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems, but she said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.

“That doesn’t mean you can’t manage the risks. Trying to nip it in the bud, that’s all you can do. But that’s good if you can achieve that, it’s going a long way,” said Shaw.

Police officers say they have struggled in the past to reach medical practitioners when they had concerns about some people and Shaw said the pilot was designed to address those worries.

According to one of Shaw’s case studies, a man went to a hospital saying he monitored Islamic State websites, had been walking around the city center working out how many people he could kill in a gun attack, and wanted to behead his mother.

Shaw’s team discovered the man had no contact with mental health services and no diagnosis of any illness. An urgent assessment concluded his anger stemmed from experiences in his childhood and safeguarding measures were put in place.

‘TERRORIST METHODOLOGY’

British police have no doubts about the importance of the work, especially given the global shift from carefully planned spectacular attacks by militant networks to unsophisticated, strikes by individuals using cars and knives as weapons.

Mark Rowley, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, told the British Medical Journal in April that a disproportionate number of suspects in 13 attacks foiled by British police since 2013 had mental health issues.

“If part of the terrorist methodology is to prey on the vulnerable ... then it stands to reason that there will be people with certain mental health conditions who will be ... susceptible to that,” he said.

FILE PHOTO: Tributes are seen in Westminster, following the attack in Westminster earlier in the week, in London, Britain March 25, 2017. REUTERS/Paul Hackett/File Photo

“Radicalizing and inciting someone who is vulnerable to go and carry out some ghastly attack seems to be part of their tactics, and that has brought in a whole load of vulnerability issues, including mental health, that we now have to wrestle with,” said Rowley.

A study by University College London’s (UCL) Department of Security and Crime Science looked at 55 attacks involving 76 individuals between May 2014 and September 2016 where reports had shown the perpetrators may have been influenced by IS.

The study found 34 percent of those involved in attacks inspired by Islamic State - rather than actually directed by the militant group - had mental health issues.

Health experts estimate about one in four people will suffer some form of mental health issue and those with mental illnesses are generally less likely to commit violent crimes than the overall population.

STIGMATIZATION CONCERNS

Shaw said those with mental health issues and developmental disorders referred to her team at Prevent were more likely to be suffering from psychosis and autism, adding that people with serious mental illnesses often had tiny social networks.

“They can therefore, when unwell, be influenced by messages that go out that say come and belong to our group. It can be quite compelling. The same for people with autism. The internet kind of way of getting the message out makes those people, particularly vulnerable. So I think that’s a big issue.”

Psychiatrists worry that all people with mental health issues could be stigmatized and considered potential militants, possibly deterring them from seeking help.

Prevent, one of the four strands of Britain’s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest launched in 2003, has also been dogged by claims it is used to spy on Muslim communities.

A government edict in 2015 instructing public bodies such as schools, health workers and universities to raise any concerns they have about individuals with the authorities has exacerbated those concerns.

Shaw acknowledged more work was needed on the outcomes of their mental health interventions under the Prevent pilot programs to determine what made a difference.

Asked if people her team had treated might have committed violent acts if their conditions had not been addressed, she said: ”That is the obvious question. You can’t say that in any kind of scientific way.

“We’re attempting to try and get at that. Is it completely to do with their mental illness, half to do with it, or not at all?” said Shaw.

“We have had cases where people have had ideologies, they have also had a mental health problem, and they are not linked at all. The last thing we need is ‘all these bombers are nutters’. We don’t want that going on.”",The battle for minds: Britain expands project on mental health in terrorism,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-security-mentalhealth/the-battle-for-minds-britain-expands-project-on-mental-health-in-terrorism-idUKKBN1D718N

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Devin Kelley, o atirador da chacina de domingo realizada em uma igreja no interior do sudeste do Estado norte-americano, foi condenado por uma corte marcial por ter agredido sua primeira mulher e seu enteado quando servia em uma unidade de prontidão logística da Força Aérea dos Estados Unidos em 2012, revelou o Pentágono na segunda-feira.

A Força Aérea também admitiu que falhou por não transmitir informações sobre a condenação de Kelley ao sistema do Centro Nacional de Informações Criminais (NCIC, na sigla em inglês), um banco de dados do governo dos EUA usado por vendedores de armas de fogo licenciadas para verificar antecedentes criminais de compradores em potencial.

O porta-voz do Departamento de Segurança Pública do Texas, Freeman Martin, estimou o número de vítimas fatais do ataque em 26. A idade dos mortos variou de 18 meses a 77 anos.

Vinte outras pessoas ficaram feridas, 10 das quais continuavam em estado grave na noite de segunda-feira, segundo autoridades.

Duas armas de mão foram encontradas no veículo da fuga de Kelley, onde ele morreu devido a ferimentos de bala autoinfligidos na cabeça depois de uma tentativa fracassada de escapar do local do massacre, informou Martin em uma coletiva de imprensa na noite de segunda-feira.

A Força Aérea abriu um inquérito para descobrir como lidou com o antecedente criminal do ex-aviador, e o Departamento de Defesa dos EUA pediu uma revisão de seu inspetor-geral para ter certeza de que outros casos “foram relatados corretamente”, disseram autoridades do Pentágono.

CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last week announced that it would launch the futures contract of bitcoin, marking a major step in the digital currency’s path toward mainstream acceptance.

Melamed said he expects major investors to take part in bitcoin futures, which the exchange plans to start by the end of year.

“That’s a very important step for bitcoin’s history... We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,” Melamed told Reuters in an interview.

The futures will allow investors to short-sell bitcoins, making two-way bets possible, a development that he expects will attract major institutional investors, not just speculators.

Six-fold gains in the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP so far this year have stirred a debate among financial professionals on whether the digital currency represents a revolution in financial technology or just another tech bubble.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in September that bitcoin “is a fraud” and will blow up while regulators in many countries tightened their grip on its trading.

Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.

“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.

He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology.

Pundits say blockchain will enable the transfer of assets without a centralized system such as banks and sharply reduce costs of money transfer.

“My whole life is built abound new technology. I never said no to technology. People who say no to technology are soon dead. I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change. That’s what bitcoin represents,” he also said.

Melamed was elected chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. He moved to Chicago in his youth, having fled Nazi-occupied Poland with his family.

Melamed’s parents were among a small number of Jews to flee to Lithuania after Germany invaded their native town of Bialystok in Poland, he said.

Though financial markets have been broadly skeptical about the ability of the Trump presidency to pass significant political reforms since he won the U.S. elections, funds have enjoyed inflows and have seen the value of their holdings rise as global financial markets enjoyed double-digit returns.

As the Trump presidency approached a one-year anniversary on Wednesday, total net assets under management of U.S. mutual funds including exchange-traded funds climbed by a sixth to $21.1 trillion over the one-year period ending Sept. 30, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Equity funds were the leaders with assets under management for stock funds seeing the biggest increase over that period with total assets rising by a fifth to $11.4 trillion as of end-September global stock markets hit new peaks.

U.S. stocks hit a record high on Monday with stocks up more than 15 percent year-to-date while an index of high yield U.S. bonds is up by a similar quantum in that period.

While performance has been a key driver as rising markets pushed up valuations, inflows have also been robust, especially to passively managed funds as active managers faced another year of fierce competition from their exchange-traded counterparts.

CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last week announced that it would launch the futures contract of bitcoin, marking a major step in the digital currency’s path toward mainstream acceptance.

Melamed said he expects major investors to take part in bitcoin futures, which the exchange plans to start by the end of year.

“That’s a very important step for bitcoin’s history... We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,” Melamed told Reuters in an interview.

The futures will allow investors to short-sell bitcoins, making two-way bets possible, a development that he expects will attract major institutional investors, not just speculators.

Six-fold gains in the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP so far this year have stirred a debate among financial professionals on whether the digital currency represents a revolution in financial technology or just another tech bubble.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in September that bitcoin “is a fraud” and will blow up while regulators in many countries tightened their grip on its trading.

Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.

“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.

He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology.

Pundits say blockchain will enable the transfer of assets without a centralized system such as banks and sharply reduce costs of money transfer.

“My whole life is built abound new technology. I never said no to technology. People who say no to technology are soon dead. I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change. That’s what bitcoin represents,” he also said.

Melamed was elected chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. He moved to Chicago in his youth, having fled Nazi-occupied Poland with his family.

Melamed’s parents were among a small number of Jews to flee to Lithuania after Germany invaded their native town of Bialystok in Poland, he said.

Mugabe sacked his long-time ally Mnangagwa on Monday for showing “traits of disloyalty”, abruptly removing a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader and boosting the likelihood of Grace Mugabe becoming his next deputy and potential successor.

State television ZBC said the purge went beyond removing Mnangagwa, 75, as half of the ruling ZANU-PF’s national provincial executives separately met and passed resolutions expelling supporters of the former vice president on Monday.

ZANU-PF leaders in the eastern Manicaland region called for the expulsion of cyber security minister Patrick Chinamasa, a former finance minister before he was moved in a cabinet reshuffle on Oct. 9, ZBC said in an online report.

Chinamasa, fellow cabinet ministers Oppah Muchinguri, Chris Mushohwe and 36 other party members and officials were accused of being Mnangagwa allies who were disrespectful to Mugabe.

“The province recommended the expulsion of 39 individuals from the province who were involved with the Mnangagwa-aligned ‘Lacoste’ faction, which is accused of not respecting the party’s one center of power principle,” ZBC said.

The three cabinet ministers did not respond to calls for comment.

The process to weed out Mnangagwa allies was repeated in four other provinces, the state Herald newspaper said.

A senior ZANU-PF official from Matabeleland South Province told Reuters that the provincial executive there had on Tuesday passed a resolution to fire 15 senior members linked to Mnangagwa, including state security minister Kembo Mohadi.

Remaining provinces were holding separate meetings on Tuesday, two ZANU-PF sources in Harare told Reuters.

Recommendations by the provinces will be discussed by ZANU-PF’s supreme decision-making Politburo at its sitting next week and if adopted will seal the fate of the officials.

International Crisis Group’s southern Africa senior consultant Piers Pigou said purges of ZANU-PF members seen as supportive of Mnangagwa would neutralize any potential fight-back.

“Survival is going to be the name of the game for many people,” he said.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

The deal, unveiled on Monday, looks partly like a consolation prize. Qatar Airways recently had to drop a controversial attempt to buy a chunk of American Airlines. But the company is still following a trajectory similar to Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, gobbling up minority stakes left and right.

True, the airline is a more natural investor than the seller, Kingboard Chemical, a bargain-hunting group whose day job is making laminates, chemicals and circuit boards. And the duo, who are already partners in the Oneworld alliance, could reap some benefits from collaborating more closely: Corrine Png of Crucial Perspective says this could cover areas like cross-marketing and joint procurement.

Still, Etihad and others show the perils of airlines dabbling in portfolio-building. This can tie up funds in a capital-hungry industry, and the buyer gets little clout in return. Such deal-making also tends to concentrate on cheaper, more distressed carriers.

It is not clear if Qatar Airways will even get a board seat in this deal. And while the airline characterises this as a financial investment, it is unlikely to be lucrative, at least in the short term. Analysts expect Cathay to record a loss this year, and be barely profitable in 2018. A price of HK$13.65 a share equates to about 16 times estimated earnings in 2019: hardly a bargain.

On the other hand, the stake does give Qatar Airways a seat at the table if Cathay were to be put up for sale. It is 45 percent owned by Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and 30 percent by mainland carrier Air China. Swire has remained committed despite Cathay’s recent difficulties. But should it decide to quit or sell down, it now has two suitors to play against each other, assuming national ownership hurdles can be overcome.",Breakingviews - Qatar Airways gets seat for any Cathay dealmaking,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-qatar-airways-gets-seat-for-any-cathay-dealmaking-idUSKBN1D60CK

Economic growth is forecast to rise to more than 6 percent next year and to move towards 7 percent in the medium term, Rotich said. He had earlier trimmed the 2017 forecast to 5.0 percent from a previous projection of 5.5 percent, which itself was a reduction from 5.9 percent.

The economy grew 5 percent in the first half of the year, the government said, falling short of its full-year forecast.

“By and large, agriculture this year will be better than last year, that is the reason why our growth looks optimistic, even at this time when we face these challenges on the investment side,” Rotich told a news conference.

Rotich said that revenue collections for the first four months of the 2017/18 (July-June) fiscal year had fallen short by 40 billion shillings ($386.47 million).

Kenya’s economy has faced a slowdown for the better part of the year. In addition to the drought and its political uncertainty, credit growth has slowed, partly because of a cap on commercial bank lending rates imposed last September.

Kenya held presidential elections on Aug. 8, but the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win and ordered a repeat election. Opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted the new election, on Oct. 26, and Kenyatta won again, with 98 percent of the vote, in a campaign marred by violent protests.

On Monday, a former lawmaker filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging Kenyatta’s second victory, in a last-minute move that opened the door to legal scrutiny of the vote.

Kenya is a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security and its prolonged election season has disrupted its economy.

The International Monetary Fund has also cut its 2017 growth forecast for this year to 5 percent from its initial forecast of more than 5 percent.

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

Repairing the damage wrought on the broadband system, including replacing steel-braid wires that the pesky parrots have gnawed, has already cost A$80,000 ($61,500), network builder NBN Co said on Friday.

The company estimates the bill could rise sharply as more damage is uncovered and more cables are rolled out in the national telecommunications infrastructure project, which is not due to be completed until around 2021.

“They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across,” said NBN Co project manager Chedryian Bresland in a blog post on the company’s website on Friday.

“Unfortunately, they’ve developed a liking to our cables ... these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm.”

Yellow-crested cockatoos are prolific in Australia and well-known for their voracious appetites for everything from fruit crops to wooden window frames.

Much of the cable chomping has occurred in grain-growing regions in Australia’s southeast.

“It would have to be an acquired taste, because it’s not their usual style,” Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behavior at the University of New England, told Reuters.

“Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, They don’t usually go for cables. But it might be the color or the position of the cables that’s attracted them,” she said.

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman lost his bid on Tuesday to win seats on the board of Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP.O) after a hostile, months-long proxy contest that was crucial to him retaining support from some of his own investors.

William 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

His Pershing Square hedge fund did not get any of its three nominees, including Ackman himself, elected to ADP’s board, with less than 25 percent of voting shares supporting his proxy campaign.

“This was an ass-whipping,” ADP Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez said after the vote tally was announced at the payroll processor’s annual shareholder meeting in Roseland, New Jersey.

For three months, Ackman and ADP have traded increasingly bitter barbs through securities filings, television appearances, conference calls, webcasts and private meetings with investors.

Ackman, who had expected to win, told Reuters he felt he accomplished a lot despite the loss, which he blamed on a flawed proxy voting system.

“The company, in order to win, made a number of very significant commitments to shareholders about growth,” he said at the meeting. “If they achieve those objectives and they exceed them, then I think shareholders will be happy, the stock will go up. If they don’t, we’ll be back next year.”

ADP’s stock was down 0.5 percent at $110.76 in early trading after the vote results were announced.

Ackman launched the ADP proxy contest as an underdog, taking aim at a company engaged in the unglamorous business of providing human resources technology and largely backed by Wall Street. ADP’s share price has more than doubled under Rodriguez’s tenure, and the company has posted relatively solid earnings growth.

But Ackman contends that management complacency has turned ADP into an inefficient corporate slugabed pushing outmoded products that even a top sales force could not sell. ADP has countered that Ackman brings no new ideas to the table, risks disrupting the company’s steady path to growth and behaves like a “spoiled brat.”

The 51-year-old billionaire had asked ADP shareholders to approve his proposal to seat three new directors, including himself, and oust three others, including Chairman John Jones. He has also suggested Rodriguez is the wrong person for the job, and called for the departure of ADP’s technology chief, Stuart Sackman.

Ackman posted double-digit losses in his key funds in 2015 and 2016 due to high-profile bets moving against him, and has produced underwhelming performance this year compared to major stock market indexes. Several Pershing investors who spoke to Reuters in the run-up to the ADP vote said the outcome would affect their confidence in his investment ability.

He said before the proxy battle that he would not exit the ADP investment if the shareholder vote went against him. Instead, he has said he plans to continue agitating for change loudly and publicly from the outside.

Three of 42-year-old elephant Sandra’s abstract canvasses, with colored lines flowing across them resembling rivers, fetched about 40,000 forints ($150) each.

A painting depicting Sandra herself, done by a Hungarian painter, sold for 260,000 forints. The money will be offered to an elephant sanctuary in Malaysia.

Sandra paints with her trunk purely for pleasure, according to her owner and trainer Florian Richter, a horse acrobat and circus director.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

“I only help her with changing the brushes and putting them into paints but she does the rest by herself more or less. I praise her by saying ‘oh this is really good, or not so good’,” Richter said. “We have been together for 40 years so this is a family connection.”

Sandra arrived as a baby elephant at the circus where Richter grew up, as a seventh generation member of an acrobat family.

“Tennis Re-invented” is the catchphrase of the tournament launched this year by the ATP to showcase the young men it hopes will lead it towards a brave new world, together with a raft of innovations designed to catch a new wave of tennis fans.

Sunday’s botched draw ceremony branded as “sexist” and “trashy” was hardly what the ATP had in mind -- forcing them and sponsors Red Bull to apologize after players had to select glamorous models to determine their round-robin group.

And all the talk of new technology, gizmos and enhanced fan experiences looked a little lame when, minutes before Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev were scheduled to appear for the tournament’s opening salvos, workmen were still welding pieces of the temporary stadium together.

It hardly felt state-of-the-art.

Yet once the crowds, many of them children, eventually filled the humongous aircraft hanger-sized hall at the Fiera Milano, there was much to savor as Khachanov and Medvedev showcased their considerable skills -- and the new rules that would make traditionalists wince.

There is a school of thought that men’s tennis, still in the midst of its golden era, is not broken. So don’t fix it.

Yet the ATP knows the clock ticks ever louder on the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - who are all in their 30s.

Hence it wants to promote the “Next Gen” led by Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who withdrew from Milan to concentrate on playing with the ‘grown ups’ at next week’s ATP Finals in London.

With a black hole looming, that is why they have invested so much time and effort into making the Milan event rock.

Featuring the top seven players in the ATP rankings aged 21 and under - minus world number three Zverev - and with an Italian wildcard, it is tennis on fast forward.

On a two-tone blue singles only court, backdropped with a deep red mock-up of Milan’s iconic La Scala opera house, things did feel very different indeed.

For starters sets were played to four with a tiebreak at 3-3. With no advantage points, deuce effectively became ‘sudden death’. Five of the first six games of the match, eventually won by Medvedev in one hour 48 minutes, were decided that way.

A shot-clock ticked away in the corner to enforce the 25-second rule between points -- ironic considering the tardy start.

Electronic Hawkeye calls replaced line judges with an automated, rather unnerving, British accented voice calling instantaneously “OUT” or “FAULT”.

Italian crowds don’t need an excuse to make noise and the scrapping of any requirement for them to stay silent, or stay still during play, meant a constant hubbub soundtracked the action.

Experienced Brazilian chair umpire Carlos Bernardes still presided over the action -- yet even he got left behind.

In the second game of the third set he instinctively called out “let” when a Medvedev serve flicked the net -- forgetting that service, for this week at least, are fair game.

Another novelty was the sight of the players wearing headphones at the end of sets -- not to listen to their favorite tunes, but to take advice from their coaches.

Any notion that the tournament would be a “hit and giggle” affair was quickly put to bed by action between world number 45 Khachanov and Medvedev, ranked 20 places lower.

They did the organizers proud as Medvedev hit back to win the Group B match 2-4 4-3(6) 4-3(3) 4-2.","Tennis: Future arrives, a little late, as Next Gen revolution begins",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1D72F1-OCASP

Harun Mwau filed the petition hours before a Monday deadline set by the constitution expired. Earlier in the day, a coalition of civil society groups said they were being targeted by the government in an effort to head off potential legal cases.

The Supreme Court has until Nov. 14 to rule on election petitions. If it upholds the result, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28.

Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term in August, defeating opposition leader Raila Odinga by 1.4 million votes. The Supreme Court nullified the vote citing procedural irregularities and ordered a second election.

Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26 saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms. Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote, though opposition supporters staged a boycott and prevented polls from opening in the west of the country.

Kenya is a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security and its prolonged election season has disrupted its economy.

Rights groups said on Monday the government was trying to prevent them from lodging cases challenging the Oct. 26 result. The government’s NGO Board, which monitors civil society organizations, summoned three groups for an audit on Monday, they said.

“It is not a coincidence that the NGO Board has decided to come after these organizations. All three have been instrumental in calling for free, fair, and credible elections,” said a statement from Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society groups that monitored the election.

The name means My Vote My Voice in Kiswahili.

The three organizations, Katiba Institute, Muslims for Human Rights and Inuka Trust, belong to the coalition. The head of Muslims for Human Rights said he had planned to file a court challenge.

Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu deployed 2,000 monitors for last month’s vote and said it found multiple cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal.

“They are trying to attack everywhere to see who is preparing to go to court so that they stop it,” Tom Oketch, secretary general for the Coalition for Constitutional Implementation, told a news conference.

Calls to Fazul Mohamed, the NGO Board’s executive director, went unanswered. Mwenda Njoka, a spokesman for the interior ministry, under which the board falls, said only Mohamed could comment.

In a separate case, another organization filed a case against the opposition, seeking to hold them liable for losses incurred because of their demonstrations.",Petition filed in Kenya court challenging Kenyatta's election victory,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D61ZB-OZATP

Auch zwei Ereignisse vom Donnerstag hallten noch nach und sorgten für positive Stimmung: die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von Janet Yellen an die Spitze der US-Notenbank und die Vorlage der mehrfach aufgeschobenen Steuer-Pläne der Republikaner um Präsident Donald Trump.

Im Technologiesektor steckten der Hype um den Verkaufsstart des iPhone X und ein rosiger Ausblick auf das Weihnachtsgeschäft von Apple die Anleger an. Die Apple-Aktie legte um 2,6 Prozent zu.

Gegen die Markttendenz brachen Aktien von AIG 4,6 Prozent ein. Die Serie von Wirbelstürmen in den USA und der Karibik trieb den Versicherer in die roten Zahlen. Der Konzern wies für das dritte Quartal einen Nettoverlust von 1,74 Milliarden Dollar aus, nachdem ein Jahr zuvor noch ein Gewinn von 462 Millionen Dollar in den Büchern stand.

Gut kam bei Investoren die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von US-Notenbankchefin Janet Yellen an. Der 64-Jährige steht für Kontinuität in der Geldpolitik. “Mit ihm dürfte der von der Fed eingeschlagene Kurs gradueller Leitzinsanhebungen fortgesetzt werden”, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank.

The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon is a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.

Waymo said that members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology -- and without human drivers -- in the next few months.

At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car. The service will start free, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.",Waymo launching ride-hailing service in Phoenix with no human behind wheel,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-selfdriving/waymo-launching-ride-hailing-service-in-phoenix-with-no-human-behind-wheel-idUSKBN1D72BU?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

“That’s it. I mean that’s the bottom line, he needed to be stopped,” Johnnie Langendorff told Reuters TV. “He was stopped and he’s not going to hurt anyone else ever again.”

Langendorff was driving his pickup truck in Sutherland Springs on Sunday when he saw a local man, Stephen Willeford, trading rifle fire with a black-clad stranger who had just emerged from the First Baptist Church.

“He jumped in my truck and said ‘He just shot up the church, we got to get him’ and I said ‘OK, let’s go,'” Langendorff said of his rapid words with Willeford.

“And so from there we blew through this intersection and he started going about 90-95 (miles per hour) (145-153 km per hour) keeping up with this guy,” Langendorff said.

At the time, neither of them knew they were chasing Devin Kelley, 26, an Air Force veteran who police say put on tactical gear, a ballistic vest and skull-like mask to carry out the most deadly mass shooting in the modern history of Texas.

The pursuit lasted about 10-12 minutes, Langendorff said. Then Kelley lost control and crashed into a ditch. They stopped too and Willeford trained his rifle on the disabled vehicle, Langendorff added, but the gunman never emerged.

Willeford’s cousin Ken Leonard told CNN that Willeford shot Kelley where there was a gap in his vest.

“Stephen is the best shot that I know,” Leonard told CNN. “He without armor and barefooted ran into the fire and put his own life at risk, took return fire and fired accurately three times. That’s an amazing accomplishment, especially for a man who has, who was never in the military.”

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Freeman Martin, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety, described Willeford as a good Samaritan and a “Texas hero.”

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt also hailed Willeford for grabbing his gun and responding to the danger.

“He didn’t have to come out,” Tackitt told Reuters. “He could have stayed at his house.”","'He needed to be stopped,' says man who pursued Texas gunman",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting-locals/he-needed-to-be-stopped-says-man-who-pursued-texas-gunman-idUSKBN1D62EY

The company's shares were trading at $1,715 and were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 .SPX. Shares of rival Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) were down 2.6 percent.

Priceline said on Monday it expected adjusted profit of $13.40 per share to $14.00 per share, well short of analysts’ average estimate of $15.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also said it expected booked room nights to grow 8 percent to 13 percent in the current quarter, a steep drop from the 31 percent growth posted in the year-ago quarter.

Priceline plans to boost advertising its Booking.com online travel agent website to about 30 countries by the year-end, up from 12 in 2016.

The owner of brands such as Priceline.com, Booking.com, Kayak said the jump in costs would pressure margins in the current quarter as well as in the first quarter.

At least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with Deutsche Bank the most bearish, cutting it by as much as $225 to $1,825.

The near-term growth rates are likely to be negatively impacted and the company will need to disprove investor skepticism about its capability to brand build, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

>> Safety and security has become a new, more serious part of church services, near Sutherland Springs, Texas. Where 26 people were killed in a place of worship.

Knittel is a high-profile figure in the aircraft leasing industry who until recently served as president of CIT Transportation Finance, up until its $10 billion acquisition by Dublin-based Avolon.

He will join the European company on Jan. 12 next year as chairman and chief executive of Airbus Americas, Airbus said.

He will combine the roles of Barry Eccleston, the unit’s chief executive who plans to retire next February, and Allan McArtor, its chairman who will maintain an honorary role.

Knittel joins Airbus at a time when it faces an ongoing trade dispute with Boeing over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies, while inheriting a trade row between Canada and the United States after agreeing last month to buy the CSeries jet program from Bombardier, which Boeing has accused of dumping.

Airbus operates an assembly line in Alabama and says it employs 5,000 people in the United States.

The decision to recruit another outsider to replace former Rolls-Royce executive Eccleston reflects efforts to inject new blood after Boeing hired a senior engine maker to run its commercial unit, while Latin American head Rafael Alonso is also said to be approaching retirement within the next year.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will host Trump in Beijing on Wednesday, with North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons expected to top their agenda. The United States has been pressuring China to do more to rein in its neighbor and ally.

Tourism is one of the few remaining ways North Korea earns hard currency, as the United Nations has ramped up sanctions on the country over the past year, curbing key export industries including coal, seafood and textiles.

“It was very unexpected, we had no idea this was going to happen until we received the notification today,” said a Chinese tour operator who runs trips to North Korea out of Dandong.

“This is devastating news for us,” he said, adding the order had come from the Dandong Tourism Bureau.

The sources Reuters interviewed for this story all requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

The Dandong Tourism Bureau was not immediately reachable for comment late on Tuesday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after working hours on Tuesday night.

Most tour companies that take Chinese tourists to North Korea are based in Dandong, the main trading hub on the Chinese side of the border.

Dandong-based tour companies were told on Tuesday that, as of Wednesday, they were only permitted to run one-day tours to Sinuiju, the North Korean city opposite Dandong, which is a popular destination for Chinese tourists making day trips.

Longer trips to Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea were banned until further notice, the sources said. Many Chinese tour operators run three-day or longer tours inside the world’s most isolated country.

The sources said the government had not given any official explanation for the changes.

“It’s low season right now, but that’s unlikely to be the reason,” said another Dandong-based tourism source.

“It’s much more likely to be connected to increasing sanctions against North Korea. We’ll have to wait and see what happens once Trump leaves China. Maybe they will loosen the rules but it’s very hard to say. This is all connected to the growing tensions.”

Earlier this year, the United States banned its citizens from visiting North Korea after American college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after returning to the United States in a coma following more than a year in captivity in North Korea. He had been detained during a tour there.

The Korea Maritime Institute, a think-tank in the South, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea. About 80 percent of all North Korea’s foreign tourists are Chinese, it says.

China said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012, but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013.

The order does not appear to affect North Korea-focused tour operators based elsewhere.

“We didn’t receive any notice to halt trips to North Korea,” said Rubio Chan of GLO Travel, a Hong Kong-based tour company which takes tourists to North Korea.

“But that may be because we are based out of Hong Kong and we work directly with our partners in Pyongyang.”",Exclusive: China curbs tourism to North Korea ahead of Trump visit - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D723T-OCATP

Investors have snapped up shares in Razer, a maker of keyboards and mice for gamers, and China Literature, the electronic publishing arm of locally listed heavyweight Tencent. That contrasts with signs of fatigue over initial public offerings in New York and London. Limited supply, particularly in tech, has helped keep the market healthy.

On Tuesday, Razer priced its $545 million IPO close to the top of the range, IFR reported, after drawing strong demand. Shares of China Literature, which raised $1.1 billion last week, are set to debut on Wednesday. Retail investors placed orders worth a staggering 620 times the number of shares on offer, according to someone familiar with the deal.

This is despite flagging sentiment elsewhere. Last week, shares in the doll-maker Funko cratered some 40 percent in New York - the worst first-day showing in 17 years. And two British outfits shelved planned London listings, following other disappointing debuts.

A shortage of deals helps. As of Nov. 2, world IPO volumes are up 29 percent this year at $143 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows, while volumes in the United States have rocketed 103 percent. But new listings in Hong Kong have totalled just $8.4 billion this year. That is less than half of last year’s amount, which was boosted by the $7.6 billion listing of Postal Savings Bank of China. And with a global technology rally in full swing, investors are hungry for stocks that tap into exciting trends, like a global gaming market or China’s smartphone-wielding consumers.

Japan has fared better following the U.S. election than might have been expected. Abe rushed to meet Trump soon after he won and has since maintained close contact. The result has been a better rapport than most world leaders enjoy with the disrupter-in-chief. And despite Trump’s hatred of trade imbalances, his transactional worldview, and radical suggestions during the campaign about Asian security, America has recommitted to the longstanding alliance.

The latest face-to-face talks are likely to focus on the threat across the Sea of Japan. That makes sense: both men take a similarly dim view of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. And Tokyo fears being surprised by a U.S. strike, which could have unpredictable consequences.

Abe mostly likes the economic status quo, though. Maintaining it will be a challenge given Trump’s instincts, and the $57 billion trade surplus Japan ran last year with the United States. Tokyo does not want a bilateral trade deal forcing down the gap by opening up sensitive markets such as rice. It prefers bigger pacts, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which it has helped stitch back together after the U.S. withdrawal. Any pressure to strengthen the yen, now comfortably weak at 114 per dollar, would also be worrying. It could derail a lengthening upturn in growth.

As Takuji Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors notes, Abe already has successfully separated the “potentially thorny trade issues” from the top political relationship. These are now being handled separately by Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Deputy PM Taro Aso.

The arrangement turns such matters into slower-burn, more technocratic issues. That has been yielding small wins for both sides: most recently on persimmons and potatoes, for example.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

“It’s a white powder incident, there were a couple of suspicious packages sent to a Tory (Conservative) MSP,” a source at the parliament told Reuters, using the acronym for Member of the Scottish parliament.

Business returned to normal after police gave the all-clear, the Scottish parliament said.

Known as Holyrood, the parliament building is located at the bottom of the Royal Mile, Edinburgh’s most famous thoroughfare which leads down from its historic castle to Queen Elizabeth’s Edinburgh residence, Holyrood Palace.

The parliament’s chief executive said only the building housing MSPs’ offices had been evacuated while the rest of the parliamentary campus was operating normally.

The parliament said later police inquiries had concluded there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident and that no crime had been committed.

At least Thomas Morel is hoping they will. He’s a 30-year-old former financier who saw how much Canadians liked the sport, or game, or pastime, or whatever axe-throwing might be.

“And I told myself, this is bound to work in Paris,” Morel said.

So he opened Les Cognees - French for “axes” or “hatchets” - where people can gather after work and pay to hurl heavy edged weapons around. What could go wrong?

Quite a lot, obviously, but safeguards are in place: no alcohol is served, the blades of the axes are blunted and security measures are read out to participants when they arrive.

And they are arriving. Morel’s venue is in the city’s north-east 18th district, a traditionally working-class neighborhood showing tentative signs of gentrification. On a typical day this week, it had attracted about 30 men and women in their mid-20s to mid-30s.

Some had come with friends and some, improbably, were there on corporate outings. For example, 29-year-old Antoine Verdier, a legal manager, and his boss, Camille Cocaud, had come on a team-building exercise.

“It’s a great way to unwind after work,” Cocaud said.

“It’s a real melting pot,” Morel said. “You get the young hipsters, you get companies on team-building, but you also get punks, you get mothers with children, you get families.”

Morel’s timing is good. France is trying to get more people to take part in sports, partly to promote the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

In fact, Morel can see a great marketing opportunity approaching, although some might say it’s a tad over-ambitious:

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-tech-toyota/toyota-seeks-more-investments-in-israeli-auto-tech-robotics-idUSKBN1D50OI

The measures are aimed at expelling young people already in the United States illegally and preventing new ones from crossing into the country.

Some of the policy shifts have generated headlines, including Trump’s decision in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. That measure, put in place by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allowed nearly 800,000 young people brought to the United States illegally as children the ability to live, work and study in the country without fear of deportation.

Other proposals and actions have received far less attention.

The Trump administration has recently intensified scrutiny of abused and neglected foreign minors applying to stay in the United States. It is seeking to restrict who qualifies for special protections granted to children crossing the border alone. And it is stepping up prosecutions of adults who paid smugglers to bring unaccompanied kids to the United States.

The White House also announced this fall it will end a program allowing Central American minors to apply for U.S. asylum while still living abroad. At the same time, the administration is exploring ways to scrap legal protections that limit how long and under what conditions children can be held in immigration detention centers.

In response to questions about the changes in immigration policy focused on children, the White House said that relevant agencies were reviewing ways to help “law enforcement professionals to do their jobs and keep the country safe.”

(For a graphic on Trump policies targeting young immigrants, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zaT2BK)

Trump came to office promising to crack down on immigration. That message grew stronger this week in the wake of a terrorist attack in New York by a 29-year-old immigrant awarded a green card through a visa lottery program the president has now vowed to end.

Some of his messaging on child immigrants also reflects security concerns. In a speech in Long Island in July, Trump called out “alien minors” as responsible for gang-related killings in the United States.

“These are animals,” he said of members of the notorious Central American gang MS-13.

In addition, the administration says it wants to prevent children from undertaking perilous journeys to the United States and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants.

“The President wants to stop the incentives for vulnerable children to come here illegally,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech in Texas in October. In another speech last month, he blamed “dirty immigration lawyers” for encouraging clients to game the process.

Some immigration advocates see the president’s focus on young border crossers differently. Children are perceived sympathetically by the public and have more legal protections than other immigrants, giving authorities less flexibility to deport them, they say.

It is “in the administration’s interest to paint unaccompanied children as gang bangers and not as asylum seekers fleeing violence and abuse,” said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Michael Tan. “The administration wants the public to perceive these children as monsters and not people deserving of refuge.”

‘UNWORKABLE’ DETENTION POLICY

President Trump is not the first president to try to crack down on minors crossing the border illegally. Obama prioritized the removal of young immigrants after the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border peaked at more than 68,000 in 2014, most of them from violence-torn Central America.

Trump campaigned on a promise to toughen enforcement further, saying Obama’s policies had failed. After he took office early in 2017, apprehensions of unaccompanied minors dropped sharply, to a low of just over 990 in April from more than 4,400 in January.

But the number of arrests has begun rising again, with nearly 3,000 unaccompanied minors caught in August, according to government data.

REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo

One target of the administration is a legal agreement dating back to 1997 that bars the government from holding child immigrants for long periods.

The so-called Flores settlement addressed what advocates said were harsh conditions for kids held in immigration detention facilities. To settle a class-action lawsuit, the government agreed to release minors quickly to adult relatives or licensed childcare programs, or to put them in the “least restrictive” setting possible if other options were not available.

Faced with 2014 surge in illegal crossings, the Obama administration fought broad legal interpretations of the agreement in court to make it easier to detain families. The Trump White House now wants to scrap it altogether.

An internal memo dated Sept. 8 written by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and reviewed by Reuters called the two-decade-old legal agreement “unworkable,” and presented four options to fight or end it. Among them: DHS could ask a federal court to dissolve the Flores deal, a move the memo acknowledged could prove difficult given past rulings that have bolstered the agreement.

A DHS spokesperson said the agency would not comment on “internal working documents.”

‘ABUSE’ OF PROGRAM FOR ABUSED KIDS

The administration is focused not just on stopping illegal border crossings by children but also on limiting their ability to stay once they reach the United States.

Slideshow (5 Images)

One of its targets is SIJS, or special immigrant juvenile status, a program for foreign minors who have been abused, abandoned or neglected.

To qualify, children have to prove their mistreatment in U.S. family court, after which they are protected from deportation and allowed to apply for green cards.

SIJS applications ballooned following the 2014 surge in unaccompanied minors. The program’s numbers hit 19,475 in the 2016 fiscal year, a more than 1,000 percent increase from 1,646 in fiscal year 2010.

The White House and immigration hard-liners in Congress say lawyers have taken advantage of the program by using it for kids who are not in the kind of peril the statute was intended to address. Chief among their complaints is that children abandoned by one parent can apply for SIJS even if another parent is providing adequate care. The administration is already taking steps to limit the program.

Immigration attorneys say government scrutiny of SIJS petitions has increased, slowing the approval process and leaving kids in limbo.

Approvals from April to June totaled 1,862, down more than 50 percent from the previous three-month period, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

USCIS acknowledged that it has stepped up scrutiny of petitions “to ensure that they meet criteria for approval.” But the agency stressed that the majority of applications are still approved.

From January through June of this year 5,671 SIJS petitions were approved while 403 applications were denied. Meanwhile pending applications are ballooning, totaling 22,745 through June, as new petitions grow.

The delays are creating confusion for young immigrants such as 20-year-old Drucilla.

She says her mother neglected her after bringing her to the United States illegally from Jamaica when she was three years old following her father’s murder. Drucilla eventually moved in with an aunt in New York and applied for SIJS last year in order to stay in the country.

Drucilla, who asked only be identified by her first name, said she is nervous about the outcome of her case after U.S. officials recently requested additional documents to substantiate her claims.

“Growing up, nothing was ever in my control,” she said. “I have a lot of anxiety.”

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.","On Tuesday, a driver rammed a pickup truck through a crowded bike path in New York City, killing eight people and injuring 12 before he was shot by police.

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

Despite dominating the sector in Brazil, Uber has joined forces with three smaller apps for a public campaign that helped convince senators last week to scrap parts of a bill that would have effectively turned the companies into regular taxi services.

With Uber facing a possible ban in London and several U.S. federal investigations, the company’s new Chief Executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, needed a win in Brazil. The South American country is its second-largest market after the United States and Sao Paulo, Brazil’s economic capital, has more Uber rides than New York.

Together with Spain’s Cabify and Brazilian apps 99 and Lady Driver - which focuses on women drivers and customers - Uber recruited digital influencers and flooded social media with messages asking their users to call their lawmakers.

Under the slogan “Together for Mobility,” the apps got thousands of their drivers onto the streets of Brazil’s cities in protest, while the country managers of Uber, 99 and Cabify made a video together warning Brazilians that ride-hailing was in danger of being suffocated by red tape.

The collaboration with competitors may be an early sign of Khosrowshahi’s strategy of fighting unwanted regulation with a less confrontational approach than his outspoken predecessor Travis Kalanick.

“We called on drivers and users to mobilize by gathering signatures in support of alternative regulation for the apps,” said Fabio Sabba, chief spokesman for Uber in Brazil, adding that 816,000 people signed the petition presented to Congress.

In their amended bill, senators dropped requirements that drivers own their cars and use the same red license plates used by public taxis, though they left a ban on rides outside the city where the car is registered.

While drivers will still have to register with municipal authorities, they will not be classed as public transport if the amendments stand, and no city would be able ban car-hailing services or limit their numbers.

“Together we boosted public awareness of the issue and the Senate accepted the amendments,” said Daniel Bedoya, Brazil manager at Cabify, which operates in 11 countries and had never teamed up with Uber before.

The ride-booking firms said they are confident public pressure will sway Brazil’s lower house to accept the Senate’s amendments, a milestone in efforts to roll back a regulatory crackdown that could jeopardize their rapid global expansion.

But the battle is far from over. There is no date scheduled for the final vote and the leftist Workers Party, backed by taxi unions, has vowed to undo the changes.

ATTRACTING INVESTMENT

Tough regulation would slam the brakes on foreign investment into the fast-growing Brazilian market, where car-hailing apps have taken off explosively due to disastrous public transport and the belief that online booking is safer in crime-ridden cities.

In January, China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, announced plans to invest $100 million in 99, an on-demand taxi and ride-sharing service. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) followed suit in May with its own $100 million investment in the Brazilian app.

Stricter regulation would be a blow for Uber, which has 80 percent of the Brazilian market, as Japan’s SoftBank and other investors are negotiating the terms of a $10 billion investment in the company.

The debate in Brazil comes shortly after authorities in London decided not to renew Uber’s operating license and highlights the legal threats against its foreign operations as the company prepares for an initial public offering IPO as soon as 2019.

With the stakes high, Khosrowshahi flew at short notice to Brasilia last week to join lobbying efforts on the day the bill went to a Senate vote in the country’s capital.

Striking a more conciliatory style than the combative Kalanick, Khosrowshahi kept his cool after senators refused to meet with him but publicly warned that Uber’s future in Latin America’s largest economy depended on the decision.

The company was careful to emphasize the impact on ordinary Brazilians, saying the bill would leave its 500,000 drivers out of work by making it too expensive to operate.

Uber’s allies played their part. Lady Driver founder Gabriela Corrêa said she lobbied the 13 women senators in the corridors of Congress, telling them many of her drivers were mothers who depended on the app for their families’ livelihood.

Lady Driver began in February in Sao Paulo and is expanding fast in an activity long-dominated by men. The app has 9,500 drivers and will launch in November in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second-largest city.

“Congressmen won’t undo the amendments because they have realized that ride-hailing is needed today,” she said. “If we go back to the past, women will lose ground.”","Uber, rival apps join forces in Brazil to stem tide of regulation",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-brazil/uber-rival-apps-join-forces-in-brazil-to-stem-tide-of-regulation-idUSKBN1D71KE

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

Der Iran wies jede Verantwortung zurück.

UN WARNEN VOR KATASTROPHE IM JEMEN

Als Reaktion auf den Raketenabschuss kündigte die von Saudi-Arabien angeführte Militärkoalition gegen die Huthi-Rebellen die Schließung aller Häfen, Flughäfen und Zufahrtswege zum Jemen an. Die Vereinten Nationen rief die Koalition auf, einen Weg für Hilfslieferungen frei zu machen. Sie warnten vor einer Katastrophe für die Menschen. Sieben Millionen Menschen seien von Hunger bedroht und auf die Hilfslieferungen angewiesen. Der Konflikt hat bereits eine der weltweit größten Krisen für die Menschen ausgelöst, mehr als 10.000 kamen bislang ums Leben.

Seit 2015 kämpfen die schiitischen Huthi-Rebellen gegen die Truppen von Präsident Abd-Rabbu Mansur. Sie erhalten vom Iran Beistand.

Underlining the difficulty of such an approach, however, they were divided over how to impose sanctions on countries that help tax avoidance, which is often legal.

The ministers made the issue the main topic of their monthly meeting after release of the “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby. The papers made public the tax affairs of numerous companies and investors.

To reduce the appeal of jurisdictions that charge little or no taxes, EU ministers discussed plans for a common blacklist that would shine the light on such countries.

“There was strong support for the idea of moving forward quickly,” Estonia’s Finance Minister Toomas Tõniste, who holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told reporters.

He added that “most countries” wanted the adoption of the list next month, tacitly acknowledging however that not all the 28 EU member states were equally keen to go that fast.

Jurisdictions in the limelight include offshore banking centers such as Jersey and Bermuda. But some EU countries, notably Luxembourg and Malta have also been criticized for acting as tax havens.

The main sticking point for the EU is whether blacklisted countries should be subject to sanctions.

“I am not sure if there will be sanctions,” an EU official said, citing differences among member states, who need to unanimously back proposals on tax matters.

Luxembourg and Malta, for example, said that sanctions would be unnecessary because investors would be deterred from putting money in highlighted tax havens, an EU official who attended the meeting said.

“We are thinking, for instance, about the possibility of cutting financial support of the international institutions like the IMF (International Monetary Fund) or the World Bank on the states that would not provide the needed information on tax,” he told reporters before the meeting.

Although many states backed the idea of sanctions, Le Maire’s proposals did not gather much support, as it may be difficult to convince international organizations to apply the measures.

The EU commission’s vice president Valdis Dombrovskis declined to comment on the French proposals. “We hope an agreement on the blacklist will be possible by the end of the year,” he told a news conference.

He however stressed that “countermeasures” for non-cooperative countries were needed.

NEW MOMENTUM?

The Paradise Papers revelations gave new impetus to EU countries willing to counter tax avoidance, but turning plans into concrete actions is not easy.

Similar leaks last year led to a deluge of legislative proposals by the EU commission, but most of them are still stuck in talks among EU states.

The EU has been working for more than a year on the common blacklist that would replace largely toothless national lists.

An existing list of tax havens compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations, currently includes only Trinidad and Tobago.

By contrast, the EU is currently screening about 50 countries that may not respect the bloc’s criteria on tax cooperation.

The final number is likely to be much lower than that, officials said without giving details on screened jurisdictions.

States that charge no corporate tax are not automatically considered at risk of breaching EU tax criteria, but they are subject to screening if they also facilitate the creation of shell companies and other structures that could help tax avoidance.

Screened countries are expected to make commitments by the end of November, an EU official said, adding that states hit by recent hurricanes were given more leeway.","EU tax havens blacklist seen in December, but enforcement unclear",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-ecofin-france/eu-tax-havens-blacklist-seen-in-december-but-enforcement-unclear-idUSKBN1D713R?il=0

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency.

One of the first changes agreed to on Monday, related to carried interest, would go toward fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.

Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax-writing panel, offered to make smaller portions of Wall Street financiers’ income eligible for a lower capital gains tax rate.

It was one of many revisions that are expected as the House Ways and Means Committee amends the tax bill. Brady pledged to lawmakers that they would have a chance to propose their own changes. “Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process,” he told the committee.

Although Republicans generally support the bill’s broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments.

New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump’s plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector.

“There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill,” Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill.

An analysis of how taxpayers would be impacted by the bill from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center issued on Monday was later withdrawn due to an error. TPC said that its analysis contained an error related to a proposed child tax credit and that it would release a revised version as soon as possible.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.

The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent.

With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.

Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it.

Brady’s carried interest provision would lengthen to more than three years from one the amount of time Wall Street financiers must hold assets in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate.

Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits – typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors – that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds.

Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.

MARKET RALLY ON EXPECTATIONS

Securing congressional passage of the tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year.

Investors are adding to the pressure. The expectation of deep tax cuts has helped fuel a stock market rally during Trump's time as president, with the broad S&P 500 index .SPX up about 14 percent.

The Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority, is developing its own version of the tax legislation, which would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to Trump for signing.

Several Republican senators have said they would have a problem voting for any tax bill that significantly increased the deficit. The House bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.

Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the House bill could add to the fiscal strain in some states and local jurisdictions by limiting their tax-raising flexibility.

Republican leaders are pushing for the House to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. They have said a draft Senate bill could be ready at the end of this week.

As Prime Minister Theresa May heads toward a 2019 EU divorce that will shape Britain’s prosperity and global influence for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk undermining her remaining authority.

In the latest misstep, Johnson came under pressure to retract remarks made on Nov. 1 that Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said Johnson’s comment was incorrect, while opposition British lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson called Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday to discuss the case, and made clear that he had been seeking to make the point that he condemned the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, a spokesman said.

“The UK government has no doubt that she was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit,” Johnson told parliament.

“My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity,” he said.

“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and I am glad to provide this clarification.”

Johnson said he would travel to Iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there, and would try to meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe while there.

May’s spokesman expressed confidence in Johnson, adding that the “he was doing a good job”.

Monique Villa, Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a project manager in the media development team. Villa said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not a journalist and had never trained journalists in Iran.

“We welcome UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s clarification of his comments,” Villa said. “It’s time now for the Foreign Secretary to meet Nazanin in jail.”

SHAMBOLIC GOVERNMENT?

Johnson is not the only one distracted.

At the weekend, May’s deputy, Damian Green, denied an allegation made in The Sunday Times newspaper that police found pornography on one of his computers in the Houses of Parliament in 2008.

On Monday, international development minister Priti Patel apologized for failing to disclose meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday.

Besides her government’s sometimes contradictory signals on Brexit, May has faced criticism from opponents for her handling of other issues: from a deadly apartment block fire in June to a sexual harassment scandal in parliament that prompted Michael Fallon, her loyal defense secretary, to resign.

“In my lifetime, I have never experienced a British government which seems to be so shambolic,” said Simon Hix, a professor of political science at the London School of Economics.

“They are in the midst of one of the greatest challenges of the last 50 years – Brexit – and they have sexual harassment scandals in parliament, the Paradise Papers and then now on top of that the behavior of May’s ministers.”

On Tuesday, Johnson came under pressure from opponents to retract his comments about Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment.

She was brought again into court on Saturday, three days after Johnson’s remarks, and accused by a judge of “spreading propaganda against the regime”.

The British Foreign Office quoted Zarif as saying that Johnson’s comments had nothing to do with the weekend court appearance.

The charges against Zaghari-Ratcliffe were denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Reuters News.

Avast previously filed to go public on Nasdaq in December 2011 but its listing was pulled in July 2012 due to tough market conditions.

CVC and Rothschild declined to comment.

Avast, which makes antivirus software for PC, Mac and Android, was valued at $1 billion when CVC bought a majority stake three years ago.

The business protects more than 400 million users in the world from online threats and relies on a so-called freemium model whereby online users can download its core product for free and only pay for additional services.

It says it handles about 3.5 billion virus attacks per month in over 150 countries.

Avast’s enterprise value has more than tripled in recent years following a series of bolt-on acquisitions including a $1.3 billion swoop on U.S. rival AVG Technologies in 2016 and the purchase of London-based optimization software firm Piriform in July for an undisclosed amount.

Chief executive Vincent Steckler told Reuters in 2015 that the company was then worth “upwards of $2 billion” and it would take a few more years before the business was ready to go public.

Summit Partners, which has invested since 2010, remains one of Avast’s minority investors alongside Czech entrepreneurs Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera who founded the company in 1991.

Avast, which has former SAP Chief Operating Officer Erwin Gunst on its board, posted revenues of $714 million in 2016 with core earnings of $353 million.

Its float is expected to surpass the record 1 billion pound IPO of Sophos (SOPH.L), another private equity-backed security software business which was floated in London two years ago.

Sophos, which has a market value of 2.8 billion pounds, has seen its shares soaring from an IPO price of 225 pence in 2015 to 615 pence on Nov. 7.

But Avast is expected to trade at a discount to Sophos since it mainly serves private individuals and its software can be downloaded for free, one of the sources said.

So far in 2017 British IPOs have raised $5.2 billion, a 13 percent drop on the year.

Hopes for a revival before the end of the year were dashed on Friday after broadcasting masts firm Arqiva and ready meals supplier Bakkavor pulled the plug on two of London’s biggest deals, blaming market uncertainty.

That came a week after business services firm TMF abruptly ended plans to list in London, opting instead for a 1.75 billion euro sale to CVC.",Exclusive: Avast owners hire Rothschild for $4 billion software IPO - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D715Y-OCATC

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and Congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.

All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate.

The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

“For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said after the committee voted.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another sponsor, said that, in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights.

Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, calling for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war.

Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of former President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.”

Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week that they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the bill. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House of Representatives.

Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan's comments are a dramatic escalation of a crisis that threatens to destabilise tiny Lebanon, This fragile country - where one in four people is a Syrian refugee - is in the cross-hairs of regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Especially since the Saudi-backed prime minister, Saad Al-Hariri, resigned in a statement broadcast from Riyadh at the weekend. Hezbollah participated in his government, but it is allied to Iran. Its guerrilla army, more powerful than the national one, is playing a major role in the war in neighbouring Syria, shoring up government forces. That's another arena for the proxy war between Tehran and Riyadh. Al-Sabhan said Hezbollah's actions constituted aggression against Saudi Arabia, and the government would be considered - quote - ""a government which has declared war"". Hariri's resignation shocked even his aides. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah called it a ""Saudi statement"" and said Riyadh had forced him to do it.

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.","SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (Reuters) - The man who carried out one of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings was able to buy guns legally because a prior domestic violence conviction while he was in the Air Force was never put into an FBI database used in background checks, officials said.

Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sunday’s massacre at a church in rural southeastern Texas, was convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the U.S. Air Force in 2012, according to the Pentagon.

Authorities put the death toll at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was killed. The attack ranks as the fifth-deadliest by a single gunman in U.S. history.

The Air Force said it had failed to transmit information about Kelley’s conviction to the National Criminal Information Center system, a U.S. government database used by licensed firearms dealers to check prospective gun buyers for criminal backgrounds.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the military, called the failure to enter Kelley’s record into the database “appalling.”

“I don’t believe that the Air Force should be left to self-police after such tragic consequences,” Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said in a statement. “The failure to properly report domestic violence convictions may be a systemic issue.”

The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Twenty others were wounded, with 10 still in critical condition late on Monday, officials said.

Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his getaway vehicle, where authorities found two handguns, Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Monday.

Kelley was also wounded by a resident who heard the gunshot, grabbed his own rifle and raced to the church, shooting the 26-year-old twice as he fled.

The massacre stirred an ongoing debate over gun ownership, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Guns are part of the fabric of life in rural areas.

U.S. President Donald Trump on an Asia trip told reporters he believed stricter reviews of gun purchases would have had no effect on Sunday’s massacre.

“There would have been no difference,” Trump said while on a visit to South Korea. He added that stricter gun laws might have prevented the man who shot Kelley from acting as he did.

“You would have had hundreds more dead,” Trump said.

AIR FORCE INQUIRY

The Air Force opened an inquiry into how it handled the former airman’s criminal record, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure that other cases “have been reported correctly,” Pentagon officials said.

Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, has exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters en route to Brussels that the Air Force was still working to determine exactly how the error occurred.

“First I have to define what the problem is. If the problem is we didn’t put something out, we will correct that,” Mattis said.

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.

Federal databases did not contain any information that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation, said Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Antonio.

Kelley stormed into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, population about 400, opening fire with a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle.

Authorities said Kelley had been involved in a domestic dispute with the parents of his second wife, whom he married in 2014, and had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law before the shooting.

Although his in-laws were known to occasionally attend services at First Baptist, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said family members were not there on Sunday.

Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the shooting as well as 15 empty 30-round ammunition magazines.",U.S. Air Force error allowed Texas church gunman to buy weapons,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-texas-shooting/air-force-didnt-log-texas-church-gunman-conviction-in-u-s-database-idUKKBN1D715U?il=0

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Secondo quanto spiegato oggi agli analisti, la migrazione dei fondi di fondi porterà un incremento dei margini consolidati al netto delle tasse di circa 20 punti base, i singoli fondi e building block (classe istituzionale) di circa 34/42 punti base, i singoli fondi (classe retail) di 5/7 punti base e i bulding block (classe retail) di circa 25 punti base.

“Diventiamo molto più efficienti, più in controllo della catena di costruzione dei prodotti di modo da essere anche più in linea con la ‘product governance’ prevista di Mifid II”, ha spiegato Foti.

Altra novità della banca multicanale del gruppo UniCredit è stata quella di adeguare le condizioni dei conti correnti aperti prima del 2012, che avevano una indicizzazione all‘Euribor a 1 mese (oggi negativo) portandoli a zero costi e zero interessi come gli altri. Questo vuol dire, si legge nella presentazione, che un incremento di 100 punti base dei tassi a breve si tradurrebbe in un aumento del margine di interesse di 132 milioni.

Commentando il dato di raccolta del mese di ottobre, che ha visto afflussi di 517 milioni, Foti ha detto infine che la banca si avvantaggia del trend di domanda di consulenza e della crescente digitalizzazione del paese “che sta procedendo a passi spediti e questo sta spostando l‘attenzione dei clienti dalla prossimità della filiale alla qualità del servizio”.

Three Pillars Pte Ltd, an affiliate of the Qatar Foundation, has put up for sale through stock market transactions about 199.9 million shares in Bharti Airtel in a price range of 473-490 rupees each, according to a deal term sheet.

The price range is a discount of 4.7-8 percent to Bharti Airtel’s Tuesday closing price, but far higher than the 340 rupees Three Pillars paid for it in 2013.

The stake sale comes after other Qatari companies, including its sovereign wealth fund, have been cutting stakes in foreign companies and raising cash to withstand pressure on its economy, which has been hit by economic sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since early June.

The Gulf countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies.

Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, has responded to the crisis by pumping billions of dollars into local banks to shore up their deposits.

It has also reduced its stake in upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N), Russian energy giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).

Trump’s address to South Korea’s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America’s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict.

It contrasted markedly with Trump’s earlier threats to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea’s doorstep, will build on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue.

Trump’s official “talking points” for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea’s “amazing rise” with North Korea’s “sad, backward state” and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record.

PRESSING BEIJING TO EXERT LEVERAGE

Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions.

Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea’s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.

“President Xi … has been very helpful. We’ll find out how helpful soon,” Trump said.

But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests.

“On this issue, China’s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday. “Everyone can see clearly that we don’t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.”

But with Trump appearing to crack open the door to diplomacy with North Korea – something that China has long urged – he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea.

For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April.

The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday.

Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details.","Trump to give major North Korea speech, then press China to do more",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia/trump-to-give-major-north-korea-speech-then-press-china-to-do-more-idUSKBN1D725C?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Fredericks, who won four silver medals at the 1992 and 1996 Games, is suspected of receiving bribes and laundering the money through Paris, a source close to the inquiry in France said on Friday. He appeared before a French magistrate on Thursday.

Fredericks has previously rejected allegations of corruption.

The IOC said in a statement that its executive board had decided to suspend Fredericks after “considering the gravity and urgency of the situation and its impact on the reputation of the IOC.”

Fredericks is already being investigated by the global Athletics Integrity Unit over payments he received from Papa Massata Diack, the son of former world athletics chief Lamine Diack, on the day Rio won the vote to host the 2016 Olympics.

Fredericks has previously said that a payment of $300,000 to his company was recompense for legitimate work.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

De Blasio had the support of 61 percent of likely voters in the most recent Quinnipiac University poll in the race, released last month, more than triple the 17 percent of respondents who backed Malliotakis, of the city’s Staten Island borough.

Last week’s truck attack, in which an Uzbek man inspired by the Islamic State killed eight people and injured 12 on a bike lane, likely had little impact on voter preference in the heavily Democratic city, said Douglas Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College.

“He’s going to win big,” Muzzio said.

A progressive liberal, de Blasio in the past week campaigned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who backed de Blasio’s call for a state tax hike on people making more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in Albany.

De Blasio’s chances are helped by strong disapproval in New York for U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican businessman and real estate developer whose deals and personal life commanded the front page of the city’s tabloid newspapers long before he garnered greater national fame for his starring role in the reality television show “The Apprentice.”

Slideshow (6 Images)

Some 78 percent of respondents to the Quinnipiac poll disapproved of the way Trump is doing his job, with just 18 percent approving. De Blasio had a 58 percent favorability rating in the poll of 731 likely voters performed Sept. 27-Oct. 4, which had a 4.7 percentage point margin of error.

De Blasio has taken heat for increasing service disruptions and delays on the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the United States, though he has taken pains to emphasize that the subway is run by a state-controlled authority, not the city.

Malliotakis in recent weeks has criticized de Blasio over testimony from a former donor to the mayor in a federal corruption trial involving a union boss. The donor, Jona Rechnitz, told jurors he established a direct line to City Hall after raising money for the mayor’s campaign in 2013.

Officials said Sumgong, who became the first Kenyan woman to win an Olympic marathon title when she struck gold in Rio last year, had failed an out of competition test in April, days before she was due to defend her London Marathon title. Her four-year ban has been backdated to April 3.

The 32-year-old’s claim that she failed the test after undergoing treatment at a Kenyan hospital for an ectopic pregnancy was rejected as “not authentic” by the tribunal, as the hospital in question denied treating the athlete.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the Bank of Canada would be “mildly encouraged” by the increase in year-over-year wage growth.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Separate trade data for September was much gloomier, possibly tempering the central bank’s enthusiasm for a third rate hike in quick succession.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

Two British companies pulled their planned London listings on Friday, following weak performances from other new stocks. At the same time, tycoon-controlled Russian energy group En+ priced its shares at the bottom of the offer range. The one thing still rising is the number of banks working on IPOs. That’s part of the problem.

The London Stock Exchange

Arqiva, a broadcast infrastructure group, and Bakkavor, which makes hummus for supermarkets, both shelved their IPOs at the last minute, saying that the market for new issues is too volatile. There’s something to that, at least in Britain. Companies in Europe have raised $38.5 billion in new equity offerings in 2017, 22 percent more than at this time last year. In Britain, however, total takings are down 13 percent.

True, the affected companies have their quirks. Arqiva runs old-school TV masts, while Bakkavor has four customers of scale and En+ is an oligarch’s plaything. Yet newly listed stocks elsewhere are also doing less well than new investors might have hoped. Shares in BAWAG Group, an Austrian bank, have fallen 5 percent since they started trading on Oct. 25. SMCP, a French clothier, is also trading below its offer price. HelloFresh, which delivers pre-prepared recipe kits and is ploughing the proceeds of its offering into marketing, is barely a whisker above where it started on Thursday.

Hedge funds are one source of trouble. Having made a decent return this year so far – 10.7 percent on equity strategies by Sept. 30 according to Preqin data – fund managers have little incentive to risk their performance fees on untested new stocks. Shares in Blue Apron, an American HelloFresh clone, have plunged by two-thirds since the company’s June IPO in New York. Hedge funds aren’t everything, but they provide capital markets bankers with a useful way of jimmying up price tension.

The finger then points to the banks themselves. After all, their job ought to be to know how market participants are feeling some time before the 11th hour. But accountability is being spread ever thinner. A European IPO now has on average 2.5 bookrunners – the highest ever in the region. Failed IPO candidates may say they don’t need the money, but what they do need is a bit more discernment.",Breakingviews - Europe’s IPO failures are a problem overshared,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arqiva-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-europes-ipo-failures-are-a-problem-overshared-idUSKBN1D314Z

Syria and Nicaragua were the only two nations outside the 195-nation pact when it was agreed in 2015, under former U.S. president Barack Obama. Nicaragua, which originally denounced the plan as too weak, signed up last month.

Syria’s delegation told a meeting of almost 200 nations on climate change in Bonn that their country, torn by civil war, would sign up for the agreement to curb rising temperatures by curbing greenhouse gas emissions, delegates said.

The move will isolate Washington.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubts that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the prime cause of global warming, announced in June that he intended to pull out and instead promote U.S. coal and oil industries.

“We need everybody on board,” Ronald Jumeau, of the Seychelles, told Reuters. “We want the United States in too. We take no pleasure in the United States being out.”

Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat which is organising the meeting, said that Syria had not yet formally submitted any documents about its plan.

“Syria’s decision shows the breadth of support for the Paris agreement,” Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Reuters of the moves by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Meyer said businesses, mayors, cities and other groups were also stepping up actions to limit a rise in temperatures that scientists say are stoking more downpours, heat waves and rising sea levels.

David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute think-tank, noted that Trump’s climate views had previously isolated him in the Group of Seven and the Group of 20.

“Now he’ll be isolated from all nations,” he said.

The Paris agreement seeks to limit a rise in temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, ideally 1.5.

The U.N.’s weather agency said on Monday that this year is on track to be the second or third warmest since records began in the 19th century, behind a record-breaking 2016.

Veteran hedge fund manager Odey, whose firm has a 0.9 percent Sky stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said that Fox’s 10.75 pound-a-share bid “starts to look like it’s not a very good price” for the European pay-TV broadcaster.

Odey’s opposition to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.4 billion) takeover comes after CNBC reported that Murdoch’s Fox had recently held talks about selling some assets to Disney.

That scenario added to the potential obstacles to the Sky deal which faces an in-depth regulatory investigation and strong opposition from some British politicians.

“I’d vote against the deal,” Odey told Reuters on Tuesday, when asked about Fox’s offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own.

He added: “The interesting thing is: can Sky survive happily without Fox? I think it can quite happily.”

Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch, had initially backed the Fox bid for Sky, which was announced in December.

But in August he told Reuters that he thought the offer was beginning to “look rather mean”, although he stopped short of saying he would oppose it.

Sky shares traded 1.2 percent lower at 928 pence by 1520 GMT on Tuesday, well below the bid price.

Odey said that he had changed his mind because Sky’s financial results have been “much better than people forecast” , since the offer was made.

Last month, the British broadcaster posted an 11 percent rise in core earnings to 582 million pounds for the three months to the end of September.

DISNEY DEAL?

Odey’s comments come after CNBC said that Disney recently discussed buying Fox’s movie and TV production studio studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and its stake in Sky.

The talks were not currently ongoing, the broadcaster said.

Analysts at Liberum said they still saw a successful conclusion of Fox’s bid for Sky as the most likely outcome, but the Disney-Fox talks had thrown a curveball into the mix.

They said Fox may scrap its bid for Sky as part of a proposed sale of assets, and they also noted that Fox’s willingness to consider including the Sky stake in any sale could be seen as a signal that it feels less confident of gaining regulatory approval from the British government.

UBS, however, said a combination of Disney and Fox content could strengthen the rationale for buying all of Sky.

The British company was already starting to build a pan-European streaming platform with its Now TV and Sky Ticket products, and the addition of content from Disney as well as Fox would only make that more compelling, it said.

The bank also said in the event that a Fox/Sky deal was blocked, based on the CNBC article, Disney could be a potential strategic bidder for Sky and it noted it would not have the cross-media complications of a Fox bid.

His announcement, made from Riyadh, toppled a power sharing government that included Hezbollah ministers that shocked even his aides.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The 32-year-old’s claim that she failed the test after undergoing treatment at a Kenyan hospital for an ectopic pregnancy was rejected as “not authentic” by the tribunal, as the hospital in question denied treating the athlete.

Though financial markets have been broadly skeptical about the ability of the Trump presidency to pass significant political reforms since he won the U.S. elections, funds have enjoyed inflows and have seen the value of their holdings rise as global financial markets enjoyed double-digit returns.

As the Trump presidency approached a one-year anniversary on Wednesday, total net assets under management of U.S. mutual funds including exchange-traded funds climbed by a sixth to $21.1 trillion over the one-year period ending Sept. 30, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Equity funds were the leaders with assets under management for stock funds seeing the biggest increase over that period with total assets rising by a fifth to $11.4 trillion as of end-September global stock markets hit new peaks.

U.S. stocks hit a record high on Monday with stocks up more than 15 percent year-to-date while an index of high yield U.S. bonds is up by a similar quantum in that period.

While performance has been a key driver as rising markets pushed up valuations, inflows have also been robust, especially to passively managed funds as active managers faced another year of fierce competition from their exchange-traded counterparts.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

In der zweiten Runde der Sondierungsverhandlungen über die Bildung einer neuen Regierung sollen Kompromisse ausgelotet werden. “Wir schalten vom Sammel- in den Arbeitsmodus”, sagte Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner nach den gut vierstündigen Beratungen am Dienstag. Am Montag hatten sich die Spitzen der vier Parteien fünfeinhalb Stunden zusammengesetzt, um die großen Themen zu definieren, die geklärt werden müssen. CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel hatte betont, dass sie eine Jamaika-Regierung wolle, zu den nationalen Klimazielen 2020 stehe und mit dem Ende der Gespräche bis zum 16. November rechne.

KERNFORDERUNGEN VON FDP UND GRÜNEN

Die Zugeständnisse von FDP und Grünen bedeuten einen Einschnitt in den Verhandlungen. In der ersten Sondierungsrunde hatten alle vier Parteien ihre Maximalforderungen erneuert. “Wir begrüßen auch die Bewegung, die es bei Grünen zu geben scheint”, sagte Lindner nun. “Ich gehe nicht davon aus, dass wir mit 8,9 Prozent es schaffen werden, zu hundert Prozent unsere Handschrift auch in der Mobilitätspolitik durchzusetzen”, räumte Grünen-Parteichef Cem Özdemir ein. “Es geht darum zu zeigen, ob wie einerseits gemeinsame Ziele haben, auf die wir uns verabreden können, und ob andererseits jeder Partner, jede Partnerin auch in der Lage ist, kompromissfähig zu sein”, sagte seine Co-Verhandlerin Katrin Göring-Eckardt: “Wir haben das signalisiert. Jetzt ist die Zeit des Brückenbauens.”

Allerdings beklagten FDP-Politiker am Dienstag erneut ein schleppendes Tempo bei den Beratungen. “Wir haben einen sehr ambitionierten Zeitplan. Ich bin nicht sicher, dass der einzuhalten ist”, sagte Kubicki. Als Problem gilt nun die CSU, die sich beim Thema Migration nicht bewege.

Eine große Steuerreform war neben dem Soli-Abbau eine wichtige Forderung der FDP. Das Finanzministerium hatte allerdings schon früh auf den begrenzten finanziellen Spielraum für Entlastungen und die gleichzeitig auch von den Liberalen geforderten teuren Investitionen verwiesen. Der Abbau des Soli ist unter den Jamaika-Parteien nicht umstritten, lediglich das Tempo des Ausstieges. Ein Argument für die Präferenz für den Soli-Abbau gegenüber einer Einkommensteuerreform ist auch bei der FDP, dass letztere von der SPD im Bundesrat verhindert werden könnte. Dafür müsste der Bund aber die Mindereinnahmen beim Soli-Abbau allein verkraften. Lindner sagte, dass auch über weitere Entlastungen etwa für Familien gesprochen werden solle.

Die Grünen wiederum hatten Bewegung bei dem für sie zentralen Thema Klima gezeigt. Wenn es schon kein Enddatum für den Verbrennungsmotor gebe, müsse ein Jamaika-Bündnis aber nötige Maßnahmen einleiten, um eine emissionsfreie Mobilität zu erreichen, forderte Özdemir. “Dazu gehört die blaue Plakette, dazu gehört die Nachrüstung beim Diesel, dazu gehört, Anreizsysteme so zu machen steuerlich, dass es sich lohnt, emissionsfrei zu fahren”, sagte er. Vor allem die CSU und der frühere Verkehrsminister Dobrindt lehnen die blauen Plaketten und die damit aus Sicht der Union verbundenen Fahrverbote ab.

Göring-Eckardt, bekräftigte, für die Grünen stünden die Klimaziele 2020 und 2030 nicht zur Debatte. Die Grünen seien aber bereit, darüber zu reden, ob es andere als von ihrer Partei vorgeschlagene Wege gebe, um diese Ziele zu erreichen. Bei den Klimazielen geht es im Wesentlichen um eine Verringerung des Ausstoßes des Treibhausgases Kohlendioxid.

FDP-Vize Kubicki hatte zudem angedeutet, dass die Liberalen auch beim Thema Europa kompromissbereit seien. Die FDP hat bisher auf die Abschaffung des Euro-Rettungsmechanismus ESM gepocht, den etwa die Union zu einem Europäischen Währungsfonds ausbauen möchte. FDP-Europapolitiker Alexander Graf Lambsdorff sagte, die FDP setze auf die finanzpolitische Eigenverantwortung der Euro-Mitglieder.

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and Congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.

All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate.

The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

“For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said after the committee voted.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another sponsor, said that, in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights.

Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, calling for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war.

Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of former President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.”

Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week that they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the bill. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House of Representatives.

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on. It’s not in that situation now,” said Senator Andre Pratte, an independent who was appointed by Trudeau in 2016.",Canada government facing resistance from Senate over pot law,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D32IK-OCADN

ORB International said 66 percent of people disapproved of the government’s conduct of the negotiations, up from 64 percent last month.

The poll also showed only 27 percent were confident that May will get the right deal, compared with 47 percent who were not confident.

Trust in May’s handling of Brexit has evaporated since she gambled away her parliamentary majority in an election in June.

With only 17 months left until Britain is due to exit the European Union, the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears of an abrupt departure with no transition that businesses say they need.

For the first time, more Britons disagreed that Brexit will help the economy than agreed, ORB said.

“There is no sign that the prime minister is beginning to turn things around when it comes to Brexit,” ORB said in a statement. “Overall these poll findings provide little encouragement for a prime minister facing multiple battles.”

As well as trying to breath life into Brexit talks, May is dealing with a growing sexual harassment scandal in Britain’s parliament. Without an overall majority, May cannot afford to lose parliamentary seats.

Businesses have expressed alarm at the progress of Brexit talks. On Monday, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said nearly two-thirds of European businesses planned to cut back orders from British suppliers.

Last month Chancellor Philip Hammond said a transition deal needed to be struck by early 2018.

Republicans plan to bring their tax overhaul bill for a vote next week, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said on Tuesday, adding that he expects the plan to pass.

House Republicans last week unveiled a first draft that proposed a range of cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

“The market is waiting for the next catalyst, which is the tax bill,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.

“It looks like, unless some major unforeseen event occurs, tax cuts will get passed in some shape or form. Whether (corporate tax cuts) it’s 20 percent or 25 percent, a big tax cut is coming.”

The S&P has risen about 15 percent in 2017 on the back on strong earnings, an improving economy and Trump’s promise to cut taxes.

CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last week announced that it would launch the futures contract of bitcoin, marking a major step in the digital currency’s path toward mainstream acceptance.

Melamed said he expects major investors to take part in bitcoin futures, which the exchange plans to start by the end of year.

“That’s a very important step for bitcoin’s history... We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,” Melamed told Reuters in an interview.

The futures will allow investors to short-sell bitcoins, making two-way bets possible, a development that he expects will attract major institutional investors, not just speculators.

Six-fold gains in the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP so far this year have stirred a debate among financial professionals on whether the digital currency represents a revolution in financial technology or just another tech bubble.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in September that bitcoin “is a fraud” and will blow up while regulators in many countries tightened their grip on its trading.

Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.

“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.

He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology.

Pundits say blockchain will enable the transfer of assets without a centralized system such as banks and sharply reduce costs of money transfer.

“My whole life is built abound new technology. I never said no to technology. People who say no to technology are soon dead. I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change. That’s what bitcoin represents,” he also said.

Melamed was elected chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. He moved to Chicago in his youth, having fled Nazi-occupied Poland with his family.

The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon is a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.

Waymo said that members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology -- and without human drivers -- in the next few months.

At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car. The service will start free, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.",Waymo launching ride-hailing service in Phoenix with no human behind wheel,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-selfdriving/waymo-launching-ride-hailing-service-in-phoenix-with-no-human-behind-wheel-idUSKBN1D72BU

He also indicated that he might take the war to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls more than a quarter of Syria, by saying the war targeted those who seek to “divide and weaken states”.

His comments came after a meeting with Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign policy adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“The victories against terrorist organizations, starting in Aleppo and not ending in Deir al-Zor, formed a critical strike that foiled partition projects and terrorist goals,” Assad’s office quoted him as saying.

The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, is waging an offensive against Islamic State in the eastern Deir al-Zor province, mostly on the west banks of the Euphrates River.

The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, is also battling IS militants in Deir al-Zor. Backed by U.S.-led air strikes and special forces, the SDF has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province.

Velayati on Friday said Syrian army forces would soon advance to take Raqqa city from the SDF and accused the United States of seeking to divide Syria by stationing its forces east of the Euphrates.

“We will witness in the near future the advance of government and popular forces in Syria and east of the Euphrates, and the liberation of Raqqa city,” he said in televised comments on a visit to Beirut.

Turkey also supports rebel groups in a pocket in northern Syria, wedged between Kurdish-controlled areas. Last month, its army began setting up observation points in Idlib province in northwest Syria under a deal with Russia and Iran.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year.","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

Lo ha detto nel corso di un‘audizione in Senato il vicedirettore generale di Bankitalia, Luigi Federico Signorini, valutando positivamente le misure contenute nella manovra per il 2018 su incentivi a favore degli investimenti delle imprese, occupazione e rinnovo dei contratti della Pa, e mettendo in guardia da eventuali passi indietro sulle riforme pensionistiche.

”[Il quadro macroeconomico del governo per il 2018] si conferma condivisibile alla luce delle informazioni più recenti“, ha dichiarato Signorini”. “Date le misure contenute nella manovra, anche nel 2019 appare possibile conseguire una crescita non lontana da quella programmata”, ha aggiunto.

La crescita programmata del Pil è vista dal governo all‘1,5% per quest‘anno, per il 2018 e per il 2019.

Quanto alle misure, “la riduzione dell‘incentivo agli investimenti è condivisibile, alla luce del consolidarsi della ripresa degli stessi e in particolare del forte incremento registrato da quelli in mezzi di trasporto. L‘impulso derivante dalle nuove misure è comunque valutabile in circa un punto percentuale di maggiori spese per investimenti nel 2018”, ha osservato.

Sul tema del contrasto all‘evasione fiscale, per Signorini è “ragionevole attendersi effetti positivi dalle misure (contenute in manovra). Tuttavia la stima di tali effetti resta per forza di cose incerta. Basare una quota significativa delle coperture su tali introiti, come avviene per gli anni successivi al 2018, comporta un elemento di rischio; esso andrà tenuto presente nel monitorare nel corso del tempo l‘evoluzione effettiva dei conti”.

Riguardo al rinnovo dei contratti pubblici, il vicedirettore ha sottolineato l‘importanza che “le regole che verranno stabilite in sede di contrattazione siano tali da incentivare efficacemente gli individui e le strutture a contribuire al miglioramento dell‘efficienza e della capacità di risposta dell‘azione pubblica”.

Quanto all‘occupazione, “meglio sarebbe, potendo - ha detto ancora - ridurre il cuneo fiscale per tutti; ma, date le risorse limitate, appare ragionevole la scelta di sostenere prioritariamente le prospettive occupazionali dei più giovani”.

The company's shares were trading at $1,715 and were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 .SPX. Shares of rival Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) were down 2.6 percent.

Priceline said on Monday it expected adjusted profit of $13.40 per share to $14.00 per share, well short of analysts’ average estimate of $15.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also said it expected booked room nights to grow 8 percent to 13 percent in the current quarter, a steep drop from the 31 percent growth posted in the year-ago quarter.

The owner of brands such as Priceline.com, Booking.com, Kayak said the jump in costs would pressure margins in the current quarter as well as in the first quarter.

At least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, with Deutsche Bank the most bearish, cutting it by as much as $225 to $1,825.

In their annual report, seen by Handelsblatt newspaper, the five “wise men” who advise the German government on economic policy said the economy, which they expected to expand strongly this year and next, was moving gradually into a “boom phase”.

“There are clear signs that economic capacity is over-utilised,” read the report, which is due to be published on Wednesday.

Germans have been among the foremost critics of the ECB’s bond-buying program, which was introduced three years ago to depress borrowing costs and reignite growth in the euro zone’s heavily indebted southern periphery.

The wise men expected Germany’s economy to expand by 2 percent this year and by 2.2 percent in 2018, Handelsblatt said.

With unemployment at its lowest level since the early 1990s, Germany’s circumstances are very different from Italy’s or Spain‘s, straining the ECB’s ‘one-size-fits-all’ monetary policy.

ECB President Mario Draghi last month announced a halving n the size of its 2 trillion euro bond-buying program, but this is far from the return to conventional monetary policy many Germans, including Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, demand.

The Croatian replaced Sam Allardyce in June, 2015 and led West Ham to a seventh-placed finish in his first season. He also oversaw their move to the London Stadium but has won just two out of 11 league games in this campaign.

“West Ham United can confirm that Slaven Bilic has today left his position with the club,” West Ham said in a statement.

Former Everton, Manchester United and Sunderland manager David Moyes, who is currently out of work, has been strongly linked with the position.

West Ham said they “believe a change is now necessary in order for the club to move forward positively and in line with their ambition”.

“The club’s search for a new manager to take West Ham United forward is underway and an announcement regarding Bilic’s successor is expected to be made over the coming days,” the statement added.

Moyes told BeInSport on Sunday that he was willing to take on the challenge of keeping the Hammers in the Premier League.

“I’ve always said I want to go back into club management. If the right opportunity comes around, I’ll be interested.”

Asked about West Ham before Bilic’s sacking, the 54-year-old, who also had a brief and unsuccessful spell with Real Sociedad in Spain, said: “I am interested but at the moment that vacancy has not become available. I know what Slaven must be going through.”

Bilic, who played as a defender for West Ham, has been under pressure throughout this campaign and although a League Cup win over Tottenham bought him time, a draw at bottom club Crystal Palace and the heavy home loss to Liverpool sealed his fate.

West Ham’s joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold praised Bilic for his commitment and integrity.

“The board invested heavily signing the players Slaven believed would complete the squad he needed to push the club back towards the level we had reached in his first season, and we believe we have the players capable of doing that,” they said.

”Sadly, performances and results have not been of the expected standard and, in recent weeks, we have not seen enough indication of the required improvement to give us the encouragement that things would change and we would meet our Premier League aspirations this season.

“We see this as an exciting opportunity to appoint a quality manager to the position to inject fresh ideas, organisation and enthusiasm into a very talented squad,” Gold and Sullivan added.

India has long accused Pakistan of harboring militant groups and giving them material support to carry out a 28-year armed revolt in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan denies the allegations and says it is doing more than any other country in fighting militant groups.

Masood has become a thorny issue between India and China which has blocked its repeated requests to sanction him under the UN list of terrorists.","Indian forces kill militant leader's nephew in Kashmir, police say",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-kashmir/indian-forces-kill-militant-leaders-nephew-in-kashmir-police-say-idINKBN1D70SW

A company that sells everything from sugar beet to cheap party dresses has so far made the most of this somewhat odd mix. But its exposure to sugar prices means its valuation is too rich.

People line up outside a store of clothing retailer Primark before its opening in Berlin, July 3, 2014. Thousands of bargain hunters flocked to a new Primark store in the heart of Berlin on Thursday despite a protest by campaigners demanding the Irish chain improves conditions in the factories that produce its budget tops and jeans. REUTERS/Thomas Peter (GERMANY - Tags: BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT) - GM1EA740ARE01

ABF said on Tuesday its full-year operating profit rose 13 percent. Energy efficiencies and higher extraction rates in its sugar business helped, as did an impressive performance in fashion. Primark, the high-street chain that generates a little more than half of the group’s operating profit, is holding up well despite the spiralling costs of inputs and pressure on British consumer spending.

Like-for-like sales growth of 4.5 percent in the United Kingdom, where about half of Primark’s stores are located, suggests the retailer is taking market share from higher-priced rivals like Hennes & Mauritz and Next. That vindicates ABF’s decision not to hike prices for shoppers even though a weaker sterling has increased the cost of sourcing clothes from Asia. And high footfall through its stores means Primark is one of the few fashion names that can still afford to shun margin-damaging online sales.

But its fashion flair cannot compensate for the problems that a sugar dependency is going to cause in the coming year. Chief Executive George Weston said on Tuesday that profit from the sugar division would be hit by a decline in EU prices. The commodity has long been a volatile source of earnings, generating almost half of group operating profit in 2013 but only 3 percent three years later.

With sugar prices now expected to slide, the company’s valuation is increasingly hard to justify. Even after a 3 percent drop in the stock price on Tuesday, ABF shares are trading at 23 times expected earnings for the coming year. That is approaching the 25.7 times commanded by Zara-owner Inditex, a pure fashion company with higher operating margins.

As Prime Minister Theresa May heads toward a 2019 EU divorce that will shape Britain’s prosperity and global influence for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk undermining her remaining authority.

In the latest misstep, Johnson came under pressure to retract remarks made on Nov. 1 that Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said Johnson’s comment was incorrect, while opposition British lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson called Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday to discuss the case, and made clear that he had been seeking to make the point that he condemned the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, a spokesman said.

“The UK government has no doubt that she was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit,” Johnson told parliament.

“My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity,” he said.

“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and I am glad to provide this clarification.”

Johnson said he would travel to Iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there, and would try to meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe while there.

May’s spokesman expressed confidence in Johnson, adding that the “he was doing a good job”.

Monique Villa, Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a project manager in the media development team. Villa said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not a journalist and had never trained journalists in Iran.

“We welcome UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s clarification of his comments,” Villa said. “It’s time now for the Foreign Secretary to meet Nazanin in jail.”

SHAMBOLIC GOVERNMENT?

Johnson is not the only one distracted.

At the weekend, May’s deputy, Damian Green, denied an allegation made in The Sunday Times newspaper that police found pornography on one of his computers in the Houses of Parliament in 2008.

On Monday, international development minister Priti Patel apologized for failing to disclose meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday.

Besides her government’s sometimes contradictory signals on Brexit, May has faced criticism from opponents for her handling of other issues: from a deadly apartment block fire in June to a sexual harassment scandal in parliament that prompted Michael Fallon, her loyal defense secretary, to resign.

“In my lifetime, I have never experienced a British government which seems to be so shambolic,” said Simon Hix, a professor of political science at the London School of Economics.

“They are in the midst of one of the greatest challenges of the last 50 years – Brexit – and they have sexual harassment scandals in parliament, the Paradise Papers and then now on top of that the behavior of May’s ministers.”

On Tuesday, Johnson came under pressure from opponents to retract his comments about Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment.

She was brought again into court on Saturday, three days after Johnson’s remarks, and accused by a judge of “spreading propaganda against the regime”.

The British Foreign Office quoted Zarif as saying that Johnson’s comments had nothing to do with the weekend court appearance.

The charges against Zaghari-Ratcliffe were denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Reuters News.

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and Congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.

All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate.

The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

“For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said after the committee voted.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another sponsor, said that, in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights.

Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, calling for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war.

Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of former President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.”

Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week that they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the bill. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House of Representatives.

“As leading mobile network provider in South Africa, with the best 3G and 4G networks, it was crucial for us to partner a formidable player such as Nokia as we’re gearing ourselves for the next generation of wireless networks, 5G,” Vodacom Group Chief Technology Officer Andries Delport said in a statement.

Unlike the prior upgrades of cellular standards 2G in the early 1990s, 3G around 2000 and 4G in 2010, 5G standards will link cars, machines, cargo and crop equipment to the internet as well as speed up data times.

The companies will first focus on delivering Ultra-HD and virtual reality video services using the enhanced mobile broadband and ultra-low latency capabilities of 5G, said Vodacom, a division of Britain’s Vodafone.

“Working with Vodacom, we can help it identify how 5G can support growth in the country and the steps it should take in its own transition to best meet individual subscriber and enterprise needs,” said head of Vodacom South Africa Customer Team at Nokia, Ranjen Naidoo.",Finland's Nokia joins Vodacom to trial 5G technology in South Africa,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-vodacom-grp-5g/finlands-nokia-joins-vodacom-to-trial-5g-technology-in-south-africa-idUSKBN1D71FQ

The FTSE 100 .FTSE was steady by 0830 GMT, having inched to a new record level in early deals. It has treaded water in the past days, with investors expecting it to stay flat overall into the year-end.

Earnings misses from G4S and ABF punctured the upbeat mood.

Primark owner ABF fell 3.6 percent after the CEO said sugar profits would fall in 2017-2018 due to lower EU prices.

Results from its clothing segment Primark, however, were encouraging, and the share price drop took traders by surprise with most pre-market indications seeing gains.

“It looks like margins are improving at Primark for the first time in a while, which is quite interesting for other retailers... I think these inflationary pressures are going to come through with price increases,” said Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.

Shares in the world’s largest security group (GFS.L) sank 7.3 percent after the firm downgraded its revenue outlook for the rest of the year.

“The main drag is the Middle East and India region, excluding these G4S would have achieved 6.1 percent organic growth,” said Stifel analysts.

Overall earnings in the UK have met analysts’ expectations, though the market reaction to profit warnings and earnings misses has been violent.

“Looking at trading statements I would say the bulk of them are in line with market expectations, and the ones that have missed are probably due to specific factors rather than the UK as a whole,” said Mumford.

Oil majors BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) were the main supports to the FTSE as crude prices held around the 2 1/2 year highs they reached on the Saudi Arabia purge on Monday.

Shell hit a fresh record high in early deals.

Petrofac (PFC.L) and Tullow Oil (TLW.L) led the mid-cap index with gains of 3 to 5.4 percent.

William Hill (WMH.L) shares jumped 3.2 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts gave the gambling company a double upgrade to “buy” from “underperform”.

William Hill and rival betting firm Ladbrokes Coral (LCL.L) had made gains last week after the UK government’s review on maximum stakes for gambling machines, with analysts saying the risk was priced in.

BAML analysts on Tuesday wrote: “Even in a worst case scenario of a 2 pound cap on fixed odds betting terminal machines, William Hill would offer an attractive value opportunity.”

“I think it’s quite likely the deal will be subject to some restrictions from Mofcom.”","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A potential mega-merger between chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) and U.S. rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is likely to face stern scrutiny in China, antitrust lawyers say, amid a strategic push by Beijing into semiconductors.

Broadcom made an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm on Monday, aimed at creating a $200-billion-plus behemoth that could reshape the industry at the heart of mobile phone hardware.

But Chinese regulatory approval could be a hold-up. Beijing and Washington have sparred over technology deals, including in chips, with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) knocking back a number of takeovers involving Chinese firms this year.

The thorny topic is likely to come up when U.S. President Donald Trump visits China this week - with Qualcomm executives in tow.

The merger would face a lengthy review from the anti-monopoly unit of China’s commerce ministry, due to strategic concerns, the huge size of the deal and because Qualcomm has come under fire before in the country over competition concerns.

“This is a critical industry for China and Qualcomm has been fined by the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) before so it’s on its radar,” said Wendy Yan, Shanghai-based partner at law firm Faegre Baker Daniels.

Qualcomm agreed to pay a record fine of $975 million in China in 2015 to end a probe into anti-competitive practices related to so-called “double dipping” by billing Chinese customers patent royalty fees in addition to charging for the chips.

China is making a major push to develop its own semiconductor industry under local champions such as Tsinghua Unigroup and Fujian Grand Chip Investment to help cut reliance on global operators including Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Beijing’s push adds a political edge to the case.

“(Mofcom) will consider industry security for the whole country, as the semi-conductor industry has strategic importance to China,” a second Shanghai-based antitrust lawyer said, asking not to be named because Qualcomm was a client of his firm.

China chipmaker rivals could also raise concerns about the deal, he added, putting pressure on Mofcom’s Anti-Monopoly Bureau to act. The most likely outcome would be restrictions on the deal rather than it being blocked, he said.

Firms pursuing major takeovers must notify China before closing a deal if the merging companies’ combined global turnover in the previous year exceeded 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) or their combined China income exceeds 2 billion yuan - both easily hit in this case.

Mofcom did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.

INDUSTRIAL POLICY

The Shanghai-based antitrust lawyer said the size and complexity of the deal - and potential sensitivities - meant it would likely have to go through all three phases of Mofcom’s merger approval, on paper a 180-day process.

While Broadcom and Qualcomm have little overlap, the firms are looking to complete a $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) and a $38 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) respectively.

Mofcom approved the Brocade acquisition with conditions earlier this year with after a five-month investigation.

Qualcomm declined to comment.

“We expect China, as with other countries, will welcome this deal as a solution to the double-dipping issue, and will find there are no significant issues beyond this,” a Broadcom spokeswoman said, referring to the patent charging issue.

Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company would move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore, citing Trump’s efforts to improve business conditions and reforming tax. Trump praised the move, calling Broadcom “one of the really great, great companies.”

“Mofcom will be motivated by the government to look very closely not just from a competition perspective but also from a broader industrial policy perspective,” said another Beijing-based antitrust lawyer involved in similar transactions.

The lawyer, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Beijing had been making a big push in the area including with deals to buy international firms - some successfully and some which had hit obstruction.

“You should expect Mofcom will take a very, very close look at this transaction,” he said.

Mofcom has been flexing its muscle more on global deals over the last few years, lawyers say, including putting restrictions on a deal between Dow Chemical and DuPont earlier this year.

However, blocking deals outright was a rare step for Mofcom, especially when Chinese companies were not directly involved, several Chinese lawyers said. Instead, the firms may be asked to sell certain business units or make pledges to Chinese partners as conditions for it going ahead.

“This case will be subject to more scrutiny from the Chinese authorities (than normal),” said Faegre Baker Daniels’ Yan. “I think it’s quite likely the deal will be subject to some restrictions from Mofcom.”","Bargaining chip?

In their annual report, seen by Handelsblatt newspaper, the five “wise men” who advise the German government on economic policy said the economy, which they expected to expand strongly this year and next, was moving gradually into a “boom phase”.

“There are clear signs that economic capacity is over-utilised,” read the report, which is due to be published on Wednesday.

Germans have been among the foremost critics of the ECB’s bond-buying program, which was introduced three years ago to depress borrowing costs and reignite growth in the euro zone’s heavily indebted southern periphery.

The wise men expected Germany’s economy to expand by 2 percent this year and by 2.2 percent in 2018, Handelsblatt said.

Underlining the difficulty of such an approach, however, they were divided over how to impose sanctions on countries that help tax avoidance, which is often legal.

The ministers made the issue the main topic of their monthly meeting after release of the “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby. The papers made public the tax affairs of numerous companies and investors.

To reduce the appeal of jurisdictions that charge little or no taxes, EU ministers discussed plans for a common blacklist that would shine the light on such countries.

“There was strong support for the idea of moving forward quickly,” Estonia’s Finance Minister Toomas Tõniste, who holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told reporters.

He added that “most countries” wanted the adoption of the list next month, tacitly acknowledging however that not all the 28 EU member states were equally keen to go that fast.

Jurisdictions in the limelight include offshore banking centers such as Jersey and Bermuda. But some EU countries, notably Luxembourg and Malta have also been criticized for acting as tax havens.

The main sticking point for the EU is whether blacklisted countries should be subject to sanctions.

“I am not sure if there will be sanctions,” an EU official said, citing differences among member states, who need to unanimously back proposals on tax matters.

Luxembourg and Malta, for example, said that sanctions would be unnecessary because investors would be deterred from putting money in highlighted tax havens, an EU official who attended the meeting said.

But many other EU countries want real punishment for non-cooperative jurisdictions accused of drawing away tax revenues from EU states.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, for example, urged EU states to consider suspending funding for tax havens.

“We are thinking, for instance, about the possibility of cutting financial support of the international institutions like the IMF (International Monetary Fund) or the World Bank on the states that would not provide the needed information on tax,” he told reporters before the meeting.

Although many states backed the idea of sanctions, Le Maire’s proposals did not gather much support, as it may be difficult to convince international organizations to apply the measures.

The EU commission’s vice president Valdis Dombrovskis declined to comment on the French proposals. “We hope an agreement on the blacklist will be possible by the end of the year,” he told a news conference.

He however stressed that “countermeasures” for non-cooperative countries were needed.

NEW MOMENTUM?

The Paradise Papers revelations gave new impetus to EU countries willing to counter tax avoidance, but turning plans into concrete actions is not easy.

Similar leaks last year led to a deluge of legislative proposals by the EU commission, but most of them are still stuck in talks among EU states.

The EU has been working for more than a year on the common blacklist that would replace largely toothless national lists.

An existing list of tax havens compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations, currently includes only Trinidad and Tobago.

By contrast, the EU is currently screening about 50 countries that may not respect the bloc’s criteria on tax cooperation.

The final number is likely to be much lower than that, officials said without giving details on screened jurisdictions.

States that charge no corporate tax are not automatically considered at risk of breaching EU tax criteria, but they are subject to screening if they also facilitate the creation of shell companies and other structures that could help tax avoidance.

Screened countries are expected to make commitments by the end of November, an EU official said, adding that states hit by recent hurricanes were given more leeway.","EU tax havens blacklist seen in December, but enforcement unclear",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-ecofin-france/eu-tax-havens-blacklist-seen-in-december-but-enforcement-unclear-idUKKBN1D712W

Studies have suggested the prevalence of mental health issues among militants working together on major strikes is very low but a string of killings by so-called lone wolves has fuelled concerns mental illness could be a factor behind some attacks.

Authorities say some of those involved in four attacks in Britain this year blamed on Islamist militants appeared to people who had self-radicalised via the internet and whose mental state had been questioned.

To look more closely at the issue, British police launched pilot programmes in April last year in England’s three biggest urban areas - London, Birmingham and Manchester - to embed mental health experts with counter-terrorism officers.

The aim was to give psychiatrists the chance to identify people referred to Britain’s counter-radicalisation programme Prevent who had mental health issues, and treat them.

“Anecdotally, I am surprised that there appears to be a much higher prevalence of people with mental health problems than you would expect,” said Professor Jennifer Shaw, the mental health lead for Greater Manchester Police, referring to the people her team had dealt with since the pilot was launched.

The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide, Shaw, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester, told Reuters.

But such is the secrecy around the work of Prevent and Channel - a de-radicalisation programme within the overall project - there are few details about its successes or failings and Shaw’s work has not previously been discussed in the media.

Some psychiatrists argue that no scientific link between mental health issues and terrorist attacks has yet been established and they worry the programmes risk stimagtising people suffering from mental illnesses.

Another psychiatrist gathering data under the pilot programmes told Reuters that Britain’s Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism had told them not to disclose any details of their findings ahead of a final report.

Those findings are expected to be among a raft of data about people referred to Prevent due to be released this week.

Britain’s interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

‘WE WANT THE FACTS’

Dr Adrian James, registrar at Britain’s Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), said the link between mental health problems and terrorist acts had not been established.

He said a lack of evidence, partly because militant attacks were so rare, was at the heart of the problem, adding that an unnecessary level of secrecy about Prevent also meant many psychiatrists viewed the programme with suspicion.

“If it is true that there is a link, we need to know and then need to look at the causes of that and what we can do about them,” James told Reuters. “We just want the facts.”

Past studies have disagreed about the significance of mental health issues among lone wolf attackers, with some academics concluding that such illnesses are blamed to try to explain often complex reasons for attacks.

British police decided to launch the pilot programmes because they believed that roughly half the 7,500 people referred to Prevent each year had a broad range of mental health and psychological difficulties.

Those working on the pilot projects hope the information being gathered will now help experts assess any possible links between mental health issues and attacks.

Shaw said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems, but she said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.

“That doesn’t mean you can’t manage the risks. Trying to nip it in the bud, that’s all you can do. But that’s good if you can achieve that, it’s going a long way,” said Shaw.

Police officers say they have struggled in the past to reach medical practitioners when they had concerns about some people and Shaw said the pilot was designed to address those worries.

According to one of Shaw’s case studies, a man went to a hospital saying he monitored Islamic State websites, had been walking around the city centre working out how many people he could kill in a gun attack, and wanted to behead his mother.

Shaw’s team discovered the man had no contact with mental health services and no diagnosis of any illness. An urgent assessment concluded his anger stemmed from experiences in his childhood and safeguarding measures were put in place.

‘TERRORIST METHODOLOGY’

British police have no doubts about the importance of the work, especially given the global shift from carefully planned spectacular attacks by militant networks to unsophisticated, strikes by individuals using cars and knives as weapons.

Mark Rowley, Britain’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, told the British Medical Journal in April that a disproportionate number of suspects in 13 attacks foiled by British police since 2013 had mental health issues.

“If part of the terrorist methodology is to prey on the vulnerable ... then it stands to reason that there will be people with certain mental health conditions who will be ... susceptible to that,” he said.

“Radicalising and inciting someone who is vulnerable to go and carry out some ghastly attack seems to be part of their tactics, and that has brought in a whole load of vulnerability issues, including mental health, that we now have to wrestle with,” said Rowley.

A study by University College London’s (UCL) Department of Security and Crime Science looked at 55 attacks involving 76 individuals between May 2014 and September 2016 where reports had shown the perpetrators may have been influenced by IS.

The study found 34 percent of those involved in attacks inspired by Islamic State - rather than actually directed by the militant group - had mental health issues.

Health experts estimate about one in four people will suffer some form of mental health issue and those with mental illnesses are generally less likely to commit violent crimes than the overall population.

STIGMATISATION CONCERNS

Shaw said those with mental health issues and developmental disorders referred to her team at Prevent were more likely to be suffering from psychosis and autism, adding that people with serious mental illnesses often had tiny social networks.

“They can therefore, when unwell, be influenced by messages that go out that say come and belong to our group. It can be quite compelling. The same for people with autism. The internet kind of way of getting the message out makes those people, particularly vulnerable. So I think that’s a big issue.”

Psychiatrists worry that all people with mental health issues could be stigmatised and considered potential militants, possibly deterring them from seeking help.

Prevent, one of the four strands of Britain’s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest launched in 2003, has also been dogged by claims it is used to spy on Muslim communities.

A government edict in 2015 instructing public bodies such as schools, health workers and universities to raise any concerns they have about individuals with the authorities has exacerbated those concerns.

Shaw acknowledged more work was needed on the outcomes of their mental health interventions under the Prevent pilot programmes to determine what made a difference.

Asked if people her team had treated might have committed violent acts if their conditions had not been addressed, she said: ”That is the obvious question. You can’t say that in any kind of scientific way.

“We’re attempting to try and get at that. Is it completely to do with their mental illness, half to do with it, or not at all?” said Shaw.

“We have had cases where people have had ideologies, they have also had a mental health problem, and they are not linked at all. The last thing we need is ‘all these bombers are nutters’. We don’t want that going on.”",The battle for minds - Britain expands project on mental health in terrorism,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-mentalhealth/the-battle-for-minds-britain-expands-project-on-mental-health-in-terrorism-idUKKBN1D7186

Die saudiarabische Luftwaffe hatte am Samstag eine Rakete abgefangen, die in Richtung der Hauptstadt Riad abgefeuert worden war. Es handele sich dabei um eine iranische Rakete, die von der libanesischen Hisbollah-Miliz von Huthi-Territorium im Jemen abgefeuert worden sei, erklärte der saudiarabische Außenminister am Montag. Der Iran wies jede Verantwortung zurück.

UN WARNEN VOR KATASTROPHE IM JEMEN

Als Reaktion auf den Raketenabschuss kündigte die von Saudi-Arabien angeführte Militärkoalition gegen die Huthi-Rebellen die Schließung aller Häfen, Flughäfen und Zufahrtswege zum Jemen an. Die Vereinten Nationen warnten vor einer Katastrophe für die Menschen. Über Nacht seien die Preise für Benzin über 60 Prozent in die Höhe geschossen. Sieben Millionen Menschen seien von Hunger bedroht. Der Konflikt hat bereits eine der weltweit größten Krisen für die Menschen ausgelöst, Tausende kamen bislang ums Leben.

Seit 2015 kämpfen die schiitischen Huthi-Rebellen gegen die Truppen von Präsident Abd-Rabbu Mansur. Sie erhalten vom Iran Beistand. Saudi-Arabien wirft dem Iran vor, den Huthi militärisch zu helfen, was die Regierung in Teheran aber bestreitet.

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital, and SSI Investment Management are among those that are adding to or holding on to their shares of those of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Microsoft Co and Southwest Airlines Co in part because they expect to see more share buybacks or special dividends if a tax reform passes in some form.

The House Republican plan would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent and allow companies bring back foreign profits at a 12 percent tax rate, a process known as repatriation. Overall, U.S. companies hold some $2.6 trillion in untaxed offshore cash.

Fund managers say that while it is far too soon to tell whether the tax bill will pass, the prospect of increased buybacks is worth taking a bet on companies that would benefit the most from the plan.

“If you have two companies that you are looking at and one would get a bigger boost from bringing back its cash from overseas, that provides an extra level of return,” said Peter Santoro, a portfolio manager of the $11 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund.

For example, cash-rich tech companies with big international presence, such as Microsoft, are likely to return cash to shareholders via a one-time dividend even if Congress passes a repatriation bill rather than a broad tax reform, Santoro said.

When Congress allowed U.S. companies to bring back foreign profits at a discounted tax rate in 2004, Microsoft issued a special $3-per-share dividend and the Trump tax windfall would likely lead to something similar, Santoro said.

Santoro declined to say whether he was adding to his Microsoft position in recent months. Microsoft is the largest position in Santoro’s fund, according to Morningstar data, and its shares are up 36 percent for the year largely driven by the expansion of its cloud-based business.

Goldman Sachs estimates that the Republican tax bill would increase corporate buybacks by $75 billion, to $590 billion, in 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, estimates about half of repatriated cash would go into buybacks and the rest would get spent on acquisitions and other investments.

Stock buybacks often provide a short-term bump in a company’s share price both by eliminating the total number of available shares and improving metrics such as earnings per share and return on equity.

LAGGING THE MARKET

Yet buybacks, which peaked in 2016, have been slowing over the last three years as rising stock valuations made them more costly and investors have called on companies to invest more in their future by spending on factories or research.

The S&P 500 Buyback Index is lagging the broader market this year after having beaten the S&P 500 by nearly 83 percent between 2009 and the end of 2016. The buyback index tracks 100 of the companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratios, such as Boeing Co, Michael Kors Holdings, and Tyson Foods Inc. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zcj87u)

The Powershares Buyback Achievers fund, which tracks companies that have repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares over the last 12 months, is up 11.2 percent so far this year, compared with a 15.7 percent gain in S&P 500.

Eric Marshall, a fund manager at $2 billion Hodges Capital, said he has been adding to his position in buyback-heavy companies such as Texas Instruments and Lowe’s Companies Inc because he expects them to increase their current buyback programs if a tax bill does pass.

Texas Instruments, for instance, said in September it would buy a further $6 billion of its own shares, extending a program that has reduced its total number of shares by a quarter over the last five years. Texas Instruments shares make up about 2 percent of the Hodges Blue Chip Equity Income fund. The firm last bought the stock in June, according to the latest publicly available data.

“Buybacks are the most tax efficient thing you can do with your capital, and when you are repurchase your own stock you know exactly what you are buying,” Marshall said.

Ravi Malik, a portfolio manager at $1.6 billion SSI Investment Management Inc, said that a cut in the repatriation rate would benefit convertible bonds in his portfolio such as Citrix Systems Inc, Amgen Inc and Lam Research Corp.

SSI Investment examines its biggest holdings with a significant share of overseas revenues to assess the impact of tax legislation on those companies, Malik said. “That’s how we identified these companies as significant beneficiaries of the changes proposed.”

Barry James, a portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, said that he expected fund holdings, such as lawn mower maker Toro Co and Southwest Airlines to boost existing buyback schemes should a tax bill pass. Such a move would be preferable to an acquisition or hiring more employees, he said.

Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings. Uber has denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets and rejects the financial damages claim.

Uber and Waymo, rivals in the development of autonomous car technology, have been fighting in court since earlier this year about whether Uber benefited from trade secrets and other intellectual property allegedly stolen by former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski. Trial is set for early December.

U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup late on Thursday issued an order excluding Waymo’s damages expert, Michael Wagner, from the case and restricting use of financial evidence at trial and denying other relief, according to a docket entry.

The docket summarizes the decision, but the details are under seal until later on Friday.

University of Florida law professor Elizabeth Rowe said it was a setback for Waymo to have its damages expert excluded, but noted there were still ways to include the information, were the scope of the exclusion limited to the one person.

In a statement, Waymo said the company could still pursue full damages using “the same documents” relied upon by their expert.

Uber described the ruling on the expert as a sign of success, together with Alsup’s exclusion of Otto Trucking as a defendant in the case. Levandowski is the primary shareholder of Otto Trucking.

“Waymo’s case continues to shrink,” the ride-services company said in a statement.

Alsup recently agreed to Waymo’s request to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.

Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that Levandowski - the former head of Uber’s self-driving effort who was previously at Waymo - downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Waymo to set up a self-driving truck startup company that Uber then acquired.

Waymo in settlement talks had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, which rejected that and other terms as non-starters, sources previously told Reuters.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

“I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).”

Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sunday’s massacre at a church in rural southeastern Texas, was convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the U.S. Air Force in 2012, according to the Pentagon.

Authorities put the death toll at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was killed. The attack ranks as the fifth-deadliest by a single gunman in U.S. history.

The Air Force said it had failed to transmit information about Kelley’s conviction to the National Criminal Information Center system, a U.S. government database used by licensed firearms dealers to check prospective gun buyers for criminal backgrounds.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the military, called the failure to enter Kelley’s record into the database “appalling.”

“I don’t believe that the Air Force should be left to self-police after such tragic consequences,” Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said in a statement. “The failure to properly report domestic violence convictions may be a systemic issue.”

The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Twenty others were wounded, with 10 still in critical condition late on Monday, officials said.

Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his getaway vehicle, where authorities found two handguns, Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Monday.

Kelley was also wounded by a resident who heard the gunshot, grabbed his own rifle and raced to the church, shooting the 26-year-old twice as he fled.

The massacre stirred an ongoing debate over gun ownership, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Guns are part of the fabric of life in rural areas.

U.S. President Donald Trump on an Asia trip told reporters he believed stricter reviews of gun purchases would have had no effect on Sunday’s massacre.

“There would have been no difference,” Trump said while on a visit to South Korea. He added that stricter gun laws might have prevented the man who shot Kelley from acting as he did.

“You would have had hundreds more dead,” Trump said.

AIR FORCE INQUIRY

The Air Force opened an inquiry into how it handled the former airman’s criminal record, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure that other cases “have been reported correctly,” Pentagon officials said.

Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, has exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks.

Slideshow (6 Images)

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters en route to Brussels that the Air Force was still working to determine exactly how the error occurred.

“First I have to define what the problem is. If the problem is we didn’t put something out, we will correct that,” Mattis said.

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.

Federal databases did not contain any information that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation, said Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Antonio.

Kelley stormed into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, population about 400, opening fire with a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle.

Authorities said Kelley had been involved in a domestic dispute with the parents of his second wife, whom he married in 2014, and had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law before the shooting.

Although his in-laws were known to occasionally attend services at First Baptist, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said family members were not there on Sunday.

Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the shooting as well as 15 empty 30-round ammunition magazines.",U.S. Air Force error allowed Texas church gunman to buy weapons,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-texas-shooting/air-force-didnt-log-texas-church-gunman-conviction-in-u-s-database-idUKKBN1D715U

Grace Mendonça disse que os acordos que estão sendo fechados entre órgãos e empresas têm previsto uma “cláusula aberta” na qual as empresas que, mesmo já tendo fechado um acordo de leniência, concordam em fazer novas reparações por danos apurados por corte de contas.

Atualmente, participam da leniência o Ministério da Transparência e CGU, o Ministério Público Federal e o Tribunal de Contas da União, além da própria AGU.

Para a ministra, não há como avançar na segurança jurídica do instituto sem haver diálogo entre os órgãos, o que deve ser uma premissa.

O presidente do TCU, Raimundo Carreiro, defendeu uma maior cooperação. “Quanto mais você abrir o leque de discussões, melhor decisões sairão”, disse.

Em rápida entrevista na saída da abertura do evento, Carreiro disse que a relação com a gestão de Janot foi “normal” e destacou o bom relacionamento no trato da leniência com a equipe do MPF de Curitiba.

Também em entrevista, a chefe da AGU afirmou que o órgão que comanda e o Ministério da Transparência e Controladoria Geral da União (CGU) assinaram um novo acordo de leniência. Ela disse que não podia dar detalhes do acordo porque, embora assinado, está sob sigilo por estar em fase de finalização.

Até o momento, sabia-se da assinatura do acordo da UTC, investigada na Lava Jato, e da Bilfinger e da SBM, sendo que esse último fora suspenso por decisão da Câmara de Combate à Corrupção do MPF.

O presidente do TCU mencionou que a corte acompanha no momento 25 acordos de leniência.

Dados da CGU divulgados no seminário pelo consultor jurídico do órgão Renato Lima França, contudo, citam ao todo 22 propostas. Constam dois acordos assinados (sem considerar o da SBM), 14 com negociações em andamento e seis empresas tiveram as negociações encerradas.","TCU pode cobrar reparação adicional de empresas em leniência se constatar novas irregularidades, diz Grace",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN1D727P-OBRDN

A tie-up would come at a time when Britain’s established energy companies are losing market share to smaller challengers and face the prospect of a government-imposed cap on prices.

SSE said on Tuesday the talks were about merging its household energy supply and services business with Innogy’s UK supply business npower, sending SSE shares more than 3 percent higher and Innogy’s up 1.6 percent.

In the UK retail electricity market, SSE has a 14 percent market share and npower 9 percent. The combined 23 percent would just top Centrica-owned (CNA.L) British Gas’s share of 22 percent, data from regulator Ofgem shows.

For the retail gas market, SSE has an 11 percent market share and npower 8 percent, with Centrica on 33 percent.

“SSE probably thinks it can harness the customer base for a bargain price since npower has been struggling for a while now. But the real question is whether regulators would let this one pass, and it’s hard to see it overcoming competition concerns,” said analysts at ETX Capital.

The two firms said discussions were “well-advanced”, but no binding agreements had been entered into, and declined to comment on the reasons for the talks.

Innogy said the combined business would be listed.

“A deal may face some tough questions from the regulator but they must think it’s achievable,” said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight.

On Monday, Reuters reported that Innogy could sell npower, or combine it with a local rival.

Britain’s energy market is dominated by the so-called “big six” of British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, npower, E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF Energy (EDF.PA), which account for about 85 percent of the retail electricity market.

But they have all been losing customers to smaller rivals over the past year or so, which has ramped up pressure on the firms which already face the introduction of a price cap on their most common tariffs, standard variable tariffs (SVTs).

“This puts the consolidation theme on everyone’s radar. The companies have to think about what to do in Britain and whether going it alone still makes sense. The answer is probably not,” an industry source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Last month, the government asked the energy market regulator to come up with price caps on consumer gas and electricity prices for millions of households which will initially last until 2020.

When introduced, which is not likely until next winter at the earliest, it would be the biggest energy market intervention for 30 years.

Utilities have criticised the move, with some saying it would hit competition and others saying SVTs should be scrapped altogether.",SSE and Innogy in talks to merge UK retail energy supply businesses,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sse-innogy/sse-and-innogy-in-talks-to-merge-uk-retail-energy-supply-businesses-idUKKBN1D721X

Retail sales declined by an annual 1.0 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Sales rose 1.9 percent in September.

Payments company Barclaycard (BARC.L) also reported weak consumer spending, with a split between spending on essentials and spending on discretionary items.

Last Thursday, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years, despite a slowdown in economic growth this year.

Most economists polled by Reuters before the decision thought raising rates would be a mistake, partly because of fragile consumer finances, which have been under pressure from weak wage growth and the rise in inflation since last year’s Brexit vote.

Governor Mark Carney has said the worst of the squeeze on households is ending and the impact of the rate increase will not be big for households, whose spending is the main driver of Britain’s economy.

But analysts were less sure in light of Tuesday’s figures, as well as a similar Confederation of British Industry survey published last month, which showed sales plunged during October at the fastest rate since 2009.

“The UK BRC Retail Sales make for rather depressing reading ... thus raising further questions about the wisdom of last week’s BoE rate hike, let alone the prospect of any follow-up,” said Marc Ostwald, market strategist at ADM Investor Services.

The BRC said its figures were a cause for concern ahead of the Christmas holidays. “The decline was driven by the worst performance of non-food sales since our record began in January 2011,” said Helen Dickinson, BRC’s chief executive.

“The growth in food sales, meanwhile, adds some colour to this otherwise anaemic picture, but these figures are very much buoyed by inflation.”

Consumer price inflation reached 3 percent in September, its highest level in more than five years and above the BoE’s 2 percent target. The central bank expects the consumer price index to peak at 3.2 percent in October.

The BRC, whose figures are not seasonally adjusted, said total sales last month edged up 0.2 percent, which was also the weakest increase for any October since 2008.

Dickinson said the last week’s rate hike - the first in more than a decade - would add more pressure on household budgets.

The impact from the rise in borrowing costs on the housing market looks much less marked, mortgage lender Halifax said as it reported a pick-up in house prices in the three months to October.

Barclaycard’s measure of consumer spending growth eased to 2.4 percent year-on-year, compared with an increase of 3 percent in September.

“In light of the Bank of England’s announcement last week, it’ll be interesting to see how shoppers, who have so far demonstrated their resilience, continue to juggle the many demands on their budget,” said Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard.",UK retailers suffer worst October since 2008 - BRC,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/uk-retailers-suffer-worst-october-since-2008-brc-idUKKBN1D701B

On Sunday, Mohammed bin Salman turned the same venue – the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh – into a posh detention center for princes, ministers and other elites rounded up in a sudden anti-corruption drive. It could do the likely next Saudi king’s ambitious economic and social reforms more harm than good.

Among those detained was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whose investments in Citigroup, Twitter and other firms make him the most recognizable Saudi on Wall Street, along with another 10 princes. Four ministers were also held, Reuters reported, as was former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a Saudi Aramco director who rubbed elbows at the recent Future Investment Initiative shindig at the Ritz-Carlton with the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman.

Corruption may be a problem, but the weekend move also looks like a strike against potential opposition. The crown prince has vowed to take Saudi mores back to a time before 1979, when the seizure of the Grand Mosque by armed militants brought religious conservatives into control. Having charmed financiers at the event dubbed Davos in the desert with his vision for a $500 billion global city he calls NEOM, among other things, the crown prince may have felt emboldened to move rapidly.

The clampdown on perceived members of the old guard, many blessed with extraordinary birthright wealth, was seen favorably by many Saudis, according to Reuters. Though the domestic stock market initially sank 2.2 percent, it closed higher.

Yet Sunday’s purge raises more questions than it answers. Among them: What is the nature of the charges, and the evidence for them? Did a public spat with Donald Trump play a role in Prince Alwaleed’s arrest? Was the monarchy threatened with a coup, or was it a pre-emptive initiative?

More lastingly, the weekend’s events underline that Saudi is an absolute monarchy. That can mean whims, plots and retribution matter more than transparency and a predictable rule of law. The latter two are prerequisites for many global investors, like the ones in attendance at the Ritz-Carlton just days ago.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

Picture taken on June 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mark Blinch

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Despite dominating the sector in Brazil, Uber has joined forces with three smaller apps for a public campaign that helped convince senators last week to scrap parts of a bill that would have effectively turned the companies into regular taxi services.

With Uber facing a possible ban in London and several U.S. federal investigations, the company’s new Chief Executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, needed a win in Brazil. The South American country is its second-largest market after the United States and Sao Paulo, Brazil’s economic capital, has more Uber rides than New York.

Together with Spain’s Cabify and Brazilian apps 99 and Lady Driver - which focuses on women drivers and customers - Uber recruited digital influencers and flooded social media with messages asking their users to call their lawmakers.

Under the slogan “Together for Mobility,” the apps got thousands of their drivers onto the streets of Brazil’s cities in protest, while the country managers of Uber, 99 and Cabify made a video together warning Brazilians that ride-hailing was in danger of being suffocated by red tape.

The collaboration with competitors may be an early sign of Khosrowshahi’s strategy of fighting unwanted regulation with a less confrontational approach than his outspoken predecessor Travis Kalanick.

“We called on drivers and users to mobilize by gathering signatures in support of alternative regulation for the apps,” said Fabio Sabba, chief spokesman for Uber in Brazil, adding that 816,000 people signed the petition presented to Congress.

In their amended bill, senators dropped requirements that drivers own their cars and use the same red license plates used by public taxis, though they left a ban on rides outside the city where the car is registered.

While drivers will still have to register with municipal authorities, they will not be classed as public transport if the amendments stand, and no city would be able ban car-hailing services or limit their numbers.

“Together we boosted public awareness of the issue and the Senate accepted the amendments,” said Daniel Bedoya, Brazil manager at Cabify, which operates in 11 countries and had never teamed up with Uber before.

The ride-booking firms said they are confident public pressure will sway Brazil’s lower house to accept the Senate’s amendments, a milestone in efforts to roll back a regulatory crackdown that could jeopardize their rapid global expansion.

But the battle is far from over. There is no date scheduled for the final vote and the leftist Workers Party, backed by taxi unions, has vowed to undo the changes.

ATTRACTING INVESTMENT

Tough regulation would slam the brakes on foreign investment into the fast-growing Brazilian market, where car-hailing apps have taken off explosively due to disastrous public transport and the belief that online booking is safer in crime-ridden cities.

In January, China’s largest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, announced plans to invest $100 million in 99, an on-demand taxi and ride-sharing service. Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) followed suit in May with its own $100 million investment in the Brazilian app.

Stricter regulation would be a blow for Uber, which has 80 percent of the Brazilian market, as Japan’s SoftBank and other investors are negotiating the terms of a $10 billion investment in the company.

The debate in Brazil comes shortly after authorities in London decided not to renew Uber’s operating license and highlights the legal threats against its foreign operations as the company prepares for an initial public offering IPO as soon as 2019.

With the stakes high, Khosrowshahi flew at short notice to Brasilia last week to join lobbying efforts on the day the bill went to a Senate vote in the country’s capital.

Striking a more conciliatory style than the combative Kalanick, Khosrowshahi kept his cool after senators refused to meet with him but publicly warned that Uber’s future in Latin America’s largest economy depended on the decision.

The company was careful to emphasize the impact on ordinary Brazilians, saying the bill would leave its 500,000 drivers out of work by making it too expensive to operate.

Uber’s allies played their part. Lady Driver founder Gabriela Corrêa said she lobbied the 13 women senators in the corridors of Congress, telling them many of her drivers were mothers who depended on the app for their families’ livelihood.

Lady Driver began in February in Sao Paulo and is expanding fast in an activity long-dominated by men. The app has 9,500 drivers and will launch in November in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s second-largest city.

“Congressmen won’t undo the amendments because they have realized that ride-hailing is needed today,” she said. “If we go back to the past, women will lose ground.”","Uber, rival apps join forces in Brazil to stem tide of regulation",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-brazil/uber-rival-apps-join-forces-in-brazil-to-stem-tide-of-regulation-idUKKBN1D71KE

Walt Disney may be mulling a bid for Rupert Murdoch’s film studio and cable networks. A deal would reduce Twenty-First Century Fox to news and sports assets while helping the Magic Kingdom bulk up to fight the video-streaming network.

Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has been talking with Fox about the possibility of a mashup between the two media conglomerates, according to a CNBC report on Monday. Fox would sell its international assets, including its 39 percent equity stake in European pay-TV group Sky, along with its movie and cable units. It would keep its U.S. broadcast stations and eponymous news network, which is undergoing its own transformation after a spate of recent sexual-harassment allegations.

The details were scarce but one thing is clear: scale is a necessity. As distributors become larger - AT&T is seeking to close its $85 billion deal for Time Warner for instance - media companies have to follow. Netflix’s success in securing 100 million subscribers worldwide and its plan to spend some $8 billion on content next year adds to the pressure.

The acquisition of Fox programming would strengthen Disney’s arsenal as it prepares to launch its direct-to-consumer video offerings from its entertainment networks and sports giant ESPN. Fox too has acknowledged the need for scale with its failed $80 billion tilt at Time Warner in 2014 and its second run for full control of Sky, still waiting for UK regulatory approval.

That’s what makes possible retreat by the Murdoch family all the more puzzling. Murdoch built his empire from newspapers he inherited from his father in Australia and turned them into a global enterprise housing everything from Fox News to “The Simpsons” to Star India.

Murdoch, who is executive chairman, and his family hold nearly 40 percent of the voting shares in Fox and sister company News Corp. He elevated his sons James and Lachlan to eventually take over the reins.

Underlining the difficulty of such an approach, however, they were divided over how to impose sanctions on countries that help tax avoidance, which is often legal.

The ministers made the issue the main topic of their monthly meeting after release of the “Paradise Papers”, a trove of financial documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby. The papers made public the tax affairs of numerous companies and investors.

To reduce the appeal of jurisdictions that charge little or no taxes, EU ministers discussed plans for a common blacklist that would shine the light on such countries.

“There was strong support for the idea of moving forward quickly,” Estonia’s Finance Minister Toomas Tõniste, who holds the EU’s rotating presidency, told reporters.

He added that “most countries” wanted the adoption of the list next month, tacitly acknowledging however that not all the 28 EU member states were equally keen to go that fast.

Jurisdictions in the limelight include offshore banking centers such as Jersey and Bermuda. But some EU countries, notably Luxembourg and Malta have also been criticized for acting as tax havens.

The main sticking point for the EU is whether blacklisted countries should be subject to sanctions.

“I am not sure if there will be sanctions,” an EU official said, citing differences among member states, who need to unanimously back proposals on tax matters.

Luxembourg and Malta, for example, said that sanctions would be unnecessary because investors would be deterred from putting money in highlighted tax havens, an EU official who attended the meeting said.

But many other EU countries want real punishment for non-cooperative jurisdictions accused of drawing away tax revenues from EU states.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, for example, urged EU states to consider suspending funding for tax havens.

“We are thinking, for instance, about the possibility of cutting financial support of the international institutions like the IMF (International Monetary Fund) or the World Bank on the states that would not provide the needed information on tax,” he told reporters before the meeting.

Although many states backed the idea of sanctions, Le Maire’s proposals did not gather much support, as it may be difficult to convince international organizations to apply the measures.

The EU commission’s vice president Valdis Dombrovskis declined to comment on the French proposals. “We hope an agreement on the blacklist will be possible by the end of the year,” he told a news conference.

He however stressed that “countermeasures” for non-cooperative countries were needed.

NEW MOMENTUM?

The Paradise Papers revelations gave new impetus to EU countries willing to counter tax avoidance, but turning plans into concrete actions is not easy.

Similar leaks last year led to a deluge of legislative proposals by the EU commission, but most of them are still stuck in talks among EU states.

The EU has been working for more than a year on the common blacklist that would replace largely toothless national lists.

An existing list of tax havens compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a global group of mostly rich nations, currently includes only Trinidad and Tobago.

By contrast, the EU is currently screening about 50 countries that may not respect the bloc’s criteria on tax cooperation.

The final number is likely to be much lower than that, officials said without giving details on screened jurisdictions.

States that charge no corporate tax are not automatically considered at risk of breaching EU tax criteria, but they are subject to screening if they also facilitate the creation of shell companies and other structures that could help tax avoidance.

Screened countries are expected to make commitments by the end of November, an EU official said, adding that states hit by recent hurricanes were given more leeway.","EU tax havens blacklist seen in December, but enforcement unclear",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-ecofin-france/eu-tax-havens-blacklist-seen-in-december-but-enforcement-unclear-idUKKBN1D712W?il=0

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

“I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).”

As Prime Minister Theresa May heads toward a 2019 EU divorce that will shape Britain’s prosperity and global influence for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk undermining her remaining authority.

In the latest misstep, Johnson came under pressure to retract remarks made on Nov. 1 that Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said Johnson’s comment was incorrect, while opposition British lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson called Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday to discuss the case, and made clear that he had been seeking to make the point that he condemned the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, a spokesman said.

“The UK government has no doubt that she was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit,” Johnson told parliament.

“My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity,” he said.

“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and I am glad to provide this clarification.”

Johnson said he would travel to Iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there, and would try to meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe while there.

May’s spokesman expressed confidence in Johnson, adding that the “he was doing a good job”.

Monique Villa, Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a project manager in the media development team. Villa said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not a journalist and had never trained journalists in Iran.

“We welcome UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s clarification of his comments,” Villa said. “It’s time now for the Foreign Secretary to meet Nazanin in jail.”

SHAMBOLIC GOVERNMENT?

Johnson is not the only one distracted.

At the weekend, May’s deputy, Damian Green, denied an allegation made in The Sunday Times newspaper that police found pornography on one of his computers in the Houses of Parliament in 2008.

On Monday, international development minister Priti Patel apologized for failing to disclose meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday.

Besides her government’s sometimes contradictory signals on Brexit, May has faced criticism from opponents for her handling of other issues: from a deadly apartment block fire in June to a sexual harassment scandal in parliament that prompted Michael Fallon, her loyal defense secretary, to resign.

“In my lifetime, I have never experienced a British government which seems to be so shambolic,” said Simon Hix, a professor of political science at the London School of Economics.

“They are in the midst of one of the greatest challenges of the last 50 years – Brexit – and they have sexual harassment scandals in parliament, the Paradise Papers and then now on top of that the behavior of May’s ministers.”

On Tuesday, Johnson came under pressure from opponents to retract his comments about Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment.

She was brought again into court on Saturday, three days after Johnson’s remarks, and accused by a judge of “spreading propaganda against the regime”.

The British Foreign Office quoted Zarif as saying that Johnson’s comments had nothing to do with the weekend court appearance.

The charges against Zaghari-Ratcliffe were denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Reuters News.

“By suggesting Nazanin was in Iran ‘teaching people journalism’, Boris Johnson has endangered the cause to secure her release,” Tulip Siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said.",Britain's Boris Johnson 'could have been clearer' on jailed aid worker in Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-iran-nazanin/britains-boris-johnson-could-have-been-clearer-on-jailed-aid-worker-in-iran-idINKBN1D72DA?il=0

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.
“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving unit is launching a ride-hailing service for the general public with no human driver behind the steering wheel and has been testing such fully self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona, Chief Executive John Krafcik said on Tuesday.

The announcement by Krafcik at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon is a major advance in the roll-out of fully autonomous vehicles. While self-driving car companies test their vehicles in public, they routinely have a human in the driver’s seat ready to take over if the technology fails.

Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups are all vying for what they expect to be a new era for vehicles and a lucrative opportunity.

Waymo said that members of the public will begin riding in its fleet of Fiat Chrysler Pacifica minivans outfitted with Waymo technology -- and without human drivers -- in the next few months.

At first, the passengers will be accompanied in the back seat by a Waymo employee, but eventually the passengers will travel alone in the robotic car. The service will start free, but Waymo expects at some point to start charging for rides.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.",Waymo launching ride-hailing service in Phoenix with no human behind wheel,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D72BU-OCATC

GE’s move on GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the world’s second-largest lessor, follows expressions of interest from some of its competitors, the sources said.

A spin-off of the business is also a possibility, the sources said, cautioning that GE may decide to keep the business.

The move comes at a time when a flood of Chinese funding is shaping the $260 billion-strong aircraft leasing industry as a significant new asset class.

GE declined to comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

GECAS has a fleet of roughly 1,300 planes worth an estimated $25 billion, ranking behind only U.S.-listed AerCap Holdings NV (AER.N), which is estimated to have a $30 billion portfolio, according to data from industry consultancy Ascend Flightglobal. AerCap has a market value of $8.3 billion.

Some 40 percent of the airline industry’s aircraft is leased to avoid the fixed costs of owning planes.

Both GECAS and AerCap trace their roots to the collapsed (Guinness Peat Aviation) (GPA) leasing empire of Irish leasing baron, Tony Ryan, over two decades ago.

GE Capital bought $1.3 billion of prime GPA assets and struck a deal to manage most of the rest to form GECAS – coupling GPA’s hardware with GE’s balance sheet. The remaining core of old GPA was later acquired by AerCap, which is now the main competitor to GECAS.

RISE OF ASIAN LESSORS

Consolidation in the leasing sector has intensified in the last few years, as Asian competitors chip away at the market shares of GECAS and AerCap. GECAS has also been trimming its fleet in the last few years.

“I believe that GECAS sees opportunity in the market to sell aircraft with leases attached to new emerging lessors which allows them to generate profit on these specific transactions whilst also managing their asset and customer concentration risk,” said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend Flightglobal.

Avolon Holdings, owned by China’s shipping-and-airline giant HNA Group, has vaulted to become the world’s third biggest lessor after acquiring U.S. rival CIT Group Inc’s (CIT.N) plane leasing business this year.

Bank of China-owned Bank of China Aviation Ltd (2588.HK) and subsidiaries of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), China Development Bank and Bank of Communications (601328.SS) have emerged among the list of top 15 lessors after placing multi-billion dollar orders for Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) aircraft.

In June, GECAS struck a partnership with Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Canada’s second largest pension fund, to create a new company focused on leasing high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft. [nL1N1JG15H]

Lieutenant Colonel Chan Garang, an ally of former army chief Paul Malong, defected to join the largest rebel group fighting Kiir, he said. All three men are ethnic Dinkas and any split within the powerful group could represent a threat to Kiir.

The four-year civil war has split the country into a patchwork of fiefdoms, created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis in two decades and led to ethnic cleansing. A third of the 12 million-strong population has fled their homes and half are dependent on food aid.

In May, Kiir fired Malong, whom U.N. investigators accused of directing ethnic militias responsible for the rape, torture and murder of civilians. Malong, who is also on a U.S. sanctions list, briefly fled north but returned to the capital, where he has been under house arrest ever since.

Over the weekend, Kiir’s troops surrounded Malong’s house in Juba and unsuccessfully attempted to disarm his bodyguards. An armed standoff continues outside his house.

Garang is the first Malong loyalist to join the rebels. Garang said he defected because allies of Malong’s were being badly treated, troops had not been paid for seven months and other tribes were being discriminated against.

“I left Juba because when are you are a supporter of Paul Malong, you will be arrested,” Garang told Reuters via satellite phone.

“We are preparing our army so that we can launch an attack on Juba. Salva Kiir divided the tribes so we need him to go.”

Garang told Reuters he took more than 200 soldiers with him, although a rebel press release put the number at 150. A photo provided by the rebels showed more than 30 armed men but their identities were unclear.

Army spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said they were not aware of any defection from their ranks.

Malong was unreachable by phone, but his wife Lucy Ayak distanced her husband from the defected commander.

“[Garang] is not happy with the government and he has deserted. Why is he saying it is the issue of General Malong?” she asked Reuters.

South Sudan’s war began in December 2013 between troops loyal to Kiir and rebels of former vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer.

Oyet Nathaniel, a senior rebel official, told Reuters that Garang had brought 150 men with him and that anyone deciding to join them against Kiir is a “welcome development,” regardless of their background.

There are several rebel groups, but none of them is well-funded or well-armed.

New Jersey voters are picking a new governor, to succeed outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several big cities are selecting mayors, and conservative Utah is holding a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended.

In Virginia, opinion polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor’s race that will offer clues about the U.S. political mood.

Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but has embraced the president’s combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

The ads put Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in polls in recent weeks in the Southern state, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points in last year’s presidential race.

“The momentum is clearly on our side,” Gillespie told Fox News on Monday.

Gillespie, however, has not won over Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and lives in Democratic-leaning Arlington. Peacemaker considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s nomination last year. Clinton won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington County, the most densely populated part of Virginia, nestled against the border of Washington, D.C.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” Peacemaker, who voted for Clinton, said on Tuesday

Trump’s influence on the race is significant even though the president was not highly engaged until the campaign’s final days, Peacemaker said. After winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies, Peacemaker added.

ANOTHER SETBACK FOR DEMOCRATS?

A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who lost four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.

Democrats fear such a victory would give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

“Gillespie’s ads played on every fear and dark impulse, and if we lose, we are going to see a lot more of that,” Democratic strategist Dane Strother said.

Gillespie rejected that characterization and said he was gaining ground against Northam because of his substantive policies and plans to bolster Virginia’s economy. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but never campaigned for him, backed that view on Monday.

“The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!” he wrote on Twitter.

In response, Northam tweeted that voting for him was “the best way to refute Trump’s lies.” The Virginia economy had an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in September, better than all but 13 states and below the national rate of just over 4 percent.

Trump’s argument resonated with Lee Hernandez, who works in finance and voted for Gillespie because he found the Republican’s message on economic improvement more persuasive.

Hernandez, a swing voter who also lives in Arlington, said he was bothered by Northam’s emphasis on “keeping Virginia blue (Democratic) or making it blue, and that really was a big turnoff.”

Gillespie’s campaign has blasted an ad aired by an outside pro-Northam group - quickly taken down - that showed a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie sticker chasing down minority children.

In the governor’s race in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead in polls over Republican Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor, who has been hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

In local races, Democratic Mayors Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston are expected to cruise to re-election, while Detroit, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina; and Seattle also will pick mayors.

It is a debate that is echoing across the United States as security experts and some politicians ask churches to consider a wide range of enhanced measures to thwart tragedies like Sunday’s deadly rampage at the First Baptist Church.

Barbara Burdette, who knew the 26 people killed in the massacre and as well as the 20 wounded, is ready to see her church hire armed security, or allow congregants to carry their own concealed firearms for self-defense.

“God is our protector,” said Burdette, 62, “but I do still think that we need to have people with conceal carry.”

Her pastor at the First Baptist Church of La Vernia, a one-story brick sanctuary 7 miles from the shooting scene, said the issue of guns in church requires a delicate balance between providing safety instead of fear.

Arming parishioners is not the only option. At the historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, where a white gunman killed nine at a June 2015 bible study session, uniformed police officers now attend regular worship services.

“It’s part of our new normal,” said Reverend Eric Manning at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, by phone. He said the church also created in-house security, as have most black churches in the region.

Muslim and Jewish institutions for years have added security measures to address the threat of violence and hate crimes. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) stresses the importance of security cameras, strong doors and clearing brush away from buildings so attackers have no place to hide.

A law enforcement vehicle prominently parked in front of a house of worship is also a strong deterrent to crime, said Claude Pichard, director of Training Force USA, which worked with churches across the country to improve security after the Charleston shooting.

The question of enabling, or even encouraging, parishioners to shoot back is a discussion particularly important to communities where guns are a part of life, such as rural Texas.

In Sutherland Springs, the shooter was confronted as he left the church by a resident who shot and wounded him.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News that churches should consider whether they wanted parishioners to be armed as a way of preventing another tragedy.

His state allows for the concealed carrying of handguns by licensed owners. It is not clear exactly how First Baptist Church, where the shooting occurred, addressed gun issues.

A sheriff in Williamson County, Texas, a two-hour drive from the massacre, expects to discuss arming parishioners at a church security summit he is organizing in the wake of the attack. He said churches have a responsibility to ensure that responding officers can distinguish a protector from the assailant.

“What are you doing to make sure we don’t have a friendly on friendly fire?” said Sheriff Robert Chody by phone.

New Life Church, a congregation of 10,000 people in Colorado Springs, Colorado, requires churchgoers to leave their guns in their vehicles, a decade after it was the scene of a deadly shooting that killed two. A parishioner trained in church security used a firearm to wound the shooter, preventing greater carnage, said pastor Brady Boyd.

“Pastors are now waking up to this reality that we are not living in Mayberry anymore,” he said, referring to the fictitious North Carolina hometown on the “Andy Griffith Show,” a long-running 1960s television comedy.

He pointed out that no church could have security in place to withstand an attack by a military-trained shooter using an assault rifle, the scenario that unfolded this weekend in Texas.

About 10 miles from the shooting, Floresville Christian Fellowship Pastor Bennie Herrera said he needed to re-examine security but knows there is only so much that can be done.

“We will not be gripped by fear,” he said. “Faith will rise up and we will come together,” he said.",Fear and faith: Church security scrutinized after Texas massacre,https://www.reuters.com/article/texas-shooting-security/fear-and-faith-church-security-scrutinized-after-texas-massacre-idINKBN1D71T8

Pressed on whether he would retain the interest in Navigator Holdings, Ross told Bloomberg Television: “I’ve been actually selling it anyway, but that isn’t because of this.”

Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, was criticized when several media outlets reported that he had failed to disclose that one of Navigator’s clients is Russian gas and petrochemical company Sibur.

Sibur’s owners include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions.

The information is based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L). They were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets and published on Sunday.

Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth.

Ross said in multiple media interviews that he had fully disclosed his stake in Navigator Holdings as part of government ethics requirements.

“There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC.

U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which was included in Ross’ 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest holdings that posed conflicts.

Blumenthal called for an investigation and hearings.

“If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC.

Senate Commerce Committee spokesman Frederick Hill said that Ross’ interest in Navigator was disclosed to the panel, but added: “The committee expects Secretary Ross will follow the advice of his department’s ethics officials should there be a determination that any holding creates a conflict of interest.”

Navigator did not come up at Ross’ confirmation hearing in January, but he was asked about his decision to retain an interest in Diamond S Shipping, which operates 33 petroleum product tankers.

Ross said his research showed that no ocean shipping cases had ever come before the Commerce Department. Ocean shipping is regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission, an independent agency.

But asked by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell if he would look at additional areas for possible further recusals from potential conflicts of interest, Ross replied: “I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal in any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of a doubt.”

Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified with investigations into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.

Officials from Navigator could not be reached for comment.

Appleby released a statement late on Sunday saying that the release of its documents was the result of “an illegal computer hack” and not a leak.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

FILE PHOTO: An overall view of the assembly line where the BMW X4 is made at the BMW manufacturing plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina March 28, 2014. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sunday’s massacre at a church in rural southeastern Texas, was found guilty by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and a stepson while assigned to a U.S. Air Force logistics readiness unit in 2012, the Pentagon disclosed on Monday.

The Air Force also acknowledged that it had failed to transmit information about Kelley’s conviction to the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system, a U.S. government data bank used by licensed firearms dealers to check prospective gun buyers for criminal backgrounds.

Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Freeman Martin put the number of victims killed in the attack at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who died. The dead otherwise ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years.

Twenty others were wounded, 10 of whom remained in critical condition late on Monday, officials said.

Two handguns were found in Kelley’s getaway vehicle, where he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a failed attempt to flee from the scene of Sunday’s shootings, Martin told a news conference on Monday night.

The Air Force opened an inquiry into how it handled the former airman’s criminal record, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure that other cases “have been reported correctly,” Pentagon officials said. [nL1N1NC23Y]

Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, 26, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, had exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks.

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.

A sporting goods retail outlet said Kelley passed background checks when he bought a gun in 2016 and a second firearm this year. [nL1N1NC1HK]

Neither the NCIC nor two related databases contained any information that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation of the slayings, said Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Antonio.

‘TEXAS HERO’

Police said Kelley stormed into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, dressed in black and wearing a human-skull mask, and opened fire on worshippers with a Ruger AR-556 semi-automatic rifle.

Kelley was shot twice - in the leg and torso - by another man, Stephen Willeford, who lived nearby and confronted Kelley with his own rifle as the gunman emerged from the church.

Kelley managed to flee in a sport utility vehicle as Willeford waved down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff. The two then gave chase in Langendorff’s pickup truck until Kelley’s vehicle crashed in a ditch. [nL1N1NC1DN]

Martin later hailed Willeford as “our Texas hero,” crediting him with preventing further carnage in Sunday’s rampage, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in the state and one of the five most lethal in modern U.S. history. [nL1N1NC1US]

Authorities also said Kelley had been involved in a domestic dispute of some kind with the parents of his second wife, whom he married in 2014, and had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law before the shooting. [nL1N1NC1US]

Although his in-laws were known to occasionally attend services at the church Kelley attacked, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said family members were not present on Sunday.

The attack stunned Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people. One family, the Holcombes, lost eight members from three generations in the attack, including Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor who was leading the service, a relative said. [nL1N1NC1ZZ]

The first shots came through the windows of the church, according to an account related to CNN by the son of one of the survivors, 73-year-old Farida Brown, who was shot in both legs. The assailant then stalked inside and sprayed the pews with gunfire, walking up and down the aisles targeting people even as they ran for cover or lay on the floor.

Farida Brown was in the last pew, beside a woman who was shot multiple times, her son, David Brown, said.

“She was pretty certain she was next, and her life was about to end. Then somebody with a gun showed up at the front of the church, caught the shooter’s attention. He left and that was the end of the ordeal,” David Brown told CNN.

Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the shooting, as well as 15 empty 30-round ammunition magazines.",Lapse in background check database allowed Texan church gunman to buy weapons - Pentagon,https://in.reuters.com/article/texas-shooting/lapse-in-background-check-database-allowed-texan-church-gunman-to-buy-weapons-pentagon-idINKBN1D714Q

The company’s U.S.-listed shares (VRX.N) were up 13 percent at $13.59 in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Valeant maintained its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3.60 billion to $3.75 billion, even as it divests assets to reduce its debt pile, accumulated during former CEO Michael Pearson’s deal-making spree.

The company said on Tuesday it reduced total debt by about $6 billion between the end of the first quarter of 2016 and Nov. 7. The company said total long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, stood at $27.14 billion.

Laval, Quebec-based Valeant also said it had eliminated all long-term debt maturities until 2020 and all mandatory amortization requirements.

“Valeant is a very different company today than it was a year ago ... We realize there is more progress to be made,” Chief Executive Joseph Papa said in a statement.

The company has been rebuilding its business after coming under fire for its steep drug price hikes and the unorthodox use of a specialty pharmacy to boost sales.

Net income attributable to Valeant was $1.30 billion, or $3.69 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $1.22 billion, or $3.49 per share, a year earlier.

The reported quarter included a tax benefit of about $1.4 billion, the company said.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S calculation, above analysts’ average estimate of 88 cents.

Total revenue fell 10.5 percent to $2.22 billion, largely due to volume decreases in its U.S. diversified products and branded businesses, but beat estimate of $2.15 billion.

Veteran hedge fund manager Odey, whose firm has a 0.9 percent Sky stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said that Fox’s 10.75 pound-a-share bid “starts to look like it’s not a very good price” for the European pay-TV broadcaster.

Odey’s opposition to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.4 billion) takeover comes after CNBC reported that Murdoch’s Fox had recently held talks about selling some assets to Disney.

That scenario added to the potential obstacles to the Sky deal which faces an in-depth regulatory investigation and strong opposition from some British politicians.

“I’d vote against the deal,” Odey told Reuters on Tuesday, when asked about Fox’s offer for the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own.

He added: “The interesting thing is: can Sky survive happily without Fox? I think it can quite happily.”

Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch, had initially backed the Fox bid for Sky, which was announced in December.

But in August he told Reuters that he thought the offer was beginning to “look rather mean”, although he stopped short of saying he would oppose it.

Sky shares traded 1.2 percent lower at 928 pence by 1520 GMT on Tuesday, well below the bid price.

Odey said that he had changed his mind because Sky’s financial results have been “much better than people forecast” , since the offer was made.

Last month, the British broadcaster posted an 11 percent rise in core earnings to 582 million pounds for the three months to the end of September.

DISNEY DEAL?

Odey’s comments come after CNBC said that Disney recently discussed buying Fox’s movie and TV production studio studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and its stake in Sky.

The talks were not currently ongoing, the broadcaster said.

Analysts at Liberum said they still saw a successful conclusion of Fox’s bid for Sky as the most likely outcome, but the Disney-Fox talks had thrown a curveball into the mix.

They said Fox may scrap its bid for Sky as part of a proposed sale of assets, and they also noted that Fox’s willingness to consider including the Sky stake in any sale could be seen as a signal that it feels less confident of gaining regulatory approval from the British government.

UBS, however, said a combination of Disney and Fox content could strengthen the rationale for buying all of Sky.

The British company was already starting to build a pan-European streaming platform with its Now TV and Sky Ticket products, and the addition of content from Disney as well as Fox would only make that more compelling, it said.

The bank also said in the event that a Fox/Sky deal was blocked, based on the CNBC article, Disney could be a potential strategic bidder for Sky and it noted it would not have the cross-media complications of a Fox bid.

That makes Broadcom’s roughly $105 billion unsolicited offer for Qualcomm on Monday all the more edgy. The borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send debt-to-EBITDA ratios uncomfortably high.

Broadcom boss Hock Tan is facing down two sources of uncertainty. One is whether his counterpart Steve Mollenkopf will engage over the deal, which offers a 27.6 percent premium. So far, Qualcomm’s response has been noncommittal. The other is Qualcomm’s ongoing $38 billion bid to buy NXP – which listed shakily in 2010 and subsequently bought Freescale in 2015. Tan says he’ll take Qualcomm with or without NXP.

Then there’s sheer scale. The bid, worth $130 billion including Qualcomm debt, according to Broadcom, will require nearly $90 billion of cash. Private-equity outfit Silver Lake is providing $5 billion in convertible debt, with the rest to be raised by Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Add in the companies’ existing net debt, and the new group’s total would be over $100 billion, even if more cash accumulates before the deal closes. That’s four or five times the $23 billion in combined EBITDA Broadcom is expecting, including cost savings.

Consolidation among makers of chips for mobile phones, cars and the rest is all the rage, and Tan is an experienced dealmaker with a record of bringing debt down quickly after acquisitions. But it’s still a cyclical industry. The merged company would have to keep big customers like Apple happy, which might mean cutting prices. Meanwhile, $3 billion of annual cost-cuts, taxed and capitalised, are worth about the same as the roughly $22 billion premium, so Broadcom isn’t keeping much for its own shareholders.

At least one deal hurdle – the U.S. examination of foreign acquirers – has been pre-empted. The Singapore-domiciled Broadcom will move to the United States, Tan said last week in a press conference with President Donald Trump. Investors seem to have caught the boosterish mood, pushing up the stock of both companies to the tune of more than $20 billion altogether since Thursday.

The OPEC member’s socialist leader wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt and has put an alleged drug trafficker in charge of working out how. U.S. sanctions make any refinancing virtually impossible. But even default might not force the hapless, increasingly authoritarian former bus driver from power.

Maduro presides over a mismanaged economy that was hit hard by the end of the oil-price boom in 2014. Now the government cannot provide sufficient food or medicine for its citizens despite huge crude reserves. Nonetheless, on Thursday he said state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela would make a $1.1 billion payment on a bond maturing that day. He also asked Vice President Tareck El Aissami to head a commission studying how to restructure all future obligations. El Aissami called on bondholders to meet in Caracas on Nov. 13 to discuss how that might work.

With great difficulty, is the answer. El Aissami is blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury as an alleged narcotics kingpin, something he denies. Sanctions against Maduro’s government effectively mean U.S. banks can’t take part in any restructuring of the country’s foreign debt, estimated at $90 billion or higher. The country owes some $9 billion in sovereign and PDVSA debt payments in 2018. Reserves have dwindled to barely more than that.

Default might ease some domestic pressure on Maduro by allowing his government to divert scarce dollars to import more medical supplies, food and other basic goods. Yet that may prompt creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments and assets abroad such as PDVSA’s U.S. refiner Citgo.

To counter that, Maduro’s government could try to somehow funnel oil exports through ally Russia, or try to arrange further cash-for-oil barter deals like those it has with Russia and China. It could try to maintain payments on PDVSA debt, protecting the company’s assets, while halting payments on sovereign debt.

Maduro looks increasingly willing to resort to repression. Elections for an all-powerful Constituent Assembly resulted in a rubber-stamp body crammed with government loyalists. Opposition politicians alleged fraud in recent gubernatorial polls but lost heavily and seem unable to unite against him. A presidential vote due next year looks unlikely to be free or fair. Unless dissatisfaction among his own allies in government forces Maduro out, he may end up presiding over a bizarre twilight economy for years to come.",Breakingviews - Venezuela's Maduro enters alternate reality,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-venezuelas-maduro-enters-alternate-reality-idUSKBN1D324G

A venda dessas seis distribuidoras, que operam no Norte e Nordeste, está prevista para até abril de 2018, antes da desestatização da Eletrobras como um todo, que o governo projeta para até o final do primeiro semestre do próximo ano.

Pedrosa adiantou que, como contrapartida por assumir os débitos, a Eletrobras poderá assumir uma fatia de até 30 por cento nessas distribuidoras no futuro, conforme modelo definido pelo Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES), que tem apoiado o processo de privatização.

“Vai sair uma resolução do PPI e a partir daí o processo segue adiante. Já deve constar as condições que o BNDES estabeleceu para a venda das distribuidoras e as dívidas que a Eletrobras vai ter que transferir para a holding”, explicou Pedrosa.

Ele não quis citar valores, mas afirmou que essas dívidas estão “na casa dos vários bilhões (de reais)”.

“O processo permite que a Eletrobras converta em até 30 por cento de capital nas empresas, mas isso lá na frente”, explicou.

Segundo ele, a reunião do PPI para decidir sobre o tema pode acontecer ainda nesta semana, em caráter extraordinário.

O presidente Michel Temer publicou nesta terça-feira um decreto com regras para a privatização de distribuidoras de energia estatais, que deverá guiar o processo nas empresas da Eletrobras.

Um projeto de lei com pontos associados à venda das distribuidoras também deverá ser enviado ao Congresso em breve, disse Pedrosa.

Acusado pela oposição de ter se transformado em uma mistura entre um autocrata de estilo soviético e um czar, e de olho em uma possível reeleição no ano que vem, o líder russo de 65 anos passou anos pregando a estabilidade e ao mesmo tempo denunciando rebeliões na antiga União Soviética e no Oriente Médio.

O batalhão de choque da polícia reprimiu uma série de protestos antigoverno neste ano, realizando detenções em massa. Alexei Navalny, líder opositor e crítico ferrenho de Putin, foi preso três vezes por violar regras sobre manifestações públicas.

Putin, que busca moldar uma identidade nacional orgulhosa, selecionou a dedo partes do passado soviético, como sua vitória na Segunda Guerra e seu sucesso na corrida espacial. Embora não enfatize o papel do comunismo nestes feitos, ele já usou um tom ambivalente, classificando certa vez o colapso soviético em 1991 como a maior catástrofe geopolítica do século 20.

Nos raros comentários que fez sobre o tema antes do centenário, Putin deixou claro que acha que teria sido melhor que a revolução de 1917 nunca tivesse ocorrido e que acredita que não há nada para se comemorar.

“... Vemos quão ambíguos são seus resultados, o quão intimamente as consequências negativas e, precisamos reconhecer, positivas destes eventos estão entrelaçadas”, afirmou Putin a uma congregação de acadêmicos no mês passado.

Putin escolheu suas palavras cuidadosamente. A data pode lhe causar sentimentos conflitantes, mas continua sendo um aniversário sagrado para o Partido Comunista e para muitos russos mais velhos.

Embora seja o segundo maior partido na câmara baixa do Parlamento após o partido pró-Kremlin Rússia Unida, o Partido Comunista Russo exerce pouca influência real hoje e vota com o Kremlin na maioria dos principais temas.

Mas os seus apoiadores, que realizaram uma série de eventos de comemoração de uma semana para marcar o centenário da revolução e que ainda deveriam realizar uma manifestação em Moscou nesta terça-feira, acreditam que sua hora vai chegar novamente.

“O capitalismo está tropeçando de uma crise para outra”, escreveu o veterano líder do Partido Comunista Russo, Gennady Zyuganov, em uma nota de celebração do centenário para seus simpatizantes.

TENTATIVE DE DIVERSION

Kevin Spacey, qui a connu le succès aussi bien au cinéma, qu‘à la télévision et au théâtre, est, comme un certain nombre d‘autres célébrités à Hollywood, accusé de faits s‘apparentant à du harcèlement sexuel dans la foulée des révélations concernant le producteur Harvey Weinstein.

Kevin Spacey a présenté ses excuses le week-end dernier à l‘acteur Anthony Rapp, qui l‘avait accusé d‘avoir tenté de le séduire en 1986 alors que ce dernier était âgé de 14 ans.

Selon une information donnée par la chaîne de télévision CNN jeudi, huit employés de “House of Cards”, anciens et actuels, ont accusé Kevin Spacey de comportement sexuel non approprié.

Netflix a également annoncé vendredi qu‘il ne diffuserait pas le film “Gore”, qui se trouve en postproduction et qui est produit par Kevin Spacey. L‘acteur y incarne l‘écrivain Gore Vidal, décédé en 2012.

L‘agent de Kevin Spacey a rompu avec lui jeudi et on ne sait désormais qui représente l‘acteur.

Dans le cadre de ses excuses présentées à Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey a annoncé qu‘il était homosexuel, ce qui a mis en colère un certain nombre de personnes dans et hors de la communauté LGBT qui ont vu dans ce coming out une tentative de faire diversion par rapport aux accusations d‘Anthony Rapp.

L‘acteur mexicain Roberto Cavazos, qui travaillait au théâtre Old Vic de Londres où Kevin Spacey a été directeur artistique entre 2004 et 2015, a dit avoir subi à l‘époque des faits de harcèlement de la part de la star hollywoodienne.","Netflix rompt avec Kevin Spacey, accusé d'inconduite sexuelle",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idFRKBN1D40AX-OFRIN

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

“I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).”

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUSKBN1D31U1

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

In testimony made public on Monday, Page initially said he did not meet with any senior Russian officials during a trip in July 2016 but later said he “briefly” greeted Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich, and saw him again at a dinner in December 2016.

When asked if he had a private meeting with Dvorkovich on that second trip, Page replied: “We did - he stopped by a dinner I went to in December with people from the university.”

Page also said he let senior members of Trump’s campaign staff know of his trip in July 2016, including then-Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now U.S. attorney general, as well as senior Trump aides Hope Hicks and Corey Lewandowski.

Page said he reported back to other campaign officials about the July 2016 trip, saying in one email that he had received “incredible insights and outreach”.

He has for months said the trip was made as a private citizen, not as part of his role with the Trump campaign.

Page was interviewed for seven hours last Thursday by members of the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee, which is probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump campaign officials.

Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is leading a criminal investigation into the same issues and last week charged two former Trump campaign advisers, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes.

Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow, has attracted the scrutiny of investigators for his numerous contacts with Russia.

His trip to Moscow in July 2016 came after he joined the Trump campaign and he used it to deliver a pro-Russia speech at a university.

But Page, who declined to have an attorney present during the testimony to the House committee, said his trips to Russia were “benign” and blasted the congressional investigations as a waste of time and money.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House’s Intelligence committee, said Page’s testimony showed that his denials of formal meetings with senior Russian officials were inaccurate.

“Perhaps most important, Page — after being presented with an email he sent to his campaign supervisors, and which he did not disclose to the Committee prior to the interview and despite a subpoena from the Committee — detailed his meetings with Russian government officials and others, and said that they provided him with insights and outreach that he was interested in sharing with the campaign,” Schiff said.

In his testimony, Page said he has been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Russia and the election four or five times this year.

CME, the world’s largest derivatives exchange, last week announced that it would launch the futures contract of bitcoin, marking a major step in the digital currency’s path toward mainstream acceptance.

Melamed said he expects major investors to take part in bitcoin futures, which the exchange plans to start by the end of year.

“That’s a very important step for bitcoin’s history... We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,” Melamed told Reuters in an interview.

The futures will allow investors to short-sell bitcoins, making two-way bets possible, a development that he expects will attract major institutional investors, not just speculators.

Six-fold gains in the bitcoin price BTC=BTSP so far this year have stirred a debate among financial professionals on whether the digital currency represents a revolution in financial technology or just another tech bubble.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said in September that bitcoin “is a fraud” and will blow up while regulators in many countries tightened their grip on its trading.

Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.

“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.

He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology.

Pundits say blockchain will enable the transfer of assets without a centralized system such as banks and sharply reduce costs of money transfer.

“My whole life is built abound new technology. I never said no to technology. People who say no to technology are soon dead. I’m still that same guy who believes in, at least examining change. That’s what bitcoin represents,” he also said.

Melamed was elected chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1969. He moved to Chicago in his youth, having fled Nazi-occupied Poland with his family.

Melamed’s parents were among a small number of Jews to flee to Lithuania after Germany invaded their native town of Bialystok in Poland, he said.

Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan's comments are a dramatic escalation of a crisis that threatens to destabilise tiny Lebanon, This fragile country - where one in four people is a Syrian refugee - is in the cross-hairs of regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Especially since the Saudi-backed prime minister, Saad Al-Hariri, resigned in a statement broadcast from Riyadh at the weekend. Hezbollah participated in his government, but it is allied to Iran. Its guerrilla army, more powerful than the national one, is playing a major role in the war in neighbouring Syria, shoring up government forces. That's another arena for the proxy war between Tehran and Riyadh. Al-Sabhan said Hezbollah's actions constituted aggression against Saudi Arabia, and the government would be considered - quote - ""a government which has declared war"". Hariri's resignation shocked even his aides. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah called it a ""Saudi statement"" and said Riyadh had forced him to do it.

But Saudi's foreign minister said Monday that Hariri was protesting to Hezbollah ""calling the shots"" in his government. Hariri's power-sharing government took over a year ago and was heralded for ending years of political deadlock.

Cyber attackers made about $4.4 million in illegal transfers from NIC Asia Bank, based in the Nepali capital, by hacking the SWIFT server at the private bank, to other countries, including the United States, Britain, China, Japan and Singapore last month when the bank was closed for annual festival holidays, Nepali media said.

Chinta Mani Shivakoti, a deputy governor of the Central Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) said the regulator had requested authorities in these countries not to release the payment of the stolen amount as soon as it was informed about the theft and had launched moves to recover it.

“Most of the stolen amount of money has been recovered,” Shivakoti told Reuters. “A sum of amout $580,000 is yet to be recovered,” he said without giving details.

The chief of Nepal police’s Central Investigation Bureau Pushkar Karki said his agency was investigating into how the passcode of the bank’s computer system had been stolen and who was involved in it.

“We are still working on this,” Karki told Reuters.

Nepali media reports said consultancy firm KPMG was also involved in the investigation.

“The incident showed there are some weaknesses with the IT department of the bank. Once the investigation report is available we’ll provide guidelines to avoid such incidents in future,” Shivakoti of the central bank said.

SWIFT said it does not comment on individual entities.

A SWIFT spokesperson said: ”When a case of potential fraud is reported to us, we offer our assistance to the affected user to help secure its environment.”

“We subsequently share relevant information on an anonymised basis with the community. This preserves confidentiality, whilst assisting other SWIFT users to take appropriate measures to protect themselves. We have no indication that our network and core messaging services have been compromised”.

In testimony made public on Monday, Page initially said he did not meet with any senior Russian officials during a trip in July 2016 but later said he “briefly” greeted Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich, and saw him again at a dinner in December 2016.

When asked if he had a private meeting with Dvorkovich on that second trip, Page replied: “We did - he stopped by a dinner I went to in December with people from the university.”

Page also said he let senior members of Trump’s campaign staff know of his trip in July 2016, including then-Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now U.S. attorney general, as well as senior Trump aides Hope Hicks and Corey Lewandowski.

Page said he reported back to other campaign officials about the July 2016 trip, saying in one email that he had received “incredible insights and outreach”.

He has for months said the trip was made as a private citizen, not as part of his role with the Trump campaign.

Page was interviewed for seven hours last Thursday by members of the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee, which is probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump campaign officials.

Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is leading a criminal investigation into the same issues and last week charged two former Trump campaign advisers, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes.

Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow, has attracted the scrutiny of investigators for his numerous contacts with Russia.

His trip to Moscow in July 2016 came after he joined the Trump campaign and he used it to deliver a pro-Russia speech at a university.

But Page, who declined to have an attorney present during the testimony to the House committee, said his trips to Russia were “benign” and blasted the congressional investigations as a waste of time and money.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House’s Intelligence committee, said Page’s testimony showed that his denials of formal meetings with senior Russian officials were inaccurate.

“Perhaps most important, Page — after being presented with an email he sent to his campaign supervisors, and which he did not disclose to the Committee prior to the interview and despite a subpoena from the Committee — detailed his meetings with Russian government officials and others, and said that they provided him with insights and outreach that he was interested in sharing with the campaign,” Schiff said.

In his testimony, Page said he has been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Russia and the election four or five times this year.

A tie-up would come at a time when Britain’s established energy companies are losing market share to smaller challengers and face the prospect of a government-imposed cap on prices.

SSE said on Tuesday the talks were about merging its household energy supply and services business with Innogy’s UK supply business npower, sending SSE shares more than 3 percent higher and Innogy’s up 1.6 percent.

In the UK retail electricity market, SSE has a 14 percent market share and npower 9 percent. The combined 23 percent would just top Centrica-owned (CNA.L) British Gas’s share of 22 percent, data from regulator Ofgem shows.

For the retail gas market, SSE has an 11 percent market share and npower 8 percent, with Centrica on 33 percent.

“SSE probably thinks it can harness the customer base for a bargain price since npower has been struggling for a while now. But the real question is whether regulators would let this one pass, and it’s hard to see it overcoming competition concerns,” said analysts at ETX Capital.

The two firms said discussions were “well-advanced”, but no binding agreements had been entered into, and declined to comment on the reasons for the talks.

Innogy said the combined business would be listed.

“A deal may face some tough questions from the regulator but they must think it’s achievable,” said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight.

On Monday, Reuters reported that Innogy could sell npower, or combine it with a local rival.

Britain’s energy market is dominated by the so-called “big six” of British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, npower, E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF Energy (EDF.PA), which account for about 85 percent of the retail electricity market.

But they have all been losing customers to smaller rivals over the past year or so, which has ramped up pressure on the firms which already face the introduction of a price cap on their most common tariffs, standard variable tariffs (SVTs).

“This puts the consolidation theme on everyone’s radar. The companies have to think about what to do in Britain and whether going it alone still makes sense. The answer is probably not,” an industry source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Last month, the government asked the energy market regulator to come up with price caps on consumer gas and electricity prices for millions of households which will initially last until 2020.

When introduced, which is not likely until next winter at the earliest, it would be the biggest energy market intervention for 30 years.

Utilities have criticised the move, with some saying it would hit competition and others saying SVTs should be scrapped altogether.",SSE and Innogy in talks to merge UK retail energy supply businesses,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sse-innogy/sse-and-innogy-in-talks-to-merge-uk-retail-energy-supply-businesses-idUKKBN1D721X?il=0

They argue the bloody sport causes excessive suffering for the animals as bulls fight to the death against matadors. Tensions boiled over with some protesters and riot police amidst accusations of heavy-handed tactics by authorities as demonstrators tried to get close to a bullring with spectators inside. Bullfighting was introduced to Peru by the Spaniards in 1558. According to CAS International, an international anti-bullfighting organization, about 377 bullfights take place every year in Peru.

After a sporadic gun battle lasting about two hours, Afghan special forces suppressed the attack on Shamshad TV, a private Pashto-language broadcaster based close to the national stadium. Police said at least two people were killed and 20 wounded.

“People dressed in police clothes came in and initially threw hand grenades, which killed one of our guards and wounded another,” Abed Ehsas, Shamshad’s news director told broadcaster Tolo News TV.

“Others got into our building and started firing. Some of our colleagues were hit, though, thank God, many others managed to get out. Some were wounded by gunshots, falling glass and when they jumped from higher floors.”

Some two hours later the station, which had replaced regular programs with a still picture as the fighting went on, resumed normal service, its newsreader appearing with a bandage on a hand injured in the attack..

The attack, which underlined insecurity in Kabul, came on the day NATO announced an increase of some 3,000 troops in its Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan as part of a bid to break the stalemate with Taliban insurgents.

Amid the crack of gunfire, a special forces unit blasted a hole in the concrete wall around the compound and entered the site as police blocked off surrounding streets. At least one attacker was killed during the operation, while another died at the compound entrance.

In a statement on its news agency Amaq, Islamic State claimed responsibility, without giving evidence.

The group, based mainly in the eastern province of Nangarhar, has claimed a number of attacks on civilian targets in Kabul but uncertainty remains over whether all the attacks the group claims are actually its work.

Shortly after the beginning of the attack, the Taliban’s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, issued an immediate denial of involvement.

Suicide bombings are part of life in Kabul but the latest attack on journalists and media workers was described by human rights group Amnesty International as an “horrific crime”.

“The Afghan authorities must do what they can to protect the country’s media, allowing them to work freely and without fear,” the group said in a statement.

Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s comments were published after Saudi air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile that Saudi Arabia said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Iran-allied Houthi militia, which controls large parts of neighboring Yemen.

Saudi-led forces, which back the internationally-recognized government, have been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

The supply of rockets to the Houthi movement could “constitute an act of war against the kingdom,” state news agency SPA on Tuesday quoted Prince Salman as saying in a call with British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

In reaction to the missile, the Saudi-led military coalition said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country.

The United Nations on Tuesday called on the coalition to re-open an aid lifeline into Yemen, saying food and medicine imports were vital for 7 million people facing famine.

“The situation is catastrophic in Yemen, it is the worst food crisis we are looking at today,” Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told a briefing in Geneva.

The missile launch was “most likely a war crime” Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday but also urged Saudi Arabia against restricting aid access to Yemen, where the United Nations estimates nearly 900,000 people are infected with cholera.

“This unlawful attack is no justification for Saudi Arabia to exacerbate Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe by further restricting aid and access to the country,” it said.

The coalition said aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen despite the temporary closure of ports but the United Nations said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday.

The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to northern Yemen, which is held by the Houthis.

The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia.

In an interview with CNN television on Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir accused the armed Lebanese Hezbollah group of firing the missile at Riyadh from Houthi-held territory.

“With regards to the missile...that was launched on Saudi territory, it was an Iranian missile launched by Hezbollah from territory occupied by the Houthis in Yemen.”

He said the missile was similar to one launched in July at Yanbu in Saudi Arabia and was manufactured in Iran, disassembled and smuggled into Yemen, then reassembled by the operatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah, “then it was launched into Saudi Arabia.”",Saudi crown prince calls Iran supply of rockets 'military aggression',https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-iran/saudi-crown-prince-calls-iran-supply-of-rockets-military-aggression-idINKBN1D70QR

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and Congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.

All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate.

The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

“For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said after the committee voted.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another sponsor, said that, in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights.

Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, calling for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war.

Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of former President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.”

Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week that they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the bill. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House of Representatives.

The trend reversal is likely to reignite investor concern over mine safety and could prompt regulators to step up shaft inspections, which often result in costly production stoppages.

“Fatal accidents last week raised the number of fatalities in 2017 to 76, above the 73 reported in 2016. This is particularly disappointing given the consistent improvement the industry has seen over the past two decades,” South Africa’s Chamber of Mines said in a statement.

The chamber said there had been several fatalities in recent weeks because of seismic activity.

Anglo American Platinum CEO Chris Griffith, who heads the chamber’s CEO Zero Harm Forum, said the industry, government and labour needs to “accelerate initiatives that could improve this unacceptable performance”.

Fidel Hadebe, spokesman for the department of mineral resources, said “the department will certainly be stepping up efforts around this issue”, including closing operations for non-compliance with safety regulations.

Paul Mardon, head of health and safety at the Solidarity trade union, said there were concerns that production pressures were compromising safety as workers worried about their jobs in a difficult economic climate.

He also said there was a worrying trend in the size and frequency of what are called “fall of ground” incidents, which involve tunnel roofs or walls crumbling onto workers. This could point to geological or other structural issues.

South African mining companies include Harmony Gold, Gold Fields, Impala Platinum and AngloGold Ashanti among others. AngloGold Ashanti operates the world’s deepest mine, the Mponeng gold mine, which extends 4km (2-1/2 miles) below ground.

For all the dangers, the industry in the world’s top platinum producer had been making significant strides on safety thanks to measures such as the use of netting to catch falling rocks at the face, or stope, where drilling and blasting take place.

In 1993, the year before Nelson Mandela became South Africa’s first black president, 615 miners died in the pits. By 2009 the number had dropped to 167 and kept falling, reaching a record low of 73 in 2016, according to Chamber of Mines data.","Deaths spike in South Africa's deep and dangerous mines, reversing trend",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D71ZO-OZATP

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

US-JOBDATEN BEREITEN BÜHNE FÜR DEZEMBER-ZINSERHÖHUNG

Auch an der Wall Street ging es für Dow-Jones und S&P weiter nach oben. Ein schwächer als erwartet ausgefallener US-Stellenaufbau bremste nur vorübergehend. Am US-Arbeitsmarkt entstanden im Oktober 261.000 statt der erwarteten 310.000 Jobs. Dennoch steckte die US-Wirtschaft den Dämpfer durch die Wirbelstürme “Harvey” und “Irma” insgesamt gut weg. “Auf den zweiten Blick ist es nicht so schlimm wie gedacht, da es deutliche Aufwärtsrevisionen für den vorangegangenen Monat gibt”, sagt Anlageexperte Brad McMillan vom US-Brokerhaus Commonwealth Financial.

Damit ist die Bühne für die dritte geldpolitische Straffung in diesem Jahr bereitet: Händler sehen eine Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Dezember-Erhöhung bei 90 Prozent. Zuletzt hatte die Fed den Zins im Juni auf 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent hochgesetzt.

APPLE-HYPE STECKT AN - ANLEGER MÖGEN NEUEN-FED-CHEF

Im Technologiesektor steckten der Hype um den Verkaufsstart des iPhone X und ein rosiger Ausblick auf das Weihnachtsgeschäft von Apple die Anleger an. Die Apple-Aktie legte um 3,7 Prozent zu und erreichte mit 174,26 Dollar einen neuen Höchststand. Damit knackte der Konzern aus Kalifornien erstmals die Marke von 900 Milliarden Dollar bei der Marktbewertung - Analysten zufolge dürfte schon bald die Schwelle von einer Billion Dollar überschritten werden.

Auch Zulieferer standen hoch im Kurs: Größter Dax-Gewinner waren die Aktien des Münchner Chipherstellers Infineon mit einem Aufschlag von 1,7 Prozent. Dialog Semiconductor waren mit einem Plus von 2,3 Prozent unter den gefragtesten Werten im Technologie-Index TecDax. STMicroelectronics legten in Mailand 2,5 Prozent auf ein 13 1/2-Jahres-Hoch von 20,96 Euro zu.

Der 64-Jährige steht für Kontinuität in der Geldpolitik. “Mit ihm dürfte der von der Fed eingeschlagene Kurs gradueller Leitzinsanhebungen fortgesetzt werden”, sagte Analyst Dirk Gojny von der National-Bank. Powell stehe zudem einer etwas lockeren Regulierung des Finanzdienstleistungssektors offen gegenüber.

ティラーソン米国務長官が中東を歴訪した目的はただ２つ。イランに対抗する地域的枠組みにイラクを取り込むこと、そしてカタールに対する禁輸措置を終了するようサウジアラビアを説得することだった。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。カタールで２４日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。１０月２７日、米国はこの３年間、ＩＳ打倒を最優先する中東政策をとってきたが、問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。写真はティラーソン米国務長官。サウジアラビアの首都リヤドで２２日代表撮影（２０１７年 ロイター）カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。＊筆者はロイターのコラムニスト。元ロイターの防衛担当記者で、現在はシンクタンク「Project for Study of the 21st Century（ＰＳ２１）」を立ち上げ、理事を務める。＊本コラムは筆者の個人的見解に基づいて書かれています。（翻訳：エァクレーレン）＊このドキュメントにおけるニュース、取引価格、データ及びその他の情報などのコンテンツはあくまでも利用者の個人使用のみのためにロイターのコラムニストによって提供されているものであって、商用目的のために提供されているものではありません。このドキュメントの当コンテンツは、投資活動を勧誘又は誘引するものではなく、また当コンテンツを取引又は売買を行う際の意思決定の目的で使用することは適切ではありません。当コンテンツは投資助言となる投資、税金、法律等のいかなる助言も提供せず、また、特定の金融の個別銘柄、金融投資あるいは金融商品に関するいかなる勧告もしません。このドキュメントの使用は、資格のある投資専門家の投資助言に取って代わるものではありません。ロイターはコンテンツの信頼性を確保するよう合理的な努力をしていますが、コラムニストによって提供されたいかなる見解又は意見は当該コラムニスト自身の見解や分析であって、ロイターの見解、分析ではありません。,"［２７日 ロイター］ -

だが、どちらも不首尾に終わった。

過激派組織「イスラム国（ＩＳ）」が事実上の首都としていたシリアのラッカが陥落し、ようやく戦塵は収まりつつある。米国政府とその主導による有志連合が中東地域にとどまらず広範囲で収めた大きな成功だ。

実際の戦闘の大半は現地勢力によって担われたとはいえ、米国による支援がなければ、依然としてＩＳがこの地域に広大な占領地を維持していたのはほぼ確実だ。ＩＳが２０１４年に劇的な勝利を重ねたことで、特にイラク、サウジアラビア両国政府はひどく混乱した。だが、ＩＳが窮地に追い詰められた今、どちらの政府も米国にあれこれ指図されることを快く思っていない。

トランプ政権、オバマ政権のどちらも認めたくないかもしれないが、実はこの３年間、両政権とも中東政策に関しては似たようなアプローチをとっている。「ＩＳ最優先」と呼ばれることもあるが、中東地域のその他すべての利害よりも、ＩＳ打倒を優先してきたのである。これは理にかなったアプローチで、結果的に大きな成功を収めた。

問題は、ＩＳをほぼ打倒した今の時点で、米国の中東政策が何によって決まるのかがほとんど明らかになっていないという点だ。核となる行動規範がないため、ただでさえ矛盾を抱えるアプローチが完全に崩壊してしまうリスクが顕在化している。

いくつかの面で、そのリスクはすでに現実のものとなっている。

米国政府と、シーア派主導でイランと同盟関係にあるイラク政府、またイラク領内のさまざまなクルド人政治組織との関係はこれまでも常にギクシャクしていたが、イスラム国の脅威が減るなかで、急速に悪化しつつある。９月にはクルド地域の独立を問う住民投票が行われたが、イラク政府はその直後、クルド地域の都市キルクーク周辺の石油資源が豊富な地域に進出した。クルド人勢力とイラク政府軍のあいだで衝突も相次いだ。

中東のそれ以外の地域では、スンニ派・シーア派間の歴史的なライバル関係が複雑化の様相を強めている。

シリアでは、アサド政権を救おうというイラン、ロシアの企図が実質的に成功した。米国政府はこれを、安定性の確保とＩＳに対する反撃のための代償として容認しているように見える。その一方で、サウジアラビアに対しては、イエメンにおいてイラン政府と同盟関係にあるフーシ派の掃討を進めることを事実上黙認している。

ＩＳの弱体化に伴い、トランプ政権は現在、イランへの対抗を米中東政策全般における最優先課題とすることを明らかに望んでいる。

これまでのところ、それを最も明瞭に示しているのは、トランプ大統領が１０月１３日に前政権が交渉したイラン核合意を承認しないと発表したことである。その後まもなく、米国がテロ支援組織に指定しているイラン革命防衛隊に対する新たな制裁が発表された。

だが対イランに関しては、米国政府がＩＳに対して結成したような広範囲かつ一枚岩の有志連合を生み出す現実的なチャンスはほとんどない。イラン政府に対するアプローチとして何が最善なのか、米国の同盟諸国のあいだには依然として深い溝があり、欧州諸国は、ロシアも中国も署名している核合意を破棄することについて、気が進まない姿勢を明らかにしている。

湾岸諸国は、統一的な連合とはとうてい言いがたい状態にある。サウジアラビア、アラブ首長国連邦が支持する対カタール禁輸措置は継続されており、これら３カ国すべてに重要な軍事基地を持つ米国は居心地の悪い立場に置かれている。米国政府がこの状況を修復する能力はきわめて限定されているように思われる。

カタールの近隣諸国は、同国がムスリム同胞団などの組織を支援していることに怒っており、この対立は米国政府が仲裁できる領域を超えてしまっている可能性がある。

しかしそれはともかく、ティラーソン氏が、中東歴訪のもう１つの目的であるイラク政府の立場を反イランに転向させるのに成功する可能性は、さらに低かった。

ＩＳ打倒に関して、イラク政府は、米国政府やクルド人勢力に頼るのと少なくとも同じ程度に、イランの支援を受けたシーア派民兵に依存していた。ティラーソン氏がシーア派民兵に対し、イランに帰国するよう求めたことは、ひどく不合理な要求と受け止められた可能性がある。何しろ、その構成員の多くはシーア派イラク国民だからである。

ティラーソン氏の訪問は、オバマ政権以来高まっていた言説をさらに補強してしまうリスクがある。つまり、従来の友好国・敵対国双方に対して同じように、米国の支配力・影響力がいっそう低下している、というものだ。

しかもこれら諸国では、今やプーチン大統領率いるロシアに接近するという選択肢さえあるという感覚が強まっている。遠く１９世紀末以来、米国の信頼できる同盟国であったトルコは、エルドアン大統領のもとで、ますます反米的な意識を強めている。エジプトの軍事政権も、引き続き米国から大量の支援を受けているとはいえ、独自性を主張することにますます熱心になっている。

イスラエルとの関係においては、オバマ政権時代よりトランプ政権の方がわずかに改善されているかもしれないが、それでもここ数十年に比べればかなり疎遠になっている。イスラエル・パレスチナ間の紛争に関する「２国家共存」案について、トランプ氏は曖昧なシグナルを送っている。

米国大使館をテルアビブからエルサレムに移転させることを提案する一方で、今年前半には、イスラエルが提供したＩＳに関する機密情報をロシア外相に漏らしたことが報道され、イスラエル側を動揺させている。イスラエルはイランの影響力拡大とトランプ政権の予測しにくさに懸念を抱いており、特に湾岸諸国との独自の地域外交努力を強めていくことになろう。

ＩＳに対する有志連合の取り組みがほぼ成功を収めるのと同時進行で、このような状況が生じているのは逆説的である。その有志連合は、米国に深く依存していたのだし、このような有志連合をまさにこのような形でまとめ上げることは、恐らく他のどの国にもできなかっただろう。

米国政府は、かつてのイラクに対する単独主義的な武力介入とは対照的に、対ＩＳにおいては域内諸勢力と協力し、彼らを介在させることに大きな努力を注ぎ、それが顕著な効果を発揮することになったのである。

米国の軍事的な支援は今後も続くだろう。ＩＳは完全に消滅したわけではなく、攻撃を続けるだろう。リビアやアフガニスタンの一部におけるように、新たに安全な潜伏地を確保するかもしれない。アルカイダに刺激された武装勢力に対するより広範囲の戦いは確実に続くだろうし、多くの場合は、米国による軍事的な支援・協調を伴うことだろう。

だが、１０年以上にわたる戦争が失敗に終わったとみられる今、中東再編という試みに向けた米国の熱意は冷めていくかもしれない。そして、仮に米国の熱意が維持されるとしても、中東の諸勢力の側で、米国の声に耳を傾けようという気持ちがうせてしまう可能性はある。

Apesar de dominar o setor no país, o Uber uniu forças com três aplicativos menores para uma campanha pública que ajudou a convencer os senadores na semana passada a retirar partes de um projeto de lei que efetivamente transformaria as empresas em serviços regulares de táxi.

Com o Uber enfrentando uma possível proibição em Londres e várias investigações federais dos Estados Unidos, o novo presidente-executivo da empresa, Dara Khosrowshahi, precisava de uma vitória no Brasil. O país é o segundo maior mercado depois dos Estados Unidos e São Paulo faz mais viagens de Uber do que Nova York.

Juntamente com o espanhol Cabify e os brasileiros 99 e Lady Driver - voltado para passageiras e motoristas mulheres - o Uber recrutou influenciadores digitais e inundou as redes sociais com mensagens pedindo que seus usuários ligassem para seus parlamentares.

Sob o slogan “Juntos pela Mobilidade”, os aplicativos reuniram milhares de seus motoristas em protestos em cidades do país, enquanto os administradores no país do Uber, 99 e Cabify fizeram um vídeo juntos alertando os brasileiros que os transportes por aplicativos poderiam ser sufocados pela burocracia.

A colaboração com concorrentes pode ser um sinal da estratégia de Khosrowshahi de combater regulamentações indesejadas com uma abordagem menos conflituosa do que a do seu antecessor Travis Kalanick.

“Pedimos aos motoristas e usuários que se mobilizem, reunindo assinaturas em apoio à regulamentação alternativa para os aplicativos”, disse Fabio Sabba, porta-voz do Uber no Brasil, acrescentando que 816 mil pessoas assinaram a petição apresentada ao Congresso.

No projeto de lei alterado, os senadores deixaram de lado os requisitos que obrigariam os motoristas a terem carros próprios e usarem as mesmas placas de licença vermelhas usadas por taxistas, mas mantiveram a proibição de corridas fora da cidade onde o carro está registrado.

Caso as mudanças aprovadas no Senado sejam mantidas pela Câmara dos Deputados, os motoristas ainda vão precisar se registrar junto às autoridades municipais, mas nenhuma cidade poderá proibir ou limitar os serviços.

“Juntos, fomentamos a conscientização pública sobre o assunto e o Senado aceitou as emendas”, disse Daniel Bedoya, gerente do Cabify Brasil, que atua em 11 países e nunca antes tinha atuado conjuntamente com o Uber.

As empresas disseram que estão confiantes de que a pressão pública influenciará a Câmara dos Deputados a aprovar as alterações do Senado, um marco nos esforços para reverter a regulação dura que poderia comprometer sua rápida expansão global.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid.

“I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager told a news briefing on the sidelines of an international tech summit in Lisbon.

“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said.

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland.

“We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said.

It's one of several races being contested. New Jersey voters also will pick a new governor to replace outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans currently control both chambers.","New York Mayor de Blasio votes, seeks second term",https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/07/new-york-mayor-de-blasio-votes-seeks-sec?videoId=372922928&videoChannel=1&channelName=Top+News

Fredericks, who won four silver medals at the 1992 and 1996 Games, is suspected of receiving bribes and laundering the money through Paris, a source close to the inquiry in France said on Friday. He appeared before a French magistrate on Thursday.

Fredericks has previously rejected allegations of corruption.

The IOC said in a statement that its executive board had decided to suspend Fredericks after “considering the gravity and urgency of the situation and its impact on the reputation of the IOC.”

Fredericks is already being investigated by the global Athletics Integrity Unit over payments he received from Papa Massata Diack, the son of former world athletics chief Lamine Diack, on the day Rio won the vote to host the 2016 Olympics.

Fredericks has previously said that a payment of $300,000 to his company was recompense for legitimate work.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, has agreed to restrain crude output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) together with 10 other nations including Russia until March 2018.

OPEC meets at the end of this month and has been widely expected to extend the deal.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting against the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday that it was closing all Yemeni air, sea and land crossings after a missile was fired towards Riyadh at the weekend.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have said they see Iran as responsible for the Yemen conflict and on Monday Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said his country reserves the right to respond to Iran’s “hostile actions”.

“The combined oil production of these two OPEC nations is close to 14 million bpd. When they stare at each other from very close proximity, it is not surprising to see oil prices rally,” PVM Oil Associates’ Tamas Varga said.

Even a distant threat of disruption to Middle East crude supplies from any conflict is likely to support the price, but with money managers now sitting on a record bullish bet on Brent, discord within OPEC could force their hand.

“What’s happening in Saudi Arabia does not change the strategic energy priorities of the Saudis and the market is likely to dismiss this noise,” UBS said in a note.

Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had once become a “gas chamber”. Schools for younger children were ordered shut on Wednesday and all outdoor activity at high schools suspended.

A thick fog that hung over the sprawling city worsened conditions. Residents complained of smarting eyes and irritation in the throat.

The air quality index, which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter in the air, hit the “severe” level of 451 on a scale where the maximum reading is 500 and where anything above 100 is considered unhealthy by the Central Pollution Control Board.

At the severe level, even healthy people will be affected while those who have existing diseases will be severely impacted, it said.

In some parts of Delhi, the air quality was so poor that it was beyond the maximum level, according to the U.S. Embassy’s real-time air quality index. It stood at 999 for RK Puram area beyond which no readings are available.

That level is equal to smoking 50 cigarettes a day, Dr. Arvind Kumar, chairman for chest surgery at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said.

“We are in a state of medical emergency, schools should be shut, we need to bring these levels down. We are all shortening our lives.”

The Indian Medical Association urged Delhi’s biggest running race, due on Nov. 19, to be called off to protect runners and volunteers from exposure to high levels of deadly particulate matter that lodge deep in the lungs.

It said the air quality is particularly poor early in the day when the race will be run.

The air quality index measures concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide among other indicators.

EMERGENCY MEASURES

The air quality is likely to worsen in the next few days as a northwesterly wind is expected to bring toxic smoke from the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana where farmers burn crop stubble before the new planting season.

Delhi’s deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said emergency measures such as banning the entry of trucks into the capital and suspension of construction activity will kick in, if the pollution level rose further.

Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years.

Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.

Bharti Airtel, the country’s top telecoms operator that sponsors the Delhi race, said it had been assured by the organizers that steps were being taken to reduce the impact of air pollution on the runners.

Salt mixed with water will be sprinkled on the entire track to ensure that dust pollution is minimal, it said. No vehicles will be allowed on the route.

But going forward, the administration would have to take steps to improve air quality, the company said in a statement.

“Air pollution poses serious health risks and it is important that these concerns are addressed urgently and appropriately by the authorities for Airtel to continue associating with the event next year and beyond,” it said in a statement.","New Delhi pollution hits dangerous level, putting runners at risk",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/new-delhi-pollution-hits-dangerous-level-putting-runners-at-risk-idINKBN1D70QM

Rose jogou pela Inglaterra pela última vez um ano atrás e desde então passou por uma cirurgia no joelho, perdendo seu lugar fixo no Spurs e vendo seu futuro ser posto em dúvida depois de criticar a ambição e a estrutura salarial de seu time.

Magufuli, nicknamed “the Bulldozer” for his infrastructure projects and leadership style, launched his reform drive after he was elected in late 2015, promising to transform an economy hobbled by red-tape and corruption and carry out a major building program.

He has sacked thousands of civil servants over the past two years in a crackdown on government inefficiency and corruption.

A statement issued by the president’s office said the sacked director of the Bukoba Municipal Council, Erasto Aron Mfugale, and the director of the Bukoba Rural Municipal Council, Mwantum Kitwana Dau, would be assigned to other duties.

The president’s office did not explain the reasons for the sackings.

However, the two municipal directors were dismissed just hours after the president summoned them at a public gathering and demanded that they announce exactly how much was allocated by the government for road construction in their districts.

“You can’t talk to me like that,” Magufuli said at the launch of a new airport in the lakeside town of Bukoba, which was televised live. Dau had informed the president that she oversees many departments and could therefore not immediately recall the exact budget allocated for road projects.

The two dismissed officials were not immediately available for comment.

Magufuli, who served as the public works minister for nearly 20 years before becoming president, is widely known for having data at his fingertips, and frequently recites monetary figures and exact lengths of roads to their decimal points without referring to notes.

He has purged more than 20,000 “ghost workers” from the public service payroll and sacked 12,000 government employees for forging their academic transcripts.

“I will continue to straighten out those few people who have been looting this country in order to ensure that the majority of the population can reap the benefits,” he said.

Magufuli has won praise from some Western donors for cracking down on corruption and tax evasion.

Critics accuse his administration of being increasingly autocratic, but the president declared on Monday that his government “respects democracy”.",Tanzania's Magufuli sacks officials who failed to recall public works budget figures,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D70M2-OZATP

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid.

“I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager told a news briefing on the sidelines of an international tech summit in Lisbon.

“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said.

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland.

“We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said.

She also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any investigation.

“That remains to be seen if we will open more cases after the Paradise Papers.”

The European Commission last month sued Ireland for its tardiness in collecting the money from Apple.

We do have from the Irish government the progress made,” she said.",EU's Vestager says seeking details on Apple's recent tax set-up,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-apple-taxation/eus-vestager-says-seeking-details-on-apples-recent-tax-set-up-idUKKBN1D722V

The decision to endorse a measure advancing in the U.S. Senate could clear the way for Congress to pass the first rewrite of a law adopted 21 years ago that is widely considered a bedrock legal shield for the internet industry.

Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said in a statement it supported a bipartisan proposal advancing in the U.S. Senate making it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.

“Important changes made to (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,” Beckerman said.

This week, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said it would vote next week on the bill authored by Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Richard Blumenthal.

The internet industry has fought such a change in the law for years, but now Washington is stepping up scrutiny on the sector on a range of policy issues after decades of hands-off regulation.

U.S. technology companies had long opposed any legislation seeking to amend Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it is a bedrock legal protection for the internet that could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation.

Investors and analysts took the swell of interest, alongside the company’s better-than-expected sales forecast for the upcoming holiday shopping season, as signs that Apple could be the first ever company worth $1 trillion.

“I’m so excited and can’t wait to show this to my friends,” she said. “I’m especially excited about the camera quality and facial recognition.”

The glass-and-stainless-steel device that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has billed as “the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone,” starts at $999 in the United States.

The handset features an edge-to-edge display designed for deeper color rendition and an innovative camera that uses facial recognition to unlock and operate the phone.

Cook appeared on TV greeting the first customers in line at the company’s store in Palo Alto, California, about a half-hour drive from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino.

In nearby San Francisco, about 250 people lined up outside the Apple store in the Union Square shopping district.

“I’m feeling good, but my socks are wet,” said Ross Hendrix, 20, one of the first in line after camping out on the sidewalk despite a light rain on Thursday night.

GLOBAL EXCITEMENT

Similar scenes of excitement occurred earlier in the day in Asia and Europe.

In Australia, around 400 people queued outside Apple’s main store in central Sydney to pay A$1,579 ($1,218) for the new phone. Just 30 turned up for the September release of the iPhone 8, an incremental update of the iPhone 7.

“It’s beautiful bro, what a feeling, I‘m excited,” builder Bishoy Behman, 18, told Reuters after picking up two iPhone X as the first in line. He said he camped outside the store for a week before paying to improve his place in the queue overnight.

In Apple’s Omotesando store in Tokyo, some 550 people were waiting in a line stretching to around 600 meters.

“I‘m going home, and after having a rest, I’d like to have fun (with the phone),” said first-in-line Yamaura, a 21-year-old college student who spent six days in the queue.

In Europe, Apple stores in Amsterdam, Berlin and London saw lines of several hundred fans, while smaller, more subdued crowds were observed at stores in Frankfurt and Paris.

Arbitrage traders were also in line in an attempt to take advantage of the strong demand. In Hong Kong, some buyers quickly resold iPhone X handsets for a profit, but the resale premium eased as waiting times fell and supply concerns eased.

Newly purchased iPhone X were reselling for HK$11,800 ($1,512) soon after sales began, but the price quickly fell to HK$10,300, a trader told Reuters. In mainland China - where Hong Kong traders often sell newly purchased goods - the anniversary model’s starting price is 8,388 yuan ($1,267).

SUPPLY CLOSER TO DEMAND

Analysts had expressed concern that supply issues might stop Apple satisfying early demand. The camera, for instance, has never before been manufactured in the volume Apple demands.

But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that Apple was “quite happy” with how manufacturing of the iPhone X was progressing.

“Production is growing every week, and that’s very, very important during a ramp period,” he said.

Demand and supply for the iPhone X appear to be coming back into balance, according to Apple’s online store. While last week users trying to order the iPhone X were told they faced waits up to five to six weeks, these delays are now three to four weeks.

The rush of interest in the new phone came after Apple issued an upbeat sales forecast for the year-end holiday shopping season on Thursday.

Wall Street welcomed that outlook, and five analysts now have stock price targets that would move Apple’s market value past $1 trillion.

Friday’s lines signaled the company was “on track for a pretty good replacement cycle” said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor, but he questioned whether the new model sales will be as large as prior iPhone upgrade cycles.

“We do not think that the iPhone X will offer a cycle nearly as big as the iPhone 6 and my concern is that this is what the market is looking for,” said Windsor, who actively tracks all the major players in the global smartphone industry.",Long lines for iPhone X help push Apple shares to record high,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/long-lines-for-iphone-x-help-push-apple-shares-to-record-high-idUSKBN1D22Y2

Microsoft is separately also in talks over a potential investment in Ola, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the discussions are private.

The new connected-vehicle platform, for cars that have internet access, will have features to aid navigation and to flag when vehicle maintenance is required, Ola said in a statement on Tuesday.

Ola, which has been locked in a fierce battle with rival Uber [UBER.UL] for a bigger piece of India’s $12 billion taxi market, has said it would invest in artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities, which include technologies like its in-car entertainment platform called Play that allows riders to choose music and stream videos.

Nella manovra per Pisauro ci sono criticità in rapporto ai target di privatizzazione: “Per il triennio 2018-2020 il DPB conferma gli obiettivi degli introiti da privatizzazioni (0,3% del Pil) senza peraltro fornire informazioni sufficienti per valutare se il programma sia realizzabile e configurando quindi un altro elemento di rischio del quadro programmatico”.

L‘Upb segnala poi “rilevanti fattori di incertezza” in relazione al rispetto delle regole Ue, con “un forte rischio di deviazione significativa” per il 2017 in tema sia di aggiustamento del saldo strutturale che di rispetto della regola sulla spesa.

Dubbi anche sulle coperture legate agli introiti della lotta all‘evasione fiscale e al potenziamento della riscossione: “Spicca la rilevanza dell’impatto quantitativo di queste norme e l’ammontare crescente del gettito previsto che, stando all’esperienza del passato, risulta di valutazione complessa”.

Investors are also waiting for more clarity on President Donald Trump’s tax-cut plan as the earnings season winds down.

Republicans plan to bring their tax overhaul bill for a vote next week, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said on Tuesday, adding that he expects the plan to pass.

House Republicans last week unveiled a first draft that proposed a range of cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

“The market is waiting for the next catalyst, which is the tax bill,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.

“It looks like, unless some major unforeseen event occurs, tax cuts will get passed in some shape or form. Whether (corporate tax cuts) it’s 20 percent or 25 percent, a big tax cut is coming.”

The S&P has risen about 15 percent in 2017 on the back on strong earnings, an improving economy and Trump’s promise to cut taxes.

With more than 400 of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings for the third quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared with expectations of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Uber’s service has triggered protests by rivals from London to New Delhi as it up-ends traditional business models that require professional drivers to pay steep licensing fees to do business.

“We are bullish on Africa. The growth here is still substantial and we think that given the right regulatory environment, the growth could be even better,” Justin Spratt, head of business development for the sub-Saharan region, told Reuters.

“Africa’s growth thus far has been faster than America and a large part of that is because there is such deficiency in public transport ... that talks to the latent need, the pent-up demand for citizens to travel more within cities,” he added.

Spratt said Uber was talking to governments, regulatory authorities and metered taxi associations across the continent to address grievances that have seen some of its contract drivers attacked from Kenya to South Africa.

U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been “milking” Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power.

Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world’s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.

“Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it’s corruption that delays society’s development,” Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.

“God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,” said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see “correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.”

But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself.

Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom’s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts.

Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said.

INVESTOR NERVES

The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent.

Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.

In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index losing 2.8 percent.

The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry.

Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis.

A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.

“He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,” wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.

“In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.”

PIVOTAL POWER BASE

Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne.

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began.

The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.

“This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,” he said.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard’s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash. “I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,” he said.

But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.

“There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,” said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.

“Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.”","Saudi mass arrests jolt markets, play to ire over corruption",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-mass-arrests-jolt-markets-play-to-ire-over-corruption-idUSKBN1D71NN

They are open now under President Donald Trump. That is not altogether unexpected as the New York real estate developer did campaign during the 2016 presidential election on a promise to elevate the needs of business, which he argued would fuel economic growth.

What does surprise lobbyists, however, is the sheer number of wins in getting the Trump administration to roll back or delay unfavorable regulations in its first 10 months. And it is occurring despite White House dysfunction and distraction.

The lobbyists say it is a stark departure from the approach of the Obama administration, which had a reputation for aloofness toward business and sought to limit the influence of lobbyists, whom it saw as beholden to special interests. The Trump White House is listening to them, they say. It is returning their phone calls. And it is working to eliminate regulations they view as detrimental to the ability to prosper.

When 15 lobbyists and business leaders recently held talks with Trump administration officials on energy infrastructure and climate change, they were surprised by the officials' opening question: ""Do you have a regulation that we could put on a list to try to eliminate? Is there something that is impeding you from growing?""

In that moment, one of the lobbyists at the meeting knew it was a new era. “That as an opening was not the way the Obama administration approached meetings,” she said.

“It’s night and day,” between the Trump and Obama administrations, said James Thurber, a professor in the public affairs school at American University, who studies lobbying and its effects.

Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” an oath that came with plans to curb lobbying and end a “culture of corruption.” The campaign stump speech line had a populist appeal, but one person’s swamp dweller is another’s job creator.

Some of the 16 lobbyists spanning nine different industries interviewed by Reuters acknowledged that many people view them as part of the problem in Washington, not the solution, and that their growing influence may be seen by those as a negative.

Spending so far this year on lobbyists is on pace to exceed spending in 2016, according to the OpenSecrets website, with $2.43 billion spent over the first nine months compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016.

After taking office in January, Trump quickly made it easier to get into the White House.

He reversed President Barack Obama’s restrictions that sought to keep lobbyists at bay by physically barring many of them from the White House - a rule that critics said did nothing more than move meetings with lobbyists to coffee shops across the street. And Trump has stopped the public disclosure of White House visitors’ logs, so now lobbyists come and go with less concern that their presence at the White House will be scrutinized.

Most lobbyists refused to speak on the record because they did not want to reveal anything about their private discussions with the administration. Lobbyists are also acutely aware that anything they say will be used by critics who think Trump has tilted too much toward corporate interests.

The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.

The coal, steel, oil and gas industries are some of the clear winners, with easier access to the Trump administration and more deregulation of their industries, said Stan Veuger, a fellow at the conservative thinktank American Enterprise Institute who studies politics and the economy.

That business has been given more access and even more control of certain regulatory issues is “fair criticism and praise if you want to call it that,” said Veuger.

There are big losers, too. Consumer advocacy and environmental groups warning about the perils of climate change, who enjoyed easy access to the Obama White House, have largely been shut out of a Trump White House that is more skeptical of climate change and believes Obama over-reached with some of his measures to protect consumers.

SOME WINS

It was no secret that Trump wanted to greenlight the Dakota Access Pipeline to move oil from North Dakota to Illinois despite the fierce opposition of environmentalists and American Indian tribes whose land was being used. He spoke about it frequently during the campaign. Then Trump gave the energy industry more than they had hoped for.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents all the large refiners, had asked the administration to speed the permitting process for drilling and building new facilities. When Trump signed his executive order authorizing the pipeline only four days after taking office, he also granted this wish.

A number of business trade groups asked the Trump administration to suspend a rule, created during the Obama years, that would require companies to disclose to the government any communications they have with employees during union disputes. In June, the Trump Labor Department did just that, citing the opposition from business.

Among the other wins for business, the Labor Department delivered on a top priority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group and Wall Street brokerages when it reversed an Obama-era rule aimed at brokers who recommend inappropriate retirement investments.

The administration also side-stepped the process to repeal regulations by implementing delays and holds on rules.

For instance, in the final months of the Obama administration the Bureau of Land Management created a rule governing methane and waste prevention over the strong objections of groups representing oil and gas companies.

API wrote to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, in May asking him to postpone implementation of the rule. The Trump administration announced it would and even cited the lobbyists’ objections as the reason.

Of course, it is not perfect harmony between Trump and business. Dozens of corporate leaders abandoned advisory business councils set up by Trump after he appeared to side with white supremacists following a white nationalist rally in Virginia that resulted in the death of a protester.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent the past few weeks ringing alarm bells over Trump’s various positions on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

And yet, said Neil Bradley, one of the top lobbyists for the chamber, “I have even found in times when we may not see eye to eye with the administration on something, we have cordial, timely discussions that are substantive.”",'Open Sesame:' Lobbyists cheer warmer welcome in Trump White House,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-lobbying/open-sesame-lobbyists-cheer-warmer-welcome-in-trump-white-house-idUSKBN1D714U?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital, and SSI Investment Management are among those that are adding to or holding on to their shares of those of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Microsoft Co and Southwest Airlines Co in part because they expect to see more share buybacks or special dividends if a tax reform passes in some form.

The House Republican plan would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent and allow companies bring back foreign profits at a 12 percent tax rate, a process known as repatriation. Overall, U.S. companies hold some $2.6 trillion in untaxed offshore cash.

Fund managers say that while it is far too soon to tell whether the tax bill will pass, the prospect of increased buybacks is worth taking a bet on companies that would benefit the most from the plan.

“If you have two companies that you are looking at and one would get a bigger boost from bringing back its cash from overseas, that provides an extra level of return,” said Peter Santoro, a portfolio manager of the $11 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund.

For example, cash-rich tech companies with big international presence, such as Microsoft, are likely to return cash to shareholders via a one-time dividend even if Congress passes a repatriation bill rather than a broad tax reform, Santoro said.

When Congress allowed U.S. companies to bring back foreign profits at a discounted tax rate in 2004, Microsoft issued a special $3-per-share dividend and the Trump tax windfall would likely lead to something similar, Santoro said.

Santoro declined to say whether he was adding to his Microsoft position in recent months. Microsoft is the largest position in Santoro’s fund, according to Morningstar data, and its shares are up 36 percent for the year largely driven by the expansion of its cloud-based business.

Goldman Sachs estimates that the Republican tax bill would increase corporate buybacks by $75 billion, to $590 billion, in 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, estimates about half of repatriated cash would go into buybacks and the rest would get spent on acquisitions and other investments.

Stock buybacks often provide a short-term bump in a company’s share price both by eliminating the total number of available shares and improving metrics such as earnings per share and return on equity.

LAGGING THE MARKET

Yet buybacks, which peaked in 2016, have been slowing over the last three years as rising stock valuations made them more costly and investors have called on companies to invest more in their future by spending on factories or research.

The S&P 500 Buyback Index is lagging the broader market this year after having beaten the S&P 500 by nearly 83 percent between 2009 and the end of 2016. The buyback index tracks 100 of the companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratios, such as Boeing Co, Michael Kors Holdings, and Tyson Foods Inc. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zcj87u)

The Powershares Buyback Achievers fund, which tracks companies that have repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares over the last 12 months, is up 11.2 percent so far this year, compared with a 15.7 percent gain in S&P 500.

Eric Marshall, a fund manager at $2 billion Hodges Capital, said he has been adding to his position in buyback-heavy companies such as Texas Instruments and Lowe’s Companies Inc because he expects them to increase their current buyback programs if a tax bill does pass.

Texas Instruments, for instance, said in September it would buy a further $6 billion of its own shares, extending a program that has reduced its total number of shares by a quarter over the last five years. Texas Instruments shares make up about 2 percent of the Hodges Blue Chip Equity Income fund. The firm last bought the stock in June, according to the latest publicly available data.

“Buybacks are the most tax efficient thing you can do with your capital, and when you are repurchase your own stock you know exactly what you are buying,” Marshall said.

Ravi Malik, a portfolio manager at $1.6 billion SSI Investment Management Inc, said that a cut in the repatriation rate would benefit convertible bonds in his portfolio such as Citrix Systems Inc, Amgen Inc and Lam Research Corp.

SSI Investment examines its biggest holdings with a significant share of overseas revenues to assess the impact of tax legislation on those companies, Malik said. “That’s how we identified these companies as significant beneficiaries of the changes proposed.”

Barry James, a portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, said that he expected fund holdings, such as lawn mower maker Toro Co and Southwest Airlines to boost existing buyback schemes should a tax bill pass. Such a move would be preferable to an acquisition or hiring more employees, he said.

“Over the long run, we are fans of companies that reward shareholders, and now is not the right time to find an acquisition cheaply.”",U.S. investors target 'buyback stocks' in bet on Trump tax plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-buybacks/u-s-investors-target-buyback-stocks-in-bet-on-trump-tax-plan-idUSKBN1D70HX?il=0

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal but the San Diego-based company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators may reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States, told Reuters he would not rule out a proxy fight to convince shareholders to replace the board and accept the offer.

“We are well advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” said Tan, who has pulled off a string of deals over the past decade. “We have a very strong desire to work with Qualcomm to reach a mutually beneficial deal.”

A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders, who have watched their investment sour over the past year in the face of a patent dispute with Apple, would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock in a deal, according to Broadcom’s proposal. Including debt, the transaction is worth $130 billion.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” said GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives, who believes bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share. The offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014. They rose 1.1 percent to $62.52, suggesting skepticism a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares rose 1.4 percent to $277.52 after touching a record of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny, especially in China, which is home to expanding rivals. Chinese ambitions to buy U.S. chipmakers have been thwarted by U.S. regulators.

Qualcomm sells modem chips that allow phones to send data as well as communications chips for automobiles that handle “infotainment” systems and wireless electric vehicle charging.

Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data and is also in the process of closing a $38 billion bid for automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom, Qualcomm and NXP together would have control over modems, Wi-Fi, GPS and near-field communications chips, a strong position that could concern customers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd because of the bargaining power such a combined company could have to raise prices. However, a combined company would also likely have a lower cost base and the flexibility to cut prices.

Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said that U.S. regulators would try to ensure the deal would not lead to higher chip prices.

”Based on what I’ve seen, it seems unlikely to me that there’s a basis for a challenge (to stop the deal),” he said.

Tan added that if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm which in turn has acquired NXP, the combined company’s net debt could be in the range of $90 billion.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary financing for the proposed transaction.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Broadcom also could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, raising as much at $25 billion from a sale, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah suggested.

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion in cash as of Sept. 24. Broadcom also got a commitment letter for $5 billion in financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners, an existing Broadcom investor.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Qualcomm stock has fallen this year because of a patent fight with Apple, which could quit using Qualcomm chips in its phones, and concerns that it may have to raise its bid for a NXP.

If Broadcom decides to make a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 10-member board by a Dec. 7 nomination deadline.

Two Qualcomm directors, Anthony Vinciquerra and Mark McLaughlin, have been aligned with activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which pushed for a shakeup of the company two years ago. Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm board director, was added last year as a compromise candidate.

Apple, as a key customer, could play a key role. Analysts say that if Broadcom can salvage the Apple relationship, it would sharply increase potential returns from the takeover.

Tan also has a history of cutting costs at acquired companies, and Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder predicted Tan would cut away waste at Qualcomm.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.","Broadcom bids $103 billion for Qualcomm, open to going hostile",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-bids-103-billion-for-qualcomm-open-to-going-hostile-idUSKBN1D61EO

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

The U.S. State Department called for the immediate and unconditional release of King and other hostages.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Pentagon separately disclosed that it had failed to furnish information about the gunman’s criminal record from his U.S. Air Force service to a national database that should have prevented him from legally purchasing the firearms he bought.

The killer, Devin Kelley, 26, was convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and step-son while serving in an Air Force logistics readiness unit and spent a year in detention before his bad-conduct discharge in 2014, according to the Pentagon.

The Air Force acknowledged on Monday that Kelley’s 2012 conviction on two counts of domestic violence were never entered into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) system, a U.S. government data bank used by licensed gun dealers for conducting background checks on firearms purchasers.

Federal law forbids anyone from selling or giving a gun to someone convicted of a crime involving domestic violence.

A sporting goods retail chain has said Kelley passed background checks when he bought a gun in 2016 and a second firearm the following year.

Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s San Antonio division, said there was nothing in the NCIC or two related databases that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation of the slayings.

Details of a background of violent, disturbing behavior emerged a day after Sunday’s rampage in southeastern Texas, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in the state and one of the five most lethal in modern U.S. history.

Kelley was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a failed attempt to make his getaway from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, authorities said.

Stepping out of the church, Kelley was confronted and shot twice - in the leg and torso - by an armed area resident later identified as Stephen Willeford.

Still, Kelley managed to flee in a sport utility vehicle as Willeford waved down a passing motorist, Johnnie Langendorff, in a pickup truck. The two good Samaritans then chased after the suspect at high speeds, before the gunman’s vehicle crashed in a ditch, authorities said.

Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, hailed Willeford as “our Texas hero,” crediting him with preventing further carnage. Authorities said Kelley had called his father during the pursuit to say he had been shot and might not survive.

It appeared family problems may have been a factor in Sunday’s bloodshed. Kelley was involved in a domestic dispute with the family of Danielle Shields, a woman he married in 2014, and the situation had flared up, according to officials and public records.

“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Martin told reporters outside the church on Monday. “The mother-in-law attended the church ... she had received threatening text messages from him.”

Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said the family members were not in the church during Kelley’s attack.

Martin put the number of victims killed in the attack at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who died. The dead otherwise ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Ten of the wounded in Texas remained in critical condition, officials said.

‘VIOLENT TENDENCIES’

Wearing a black bullet-proof vest and skull mask, Kelley used a Ruder AR-556 semi-automatic rifle in the attack, authorities said. They recovered two other weapons, both handguns, from his vehicle.

The gunman walked up and down the church aisles shooting people on the ground in between the pews, according to an account related to CNN by David Brown, the son of one of the wounded survivors, 73-year-old Farida Brown, who was shot in both legs.

Brown said his mother told him the first shots came through the windows, then the assailant walked through the front door and started shooting, opening fire even at those diving on the floor for cover or attempting to flee.

Farida Brown was in the last pew, beside a woman who was shot multiple times, her son told CNN.

“She was pretty certain she was next, and her life was about to end. Then somebody with a gun showed up at the front of the church, caught the shooter’s attention. He left and that was the end of the ordeal,” David Brown said.

The attack came about a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a lone assailant in modern U.S. history.

Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the church, as well as 15 30-round ammunition magazines, all of them empty.

In rural Texas and in other states, gun ownership is a part of life, and Republican leaders for years have balked at gun control measures, arguing that responsible gun owners can help deter crime.

Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott told CBS News there was evidence that Kelley had mental health problems and had been denied a state gun permit.

“It’s clear this is a person who had violent tendencies, who had some challenges,” Abbott said.

Abbott and other Republican politicians said the mass shooting did not influence their support of gun ownership by U.S. citizens - the right to bear arms protected under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he will travel to Sutherland Springs on Wednesday to meet with victims’ families and law enforcement.

“This isn’t a guns situation. I mean we could go into it but it’s a little bit soon,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters while on a trip to Asia. “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise ... it would have been much worse.”

Democrats renewed their call to restrict gun ownership.

“How many more people must die at churches or concerts or schools before we stop letting the @NRA control this country’s gun policies,” Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter, referring to the powerful gun lobby the National Rifle Association.

The attack stunned Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people with just one blinking yellow traffic light. One family, the Holcombe, lost eight people from three generations in the attack, including Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor who was leading the service, a relative said.

John Stiles, a 76-year-old retired U.S. Navy veteran, said he heard the shots from his home about 150 yards (137 m) away: “My wife and I were looking for a peaceful and quiet place when we moved here but now that hasn’t worked out.”","Family strife, threats preceded Texas church massacre by former U.S. airman",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-texas-shooting/family-strife-threats-preceded-texas-church-massacre-by-former-u-s-airman-idUKKBN1D510H?il=0

The trade bill contains provisions to help Britain in its bid to convert existing EU free-trade agreements into British ones after it leaves the trading bloc, the government said.

The legislation will also include powers to ensure British companies can continue to access government contracts in other countries and create a new trade body to defend businesses against unfair trade practices, such as dumping.

“For the first time in over 40 years the UK will be able to shape our own trade and investment agenda - and we are determined that businesses and consumers can take advantage of this opportunity,” trade minister Liam Fox said in a statement.

“Ich glaube wirklich, dass es sinnvoll ist, dass Nordkorea an den Verhandlungstisch kommt und einen guten Deal für sich herausholt”, sagte Trump am Dienstag bei einem Besuch in Südkorea. Es war der bislang versöhnlichste Appell des Präsidenten an den weitgehend isolierten Staat, der den USA mit einem Atomangriff gedroht hat. Zugleich rief Trump zu einem weltweiten Schulterschluss gegen Nordkorea auf und bekräftigte seine bisherige Haltung, auch vor einer militärischen Lösung des Konflikts nicht Halt zu machen.

Trump drängte Nordkoreas Machthaber Kim Jong Un, “das Richtige zu tun”. “Ich sehe etwas Bewegung”, sagte er nach einem Treffen mit seinem südkoreanischen Kollegen Moon Jae In. Auch China und Russland arbeiten nach Trumps Worten intensiv an einer Lösung. Moon hat sich zuletzt genau wie die Regierungen in Moskau und Peking für eine diplomatische Lösung des Konflikts stark gemacht und damit die Kritik Trumps auf sich gezogen. Trump hatte auch mit einem Rückzug aus einem Handelsabkommen mit Südkorea gedroht.

Ein Sprecher des russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin kündigte umgehend an, dass Putin und Trump in dieser Woche beim Gipfel der Asiatisch-Pazifischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft (Apec) in Vietnam über Nordkorea sprechen würden.

Trump und Kim hatten in den vergangenen Wochen ihre Kriegsrhetorik immer weiter hochgeschraubt und damit weltweit Sorgen vor einer militärischen Eskalationen geweckt. Trump brüskierte dabei seinen Außenminister Rex Tillerson, der sich ebenfalls für Verhandlungen mit dem kommunistischen Staat aussprach, was Trump als Zeitverschwendung abtat.

TRUMP ERNEUERT DROHUNG EINES MILITÄRSCHLAGS

Er hoffe bei Gott, dass die USA gegenüber Nordkorea nicht von ihrer militärischen Macht Gebrauch machen müssten, erklärte Trump in Seoul. Er sei entschlossen, alles zu tun, um den “nordkoreanischen Diktator” zu stoppen. Trump kündigte weitere Manöver in der Region an und besuchte mit seiner Frau Melania auch Camp Humphreys, den größten US-Militärstützpunkt in Südkorea. Zwischen Nord- und Südkorea gibt es keinen Friedensvertrag, da der Korea-Krieg 1953 nur mit einem Waffenstillstand endete. Beide Seiten haben Tausende Raketen aufeinander gerichtet, die USA knapp 30.000 Soldaten im Süden stationiert.

The Internet is already partly censored in Indonesia, but the latest steps mark an escalation against a background of growing conservatism in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation.

“We will call all providers, including Google to clean up their network,” said Semuel Pangerapan, a director general at Indonesia’s communication and informatics ministry.

Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ministry vowed on Monday to block Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) WhatsApp Messenger within 48 hours if the service did not ensure that obscene Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images were removed.

WhatsApp said on Monday that message encryption prevented it from monitoring the animated graphics files, known as GIFs, that are available on the app through third-party services.

It said it had asked the government instead to work with those providers, which integrate their technology into WhatsApp to allow users to enter keywords to search for GIFs.

Tenor Inc, one of the third parties, said on Tuesday it had “already implemented a fix for the content issues”.

Users of Whatsapp Messenger on iPhones were unable to access Tenor GIFs on Tuesday.

“We see now that they have done what we asked,” Pangerapan said. “Therefore, we won’t block them because they have responded to us.”

WhatsApp Messenger is widely used in Indonesia. Civil servants and ministers, including Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara, are among the heaviest users.

Giphy Inc., a New York City GIFs company that also works with WhatsApp, did not respond to requests for comment. Giphy offers partners a feature to filter inappropriate images.

Indonesia’s warning did not appear to target Gboard, a keyboard app developed by Google that provides comparable GIF search results but must be installed separately from WhatsApp on most devices.

Rudiantara has vowed in the past to clamp down on pornography sites and, after meetings with representatives of Google, Twitter Inc and Facebook in August, he said his ministry’s priority was to protect Indonesians from content that promoted radicalism, terrorism and drugs.

Rudiantara, who uses one name, said however that the government was not trying to foster “a regime of censorship”.

NETIZENS SKEPTICAL

Indonesia blocks access to websites offering criticism of Islam, dating services and sex education, research published in May by Tor Project, a non-profit maker of Web browsing tools, showed.

Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users by the first quarter of 2014, ranking it fourth globally after the United States, India and Brazil, company data showed.

Some reaction on Indonesian social media to the threatened block of WhatsApp was skeptical.

“While you’re at it, why don’t you block Twitter too, (and) if necessary all browsers in the Playstore, because it’s way easier to search for porn there than on WhatsApp,” wrote one Twitter user, with the handle @jnessy.

The country’s regulators have reached settlements with several technology companies after threatening to shut them down. In August, Indonesia announced it would block Giphy’s website for showing gambling-related ads. Access was soon restored after it agreed to cooperate with regulators.

Bans were similarly rescinded in recent years on social media websites, such as Tumblr, and the chat app Telegram, which regulators had said was “full of radicals and terrorist propaganda.”

The Indonesian Consumers Foundation (YLKI) had urged the communications ministry to block pornographic GIF images accessible via emoticons, complaining that children could easily reach them, according to news website kompas.com. Terms of use for WhatsApp, Tenor and Giphy specify users must be at least 13.","After WhatsApp threat, Indonesia steps up Internet obscenity purge",https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-internet/after-whatsapp-threat-indonesia-steps-up-internet-obscenity-purge-idINKBN1D70DS

He will combine the roles of Barry Eccleston, the unit’s chief executive who plans to retire next February, and Allan McArtor, its chairman who will maintain an honorary role.

Knittel joins Airbus at a time when it faces an ongoing trade dispute with Boeing over mutual accusations of unfair subsidies, while inheriting a trade row between Canada and the United States after agreeing last month to buy the CSeries jet program from Bombardier, which Boeing has accused of dumping.

Airbus operates an assembly line in Alabama and says it employs 5,000 people in the United States.

The decision to recruit another outsider to replace former Rolls-Royce executive Eccleston reflects efforts to inject new blood after Boeing hired a senior engine maker to run its commercial unit, while Latin American head Rafael Alonso is also said to be approaching retirement within the next year.

Candidates include the head of turboprop maker ATR, Christian Scherer, and the search may extend to the senior ranks of Rolls-Royce (RR.L), people familiar with the process say.

Another former head of a large leasing company, Henri Courpron, was reported to be among the possible contenders for the sales supremo role but told Reuters he had decided to stay focused on his U.S.-based consultancy firm, Plane View Partners.",Former CIT air leasing boss to run Airbus Americas,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-appointment/former-cit-air-leasing-boss-to-run-airbus-americas-idUSKBN1D7241?il=0

New Jersey voters are picking a new governor, to succeed outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several big cities are selecting mayors, and conservative Utah is holding a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended.

In Virginia, opinion polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor’s race that will offer clues about the U.S. political mood.

Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but has embraced the president’s combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

The ads put Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in polls in recent weeks in the Southern state, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points in last year’s presidential race.

“The momentum is clearly on our side,” Gillespie told Fox News on Monday.

Gillespie, however, has not won over Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and lives in Democratic-leaning Arlington. Peacemaker considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s nomination last year. Clinton won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington County, the most densely populated part of Virginia, nestled against the border of Washington, D.C.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” Peacemaker, who voted for Clinton, said on Tuesday

Trump’s influence on the race is significant even though the president was not highly engaged until the campaign’s final days, Peacemaker said. After winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies, Peacemaker added.

ANOTHER SETBACK FOR DEMOCRATS?

A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who lost four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.

Democrats fear such a victory would give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

“Gillespie’s ads played on every fear and dark impulse, and if we lose, we are going to see a lot more of that,” Democratic strategist Dane Strother said.

Gillespie rejected that characterization and said he was gaining ground against Northam because of his substantive policies and plans to bolster Virginia’s economy. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but never campaigned for him, backed that view on Monday.

“The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!” he wrote on Twitter.

In response, Northam tweeted that voting for him was “the best way to refute Trump’s lies.” The Virginia economy had an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in September, better than all but 13 states and below the national rate of just over 4 percent.

Trump’s argument resonated with Lee Hernandez, who works in finance and voted for Gillespie because he found the Republican’s message on economic improvement more persuasive.

Hernandez, a swing voter who also lives in Arlington, said he was bothered by Northam’s emphasis on “keeping Virginia blue (Democratic) or making it blue, and that really was a big turnoff.”

Gillespie’s campaign has blasted an ad aired by an outside pro-Northam group - quickly taken down - that showed a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie sticker chasing down minority children.

In the governor’s race in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead in polls over Republican Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor, who has been hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

In local races, Democratic Mayors Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston are expected to cruise to re-election, while Detroit, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina; and Seattle also will pick mayors.

It is a debate that is echoing across the United States as security experts and some politicians ask churches to consider a wide range of enhanced measures to thwart tragedies like Sunday’s deadly rampage at the First Baptist Church.

Barbara Burdette, who knew the 26 people killed in the massacre and as well as the 20 wounded, is ready to see her church hire armed security, or allow congregants to carry their own concealed firearms for self-defense.

“God is our protector,” said Burdette, 62, “but I do still think that we need to have people with conceal carry.”

Her pastor at the First Baptist Church of La Vernia, a one-story brick sanctuary 7 miles from the shooting scene, said the issue of guns in church requires a delicate balance between providing safety instead of fear.

Arming parishioners is not the only option. At the historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, where a white gunman killed nine at a June 2015 bible study session, uniformed police officers now attend regular worship services.

“It’s part of our new normal,” said Reverend Eric Manning at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, by phone. He said the church also created in-house security, as have most black churches in the region.

Muslim and Jewish institutions for years have added security measures to address the threat of violence and hate crimes. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) stresses the importance of security cameras, strong doors and clearing brush away from buildings so attackers have no place to hide.

A law enforcement vehicle prominently parked in front of a house of worship is also a strong deterrent to crime, said Claude Pichard, director of Training Force USA, which worked with churches across the country to improve security after the Charleston shooting.

The question of enabling, or even encouraging, parishioners to shoot back is a discussion particularly important to communities where guns are a part of life, such as rural Texas.

In Sutherland Springs, the shooter was confronted as he left the church by a resident who shot and wounded him.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News that churches should consider whether they wanted parishioners to be armed as a way of preventing another tragedy.

His state allows for the concealed carrying of handguns by licensed owners. It is not clear exactly how First Baptist Church, where the shooting occurred, addressed gun issues.

A sheriff in Williamson County, Texas, a two-hour drive from the massacre, expects to discuss arming parishioners at a church security summit he is organizing in the wake of the attack. He said churches have a responsibility to ensure that responding officers can distinguish a protector from the assailant.

“What are you doing to make sure we don’t have a friendly on friendly fire?” said Sheriff Robert Chody by phone.

New Life Church, a congregation of 10,000 people in Colorado Springs, Colorado, requires churchgoers to leave their guns in their vehicles, a decade after it was the scene of a deadly shooting that killed two. A parishioner trained in church security used a firearm to wound the shooter, preventing greater carnage, said pastor Brady Boyd.

“Pastors are now waking up to this reality that we are not living in Mayberry anymore,” he said, referring to the fictitious North Carolina hometown on the “Andy Griffith Show,” a long-running 1960s television comedy.

He pointed out that no church could have security in place to withstand an attack by a military-trained shooter using an assault rifle, the scenario that unfolded this weekend in Texas.

About 10 miles from the shooting, Floresville Christian Fellowship Pastor Bennie Herrera said he needed to re-examine security but knows there is only so much that can be done.

“We will not be gripped by fear,” he said. “Faith will rise up and we will come together,” he said.",Fear and faith: Church security scrutinized after Texas massacre,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooting-security/fear-and-faith-church-security-scrutinized-after-texas-massacre-idUSKBN1D71JQ

Mnangagwa’s removal provides a boost for Mugabe’s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.

“The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,” Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.

“It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.”

Mnangagwa’s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.

Grace, 52, nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a “coup plotter” and a “coward” on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time.

The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war.

Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations.

FALLEN PROTEGE

The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation.

Mnangagwa was Mugabe’s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men.

FILE PHOTO: President Robert Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe looks on during a national church interface rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 5, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo

By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980.

However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence.

Mnangagwa’s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF.

Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa’s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes.

That Mnangagwa’s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship.

Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition.

>> The Republican tax cut is supposed to be used to spur investments and jobs, but some investors are saying that some of that money may be used instead to reward shareholders. I'm David Randall, a reporter at Reuters, and I've been speaking with fund managers over the last week over what they think companies will do with their tax savings.

Many of them are saying that they see companies buying back their own shares as a way to boost their stock prices. Among the companies they're talking about is Microsoft, which has over 15% of its market value in cash held overseas. One fund manager said that, if a tax bill does pass, some of that money will be returned to the U.S. and given to shareholders.

He called it almost like a cherry on top of a sundae. It's not only the big companies. Fund managers say that they're buying shares of companies ranging from Michael Kors, to Southwest Airlines to Texas Instruments, because they think that companies will use this money to reward shareholders with either special dividends or buyback programs.

Fund managers say that buybacks are one of the best things companies can do with their cash. One reason is that they know exactly what they're buying when they're buying their own shares. And it helps give at least a short-term boost to the share price, because it eliminates the number of shares outstanding.

But buybacks aren't a cure-all. By giving money directly back to shareholders, companies aren't always preparing for the future. Whether that means investing in a new plant, or buying a competitor, or adding new people to their workforce.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

Delfin Lorenzana said a contractor was building a beach ramp on Thitu Island, locally known as Pag-asa (hope), the largest of nine features the Philippines holds in the Spratly islands.

“While construction is ongoing, albeit intermittently, depending on good weather, we expect its completion by early 2018,” Lorenzana said, adding the monsoon rains have been hampering the building of the beach ramp.

“No construction can proceed without a good beaching ramp.”

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the waterway where more than $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year.

Recent satellite imagery has shown Chinese vessels gathering around Thitu, in what some experts say could be an attempt to deter the Philippines from cementing its claim. China’s ambassador has played that down, insisting his country has no ill intent.

The two countries have long been at odds over the South China Sea, although ties have warmed substantially under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who says it is smarter to do business with China than pick a fight with its far superior military.

Lorenzana said the ramp was important to allow large naval ships to deliver construction materials to repair and upgrade the island’s airfield, fix structures and build a new port for fishermen.

A small community lives on Thitu, ostensibly to prop up the country’s claim, although conditions are basic compared to those enjoyed by Vietnamese and Chinese on other islands in the Spratly chain.

Defense department spokesman Arsenio Andolong said the government would spend more than 1.3 billion pesos ($25.3 million) for the upgrades on Thitu.

The military has defended the work, saying almost of all South China Sea claimants have been doing the same.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will host Trump in Beijing on Wednesday, with North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons expected to top their agenda. The United States has been pressuring China to do more to rein in its neighbor and ally.

Tourism is one of the few remaining ways North Korea earns hard currency, as the United Nations has ramped up sanctions on the country over the past year, curbing key export industries including coal, seafood and textiles.

“It was very unexpected, we had no idea this was going to happen until we received the notification today,” said a Chinese tour operator who runs trips to North Korea out of Dandong.

“This is devastating news for us,” he said, adding the order had come from the Dandong Tourism Bureau.

The sources Reuters interviewed for this story all requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

The Dandong Tourism Bureau was not immediately reachable for comment late on Tuesday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after working hours on Tuesday night.

Most tour companies that take Chinese tourists to North Korea are based in Dandong, the main trading hub on the Chinese side of the border.

Dandong-based tour companies were told on Tuesday that, as of Wednesday, they were only permitted to run one-day tours to Sinuiju, the North Korean city opposite Dandong, which is a popular destination for Chinese tourists making day trips.

Longer trips to Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea were banned until further notice, the sources said. Many Chinese tour operators run three-day or longer tours inside the world’s most isolated country.

The sources said the government had not given any official explanation for the changes.

“It’s low season right now, but that’s unlikely to be the reason,” said another Dandong-based tourism source.

“It’s much more likely to be connected to increasing sanctions against North Korea. We’ll have to wait and see what happens once Trump leaves China. Maybe they will loosen the rules but it’s very hard to say. This is all connected to the growing tensions.”

Earlier this year, the United States banned its citizens from visiting North Korea after American college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after returning to the United States in a coma following more than a year in captivity in North Korea. He had been detained during a tour there.

The Korea Maritime Institute, a think-tank in the South, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea. About 80 percent of all North Korea’s foreign tourists are Chinese, it says.

China said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012, but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013.

The order does not appear to affect North Korea-focused tour operators based elsewhere.

“We didn’t receive any notice to halt trips to North Korea,” said Rubio Chan of GLO Travel, a Hong Kong-based tour company which takes tourists to North Korea.

“But that may be because we are based out of Hong Kong and we work directly with our partners in Pyongyang.”",Exclusive: China curbs tourism to North Korea ahead of Trump visit - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D723Q

Investors are also waiting for more clarity on President Donald Trump’s tax-cut plan as the earnings season winds down.

Republicans plan to bring their tax overhaul bill for a vote next week, U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said on Tuesday, adding that he expects the plan to pass.

House Republicans last week unveiled a first draft that proposed a range of cuts aimed at helping businesses, including slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.

“The market is waiting for the next catalyst, which is the tax bill,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments.

“It looks like, unless some major unforeseen event occurs, tax cuts will get passed in some shape or form. Whether (corporate tax cuts) it’s 20 percent or 25 percent, a big tax cut is coming.”

The S&P has risen about 15 percent in 2017 on the back on strong earnings, an improving economy and Trump’s promise to cut taxes.

With more than 400 of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings for the third quarter are expected to have climbed 8 percent, compared with expectations of a 5.9 percent rise at the start of October, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

At 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.3 points, or 0.06 percent, at 23,533.12, the S&P 500 was down 0.55 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,590.58.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 18.77 points, or 0.28 percent, at 6,767.67.

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the financial index’s 0.42 percent loss leading the decliners.

Investors will also lend an ear to a speech from outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at a presentation of the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government in Washington at 2:30 p.m. ET.

He also indicated that he might take the war to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which controls more than a quarter of Syria, by saying the war targeted those who seek to “divide and weaken states”.

His comments came after a meeting with Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign policy adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“The victories against terrorist organizations, starting in Aleppo and not ending in Deir al-Zor, formed a critical strike that foiled partition projects and terrorist goals,” Assad’s office quoted him as saying.

The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, is also battling IS militants in Deir al-Zor. Backed by U.S.-led air strikes and special forces, the SDF has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province.

Velayati on Friday said Syrian army forces would soon advance to take Raqqa city from the SDF and accused the United States of seeking to divide Syria by stationing its forces east of the Euphrates.

“We will witness in the near future the advance of government and popular forces in Syria and east of the Euphrates, and the liberation of Raqqa city,” he said in televised comments on a visit to Beirut.

Turkey also supports rebel groups in a pocket in northern Syria, wedged between Kurdish-controlled areas. Last month, its army began setting up observation points in Idlib province in northwest Syria under a deal with Russia and Iran.

De Blasio had the support of 61 percent of likely voters in the most recent Quinnipiac University poll in the race, released last month, more than triple the 17 percent of respondents who backed Malliotakis, of the city’s Staten Island borough.

Last week’s truck attack, in which an Uzbek man inspired by the Islamic State killed eight people and injured 12 on a bike lane, likely had little impact on voter preference in the heavily Democratic city, said Douglas Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College.

“He’s going to win big,” Muzzio said.

A progressive liberal, de Blasio in the past week campaigned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who backed de Blasio’s call for a state tax hike on people making more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in Albany.

De Blasio’s chances are helped by strong disapproval in New York for U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican businessman and real estate developer whose deals and personal life commanded the front page of the city’s tabloid newspapers long before he garnered greater national fame for his starring role in the reality television show “The Apprentice.”

Slideshow (6 Images)

Some 78 percent of respondents to the Quinnipiac poll disapproved of the way Trump is doing his job, with just 18 percent approving. De Blasio had a 58 percent favorability rating in the poll of 731 likely voters performed Sept. 27-Oct. 4, which had a 4.7 percentage point margin of error.

De Blasio has taken heat for increasing service disruptions and delays on the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the United States, though he has taken pains to emphasize that the subway is run by a state-controlled authority, not the city.

Malliotakis in recent weeks has criticized de Blasio over testimony from a former donor to the mayor in a federal corruption trial involving a union boss. The donor, Jona Rechnitz, told jurors he established a direct line to City Hall after raising money for the mayor’s campaign in 2013.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency.

One of the first changes agreed to on Monday, related to carried interest, would go toward fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.

Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax-writing panel, offered to make smaller portions of Wall Street financiers’ income eligible for a lower capital gains tax rate.

It was one of many revisions that are expected as the House Ways and Means Committee amends the tax bill. Brady pledged to lawmakers that they would have a chance to propose their own changes. “Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process,” he told the committee.

Although Republicans generally support the bill’s broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments.

New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump’s plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector.

“There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill,” Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill.

An analysis of how taxpayers would be impacted by the bill from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center issued on Monday was later withdrawn due to an error. TPC said that its analysis contained an error related to a proposed child tax credit and that it would release a revised version as soon as possible.

The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.

The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent.

With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.

Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it.

Brady’s carried interest provision would lengthen to more than three years from one the amount of time Wall Street financiers must hold assets in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate.

Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits – typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors – that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds.

Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.

MARKET RALLY ON EXPECTATIONS

Securing congressional passage of the tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year.

Investors are adding to the pressure. The expectation of deep tax cuts has helped fuel a stock market rally during Trump's time as president, with the broad S&P 500 index .SPX up about 14 percent.

The Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority, is developing its own version of the tax legislation, which would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to Trump for signing.

Several Republican senators have said they would have a problem voting for any tax bill that significantly increased the deficit. The House bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.

Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the House bill could add to the fiscal strain in some states and local jurisdictions by limiting their tax-raising flexibility.

Republican leaders are pushing for the House to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. They have said a draft Senate bill could be ready at the end of this week.

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Ela disse que a cooperação têm de ocorrer para que a política de leniência seja respeitada internacionalmente sob pena de o instituto ser desqualificado.

Atualmente, participam da leniência o Ministério da Transparência e CGU, o Ministério Público Federal e o Tribunal de Contas da União, além da própria AGU.

Na mesma linha da entrevista dada à Reuters em setembro, Grace disse que a relação com o MPF, hoje comandado por Raquel Dodge, está sendo estreitado “bastante” nos últimos meses. Havia queixas da relação mantida durante a gestão de Rodrigo Janot à frente da Procuradoria-Geral da República.

Para a ministra, não há como avançar na segurança jurídica do instituto sem haver diálogo entre os órgãos, o que deve ser uma premissa.

O presidente do TCU, Raimundo Carreiro, defendeu uma maior cooperação. “Quanto mais você abrir o leque de discussões, melhor decisões sairão”, disse.

Em rápida entrevista na saída da abertura do evento, Carreiro disse que a relação com a gestão de Janot foi “normal” e destacou o bom relacionamento no trato da leniência com a equipe do MPF de Curitiba.

ACORDOS

Também em entrevista, a chefe da AGU afirmou que o órgão que comanda e o Ministério da Transparência e Controladoria Geral da União (CGU) assinaram um novo acordo de leniência. Ela disse que não podia dar detalhes do acordo porque, embora assinado, está sob sigilo por estar em fase de finalização.

Até o momento, sabia-se da assinatura do acordo da UTC, investigada na Lava Jato, e da Bilfinger e da SBM, sendo que esse último fora suspenso por decisão da Câmara de Combate à Corrupção do MPF.

O presidente do TCU mencionou que a corte acompanha no momento 25 acordos de leniência.

Dados da CGU divulgados no seminário pelo consultor jurídico do órgão Renato Lima França, contudo, citam ao todo 22 propostas. Constam dois acordos assinados (sem considerar o da SBM), 14 com negociações em andamento e seis empresas tiveram as negociações encerradas.","TCU pode cobrar reparação adicional de empresas em leniência se constatar novas irregularidades, diz Grace",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1D727P-OBRTP

The move, if implemented, would form a key part of China’s pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs and would allow banks including Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and UBS (UBSG.S) to bolster their presence in securities business – from underwriting to trading - in the world’s second-largest economy.

Currently, Western banks can only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities joint ventures. That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration.

The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that hobble foreign firms from operating in its markets.

China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) officials have informally allowed some foreign banks to work on their onshore strategies with the planned easing of equity holding restrictions in mind, two of the people said.

The details of the plan to give majority control to foreign banks are expected to be finalised and announced once approved by the state council, they said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

News of Beijing’s possible easing of ownership restrictions in the securities sector comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is set to visit China as part of his five-nation Asia trip.

Trump’s visit to China, which starts on Wednesday, comes amid frustration in parts of the U.S. business community, including finance, over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions in various sectors.

The CSRC, which has been encouraging foreign investment in its bond and stock markets as part of broader efforts to deregulate capital markets, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.

“We continue to evaluate viable options to strengthen our position in China in order to better serve our clients,” said a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, which in December sold its 33 percent holding in a China securities venture to its local partner.

JPMorgan, whose other financial services in China include corporate banking and asset management, is in talks to set up a new partnership in China, people with knowledge of the matter have previously told Reuters.

Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and UBS declined to comment.

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS

It is still possible the proposal could be altered or even shelved following feedback from senior government officials, one of the people said, adding the regulator could also take a bank-specific approach in deciding on the ownership issue.

Despite the current ownership curbs, most global banks have waited patiently for the sector to open up more - given its potential. Brokerage revenues in China reached a high of $41 billion in 2015, according to a report by Quinlan & Associates.

Assuming institutional broking revenue is 10-15 percent of the total, a 1 percent market share would produce up to $60 million in annual revenue for an equities house, the financial sector consultancy noted.

Any lifting of the cap on foreign stakes beyond 49 percent would allow Western banks to buy more shares from their partners in existing ventures or enter into new partnerships, the people said.

Management control would allow foreign banks to offer more services through their joint ventures and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share.

Separately, allowing non-financial Chinese firms, including government entities, to enter into partnerships with foreign banks would help Western firms to better control the business, industry insiders said.

So far, Beijing has allowed only HSBC (HSBA.L) to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture in China, taking advantage of Chinese rules that favor Hong Kong-established banks over their foreign peers.

In January, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) became the first foreign bank to receive China securities regulator’s approval to boost its stake in its securities venture to 49 percent, up from a third.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will host Trump in Beijing on Wednesday, with North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons expected to top their agenda. The United States has been pressuring China to do more to rein in its neighbor and ally.

Tourism is one of the few remaining ways North Korea earns hard currency, as the United Nations has ramped up sanctions on the country over the past year, curbing key export industries including coal, seafood and textiles.

“It was very unexpected, we had no idea this was going to happen until we received the notification today,” said a Chinese tour operator who runs trips to North Korea out of Dandong.

“This is devastating news for us,” he said, adding the order had come from the Dandong Tourism Bureau.

The sources Reuters interviewed for this story all requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

The Dandong Tourism Bureau was not immediately reachable for comment late on Tuesday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after working hours on Tuesday night.

Most tour companies that take Chinese tourists to North Korea are based in Dandong, the main trading hub on the Chinese side of the border.

Dandong-based tour companies were told on Tuesday that, as of Wednesday, they were only permitted to run one-day tours to Sinuiju, the North Korean city opposite Dandong, which is a popular destination for Chinese tourists making day trips.

Longer trips to Pyongyang and other parts of North Korea were banned until further notice, the sources said. Many Chinese tour operators run three-day or longer tours inside the world’s most isolated country.

The sources said the government had not given any official explanation for the changes.

“It’s low season right now, but that’s unlikely to be the reason,” said another Dandong-based tourism source.

“It’s much more likely to be connected to increasing sanctions against North Korea. We’ll have to wait and see what happens once Trump leaves China. Maybe they will loosen the rules but it’s very hard to say. This is all connected to the growing tensions.”

Earlier this year, the United States banned its citizens from visiting North Korea after American college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after returning to the United States in a coma following more than a year in captivity in North Korea. He had been detained during a tour there.

The Korea Maritime Institute, a think-tank in the South, estimates that tourism generates about $44 million in annual revenue for North Korea. About 80 percent of all North Korea’s foreign tourists are Chinese, it says.

China said more than 237,000 Chinese visited in 2012, but it stopped publishing the statistics in 2013.

The order does not appear to affect North Korea-focused tour operators based elsewhere.

“We didn’t receive any notice to halt trips to North Korea,” said Rubio Chan of GLO Travel, a Hong Kong-based tour company which takes tourists to North Korea.

The French source said the raid was carried “on the basis of detailed intelligence against a camp that included Malians who had joined the Islamist ranks. They were hit, amongst others.”

U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been “milking” Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power.

Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world’s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.

“Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it’s corruption that delays society’s development,” Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.

“God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,” said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see “correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.”

But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centred around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself.

Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom’s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts.

Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said.

INVESTOR NERVES

The Saudi stock index .TASI sank 0.7 percent in heavy trade, led by shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation.

The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent.

Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.

In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index losing 2.8 percent.

The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry.

Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired towards Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis.

A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen’s internationally-recognised government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.

“He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalised system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterised the Saudi system of governance,” wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.

“In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.”

PIVOTAL POWER BASE

Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne.

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began.

The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.

“This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,” he said.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard’s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash. “I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,” he said.

But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.

“There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,” said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.

“Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.”","Saudi mass arrests jolt markets, play to ire over corruption",https://in.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests/saudi-mass-arrests-jolt-markets-play-to-ire-over-corruption-idINKBN1D724C

“Gegenwärtig ist das wichtigste Thema hier, die faulen Kredite anzugehen”, sagte Draghi am Dienstag auf einer Konferenz zur Bankenregulierung in Frankfurt. Obgleich sich die Bestände an notleidenden Darlehen bei großen Geldhäusern verringert hätten, sei das Problem noch nicht gelöst. Viele Banken seien immer noch nicht in der Lage, große Verluste zu verkraften. Bei ihnen sei unter anderem das Verhältnis von faulen Krediten zum Kapital hoch.

Geldhäuser im Währungsraum schleppen als Hinterlassenschaft der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise immer noch 844 Milliarden Euro an faulen Krediten mit sich. Damit nimmt ihre Bereitschaft zur Ausgabe neuer Kredite tendenziell ab, was das Wachstum der Wirtschaft potenziell dämpft. Regulatoren, Aufseher, Banken und nationale Behörden müssten gemeinsam das Problem geordnet angehen, forderte Draghi. Vor allem müsse ein Umfeld geschaffen werden, in dem Problemkredite wirksam abgebaut werden können.

Die EZB-Bankenaufsicht hatte unlängst Richtlinien zum künftigen Umgang mit neuen Problemdarlehen vorgestellt. Insbesondere in Italien hatte dies Kritik ausgelöst. Dort wird befürchtet, dass heimische Banken zu stark belastet und damit das Wirtschaftswachstum gebremst werden könnte. Zudem besteht die Sorge, dass ähnliche Vorgaben künftig auch für den Altbestand an faulen Darlehen aufgestellt werden. Auf italienische Banken entfallen rund ein Viertel aller Problemkredite von Geldhäusern in der Euro-Zone. Notenbank-Insider hielten es zuletzt für möglich, dass wegen der Kritik künftige Richtlinien für den Umgang mit dem Altbestand eher milde ausfallen könnten.

Für den Bestand seien die Situationen sehr unterschiedlich, sagte die oberste EZB-Bankenkontrolleurin, Daniele Nouy, auf der Konferenz. Bewertungen und Lösungen würden daher nur für den Einzelfall Anwendung finden. “Wir arbeiten mit allen Banken, die zu hohe Bestände an notleidenden Krediten aufweisen.” Diese würden der Aufsicht eigene Abbaupläne vorlegen und die EZB stelle sicher, dass diese glaubwürdig und ambitioniert genug seien. “Und um glaubwürdig zu sein müssen sie realistisch sein, sie können uns keine Wunder versprechen.” Ihr EZB-Kollege, Bankenaufseher Ignazio Angeloni, hatte jüngst gesagt, es sei noch offen, ob die Vorgaben künftig auch für den Altbestand gelten sollen.

First to use the service will be those who are already part of the company’s public trial already underway in Phoenix.

The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars.

“Because we see so much potential in shared mobility, the first way people will get to experience Waymo’s fully self-driving technology will be as a driverless service,” Krafcik said in prepared remarks.

With over eight years of testing under its belt, Waymo is a pioneer of self-driving technology and has tested its system in six states, the latest being Michigan.

General Motors Co - which acquired autonomous driving start-up Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion last year - has signaled its intent to test a robotaxi service in the near future.

In January, Krafcik unveiled a suite of self-driving hardware developed in-house by Waymo, including an enhanced vision system, improved radar and laser-based lidar.

At the time, he said Waymo was exploring many applications for its technology, including ride-sharing, personal use vehicles, transportation, trucking and logistics. Last week, U.S. auto retailer AutoNation Inc announced a multiyear partnership for vehicle maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s self-driving car operations.",Waymo launching ride-hailing service in Phoenix with no human behind wheel,https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-selfdriving/waymo-launching-ride-hailing-service-in-phoenix-with-no-human-behind-wheel-idINKBN1D72CR?il=0

It is estimated that seven million people are facing famine there.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country to stem the flow of arms from Iran.

The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh.

The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden, to discuss the humanitarian situation in Yemen, diplomats said in New York.

“We call for all air and sea ports to remain open to ensure food, fuel and medicines can enter the country,” Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs said in Geneva.

He said humanitarian operations are currently “blocked” because air and sea ports in Yemen are closed,

The Saudi-led coalition has told the world body to “inform all commercial vessels at Hodeidah and Saleef ports to leave”, Laerke said, referring to Red Sea ports controlled by the Houthis.

The price of fuel jumped 60 percent “overnight” in Yemen and the price of cooking gas doubled, he said. “This is an access problem of colossal dimensions right now.”

SUPPLY LINES

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the call.

“Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year,” Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement.

The ICRC said that a shipment of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera did not get clearance at Yemen’s northern border. It voiced fears for 50,000 vials of insulin for diabetics due to be delivered by next week, which require constant refrigeration.

ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said that a ship carrying 500 metric tonnes of rice, which arrived in Hodeidah port in October after a three-month trip from Pakistan, had to leave the port last week without offloading because the ship’s crane had broken.

The port itself lacks adequate cranes after repeated coalition bombing.

Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, said it would study whether the blockade amounted to “collective punishment”, banned under international law, but hoped that it would be temporary.

Attacks in Yemen over the past week that have killed dozens of civilians, including children, at markets and homes, he said.

These included at least nine air strikes on the Houthi-held city of Sanaa since Saturday, when a missile was fired from Yemen toward the Saudi capital of Riyadh, he said.

A cholera epidemic has caused 908,702 suspected cases and 2,194 deaths since the outbreak began in April, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo

The move, if implemented, would form a key part of China’s pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs and would allow banks including Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and UBS (UBSG.S) to bolster their presence in securities business – from underwriting to trading - in the world’s second-largest economy.

Currently, Western banks can only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities joint ventures. That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration.

The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that hobble foreign firms from operating in its markets.

China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) officials have informally allowed some foreign banks to work on their onshore strategies with the planned easing of equity holding restrictions in mind, two of the people said.

The details of the plan to give majority control to foreign banks are expected to be finalised and announced once approved by the state council, they said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

News of Beijing’s possible easing of ownership restrictions in the securities sector comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is set to visit China as part of his five-nation Asia trip.

Trump’s visit to China, which starts on Wednesday, comes amid frustration in parts of the U.S. business community, including finance, over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions in various sectors.

The CSRC, which has been encouraging foreign investment in its bond and stock markets as part of broader efforts to deregulate capital markets, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.

“We continue to evaluate viable options to strengthen our position in China in order to better serve our clients,” said a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, which in December sold its 33 percent holding in a China securities venture to its local partner.

JPMorgan, whose other financial services in China include corporate banking and asset management, is in talks to set up a new partnership in China, people with knowledge of the matter have previously told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks into the JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf in London May 11, 2012. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo

Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and UBS declined to comment.

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS

It is still possible the proposal could be altered or even shelved following feedback from senior government officials, one of the people said, adding the regulator could also take a bank-specific approach in deciding on the ownership issue.

Despite the current ownership curbs, most global banks have waited patiently for the sector to open up more - given its potential. Brokerage revenues in China reached a high of $41 billion in 2015, according to a report by Quinlan & Associates.

Assuming institutional broking revenue is 10-15 percent of the total, a 1 percent market share would produce up to $60 million in annual revenue for an equities house, the financial sector consultancy noted.

Any lifting of the cap on foreign stakes beyond 49 percent would allow Western banks to buy more shares from their partners in existing ventures or enter into new partnerships, the people said.

Management control would allow foreign banks to offer more services through their joint ventures and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share.

Separately, allowing non-financial Chinese firms, including government entities, to enter into partnerships with foreign banks would help Western firms to better control the business, industry insiders said.

So far, Beijing has allowed only HSBC (HSBA.L) to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture in China, taking advantage of Chinese rules that favor Hong Kong-established banks over their foreign peers.

In January, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) became the first foreign bank to receive China securities regulator’s approval to boost its stake in its securities venture to 49 percent, up from a third.

With the three camps still divided on several issues, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) gave some ground, saying they would accept more modest income tax cuts than a campaign pledge of 30-40 billion euros ($35-46 billion) of relief.

The party would focus instead on securing the abolition of the solidarity tax that Germany introduced after reunification in 1990 to support poorer eastern states, and on tax relief for families and smaller businesses, its leader Christian Lindner told reporters.

He was speaking before Tuesday’s round of exploratory coalition talks in parliament.

The ecologist Greens said they would no longer insist on fixed dates to shut down coal-fired power stations and to ban cars with internal combustion engines.

The three-way coalition the parties are trying to form is untested at national level, and the negotiations follow a fracturing of the vote in national elections in September, when Merkel’s conservatives bled support to the far right.

Should the talks stall, Germany would face a lengthy period of uncertainty at a time when many in the European Union are looking to its biggest economy for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to trans-Atlantic relations.

Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term, said on Monday that immigration and climate policy were the most contentious topics in the exploratory talks, which she hoped to advance to full-blown negotiations on Nov. 16.

COMPROMISE

There is broad support among her conservatives - comprising the Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies - for tax reforms.

The CDU/CSU alliance also reached a deal on migrant policy last month.

The main sticking point to a broader deal on that front is a conservative proposal to cap at 200,000 a year the number of migrants Germany would accept on humanitarian grounds. The Greens reject such a limit, which they say is unconstitutional.

Also complicating the path to a coalition deal, negotiators will need to seek approval from their parties before proceeding to full-blown talks.

A crucial test will be a Greens party conference on Nov. 25, when party leaders will seek the blessing of their base.

Signaling a readiness to compromise, Greens co-leader Simone Peter told Rheinische Post newspaper: “For us, it doesn’t matter if the last coal-fired power station is off the grid in 2030 or 2032. That’s where we are pragmatic.”

But it was crucial to agree on further climate protection measures to cut Germany’s CO2 emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, as Merkel had promised.

Greens Co-leader Cem Ozdemir signaled readiness to compromise on car policy after an emissions scandal at Germany’s leading automaker Volkswagen(VOWG_p.DE) plunged the industry into crisis.

“It’s clear to me that we alone cannot enforce the end date of 2030 for the approval of combustion engines,” Ozdemir told Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspapers.","Greens, FDP make concessions in German coalition talks",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D71D9

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

Devin Kelley, o atirador da chacina de domingo realizada em uma igreja no interior do sudeste do Estado norte-americano, foi condenado por uma corte marcial por ter agredido sua primeira mulher e seu enteado quando servia em uma unidade de prontidão logística da Força Aérea dos Estados Unidos em 2012, revelou o Pentágono na segunda-feira.

A Força Aérea também admitiu que falhou por não transmitir informações sobre a condenação de Kelley ao sistema do Centro Nacional de Informações Criminais (NCIC, na sigla em inglês), um banco de dados do governo dos EUA usado por vendedores de armas de fogo licenciadas para verificar antecedentes criminais de compradores em potencial.

O porta-voz do Departamento de Segurança Pública do Texas, Freeman Martin, estimou o número de vítimas fatais do ataque em 26. A idade dos mortos variou de 18 meses a 77 anos.

Vinte outras pessoas ficaram feridas, 10 das quais continuavam em estado grave na noite de segunda-feira, segundo autoridades.

Duas armas de mão foram encontradas no veículo da fuga de Kelley, onde ele morreu devido a ferimentos de bala autoinfligidos na cabeça depois de uma tentativa fracassada de escapar do local do massacre, informou Martin em uma coletiva de imprensa na noite de segunda-feira.

A Força Aérea abriu um inquérito para descobrir como lidou com o antecedente criminal do ex-aviador, e o Departamento de Defesa dos EUA pediu uma revisão de seu inspetor-geral para ter certeza de que outros casos “foram relatados corretamente”, disseram autoridades do Pentágono.

The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected.

Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter.

The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

“I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago,” Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. “We are on it, we’ve got it covered,” but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said.

The Palo Alto, California-based company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called “production bottlenecks.” It had planned to build more than 1,500.

Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company’s cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car.

Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally.

Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 17 percent from a 12-month high of $385 in September, but are still up 50 percent from January fueled by belief in the long-term prospects of the company.

Tesla’s soaring stock has made the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker behind General Motors Co (GM.N), which had annual net profit of $9.4 billion in 2016.

LARGEST-EVER LOSS

Tesla could face major new requirements for cash given Model 3 problems, a possible factory in China, and plans to develop other vehicles, including an electric heavy duty truck.

But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market.

Tesla said it was “well capitalized” for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla’s August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year.

Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter.

The price of the $1.8 billion eight-year junk bond 88160RAE1= issued by Tesla last August also fell after the quarterly report.

Tesla’s continued need for cash is exacerbated by Musk’s insistence on vertical integration, such as making its own batteries and selling cars directly to customers. That, industry experts say, is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its aggressive goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

Tesla warned that its adjusted gross margin would decline to about 15 percent due to a higher mix of lower-margin Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter, but then recover in the first quarter of 2018.

Last month, Tesla reported it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016.","Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-results/tesla-stock-falls-on-model-3-delays-biggest-ever-quarterly-loss-idUSKBN1D15TP

Dutch lawmakers demanded a debate on the secret rulings, which specify individual tax breaks for international companies in the Netherlands. They also called for a full inquiry into all tax arrangements with multinationals after newspapers reported that rules had been broken in the deal with P&G.

“We want a full explanation of the faulty P&G deal”, lawmaker Tom van der Lee said in parliament. “And we want to know if all rulings will now be investigated to see if more errors have occurred.”

The “Paradise Papers”, a trove of leaked documents about offshore investments, shed light on a deal made in 2008, which gave P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Tide laundry detergent, an estimated tax break of $169 million.

It showed the deal was signed off by just one official of the Dutch tax authority, where at least two signatures were required. The agreement also did not pass the special commission for international tax rulings, Dutch newspapers Trouw and Financieele Dagblad reported.

P&G was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. A spokesman for the finance ministry, which oversees the tax authority, declined to comment on the P&G deal or on the consequences of the leak for other tax arrangements.

The European Commission and other international bodies have frequently accused the Netherlands of helping companies to avoid taxes by drawing up thousands of tax arrangements for large corporations.

Details of these arrangements are never disclosed, out of privacy considerations, but the finance ministry has repeatedly said they always comply with strict procedures.

The new Dutch government said last month it would try to make the country less attractive to shell companies that act as a conduit for money destined for tax havens.

But it also promised to lower the corporate tax rate to encourage foreign companies to move their activities to the Netherlands. [L8N1ML3EN]

In 2015 the European Commission ordered the Dutch to reclaim up to 30 million euros ($34.7 million) in back taxes from Starbucks after ruling that the tax arrangement with the U.S. coffee company amounted to illegal state aid. Both Starbucks and the finance ministry have filed an appeal against that ruling.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who issued the record back-tax bill against Apple in August 2016, said she wanted to make sure the company now complies with the bloc’s rules which ban unfair state aid.

“I have been asking for an update on the arrangement made by Apple, the recent way they have been organized, in order to get the feeling whether or not this is in accordance with our European rules but that remains to be seen,” Vestager told a news briefing on the sidelines of an international tech summit in Lisbon.

“We are looking into this of course without any kind of prejudice, just to get the information,” she said.

Vestager said her request preceded reports based on the “Paradise Papers” which showed that Apple shifted key parts of its business to Jersey as an offshore tax haven in a move to maintain a low tax rate. Apple has said no operations were moved from Ireland.

“We have no contact after the Paradise Papers. We are in the process. There is no particular need,” she said.

She also said it was too early to say whether the latest leaks on tax arrangements by companies would lead to any investigation.

With Iranian power winning out in Iraq and Syria, and Riyadh bogged down in a war with Iran-allied groups in Yemen, the new Saudi approach could bring lasting political and economic turmoil to a country where Tehran had appeared ascendant.

The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh and blamed on Iran and Hezbollah, is seen by many as the first step in an unprecedented Saudi intervention in Lebanese politics.

“The Saudis appear to have decided that the best way to confront Iran is to start in Lebanon,” a European diplomat said.

Riyadh is blaming Hezbollah for the resignation of Lebanon’s preeminent Sunni politician, accusing it of “hijacking” Lebanese politics. But Saudi Arabia is also widening blame to Lebanon as a whole, saying it too has declared war on the Kingdom.

A Saudi minister has made the near impossible demand that Lebanese act against a group that is a major part of Lebanon’s political fabric and far more powerful than the weak state, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military.

Coinciding with a major anti-corruption purge of top Saudis, Hariri’s shock announcement has given rise to suggestions from Hezbollah and others that his Saudi business interests had embroiled him in the probe and he was forced to resigning.

Saudi Arabia and Hariri’s allies deny that, and assertions that Hariri is under house arrest. They say his hand was forced by Hezbollah interventions in Arab countries in service of Iran.

POWER VACUUM

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Hezbollah had been “calling the shots” in the Hariri government, which included two Hezbollah ministers and was formed last year in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, head of state.

Hezbollah and its allies will struggle to form a government without Hariri or his blessing, leaving Lebanon in a protracted crisis that could eventually stir Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions, though there is no sign of this yet as all sides urge calm.

Announcing his resignation, Hariri cited an assassination plot against him and slammed Iran and Hezbollah for sowing strife and trying to “kidnap” Lebanon away from the Arab world. The declaration came as a surprise even to Hariri’s aides.

It is not clear what comes next: Saudi-backed efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon failed badly a decade ago, ending with a bout of Sunni-Shi‘ite fighting on the streets of Beirut that only underlined Hezbollah’s military dominance.

The regional struggle moved elsewhere in recent years, notably neighboring Syria where years of Saudi investment in rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad failed to withstand direct military intervention by Iran and Hezbollah.

In Iraq, Tehran-backed militias and Iranian commanders have often seemed as powerful as the U.S.-backed Iraqi military, most recently in an operation to retake Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.

So emboldened was Iran that top Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati trumpeted his regional alliance’s success from Beirut last Friday, declaring victories in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His statement to the media after a meeting with Hariri was seen as a major provocation to regional Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia.

Hariri left for Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards, cancelling previously scheduled engagements and catching even his closest advisors off guard the next day with a declaration first broadcast by Saudi-owned media.

The regional standoff flared in the Gulf hours later, with Iran-allied groups firing a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen. Saudi Arabia says it was launched by Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has not responded to the accusation.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government responded on Tuesday to the Saudi accusation, voiced by Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war.

“The Lebanese government will be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia, and all Lebanese must realize these dangers and work to resolve the issues before we reach the point of no return,” he said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.

Crown Prince Mohammed told Reuters last month the war in Yemen would continue to prevent the Iran-allied Houthi movement from becoming another Hezbollah at Saudi’s border.

SANCTIONS CALL

Hezbollah was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli troops in Lebanon. Its last major war with Israel was in 2006, since when Hezbollah has grown stronger.

While Sabhan vowed that Hezbollah would be forced back into “its caves” in southern Lebanon, any Saudi military action in Lebanon - such as air strikes - would come as a major surprise.

Political paralysis and tension is however a big threat to an already stagnant economy, and could derail next year’s parliamentary elections - Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Policymakers have scrambled to calm concern over the financial stability of the heavily indebted state. They say the Lebanese pound - pegged against the dollar at the same rate for 20 years - is stable.

Hariri was spearheading efforts to garner international aid to help Lebanon deal with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of the population.

Leaders on all sides say there should be no further escalation. Both Hezbollah and Hariri’s Future Movement have worked to contain Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions during the war in neighboring Syria.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for calm and patience in the face of Hariri’s resignation. Okab Sakr, a member of Hariri’s Future Movement, noted that protests in solidarity with Hariri had been canceled to avoid trouble.

Sabhan, the Saudi minister, has called for “real sanctions” and alliances “to find a fundamental solution to this cancerous disease”, saying Hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of government.

Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, led years of political struggle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. But his Saudi-backed “March 14” coalition failed to make any progress toward Hezbollah’s disarmament as demanded by U.N. resolutions.

Echoing the Saudi position, the United States has also taken new measures targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump takes a tougher stance toward Iran.

It has offered a bounty for two Hezbollah officials, and the House of Representatives has backed new sanctions targeting entities found to support it.",Saudi reopens Lebanon front in struggle with Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-hariri-analysis/saudi-reopens-lebanon-front-in-struggle-with-iran-idUKKBN1D72B7

Lord Cromwell, co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, said the American system of compensating whistleblowers should be looked at given the financial hardship that people who speak face.

“What actually happens to whistleblowers in our system is they become unemployable, they have their lives trashed, and they are heavily persecuted in the most intimidatory way,” Cromwell told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference on conduct in banking.

“In America, if you are a genuine whistleblower and an eyewatering fine is imposed on the institution, you get a share of that - and you are going to need it.”

“You pay for vermin control, so why do you expect people to do the right thing for nothing and then have their lives destroyed,” Cromwell said.

Tougher whistleblowing rules was introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis, but they stop short of offering financial rewards. The all-party group will now hold meetings to look at how whistleblowing is working.

The industry is also waiting to see how the Financial Conduct Authority deals with attempts by Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays (BARC.L) bank, to unmask a whistleblower’s identity.

Norman Blackwell, chairman of Lloyds (LLOY.L) bank, told the City & Financial conference there should be the option of speaking out anonymously, and a crackdown on penalising anyone for speaking out publicly.

Robert Francis, a barrister who led a government review into whistleblowing in Britain’s public healthcare system, said a “re-employment” scheme for staff who often face job loss if they turn to employment tribunals, would be better than a financial reward.

“The law isn’t hitting the target,” Francis said.

Anthony Belchambers, chairman of Saxo Capital Markets, said that a decade after the crisis began, the industry was “shamefully slow” in improving conduct.

There was a risk that a “morass” of new codes could become a “bit of a mess” and not be enforced properly, Belchambers said.",Banking whistleblowers being gagged and hunted down - Lord Cromwell,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-banks-regulation/banking-whistleblowers-being-gagged-and-hunted-down-lord-cromwell-idUKKBN1D71Y9

ICICI Pru Life’s Chief Investment Officer, Manish Kumar, said he kept buying telecoms shares this year even as a bruising price war and plunging profits forced several other investors to cut their exposure to the sector.

Kumar’s investment was unorthodox as insurers’ exposure limits give them little elbow room to experiment with significant changes in asset allocation, which means their shifts in positioning are generally very modest.

“I don’t think we have taken as strong a contrarian bet in any of the sectors,” Kumar told Reuters.

India’s telecoms companies have been hurting all year as Reliance Jio - the mobile market’s newest entrant backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani - rolled out freebies and slashed costs for data plans.

Analysts say Jio’s surprise decision to raise tariffs last month signals an end to the competitive price-cutting war. As a result, shares in top mobile carrier Bharti Airtel are near their highest levels in a decade, while those of IDEA Cellular are near eight-month highs.

ICICI Pru Life, whose assets under management grew about 16 percent in that period and now total 1.3 trillion rupees ($20 billion), increased its exposure to the telecom sector by 80 basis points to 7.3 percent, even as other mutual funds cut their exposures.

The insurer has 54 percent of its assets in debt, driven by regulatory requirements and preferences of its unit-linked policyholders.

Kumar said he has cut the weighted-average maturity of his bonds portfolio over the past 12-18 months, as a bond rally in India that has lasted three years comes to an end over concerns about inflation, fiscal slippage and tighter monetary policy.

He is now turning to information technology and pharmaceutical stocks, which he thinks are attractively valued after several quarters of struggle.

India’s more than $150 billion information technology sector has grappled with cuts in client spending in United States, their biggest market, while regulatory concerns and pricing pressures have hit pharmaceutical firms.

Since it hit a record high in March 2015, the Nifty IT Index has fallen about 16 percent. The NSE Nifty has gained about a fifth in that period. The Nifty Pharma Index has declined nearly 30 percent from its record high in April 2015.

“Now, at least given the kind of correction that we’ve seen in those sectors, we believe the time has come to relook at these sectors. But we may have to be a little patient in these sectors,” Kumar said.

The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis. (After publication of this column, a spokesman for Hakim's movement told Reuters that while Hakim and Faisal had both attended an iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, Faisal ""was one of the invitees among other many people, and there was no meeting or political talk during that event."")

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

Na era soviética, lançadores de mísseis desfilavam pela Praça Vermelha todo dia 7 de novembro, líderes soviéticos assistiam do alto do mausoléu de Vladimir Lenin --o pai da Revolução Bolchevique-- e o aniversário do levante era um feriado nacional.

A Praça Vermelha de fato sediou um desfile militar nesta terça-feira, mas se tratou sobretudo de uma reencenação estilizada de um evento de 1941 da Segunda Guerra Mundial que só mencionou brevemente a famosa revolta. Ele não foi exibido ao vivo pela televisão estatal e só contou com um pequeno segmento da revolução de 1917 com soldados do Exército Vermelho.

O centenário, disse o porta-voz de Putin, foi um dia de trabalho normal para o presidente russo, que tinha várias reuniões no Kremlin.

Acusado pela oposição de ter se transformado em uma mistura entre um autocrata de estilo soviético e um czar, e de olho em uma possível reeleição no ano que vem, o líder russo de 65 anos passou anos pregando a estabilidade e ao mesmo tempo denunciando rebeliões na antiga União Soviética e no Oriente Médio.

O batalhão de choque da polícia reprimiu uma série de protestos antigoverno neste ano, realizando detenções em massa. Alexei Navalny, líder opositor e crítico ferrenho de Putin, foi preso três vezes por violar regras sobre manifestações públicas.

Putin, que busca moldar uma identidade nacional orgulhosa, selecionou a dedo partes do passado soviético, como sua vitória na Segunda Guerra e seu sucesso na corrida espacial. Embora não enfatize o papel do comunismo nestes feitos, ele já usou um tom ambivalente, classificando certa vez o colapso soviético em 1991 como a maior catástrofe geopolítica do século 20.

Nos raros comentários que fez sobre o tema antes do centenário, Putin deixou claro que acha que teria sido melhor que a revolução de 1917 nunca tivesse ocorrido e que acredita que não há nada para se comemorar.

“... Vemos quão ambíguos são seus resultados, o quão intimamente as consequências negativas e, precisamos reconhecer, positivas destes eventos estão entrelaçadas”, afirmou Putin a uma congregação de acadêmicos no mês passado.

Putin escolheu suas palavras cuidadosamente. A data pode lhe causar sentimentos conflitantes, mas continua sendo um aniversário sagrado para o Partido Comunista e para muitos russos mais velhos.

Embora seja o segundo maior partido na câmara baixa do Parlamento após o partido pró-Kremlin Rússia Unida, o Partido Comunista Russo exerce pouca influência real hoje e vota com o Kremlin na maioria dos principais temas.

Mas os seus apoiadores, que realizaram uma série de eventos de comemoração de uma semana para marcar o centenário da revolução e que ainda deveriam realizar uma manifestação em Moscou nesta terça-feira, acreditam que sua hora vai chegar novamente.

“O capitalismo está tropeçando de uma crise para outra”, escreveu o veterano líder do Partido Comunista Russo, Gennady Zyuganov, em uma nota de celebração do centenário para seus simpatizantes.

“Estamos convencidos de que o sol do socialismo voltará a iluminar a Rússia e o mundo inteiro.”",Putin evita comemorações da Revolução Russa por receio de tumulto político,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1D725I-OBRWD

Fredericks, who won four silver medals at the 1992 and 1996 Games, is suspected of receiving bribes and laundering the money through Paris, a source close to the inquiry in France said on Friday. He appeared before a French magistrate on Thursday.

Fredericks has previously rejected allegations of corruption.

The IOC said in a statement that its executive board had decided to suspend Fredericks after “considering the gravity and urgency of the situation and its impact on the reputation of the IOC.”

Fredericks is already being investigated by the global Athletics Integrity Unit over payments he received from Papa Massata Diack, the son of former world athletics chief Lamine Diack, on the day Rio won the vote to host the 2016 Olympics.

Fredericks has previously said that a payment of $300,000 to his company was recompense for legitimate work.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

“I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).”

U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been “milking” Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power.

Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world’s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.

“Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it’s corruption that delays society’s development,” Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.

“God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,” said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see “correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.”

But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself.

Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom’s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts.

Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said.

INVESTOR NERVES

The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent.

Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion.

In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index losing 2.8 percent.

The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry.

Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis.

A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen’s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region’s poorest countries.

Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as “destructive and provocative” and “slanders”.

The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.

“He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,” wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.

“In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.”

PIVOTAL POWER BASE

Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom’s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne.

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began.

The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.

“This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,” he said.

A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard’s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash. “I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,” he said.

But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.

“There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,” said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.

“Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.”","Saudi mass arrests jolt markets, play to ire over corruption",https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests/saudi-mass-arrests-jolt-markets-play-to-ire-over-corruption-idINKBN1D724C?il=0

“Attualmente qui la questione più importante è gestire le sofferenze” ha detto Draghi durante una conferenza.

“Di conseguenza abbiamo bisogno di uno sforzo congiunto da parte delle banche, dei supervisori, dei regolatori e delle autorità nazionali per affrontare tale questione in maniera ordinata, prima di tutto e soprattutto creando un ambiente in cui gli Npl possano essere efficacemente gestiti e ceduti in maniera efficiente”, ha aggiunto il presidente della Bce.

Poco dopo, nel corso di una conferenza stampa a Bruxelles, l‘Italia, unica a parlare di questo all‘Ecofin, ha dato voce con il ministro Pier Carlo Padoan al proprio dissenso su “metodo e merito” con cui la vigilanza di Francoforte guidata da Danièle Nouy, ha proposto di trattare dal 2018 le coperture dei nuovi crediti deteriorati.

“Non c‘è stato intervento da parte dei ministri salvo che da chi vi parla. Sono intervenuto solo io sostenendo aspetti di metodo, sul fatto che l‘addendum va oltre i limiti dell‘Ssm per la sorveglianza”, ha detto Padoan, sottolineando anche perplessità nel merito.

L‘addendum Bce sui crediti deteriorati delle banche vigilate da Francoforte, in consultazione fino all‘8 dicembre, prevede che dal nuovo anno le nuove sofferenze siano coperte al 100% in sette anni se sono crediti garantiti e in due se privi di garanzie. La Bce ha anche detto che si occuperà separatamente dello stock entro il primo trimestre del nuovo anno.

L‘Italia, ma anche il presidente italiano del Parlamento europeo Antonio Tajani e oggi la federazione bancaria europea, hanno criticato la vigilanza della Bce per aver sconfinato nel campo della regolamentazione con questo addendum che, de facto, sostengono, ha l‘effetto di cambiare i requisiti di capitale.

Padoan ha anche parlato del rischio sottovalutato di creare un precedente in Europa che potrebbe poi riguardare anche altre materie, mentre si è detto “assolutamente a favore” di dare priorità nell‘aggredire questo problema dell‘enorme stock di crediti deteriorati che frena il credito, “ma in tempi e modi ragionevoli”.

Parole analoghe erano già state usate dal governatore della Banca d‘Italia Ignazio Visco che ieri da Madrid ha sottolineato come l‘obiettivo di velocizzare la soluzione per questi crediti difficili debba tener conto dell‘obiettivo di preservare la stabilità del sistema.

La Federazione bancaria europea, in una lettera indirizzata ieri a Commissione europea, Europarlamento e Bce, spiega che l‘addendum rischia di alterare “alcune metriche che costituiscono il fulcro del Primo Pilastro degli standard regolamentari internazionali e della regolamentazione Ue” e che non è chiaro “se l‘Addendum possa essere in definitiva applicato anche alle esposizioni esistenti, lasciando così non chiara una definizione dell‘ambito di applicazione”.

Oggi Nouy da Francoforte ha detto che la Bce guarderà caso per caso alle soluzioni per gestire l‘enorme massa di crediti deteriorati che pesano sul settore bancario della zona euro.

“Per quel che riguarda l‘eredità (degli Npl), beh, la situazione è assai variegata, quindi valutazioni e soluzioni dovranno essere fatte solo caso per caso” ha affermato durante una conferenza.

Ieri all‘Eurogruppo ha detto che ora è il momento di intervenire su questi crediti deteriorati, incassando “un generale consenso” da parte dei ministri, secondo quanto riferito dal presidente Jeroen Dijsselbloem.

In an information leaflet seen by Reuters, IG Metall said management had failed to address employees’ concerns about their future once the joint venture goes ahead next year.

“Until now, there have been lots of warm words instead of reliable information. Under these circumstances we cannot approve of this joint venture,” IG Metall said, adding it expected management to respond to its demands by Nov. 10.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in September announced plans for a joint venture that would create Europe’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal (MT.AS). The merger will also result in up to 4,000 job cuts, although workers fear that will be the tip of the iceberg.

IG Metall also demands that Thyssenkrupp remains a long-term shareholder in the planned 50-50 joint venture and that crucial co-determination agreements will be safeguarded for the merged entity, to be headquartered in the Netherlands.

Labour representatives hold half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, and while a deal can still be pushed through without their consent, their approval could significantly smooth the transaction.

La banca si prepara al nuovo piano d‘impresa, che sarà presentato a Londra in febbraio, con una previsione di utile netto sul 2017 migliore del 2016, la conferma dell‘impegno a pagare sull‘anno un dividendo di 3,4 miliardi e la prospettiva di continuare a essere “un distributore significativo di dividendi” anche per il futuro forte di un eccesso di capitale di 12 miliardi, come dichiarato in conference call dal Ceo Carlo Messina.

Il risultato netto del terzo trimestre si è attestato a 650 milioni di euro, contro i 628 milioni di un anno prima. Il consensus raccolto da Reuters con sette analisti indicava un utile netto di 636 milioni. L‘utile salirebbe a 731 milioni se si escludesse l‘impatto dei rami acquisiti di Popolare Vicenza e Veneto.

Nei primi nove mesi l‘utile netto si attesta a 5,9 miliardi con il contributo pubblico cash da 3,5 miliardi legato all‘acquisizione delle due venete. Senza il contributo e senza l‘impatto dei rami acquisiti, l‘utile netto si attesta a 2,47 miliardi.

La banca prevede un utile netto consolidato per il 2017 superiore a quello del 2016 anche senza considerare il contributo pubblico. Per il quarto trimestre, inoltre, è prevista la contabilizzazione della plusvalenza da 800 milioni dalla cessione di Allfunds.

A fine settembre il Cet1 pro forma a regime si attesta al 13,4% (dal 13% di fine giugno), mentre ‘transitional’ è al 13% (dal 12,5%).

In calo lo stock di crediti deteriorati (-9,1% al netto delle rettifiche rispetto a fine dicembre), delle sofferenze (-8,4%) e delle inadempienze probabili (-9,5%). Le coperture sono al 49,5% per i crediti deteriorati e al 60,8% per le sofferenze. Nel trimestre sono state effettuate rettifiche su crediti per 646 milioni, in calo dai 737 milioni del secondo trimestre.

L‘obiettivo di riduzione degli npl, oggi fissato al 10,5% degli impieghi entro fine 2019, sarà migliorato con il nuovo piano, ha spiegato Messina che invece non vede impatti su capitale e dividendi dalla proposta della Bce di una copertura integrale per i crediti deteriorati emersi dall‘1 gennaio 2018 entro due anni per i non garantiti ed entro sette per i garantiti.

Le commissioni salvano una ‘top line’ nel complesso debole, con proventi operativi netti del terzo trimestre a 4,08 miliardi in calo del 6,2% rispetto al secondo trimestre. Gli interessi netti sono invece calati del 3,6% a 1,75 miliardi. Le commissioni nette nel trimestre sono stabili a 1,9 miliardi ma rispetto a un anno prima sono in crescita del 7,6%, frutto soprattutto dell‘attività di wealth management che contribuisce al risultato corrente lordo per circa il 52%.

Con costi operativi a 2,122 miliardi (-1,7%) il risultato della gestione operativa ammonta a 1,96 miliardi (-10,7%).

Il titolo non ha subito scossoni con la diffusione della trimestrale ma ha sempre sovraperformato il settore in Italia e a meno di un‘ora alla chiusura delle negoziazioni sale dell‘1,13% a 2,874 euro.

Carlo Tommaselli di Credit Suisse sottolinea, oltre alle buone commissioni e a interessi netti deboli, anche una buona asset quality e una buona posizione di capitale.

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

With Iranian power winning out in Iraq and Syria, and Riyadh bogged down in a war with Iran-allied groups in Yemen, the new Saudi approach could bring lasting political and economic turmoil to a country where Tehran had appeared ascendant.

The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh and blamed on Iran and Hezbollah, is seen by many as the first step in an unprecedented Saudi intervention in Lebanese politics.

“The Saudis appear to have decided that the best way to confront Iran is to start in Lebanon,” a European diplomat said.

Riyadh is blaming Hezbollah for the resignation of Lebanon’s preeminent Sunni politician, accusing it of “hijacking” Lebanese politics. But Saudi Arabia is also widening blame to Lebanon as a whole, saying it too has declared war on the Kingdom.

A Saudi minister has made the near impossible demand that Lebanese act against a group that is a major part of Lebanon’s political fabric and far more powerful than the weak state, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military.

Coinciding with a major anti-corruption purge of top Saudis, Hariri’s shock announcement has given rise to suggestions from Hezbollah and others that his Saudi business interests had embroiled him in the probe and he was forced to resigning.

Saudi Arabia and Hariri’s allies deny that, and assertions that Hariri is under house arrest. They say his hand was forced by Hezbollah interventions in Arab countries in service of Iran.

POWER VACUUM

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said Hezbollah had been “calling the shots” in the Hariri government, which included two Hezbollah ministers and was formed last year in a political deal that made Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, head of state.

Hezbollah and its allies will struggle to form a government without Hariri or his blessing, leaving Lebanon in a protracted crisis that could eventually stir Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions, though there is no sign of this yet as all sides urge calm.

Announcing his resignation, Hariri cited an assassination plot against him and slammed Iran and Hezbollah for sowing strife and trying to “kidnap” Lebanon away from the Arab world. The declaration came as a surprise even to Hariri’s aides.

It is not clear what comes next: Saudi-backed efforts to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon failed badly a decade ago, ending with a bout of Sunni-Shi‘ite fighting on the streets of Beirut that only underlined Hezbollah’s military dominance.

The regional struggle moved elsewhere in recent years, notably neighboring Syria where years of Saudi investment in rebel groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad failed to withstand direct military intervention by Iran and Hezbollah.

In Iraq, Tehran-backed militias and Iranian commanders have often seemed as powerful as the U.S.-backed Iraqi military, most recently in an operation to retake Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.

So emboldened was Iran that top Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati trumpeted his regional alliance’s success from Beirut last Friday, declaring victories in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His statement to the media after a meeting with Hariri was seen as a major provocation to regional Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia.

Hariri left for Saudi Arabia immediately afterwards, cancelling previously scheduled engagements and catching even his closest advisors off guard the next day with a declaration first broadcast by Saudi-owned media.

The regional standoff flared in the Gulf hours later, with Iran-allied groups firing a ballistic missile at Riyadh from Yemen. Saudi Arabia says it was launched by Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has not responded to the accusation.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government responded on Tuesday to the Saudi accusation, voiced by Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war.

“The Lebanese government will be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia, and all Lebanese must realize these dangers and work to resolve the issues before we reach the point of no return,” he said in an interview with Al-Arabiya TV.

Crown Prince Mohammed told Reuters last month the war in Yemen would continue to prevent the Iran-allied Houthi movement from becoming another Hezbollah at Saudi’s border.

SANCTIONS CALL

Hezbollah was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982 to fight Israeli troops in Lebanon. Its last major war with Israel was in 2006, since when Hezbollah has grown stronger.

While Sabhan vowed that Hezbollah would be forced back into “its caves” in southern Lebanon, any Saudi military action in Lebanon - such as air strikes - would come as a major surprise.

Political paralysis and tension is however a big threat to an already stagnant economy, and could derail next year’s parliamentary elections - Lebanon’s first since 2009.

Policymakers have scrambled to calm concern over the financial stability of the heavily indebted state. They say the Lebanese pound - pegged against the dollar at the same rate for 20 years - is stable.

Hariri was spearheading efforts to garner international aid to help Lebanon deal with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, or a quarter of the population.

Leaders on all sides say there should be no further escalation. Both Hezbollah and Hariri’s Future Movement have worked to contain Sunni-Shi‘ite tensions during the war in neighboring Syria.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called for calm and patience in the face of Hariri’s resignation. Okab Sakr, a member of Hariri’s Future Movement, noted that protests in solidarity with Hariri had been canceled to avoid trouble.

Sabhan, the Saudi minister, has called for “real sanctions” and alliances “to find a fundamental solution to this cancerous disease”, saying Hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of government.

Hariri, who was thrust into politics by the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, led years of political struggle with Hezbollah in Lebanon. But his Saudi-backed “March 14” coalition failed to make any progress toward Hezbollah’s disarmament as demanded by U.N. resolutions.

Echoing the Saudi position, the United States has also taken new measures targeting Hezbollah in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump takes a tougher stance toward Iran.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year.","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.

“Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,” OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.

“I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.”

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers’ high adherence to the supply pact.

“As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,” he said.

“I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).”

The Niger Delta Avengers, whose attacks on energy facilities in the region last year helped push Africa’s biggest economy into recession, said on Friday it had ended its ceasefire in its campaign for more of Nigeria’s oil earnings.

“We’re constrained by cash,” Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, the minister of state for petroleum, told Reuters in an interview on Monday when discussing efforts to develop the Delta. “We’ve scurried around for some money just to begin the process.”

He said he would meet representatives of the militants and other stakeholders during a visit to the region on Nov. 9.

The minister said the government needed to develop its oil and economy to deliver on promises of more cash for the Delta, which rights groups say has long suffered from pollution and poor investment despite being the source for much of Nigeria’s oil output of around 2 million barrels per day (bpd).

Kachikwu said a return to violence by the militants would be “mutually destructive”, adding: “I am sure that like they did the last time, when they see a concrete action plan they would listen.”

Attacks in the oil producing region drove Nigeria’s oil output down to close to 1 million bpd. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting granted Nigeria an exemption from a global deal to curb output to help it recover.

In its race to rebuild, Kachikwu said Shell and Eni should press on with developing oil prospecting licence (OPL) 245. The $1.3 billion award of the block in 2011 is subject to corruption investigations and court cases. The firms deny wrongdoing.

“It’s been allocated, and there are development plans for it (the block) and those development plans should go forward,” Kachikwu said. “The development of assets should not suffer because we are dealing with a legacy transparency issue.”

The minister said he intended to launch a “roadmap” in January inviting investors to fund repairs and upgrades to pipelines and oil depots, mirroring efforts that aim to draw $1.5 billion to $2 billion into Nigeria’s ailing refineries.

Kachikwu said the plans would not involve selling state-owned stakes but attracting private capital was essential.

“We don’t have the resources, and we don’t have the time to raise the resources, to revamp the sector,” he said.

On changes in the industry, the minister said revisions to oil contracts and operations at state oil company NNPC had saved money, citing deals to exchange crude for fuel, dubbed “direct sale, direct purchase”, that saved the state $1 billion.

Nigeria has called for early talks to renew oil licenses held by Shell, Total and others. Licences for several key fields expire in two years and oil firms are typically reluctant to make big investments without long-term assurances.

Kachikwu said such talks could be concluded by the first quarter of next year, although negotiations that are handled by the Department of Petroleum Resources had not yet started.","More oil cash needed in Nigeria's Delta to avert new conflict, says minister",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D71U9-OZATP

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“It is nice that I get to have someone like David Einhorn and other members of the investment team pick apart their ideas,” he said.",Scooters instead of boardroom 'kabuki': how one fund manager picks winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-greenlightmasters/scooters-instead-of-boardroom-kabuki-how-one-fund-manager-picks-winners-idUSKBN1930DA

Surrounded by water from three sides, the museum houses 600 artworks it has acquired, alongside 300 works on loan from 13 leading French institutions, in its 23 permanent galleries. The artists range from Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh to Pablo Picasso and Cy Twombly.

French President Emmanuel Macron will be the guest of honour at the opening, along with other heads of state.

“It is a lot more than just a museum. It is a centre of peace, acceptance, tolerance and education,” Mohamed al-Mubarak, chairman of the department of culture and tourism in Abu Dhabi, told Reuters.

Permanent installations include a sculpture by Auguste Rodin, an enormous bronze tree with mirrored branches called “leaves of light” by Italian artist Giuseppe Penone and three engravings on stone walls bearing historic texts from the region by Jenny Holzer, an American neo-conceptual artist.

And there are priceless pieces. They include a statue of the Sphinx dating back to the 6th century B.C., 13 fragments of a frieze that reveals Surah al Hashr from the Holy Quran and a marble bust of Alexander the Great.

Among the paintings is one by Leonardo DaVinci, done between 1495 and 1499 and called La Belle Ferronniere, or Portrait of an Unknown Woman, which was recently restored and is on loan from the original Musee du Louvre in Paris.

The Abu Dhabi museum was set up under a 2007 inter-governmental agreement between Paris and Abu Dhabi. Originally slated to open in 2012, it was delayed by the global financial crisis and then by low oil prices, which led the United Arab Emirates to rein in spending.

Louvre Abu Dhabi has partnered with museums and cultural institutions in the Arab world, who will lend 28 significant works. Among them are an 8,000-year-old, two-headed figure called the Ain Ghazal statue from Jordan, some 400 silver dirham coins from Oman and a pre-historic stone tool from Saudi Arabia.

Having invested over $1 billion in the museum, Abu Dhabi is hoping culture will attract tourists. Two more museums, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and Zayed National Museum, are planned around the Louvre Abu Dhabi in the Saadiyat Cultural District that already hosts art fairs, exhibitions and performances.

“Culture is the element that will distinguish us from others,” said Saif Saeed Ghobash, director-general of the emirate’s Department of Culture & Tourism. “We will attract a different kind of traveller.”

The entrance ticket to the museum is 60 dirhams ($16.30) with all 5,000 tickets sold out for the opening day.",East meets West as Louvre Abu Dhabi opens in the Gulf,https://in.reuters.com/article/emirates-louvre/east-meets-west-as-louvre-abu-dhabi-opens-in-the-gulf-idINKBN1D71DG

They are open now under President Donald Trump. That is not altogether unexpected as the New York real estate developer did campaign during the 2016 presidential election on a promise to elevate the needs of business, which he argued would fuel economic growth.

What does surprise lobbyists, however, is the sheer number of wins in getting the Trump administration to roll back or delay unfavorable regulations in its first 10 months. And it is occurring despite White House dysfunction and distraction.

The lobbyists say it is a stark departure from the approach of the Obama administration, which had a reputation for aloofness toward business and sought to limit the influence of lobbyists, whom it saw as beholden to special interests. The Trump White House is listening to them, they say. It is returning their phone calls. And it is working to eliminate regulations they view as detrimental to the ability to prosper.

When 15 lobbyists and business leaders recently held talks with Trump administration officials on energy infrastructure and climate change, they were surprised by the officials' opening question: ""Do you have a regulation that we could put on a list to try to eliminate? Is there something that is impeding you from growing?""

In that moment, one of the lobbyists at the meeting knew it was a new era. “That as an opening was not the way the Obama administration approached meetings,” she said.

“It’s night and day,” between the Trump and Obama administrations, said James Thurber, a professor in the public affairs school at American University, who studies lobbying and its effects.

Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” an oath that came with plans to curb lobbying and end a “culture of corruption.” The campaign stump speech line had a populist appeal, but one person’s swamp dweller is another’s job creator.

Some of the 16 lobbyists spanning nine different industries interviewed by Reuters acknowledged that many people view them as part of the problem in Washington, not the solution, and that their growing influence may be seen by those as a negative.

Spending so far this year on lobbyists is on pace to exceed spending in 2016, according to the OpenSecrets website, with $2.43 billion spent over the first nine months compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016.

After taking office in January, Trump quickly made it easier to get into the White House.

He reversed President Barack Obama’s restrictions that sought to keep lobbyists at bay by physically barring many of them from the White House - a rule that critics said did nothing more than move meetings with lobbyists to coffee shops across the street. And Trump has stopped the public disclosure of White House visitors’ logs, so now lobbyists come and go with less concern that their presence at the White House will be scrutinized.

Most lobbyists refused to speak on the record because they did not want to reveal anything about their private discussions with the administration. Lobbyists are also acutely aware that anything they say will be used by critics who think Trump has tilted too much toward corporate interests.

The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.

The coal, steel, oil and gas industries are some of the clear winners, with easier access to the Trump administration and more deregulation of their industries, said Stan Veuger, a fellow at the conservative thinktank American Enterprise Institute who studies politics and the economy.

That business has been given more access and even more control of certain regulatory issues is “fair criticism and praise if you want to call it that,” said Veuger.

There are big losers, too. Consumer advocacy and environmental groups warning about the perils of climate change, who enjoyed easy access to the Obama White House, have largely been shut out of a Trump White House that is more skeptical of climate change and believes Obama over-reached with some of his measures to protect consumers.

SOME WINS

It was no secret that Trump wanted to greenlight the Dakota Access Pipeline to move oil from North Dakota to Illinois despite the fierce opposition of environmentalists and American Indian tribes whose land was being used. He spoke about it frequently during the campaign. Then Trump gave the energy industry more than they had hoped for.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents all the large refiners, had asked the administration to speed the permitting process for drilling and building new facilities. When Trump signed his executive order authorizing the pipeline only four days after taking office, he also granted this wish.

A number of business trade groups asked the Trump administration to suspend a rule, created during the Obama years, that would require companies to disclose to the government any communications they have with employees during union disputes. In June, the Trump Labor Department did just that, citing the opposition from business.

Among the other wins for business, the Labor Department delivered on a top priority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group and Wall Street brokerages when it reversed an Obama-era rule aimed at brokers who recommend inappropriate retirement investments.

The administration also side-stepped the process to repeal regulations by implementing delays and holds on rules.

For instance, in the final months of the Obama administration the Bureau of Land Management created a rule governing methane and waste prevention over the strong objections of groups representing oil and gas companies.

API wrote to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, in May asking him to postpone implementation of the rule. The Trump administration announced it would and even cited the lobbyists’ objections as the reason.

Of course, it is not perfect harmony between Trump and business. Dozens of corporate leaders abandoned advisory business councils set up by Trump after he appeared to side with white supremacists following a white nationalist rally in Virginia that resulted in the death of a protester.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent the past few weeks ringing alarm bells over Trump’s various positions on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

And yet, said Neil Bradley, one of the top lobbyists for the chamber, “I have even found in times when we may not see eye to eye with the administration on something, we have cordial, timely discussions that are substantive.”",'Open Sesame:' Lobbyists cheer warmer welcome in Trump White House,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-lobbying/open-sesame-lobbyists-cheer-warmer-welcome-in-trump-white-house-idUSKBN1D714U

Both “demonetisation” - removing higher currency bills from circulation - and a new national goods and services tax (GST) are expected to have a marked impact on the gold jewellery industry in India, the world’s second-biggest consumer of the precious metal.

Family firms control nearly 70 percent of the $30 billion gold jewellery trade, but many cash transactions are believed to take place outside the taxman’s purview. Greater transparency in the economy and higher tax receipts are key policy goals for India’s government.

“Events like demonetisation and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax are helping us to increase market share as the industry is getting organised,” said Subbu Subramaniam, Chief Financial Officer of Titan, predicting sales growth of more than 25 percent in the 12 months through March.

Titan last week reported a 71 percent surge in net profit in the July-September quarter. In the first half of 2017/18, the company’s jewellery sale surged 47 percent to 61 billion rupees ($941 million), the company said in a statement last week.

The company’s shares surged 19 percent on Monday after touching a record high of 824.65 rupees. They have more than doubled this year up to Monday’s close.

India this year set the GST sales tax on jewellery at 3 percent - a level industry players said was low enough to avoid curbing sales while at the same time steering customers to larger players abiding by tax laws and away from cash deals of questionable legal status.

Subramaniam said Titan plans to open 15 jewellery stores in the second half of the fiscal year, on top of its existing 268 stores, to extend its geographical reach.

Reflecting Titan’s growth prospects, Deutsche Bank on Monday raised the jewellery retailer’s price target to 900 rupees from 625 rupees, and forecast company’s earnings will double by 2018/19 from last year’s base.

“All the Money in the World,” about the 1973 kidnapping of teenager John Paul Getty III, features Spacey as his grandfather, the late U.S. oil billionaire Jean Paul Getty.

The film was due to have a red carpet world premiere at the American Film Institute’s (AFI) annual festival in Los Angeles on Nov. 16.

“Given the current allegations surrounding one of its actors and out of respect for those impacted, it would be inappropriate to celebrate at a gala at this difficult time. Accordingly, the film will be withdrawn,” Sony’s TriStar Pictures unit said in an emailed statement.

Spacey’s representatives did not return a request for comment on Monday regarding Sony’s decision. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

The Sony statement said there were 800 other actors, writers and crew members involved in the movie, and the film would open wide as planned on Dec. 22.

Spacey apologized last month to actor Anthony Rapp, who accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey’s representatives later said he was seeking unspecified treatment.

CNN reported last week that eight current and former employees of the Netflix TV show “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey, the TV show’s star.

AFI said in a statement that it supported Sony’s decision.

Netflix said on Friday that it had severed ties with Spacey because of the allegations.

It said it would not be involved in further production of “House of Cards” with Spacey. Producer Media Rights Capital said Spacey had been suspended from the political show.

Netflix also said it would not release the film “Gore,” in which Spacey plays the late U.S. writer Gore Vidal.","Sony pulls Spacey film from festival, going ahead with December release",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1D62YD-OCAEN

Sede da Eletrobras no Rio de Janeiro 20/08/2014 REUTERS/Pilar Olivares

O secretário-executivo da pasta, Paulo Pedrosa, disse à Reuters que o primeiro projeto, sobre a venda de distribuidoras de energia da Eletrobras e com uma proposta para solucionar problemas relacionados ao risco hidrológico no setor elétrico, pode ir ainda nesta terça-feira para a Presidência.

O segundo projeto deve definir a modelagem para a desestatização da Eletrobras, enquanto o terceiro será focado na definição de um novo marco regulatório para a indústria de eletricidade.

A decisão sobre os projetos foi do presidente Michel Temer, que chegou a um acordo com o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), para evitar o envio de novas medidas provisórias (MPs) ao Congresso neste momento.

O encaminhamento foi uma derrota para a pasta de Minas e Energia, que vinha defendendo discutir os assuntos via MP para acelerar o processo.

O presidente da Eletrobras, Wilson Ferreira Jr, afirmou na noite de segunda-feira que o PL não é o caminho mais rápido, mas ao mesmo tempo pode promover um debate mais transparente.

“Era melhor por MP? Era. A MP começa mais rápido, mas uma mudança desse tipo e dessa envergadura achou-se melhor via projeto de lei, com o compromisso de ter o ritmo adequado... o PL deve entrar para discussão nos próximos dias”, disse ele a jornalistas, após participar de evento no Rio de Janeiro.

DESCOTIZAÇÃO

A privatização da Eletrobras deverá ser viabilizada com a emissão de novas ações pela companhia, diluindo o governo a uma fatia minoritária.

O processo também envolverá o pagamento pela empresa à União de um bônus em troca de mudanças nos contratos de suas hidrelétricas mais antigas, que operam atualmente em um chamado “regime de cotas”.

A ideia é que a Eletrobras pague ao Tesouro com recursos arrecadados na oferta de ações em troca de poder vender livremente a energia dessas usinas, um processo que vem sendo chamado de “descotização”.

O Orçamento da União para 2018 prevê a arrecadação de 12 bilhões de reais com a “descotização”.

Pedrosa disse, sem citar valores, que o processo também arrecadará recursos significativos para abater encargos nas contas de luz.

Os recursos para o Tesouro serão arrecadados em uma parcela única, enquanto os recursos para abater custos nas tarifas serão arrecadados em base anual.

Ainda está previsto um prêmio à Eletrobras em meio ao processo, acrescentou o secretário. Esse prêmio poderá ser pago por meio de acertos de contas com a União, sem envolver dinheiro.

“Não é um benefício para a Eletrobras, é uma compensação com a União, de créditos e débitos... Um prêmio pago para que possa voluntariamente aderir ao novo modelo, porque vai abrir mão de um regime... em que não tem risco”, explicou.

De acordo com Pedrosa, a Eletrobras deverá convocar uma assembleia de acionistas para decidir se aceitará a proposta da União pela “descotização”, e a União não irá participar da votação.

“Quem vai ter que tomar a decisão de aceitar será o minoritário da Eletrobras, para não caracterizar abuso de poder. A União precisará oferecer algo à Eletrobras para que ela aceite, para que faça sentido para a empresa e seja aceito”, explicou.

New Jersey voters are picking a new governor, to succeed outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several big cities are selecting mayors, and conservative Utah is holding a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended.

In Virginia, opinion polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor’s race that will offer clues about the U.S. political mood.

Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but has embraced the president’s combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

The ads put Northam, Virginia’s lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in polls in recent weeks in the Southern state, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points in last year’s presidential race.

“The momentum is clearly on our side,” Gillespie told Fox News on Monday.

Gillespie, however, has not won over Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and lives in Democratic-leaning Arlington. Peacemaker considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s nomination last year. Clinton won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington County, the most densely populated part of Virginia, nestled against the border of Washington, D.C.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” Peacemaker, who voted for Clinton, said on Tuesday

Trump’s influence on the race is significant even though the president was not highly engaged until the campaign’s final days, Peacemaker said. After winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies, Peacemaker added.

ANOTHER SETBACK FOR DEMOCRATS?

A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who lost four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.

Democrats fear such a victory would give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

“Gillespie’s ads played on every fear and dark impulse, and if we lose, we are going to see a lot more of that,” Democratic strategist Dane Strother said.

Gillespie rejected that characterization and said he was gaining ground against Northam because of his substantive policies and plans to bolster Virginia’s economy. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but never campaigned for him, backed that view on Monday.

Slideshow (16 Images)

“The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible. If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!” he wrote on Twitter.

In response, Northam tweeted that voting for him was “the best way to refute Trump’s lies.” The Virginia economy had an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in September, better than all but 13 states and below the national rate of just over 4 percent.

Trump’s argument resonated with Lee Hernandez, who works in finance and voted for Gillespie because he found the Republican’s message on economic improvement more persuasive.

Hernandez, a swing voter who also lives in Arlington, said he was bothered by Northam’s emphasis on “keeping Virginia blue (Democratic) or making it blue, and that really was a big turnoff.”

Gillespie’s campaign has blasted an ad aired by an outside pro-Northam group - quickly taken down - that showed a white man in a pickup truck with a Confederate flag and a Gillespie sticker chasing down minority children.

In the governor’s race in Democratic-leaning New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead in polls over Republican Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor, who has been hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

In local races, Democratic Mayors Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston are expected to cruise to re-election, while Detroit, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina; and Seattle also will pick mayors.

The girl gave her parents the slip near Geneva’s central railway station on Sunday, then took the one-stop ride to the airport. Her parents rang the Swiss police, who tracked her progress through the airport on security videos, airport spokesman Bertrand Staempfli said.

She went through the security gate and managed to pass herself off as the child of adults around her, before using her small stature to slip through the departure gate without being noticed and boarding a plane, the airport said in a statement.

On her first attempt she followed a crew toward the plane and was turned back. She melted into the crowd and pretended to look for her parents. The second time, she managed to get into a plane, was spotted by an official, stopped, and handed over to police.

Staempfli declined to say which airline was involved or where it was flying to, but he said it was leaving from the airport’s French sector and the destination was in France.

“Todo e qualquer valor adicional que a corte de contas vier a apurar a empresa sabe com muita clareza que ela terá de se curvar (a ser cobrada)”, disse a ministra, durante o Fórum de Debates de Acordo de Leniência e o Combate à Corrupção, promovido pela AGU.

Grace Mendonça disse que os acordos que estão sendo fechados entre órgãos e empresas têm previsto uma “cláusula aberta” na qual as empresas que, mesmo já tendo fechado um acordo de leniência, concordam em fazer novas reparações por danos apurados por corte de contas.

COLABORAÇÃO

A advogada-geral defendeu que é preciso colocar um “ponto final” em eventuais disputas que têm ocorrido entre órgãos envolvidos nas negociações do acordo. Ela disse que a cooperação têm de ocorrer para que a política de leniência seja respeitada internacionalmente sob pena de o instituto ser desqualificado.

Atualmente, participam da leniência o Ministério da Transparência e CGU, o Ministério Público Federal e o Tribunal de Contas da União, além da própria AGU.

Na mesma linha da entrevista dada à Reuters em setembro, Grace disse que a relação com o MPF, hoje comandado por Raquel Dodge, está sendo estreitado “bastante” nos últimos meses. Havia queixas da relação mantida durante a gestão de Rodrigo Janot à frente da Procuradoria-Geral da República.

Para a ministra, não há como avançar na segurança jurídica do instituto sem haver diálogo entre os órgãos, o que deve ser uma premissa.

O presidente do TCU, Raimundo Carreiro, defendeu uma maior cooperação. “Quanto mais você abrir o leque de discussões, melhor decisões sairão”, disse.

Em rápida entrevista na saída da abertura do evento, Carreiro disse que a relação com a gestão de Janot foi “normal” e destacou o bom relacionamento no trato da leniência com a equipe do MPF de Curitiba.

ACORDOS

Também em entrevista, a chefe da AGU afirmou que o órgão que comanda e o Ministério da Transparência e Controladoria Geral da União (CGU) assinaram um novo acordo de leniência. Ela disse que não podia dar detalhes do acordo porque, embora assinado, está sob sigilo por estar em fase de finalização.

Até o momento, sabia-se da assinatura do acordo da UTC, investigada na Lava Jato, e da Bilfinger e da SBM, sendo que esse último fora suspenso por decisão da Câmara de Combate à Corrupção do MPF.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

As well as strengthening existing sanctions and Congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.

All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate.

The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang.

“For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s main sponsors, said after the committee voted.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another sponsor, said that, in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights.

Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang.

Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, calling for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war.

Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of former President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.”

Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week that they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the bill. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House of Representatives.

Fund managers from Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Hodges Capital, and SSI Investment Management are among those that are adding to or holding on to their shares of those of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Microsoft Co and Southwest Airlines Co in part because they expect to see more share buybacks or special dividends if a tax reform passes in some form.

The House Republican plan would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent and allow companies bring back foreign profits at a 12 percent tax rate, a process known as repatriation. Overall, U.S. companies hold some $2.6 trillion in untaxed offshore cash.

Fund managers say that while it is far too soon to tell whether the tax bill will pass, the prospect of increased buybacks is worth taking a bet on companies that would benefit the most from the plan.

“If you have two companies that you are looking at and one would get a bigger boost from bringing back its cash from overseas, that provides an extra level of return,” said Peter Santoro, a portfolio manager of the $11 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund.

For example, cash-rich tech companies with big international presence, such as Microsoft, are likely to return cash to shareholders via a one-time dividend even if Congress passes a repatriation bill rather than a broad tax reform, Santoro said.

When Congress allowed U.S. companies to bring back foreign profits at a discounted tax rate in 2004, Microsoft issued a special $3-per-share dividend and the Trump tax windfall would likely lead to something similar, Santoro said.

Santoro declined to say whether he was adding to his Microsoft position in recent months. Microsoft is the largest position in Santoro’s fund, according to Morningstar data, and its shares are up 36 percent for the year largely driven by the expansion of its cloud-based business.

Goldman Sachs estimates that the Republican tax bill would increase corporate buybacks by $75 billion, to $590 billion, in 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, estimates about half of repatriated cash would go into buybacks and the rest would get spent on acquisitions and other investments.

Stock buybacks often provide a short-term bump in a company’s share price both by eliminating the total number of available shares and improving metrics such as earnings per share and return on equity.

LAGGING THE MARKET

Yet buybacks, which peaked in 2016, have been slowing over the last three years as rising stock valuations made them more costly and investors have called on companies to invest more in their future by spending on factories or research.

The S&P 500 Buyback Index is lagging the broader market this year after having beaten the S&P 500 by nearly 83 percent between 2009 and the end of 2016. The buyback index tracks 100 of the companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratios, such as Boeing Co, Michael Kors Holdings, and Tyson Foods Inc. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zcj87u)

The Powershares Buyback Achievers fund, which tracks companies that have repurchased at least 5 percent of their outstanding shares over the last 12 months, is up 11.2 percent so far this year, compared with a 15.7 percent gain in S&P 500.

Eric Marshall, a fund manager at $2 billion Hodges Capital, said he has been adding to his position in buyback-heavy companies such as Texas Instruments and Lowe’s Companies Inc because he expects them to increase their current buyback programs if a tax bill does pass.

Texas Instruments, for instance, said in September it would buy a further $6 billion of its own shares, extending a program that has reduced its total number of shares by a quarter over the last five years. Texas Instruments shares make up about 2 percent of the Hodges Blue Chip Equity Income fund. The firm last bought the stock in June, according to the latest publicly available data.

“Buybacks are the most tax efficient thing you can do with your capital, and when you are repurchase your own stock you know exactly what you are buying,” Marshall said.

Ravi Malik, a portfolio manager at $1.6 billion SSI Investment Management Inc, said that a cut in the repatriation rate would benefit convertible bonds in his portfolio such as Citrix Systems Inc, Amgen Inc and Lam Research Corp.

SSI Investment examines its biggest holdings with a significant share of overseas revenues to assess the impact of tax legislation on those companies, Malik said. “That’s how we identified these companies as significant beneficiaries of the changes proposed.”

Barry James, a portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, said that he expected fund holdings, such as lawn mower maker Toro Co and Southwest Airlines to boost existing buyback schemes should a tax bill pass. Such a move would be preferable to an acquisition or hiring more employees, he said.

“Over the long run, we are fans of companies that reward shareholders, and now is not the right time to find an acquisition cheaply.”",U.S. investors target 'buyback stocks' in bet on Trump tax plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-buybacks/u-s-investors-target-buyback-stocks-in-bet-on-trump-tax-plan-idUSKBN1D70HX

Von Grünen bis FDP überlegen Politiker aller an den Jamaika-Sondierungen beteiligten Parteien, wie sich die Personalie Seehofer auf die Bildung einer angestrebten Bundesregierung auswirken könnte. Immerhin ist Bayerns Ministerpräsident eine der zentralen Figuren beim Versuch, ein ungewöhnliches neues Bündnis auf Bundesebene zu schmieden. Die Personaldebatte in Bayern sei dafür und für die Stellung der CSU nicht gerade hilfreich, beklagte etwa Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann im ZDF-Morgenmagazin.

In den Spitzen von CDU und CSU gibt man sich dagegen nach den gemeinsamen Abstimmungen am Samstag entspannt, wie etwa Unions-Fraktionschef Volker Kauder betonte. Das ändert aber nichts daran, dass die Personaldebatte durchaus Einfluss haben könnte - wobei die Erwartungen völlig unterschiedlich sind. “Die CSU kann nun noch rücksichtsloser, noch kompromissloser in der für sie wichtigen Frage der Migrationspolitik auftreten”, glaubt etwa FDP-Chefunterhändler Wolfgang Kubicki. Denn Seehofer müsse seiner Partei ein gutes Ergebnis der Sondierungsgespräche vorlegen, wenn er seine Zukunft retten wolle. Bis zu den Treffen von Landtagfraktion und Parteivorstand am 18. November in München hat die CSU-Spitze die Personaldebatte zurückgestellt - eine Sprachregelung, zu der sich auch Finanzminister und Vorstandsmitglied Söder bekennt.

Seehofer will seine Pläne für die künftige Personalaufstellung der Partei kurz danach präsentieren. Die CSU steht unter Zeitdruck: Noch in diesem Jahr muss sie turnusmäßig ihren Vorstand neu wählen, der Parteitag ist für Mitte Dezember angesetzt. Dort müsse die CSU ein Bild der Geschlossenheit abgeben, sagen sowohl Freunde als auch Gegner Seehofers. Ein Streit auf offener Bühne werde den Start in den darauffolgenden Wahlkampf verderben: Im Herbst kommenden Jahres will sie bei der Landtagswahl ihre absolute Mehrheit verteidigen und das für sie desaströse Wahlergebnis von 38,8 Prozent der bayerischen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl ausbügeln. Zwei Fragen treiben die CSU um: Wie kann sie im Landtagswahlkampf ihr inhaltliches Profil schärfen? Und wer holt als Parteichef und als Ministerpräsidenten-Kandidat in Bayern die meisten Stimmen?

SEEHOFER IST ANGESCHLAGEN - ABER MÄCHTIG

Wer künftig an der Spitze steht und selbst ob beide Ämter auch künftig in einer Person vereint bleiben, darüber wagt in der Parteiführung bisher niemand eine Prognose. Denn Seehofer ist zwar angeschlagen, aber immer noch der mächtigste Mann der Partei, räumen selbst seine Gegner ein. Als Jamaika-Unterhändler ist der gewiefte 68-Jährige mit seiner bundespolitischen Erfahrung für die CSU unverzichtbar. Seinen Posten als Ministerpräsidenten kann ihm bis zur Landtagswahl niemand nehmen, denn eine Abwahl des Regierungschefs ist in der bayerischen Verfassung nicht vorgesehen.

Für eine Wiederwahl als CSU-Vorsitzender und eine Nominierung zum Spitzenkandidaten wäre Seehofer zwar auf das Votum seiner Partei angewiesen. Doch falls er seine bisherige Ankündigung wahrmacht und sich erneut um beide Posten bewirbt, könnte bereits dies Gegner wie Söder abschrecken, heißt es in der CSU. In einer GMS-Umfrage für den Sender Sat.1 in Bayern nannten im Oktober 40 Prozent der CSU-Wähler Seehofer als Favoriten und 41 Prozent Söder. Eine Kampfabstimmung dürfte die Partei spalten und damit eine denkbar schlechte Vorlage für die Landtagswahl liefern. In der CSU wird heute regelmäßig das Trauma des Putsches gegen den früheren Parteichef und Ministerpräsidenten Edmund Stoiber genannt: Nachdem die CSU Stoiber 2007 im Streit aus dem Amt gedrängt hatte, büßte sie bei der Landtagswahl 2008 ihre absolute Mehrheit ein.

Deshalb wird in der CSU landauf, landab die Sehnsucht nach Eintracht beschworen. Seehofer solle sich mit Söder auf einen “geordneten Übergang” verständigen, wünschen sich Söder-Anhänger. Söder, den Seehofer in der Vergangenheit wiederholt für Alleingänge zurechtgewiesen hat, sagt nun, er reiche diesem die Hand für “jede vernünftige Lösung”. Doch bisher gibt es keine Anzeichen, dass Seehofer seine innige Abneigung gegen den Rivalen aufgibt. Zu den Berliner Sondierungsgesprächen nahm Seehofer seinen Finanzminister nicht einmal mit, als es um Steuerfragen ging. Das sei ein taktischer Fehler, monieren selbst Seehofer-Freunde: Söder könne nun jedes Abrücken Seehofers von den Maximalforderungen der CSU in einem Jamaika-Kompromiss rücksichtslos kritisieren.

ALTERNATIVEN ZU SÖDER

Als mögliches Ass in Seehofers Ärmel wird in CSU-Kreisen Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann genannt. Der Sicherheitsexperte gilt als pflichtbewusster Parteisoldat und zählt zu Seehofers loyalsten Gefolgsleuten. Er hat durchblicken lassen, dass er mit dem von der CSU beanspruchten Bundesinnenministerium ebenso zufrieden wäre wie mit seinem Verbleib in Bayern. Dort könnte er mit dem Thema innere Sicherheit für die CSU auch bei der Landtagswahl Punkte sammeln. Seehofer könnte den früheren Landtagsfraktionschef als neuen Parteichef vorschlagen, lautet eine Variante.

Für einen der Spitzenposten im Gespräch sind auch Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt, der Europapolitiker Manfred Weber und Wirtschaftsministerin Ilse Aigner. Sie wurden wie Herrmann in der Vergangenheit ebenfalls von Seehofer gefördert. Gegen den früheren Bundesverkehrsminister als CSU-Chef spreche, dass er weder in der Landtagsfraktion noch an der Basis ausreichend Gefolgsleute habe. Ähnliches gilt für Weber: Der frühere niederbayerische CSU-Bezirkschef hat zwar beste Kontakte in seiner Heimat und in Brüssel, während der Landtag nicht zu seinen Arenen zählt. Aigner wiederum vereint als Bezirkschefin hinter sich zwar den mächtigen oberbayerischen CSU-Verband, blieb aber nach verbreiteter Ansicht als Wirtschaftministerin blass.",CSU-Beben verunsichert Jamaika-Sondierer,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-kompromisse-idDEKBN1D70MT

“Tennis Re-invented” is the catchphrase of the tournament launched this year by the ATP to showcase the young men it hopes will lead it towards a brave new world, together with a raft of innovations designed to catch a new wave of tennis fans.

Sunday’s botched draw ceremony branded as “sexist” and “trashy” was hardly what the ATP had in mind -- forcing them and sponsors Red Bull to apologize after players had to select glamorous models to determine their round-robin group.

And all the talk of new technology, gizmos and enhanced fan experiences looked a little lame when, minutes before Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev were scheduled to appear for the tournament’s opening salvos, workmen were still welding pieces of the temporary stadium together.

It hardly felt state-of-the-art.

Yet once the crowds, many of them children, eventually filled the humongous aircraft hanger-sized hall at the Fiera Milano, there was much to savor as Khachanov and Medvedev showcased their considerable skills -- and the new rules that would make traditionalists wince.

There is a school of thought that men’s tennis, still in the midst of its golden era, is not broken. So don’t fix it.

Yet the ATP knows the clock ticks ever louder on the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - who are all in their 30s.

Hence it wants to promote the “Next Gen” led by Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who withdrew from Milan to concentrate on playing with the ‘grown ups’ at next week’s ATP Finals in London.

With a black hole looming, that is why they have invested so much time and effort into making the Milan event rock.

Featuring the top seven players in the ATP rankings aged 21 and under - minus world number three Zverev - and with an Italian wildcard, it is tennis on fast forward.

On a two-tone blue singles only court, backdropped with a deep red mock-up of Milan’s iconic La Scala opera house, things did feel very different indeed.

For starters sets were played to four with a tiebreak at 3-3. With no advantage points, deuce effectively became ‘sudden death’. Five of the first six games of the match, eventually won by Medvedev in one hour 48 minutes, were decided that way.

A shot-clock ticked away in the corner to enforce the 25-second rule between points -- ironic considering the tardy start.

Electronic Hawkeye calls replaced line judges with an automated, rather unnerving, British accented voice calling instantaneously “OUT” or “FAULT”.

Italian crowds don’t need an excuse to make noise and the scrapping of any requirement for them to stay silent, or stay still during play, meant a constant hubbub soundtracked the action.

Experienced Brazilian chair umpire Carlos Bernardes still presided over the action -- yet even he got left behind.

In the second game of the third set he instinctively called out “let” when a Medvedev serve flicked the net -- forgetting that service, for this week at least, are fair game.

Another novelty was the sight of the players wearing headphones at the end of sets -- not to listen to their favorite tunes, but to take advice from their coaches.

Any notion that the tournament would be a “hit and giggle” affair was quickly put to bed by action between world number 45 Khachanov and Medvedev, ranked 20 places lower.

“He is highly regarded and respected within the game, and will bring fresh ideas, organisation and enthusiasm.”

Moyes coached Sunderland last season but stepped down following the club’s relegation to the Championship.

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.","SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas (Reuters) - The man who carried out one of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings was able to buy guns legally because a prior domestic violence conviction while he was in the Air Force was never put into an FBI database used in background checks, officials said.

Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sunday’s massacre at a church in rural southeastern Texas, was convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and stepson while serving in the U.S. Air Force in 2012, according to the Pentagon.

Authorities put the death toll at 26, including the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was killed. The attack ranks as the fifth-deadliest by a single gunman in U.S. history.

The Air Force said it had failed to transmit information about Kelley’s conviction to the National Criminal Information Center system, a U.S. government database used by licensed firearms dealers to check prospective gun buyers for criminal backgrounds.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which oversees the military, called the failure to enter Kelley’s record into the database “appalling.”

“I don’t believe that the Air Force should be left to self-police after such tragic consequences,” Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said in a statement. “The failure to properly report domestic violence convictions may be a systemic issue.”

The dead ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years. Twenty others were wounded, with 10 still in critical condition late on Monday, officials said.

Kelley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his getaway vehicle, where authorities found two handguns, Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Monday.

Kelley was also wounded by a resident who heard the gunshot, grabbed his own rifle and raced to the church, shooting the 26-year-old twice as he fled.

The massacre stirred an ongoing debate over gun ownership, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Guns are part of the fabric of life in rural areas.

U.S. President Donald Trump on an Asia trip told reporters he believed stricter reviews of gun purchases would have had no effect on Sunday’s massacre.

“There would have been no difference,” Trump said while on a visit to South Korea. He added that stricter gun laws might have prevented the man who shot Kelley from acting as he did.

“You would have had hundreds more dead,” Trump said.

AIR FORCE INQUIRY

The Air Force opened an inquiry into how it handled the former airman’s criminal record, and the U.S. Defense Department has requested a review by its inspector general to ensure that other cases “have been reported correctly,” Pentagon officials said.

Firearms experts said the case involving Kelley, who spent a year in military detention before his bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, has exposed a previously unnoticed weak link in the system of background checks.

“First I have to define what the problem is. If the problem is we didn’t put something out, we will correct that,” Mattis said.

It is illegal under federal law to sell a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child.

Federal databases did not contain any information that would have barred Kelley from legally buying any of three weapons police recovered from their investigation, said Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in San Antonio.

Kelley stormed into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, population about 400, opening fire with a Ruger AR-556 assault rifle.

Authorities said Kelley had been involved in a domestic dispute with the parents of his second wife, whom he married in 2014, and had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law before the shooting.

Although his in-laws were known to occasionally attend services at First Baptist, Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt said family members were not there on Sunday.

Martin said investigators found hundreds of spent shell casings inside the church after the shooting as well as 15 empty 30-round ammunition magazines.",U.S. Air Force error allowed Texas church gunman to buy weapons,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D715U

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year.","SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but in a more conciliatory appeal than ever before he urged Pyongyang to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff.

Speaking on North Korea’s doorstep during a visit to Seoul, Trump said that while “we hope to God” not to have to resort to the use of full U.S. military might, he was ready to do whatever was necessary to prevent the “North Korean dictator” from threatening millions of lives.

“We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built,” Trump said after talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has supported diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang.

But at times taking a more measured, less confrontational tone, Trump also urged North Korea to “do the right thing” and added that: “I do see some movement,” though he declined to elaborate.

“It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Moon.

Despite Trump’s renewed threats against North Korea, it was a far cry from the more strident approach he has pursued in recent months, including his previous dismissal of any diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang as a waste of time.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made clear, however, that he has little interest in negotiations, at least until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Landing earlier at Osan Air Base outside Seoul, the president and First Lady Melania Trump stepped down from Air Force One onto a red carpet as he began a 24-hour visit that could aggravate tension with North Korea.

He then flew by helicopter to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. military base in the country, and met U.S. and South Korean troops, along with Moon.

The White House billed Trump’s trip as intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve over a hardline approach to the North Korean nuclear and missile threats.

But many in the region had expressed fear that any further bellicose rhetoric by Trump toward Pyongyang could increase the potential for a devastating military conflict.

TRUMP PRAISE FOR MOON

Trump praised Moon for “great cooperation” despite differences in the past over how to confront North Korea and over a trade pact between the United States and South Korea.

At the news conference, the leaders said they had agreed to renegotiate the trade agreement in a timely fashion.

In formal talks after an elaborate welcoming ceremony outside the presidential Blue House in Seoul, Moon told Trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of South Koreans’ anxiety over North Korea.

Pyongyang’s recent nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N. resolutions and an exchange of insults between Trump and Kim have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency.

At the news conference, Trump said Pyongyang must understand the “unparalleled strength” that Washington had at its disposal.

He cited three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups that are converging on the Western Pacific for exercises as well as a nuclear submarine he said was also in position.

Trump has rattled some U.S. allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and by deriding Kim as a “Rocket Man on a suicide mission.”

Kim responded by calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”

Trump’s senior aides privately have since urged him to avoid “personalizing” the conflict any further, U.S. officials say.

On the second leg of his five-nation trip, Trump toured the sprawling Camp Humphreys garrison, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea, and met commanders and troops.

The base visit gave him a first-hand view of the massive military assets the United States has in place in South Korea, but it also could serve as a reminder of the cost in U.S. military lives – as well as the potential massive South Korean civilian losses – if the current crisis spirals into war.

“MAY YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE”

Trump wrapped up his first day with a dinner hosted at the Blue House, dining on grilled sole, beef ribs and chocolate cake while being serenaded by a K-pop singer with an orchestra in the background.

“Mr President, may your dreams come true,” Trump said to Moon, raising his glass in a toast.

North Korea has not conducted a missile test for 53 days, the longest such lull in testing this year. North Korean state media has not commented on Trump’s arrival in the South.

South Korea’s spy agency said last week that North Korea may be preparing another missile test, raising speculation that such a launch could be timed for Trump’s trip to the region.

U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks.

Trump had previously criticized Moon over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang – something the U.S. president once called “appeasement” – but both leaders used Tuesday’s news conference to stress common ground.

Moon urged maximum pressure from sanctions against North Korea to force it to negotiate abandonment of its nuclear program, something Pyongyang says it will never give up.

Several hundred supporters and protesters lined the streets of downtown Seoul as Trump’s motorcade passed by en route to the Blue House, waving flags and posters, with some saying, “No Trump, No War, Yes Peace,” while others cheered, “Trump! Trump!”

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday to South Korea’s National Assembly expected to focus heavily on his North Korea policy, which has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang.

The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. Washington denies any such intention.
