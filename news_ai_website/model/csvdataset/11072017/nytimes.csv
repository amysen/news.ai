There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last year’s polls were too favorable to Democrats. It’s likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines. The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nation’s leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.

One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the poll’s final estimate. For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference. It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governor’s race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll. With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.

Education Can Make a Big Difference How the Upshot/Siena College poll of Virginia might have gone if it followed three common public polling methods and used weights for: The race, gender and age of registered voters, with a likely voter screen

There are a few pollsters in Virginia — like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac — that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election. Most others weren’t weighting by education before 2016 and aren’t weighting by it today.

The disparity can be extreme. Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates. Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll. A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate. A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.

The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesn’t mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016. By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trump’s way appears to have done so. Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters. There’s also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.

But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.

Education Is a Mystery

It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes. But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.

It’s not completely unreasonable. Last year’s polling error was an odd one. It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences. There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan. But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent. Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.

If pollsters didn’t take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error. Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone else’s, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump. And most public pollsters didn’t conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.

Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didn’t think education was decisive. Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.

But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: It’s hard for pollsters to even know if they’re getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.

“I don’t weight to education because it’s pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education,” said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls. “That’s not something that’s necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.”

He’s right. It’s not easy to weight by education, and it’s especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files — the “big data” that powers most campaigning polling and analytics. Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.

Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate. R.D.D. surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election. Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D. have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.

But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files. To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere — something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do. Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.

What’s the alternative? A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isn’t a definitive benchmark for weighting. There still isn’t universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: There’s a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.

The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.

These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters. But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.

All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.

“This is the first time ever that I’ve weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018,” said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, “because education is a pretty damn good predictor.”

For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem — and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side. The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.

Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now they’re generally doing more. There’s still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change — uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.

“It’s kind of a cop-out,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. “You can’t say I can’t deal with education because I don’t know the exact weight of it. You wouldn’t not weight on race because you couldn’t figure it out.”

Is It Enough?

The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.

The cause for debate is simple. Even weighting by education wouldn’t have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge. One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.

But there’s a more ominous possibility. It wasn’t just that polls didn’t capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didn’t get the right less educated white voters.

Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas. Maybe they missed those who don’t work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture. Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.

If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve. Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since “baristas aren’t exchangeable with factory workers,” as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it. Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.

The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but it’s nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry. That’s in part because there’s limited public evidence to support it at this stage. It’s also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible. But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.

Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future. But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms. If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, it’s hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.","After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Haven’t Changed Anything",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/upshot/after-a-tough-2016-many-pollsters-havent-changed-anything.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“We have many things happening that we hope, we hope — in fact, I’ll go a step further — we hope to God we never have to use,” Mr. Trump said.

When pressed by a reporter, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he still thought negotiations with North Korea would be a waste of time, making an uncharacteristic effort to avoid a remark that might have inflamed tensions.

“I don’t want to say that — I just don’t want to say that,” Mr. Trump said. “You can understand.”

His visit to Seoul was the most diplomatically challenging leg of Mr. Trump’s 12-day, five-country trip through Asia, bringing him face to face with a public and a president wary of his combative approach on North Korea. To many of Mr. Moon’s progressive supporters, Mr. Trump poses as much of a threat to peace as Mr. Kim, if not more so.

“Don’t come, Trump! You talk about war whenever you open your mouth,” a large banner read during a protest near the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday. “Go away, Trump!” hundreds of labor activists and other progressives shouted in downtown Seoul, where thousands of police were deployed to keep security. “No Trump, no war!”

A short distance away, across a police blockade, hundreds of conservatives welcomed Mr. Trump with South Korean and American flags. South Korean conservatives are deeply skeptical of Mr. Moon’s approach, calling it naïve. They back Mr. Trump’s hawkish view of the North, although they, too, stop short of supporting war on the Korean Peninsula.

“We believe in Trump!” their signs read.

Mr. Trump’s visit to South Korea appeared choreographed to avoid potentially provocative moments. Unlike many previous presidents, he eschewed the traditional visit to the Demilitarized Zone separating the North and South, where past American commanders in chief have peered into the North through binoculars, projecting a menacing mien.

And while his advisers have signaled that Mr. Trump may soon return North Korea to the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, he did not address that issue on Tuesday.

Mr. Trump’s change in tone notwithstanding, his advisers have increasingly been making the case that North Korea’s ambition is to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force, and that traditional deterrence — fear of overwhelming retaliation — cannot stop the North once it has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.

Many observers are skeptical of both assertions, especially in South Korea, which would suffer greatly if a pre-emptive strike on the North led to all-out war. They argue that the leaders of Pyongyang’s Communist regime are not planning to use nuclear weapons to attack the United States or its allies, because they know that Washington would overwhelmingly counterattack. Rather, they say, North Korea is building its nuclear weapons out of fear, hoping that the arms will protect the country from invasion — or from outside intervention, in the case of a domestic uprising — allowing the North to focus on economic development.

In addition, all of the countries around North Korea, even its old allies China and Russia, have said they would oppose war on the Korean Peninsula.

“The view that North Korea would start war to communize Korea doesn’t make sense anymore,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “North Korea knows that if it ever uses a nuclear weapon, it means self-destruction.”

South Korean officials said they hoped that Mr. Trump’s visit to this densely populated capital of 10 million people would bring home to him the consequences of a potential war. Mr. Moon supports Mr. Trump’s call for “maximum” sanctions and pressure, but says that those alone will never persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

Mr. Moon has urged Washington to engage the North with dialogue and discuss a way out for Pyongyang. But so far, Mr. Trump has ignored such requests, even ridiculing Mr. Moon’s efforts as “appeasement.”

American officials in the region, too, were hoping the president’s trip would help Mr. Trump gain a new perspective on how Seoul and Tokyo view the threat from up close; the regional trends affecting Asia beyond North Korea, including Chinese assertiveness; and the costs and consequences of military action, according to one U.S. official.

From a dining hall at Camp Humphreys, where Mr. Trump had lunch with troops, to the Blue House, where he met with Mr. Moon, everything he saw on Tuesday could become a fiery battlefield in the event of a military exchange with North Korea.

But if the firsthand experience left an impression on Mr. Trump, he did not show it. At times, his tone was almost blithe. Before being briefed by American and South Korean military commanders, he said of the confrontation with the North, “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out — has to work out.” General Vincent Brooks, the American commander, wore a grim expression as he listened to the president.

Mr. Trump also reprised his role as a chief salesman for the American defense industry. “South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Trump said. “And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.”

On the eve of a visit to China, Mr. Trump also made a pointed plea for countries around the world to use their influence to bring North Korea to heel, saying, “It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.”

But in a reminder of the challenge that Washington faces keeping even its allies on the same page, South Korea invited an 88-year-old Korean “comfort woman,” or a former sex slave for Japan’s World War II military, to Mr. Trump’s state banquet and put on the menu a dish of shrimp said to have been caught in waters near a set of disputed islets.

The sex slave issue is one of the most contentious dividing Tokyo and Seoul, and the islets — known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan — lie at the center of a bitter territorial dispute. The Japanese government protested the banquet arrangements, accusing South Korea of “moves that could negatively affect the close coordination” among the allies.

As Mr. Trump arrived in Seoul, there was renewed evidence of activity at a site in North Korea where the regime has conducted underground nuclear tests. It was not clear, however, whether the activity suggested another imminent test or merely construction on a tunnel that could be used for tests.","No War Threats From Trump, Who Tells Koreans ‘It Will All Work Out’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/asia/trump-korea-south-north.html

Ritz-Carlton Has Become a Gilded Cage for Saudi Royals

From the stately rows of palm trees on its 52-acre grounds to the grand double staircase to the glittering ballroom chandeliers, it is easy to see why the six-year-old Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, has played host to billionaires, heads of state and members of the Saudi royal family.

Which is why it is all the more jarring that former government ministers, prominent businessmen and members of the royal family — the House of Saud — are being held captive in the five-star hotel, which was swiftly converted over the weekend into what is almost certainly the world’s most luxurious prison.

In a shaky video that appears from its metadata to have been shot early Monday morning in the hotel’s Ballroom B , people can be seen lying on mats covered with brightly colored blankets in floral motifs while guards in dark uniforms are visible in the background. In a corner stands a rifle, which appears to be an American standard military-issue M4, its civilian variant or a copycat.

Saudi Arabia finds itself in the midst of a crackdown on corruption that began on Saturday night with the arrest of dozens of people, at least 11 of whom were princes, including the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal . By Monday, American officials tracking the situation said that has many as 500 people had been rounded up in the ongoing sweep.

The country’s attorney general, Sheikh Saud al-Mujeb, said on Monday that detainees had been subjected to detailed interrogations. He said the investigations were being conducted in secret to protect the integrity of the legal procedures and to ensure that the detainees’ high social status would not exempt them from justice.

Members of the royal family have been prohibited from leaving the country, sparking fear and concern. It was a striking turnabout for elites accustomed to lives of extreme privilege and the freedom to jet off to Paris, London or New York at the drop of a hat.

While the stated goal of the arrests was fighting corruption, some observers see the crackdown as part of the consolidation of power by the country’s young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman .

Less than two weeks earlier, powerhouses of global capital including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, were among the 3,500 invitees, estimated to control $22 trillion in assets, who streamed down the red carpet and into the hotel for the Future Investment Initiative , a conference that was nicknamed “Davos in the Desert.”

Back in May, the Riyadh Ritz was festooned with American flags as the palatial hotel played host to President Trump on his first trip abroad as commander in chief. His predecessor, President Barack Obama, stayed at the hotel in 2014.

Ballroom B, where the video footage appears to have been taken, is just shy of 20,000 square feet, and can be used as a banquet room seating 1,400 people or a reception accommodating 2,000 people.

As with most public spaces in the kingdom, the hotel does not permit shorts, skirts or tank tops. It asks that guests dress modestly, either in local attire, smart casual or formal wear.

The hotel’s website said on Monday: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the hotel’s internet and telephone lines are currently disconnected until further notice.” A spokesman for the hotel did not immediately respond to a request on Monday night for a comment about the detained guests.

In some studies, processed red meat in large amounts is associated with an increased relative risk of developing cancer. The absolute risk, however, is often quite small. If I ate an extra serving of bacon a day, every day, my lifetime risk of colon cancer would go up less than one-half of 1 percent. Even then, it’s debatable.

Nevertheless, we’ve become more and more susceptible to arguments that we must avoid certain foods completely. When one panic-du-jour wanes, we find another focus for our fears. We demonized fats. Then cholesterol. Then meat.

For some people in recent years, gluten has become the enemy, even though wheat accounts for about 20 percent of the calories consumed worldwide, more than pretty much any other food. Fewer than 1 percent of people in the United States have a wheat allergy, and fewer than 1 percent have celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that requires sufferers to abstain from gluten. Gluten sensitivity (the catchall disorder that leads many Americans to abstain from gluten) is not well defined, and most people who self-diagnose don’t meet the criteria.

Nonetheless, at least one in five Americans regularly chooses gluten-free foods, according to a 2015 poll. Sales of products with gluten-free labels rose to $23 billion worldwide in 2014, up from $11.5 billion worldwide in 2010.

Gluten-free diets can lead to deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin B, folate and iron. Compared with regular bagels, gluten-free ones can have a quarter more calories, two and a half times the fat, half the fiber and twice the sugar. They also cost more.

The hullabaloo over gluten echoes the panic over MSG that began roughly half a century ago, and which has yet to fully subside. MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is nothing more than a single sodium atom added to glutamic acid — an amino acid that is a key part of the mechanism by which our cells create energy. Without it, all oxygen-dependent life as we know it would die.

A 1968 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine started the frenzy; the writer reported feeling numbness, weakness and palpitations after eating at a Chinese restaurant. A few limited studies followed, along with a spate of news articles. Before long, nutrition experts and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were calling for MSG to be banned. The Food and Drug Administration never had to step in; food companies saw the writing on the wall, and dropped MSG voluntarily.

Many people still wrongly believe that MSG is poison. We certainly don’t need MSG in our diet, but we also don’t need to waste effort avoiding it. Our aversion to it shows how susceptible we are to misinterpreting scientific research and how slow we are to update our thinking when better research becomes available. There’s no evidence that people suffer disproportionately from the afflictions — now ranging from headaches to asthma — that MSG-averse cultures commonly associate with this ingredient. In studies all over the world, the case against MSG just doesn’t hold up.

Too often, we fail to think critically about scientific evidence. Genetically modified organisms are perhaps the best example of this.

G.M.O.s are, in theory, one of our best bets for feeding the planet’s growing population. When a 2015 Pew poll asked Americans whether they thought it was generally safe or unsafe to eat modified foods, almost 60 percent said it was unsafe. The same poll asked scientists from the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same question. Only 11 percent of them thought G.M.O.s were unsafe.

Most Americans, at least according to this poll, don’t seem to care what scientists think. In fact, Americans disagree with scientists on this issue more than just about any other, including a host of contentious topics such as vaccines, evolution and even global warming.

If people want to avoid foods, even if there’s no reason to, is that really a problem?

The answer is: yes. Because it makes food scary. And being afraid of food with no real reason is unscientific — part of the dangerous trend of anti-intellectualism that we confront in many places today.

Food should be a cause for pleasure, not panic. For most people, it’s entirely possible to eat more healthfully without living in terror or struggling to avoid certain foods altogether.

In 2004, there were about 500 A.C.L. operations at those hospitals; in 2014, there were more than 2,500, he reports.

“This is a major issue for me,” said Kocher, who does more than 150 A.C.L. reconstructions a year, mostly in adolescents. “If a 15-year-old gets arthritis in 10 years, knee replacement is not a great option at age 25.”

One of the few long-term studies was done carried out by Britt Elin Oiestad, a physical therapy researcher at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, who followed 181 people for 10 to 15 years after A.C.L. surgery. Seventy-four percent developed arthritis that could be seen on X-rays. Some of those patients had yet to feel arthritic pain; 41 percent of those studied had reported knee pain that indicated arthritis.



“It’s scary,” Oiestad said.

While knee injuries have received the most attention in research on arthritis risk, other joints are not immune, said Dr. Brett Owens, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Brown University Alpert Medical School. People who repeatedly sprain an ankle are at risk, he said. And up to 40 percent of those who dislocate a shoulder get arthritis within about 15 years, he said.

What researchers want to know is this: Why do these injuries precipitate arthritis?

Is the answer a bone bruise that injures cartilage? Chemical changes that happen as the body tries to repair the injury? An intrinsic instability of the knee?

And would surgical methods that more closely reproduce an individual’s original knee anatomy reduce the risk?

Research is not definitive but seems to support all of the hypotheses, as well as a strong hunch among investigators that there are genetic factors. Owens mentioned “A.C.L. families,” explaining, “I have operated on multiple siblings in a family.”

Doctors say they struggle with telling adolescents who just tore an A.C.L. that arthritis might follow. Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.

“Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”

Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.

Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.

Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.

Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.

Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.

A person can have only two or three knee replacements in a lifetime, Fu told Lalli, and so it was best to wait until he was 50.

Now Lalli is trying to decide whether to let his children play soccer. He has a 5-year-old and 3-year-old twins, and he said they “seem to naturally gravitate toward soccer.”

Lalli, who loves the sport, is torn and has been talking it over with his wife.

“I’m not sure what we will do,” he said.","If You Tear a Knee Ligament, Arthritis Is Likely to Follow in 10 Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/health/arthritis-risk-acl.html

Contrary to how South Korean conservatives and some Americans frame it, the protection, while something to be thankful for, has not been free.

Housewives haven’t been the only South Korean women to toil for the pleasure of American soldiers in the ensuing decades. As detailed by Katharine Moon in her authoritative study “Sex Among Allies: Military Prostitution in U.S.-Korea Relations,” the South Korean military dictatorship coerced women into sex work for American soldiers. Survivors testified to forced testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment while in confinement, all for the health and happiness of our protectors.

Then there is the Status of Forces Agreement, signed between the two nations in 1966 and renewed twice. It has been understood to grant the United States military nearly exclusive jurisdiction over its personnel, such that even high-profile offenses committed by American soldiers against South Korean citizens go unpunished.

One of the most heinous examples happened in 2002 when an American military vehicle ran over two middle-school students, crushing them to death. The perpetrators were shielded from South Korean authorities and a United States military court dismissed the case.

More recently, the United States military has refused to take responsibility for its environmental degradation of its base in central Seoul.

Being an ally has also meant deploying soldiers for America’s wars — to Vietnam, where some 5,000 South Koreans died and many suffered from exposure to the United States-made chemical weapon known as Agent Orange; and to Iraq in the 2000s, despite enormous local protests. Government officials from that time have explained that the Iraq deployment came in response to the Bush administration’s threat to reduce the number of Americans stationed in South Korea.

But the biggest cost of the alliance has been the erosion of South Korea’s sovereign spirit. There is enormous support among South Koreans for the United States military presence, and it isn’t simply a reflection of national goodwill toward America. It speaks volumes about just how much South Korea has become psychologically dependent on a foreign army as a potential barrier against North Korea, despite an annual national defense budget amounting to about 2.7 percent of its G.D.P. and a nearly 650,000-strong military.

Washington knows full well that stationing its soldiers on South Korean soil isn’t an act of charity. America offers protection, but only in return for influence over its lesser allies’ affairs.

Still, many South Korean conservatives consider any critique of the alliance blasphemous, even as Seoul finds itself being called a freeloader by President Trump. He has also demanded that South Korea pay for the American-made missile-defense system deployed here, which has had the effect of provoking Chinese outrage and economic retaliation against South Korea. (In a gesture at damage control, a senior White House official later took back the freeloader statement, admitting South Korea is a “model ally” that spends sufficiently on its own defense, and the administration had to reiterate that Seoul wasn’t being asked to pay for the missile shield, at least for now.)

South Korea has pulled out all the stops to prepare for Mr. Trump’s state visit on Tuesday. Domestic news outlets have been fixated on every detail, fretting over whether his single-night stay means he isn’t invested in South Korea. (He is spending two nights in both Tokyo and Beijing.)

That obsessiveness itself is tragic. Consider Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to incite war here, and the majority of the American public’s indifference to Korean lives — a poll from September found 58 percent of Americans support military action against Pyongyang if peaceful means cannot put a stop to its weapons program, even as a congressional report recently concluded that a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula could leave up to 300,000 people dead in the early days of fighting.

In the age of Trump, South Korea should look to an example set by another longtime American ally. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany didn’t hesitate to say in May that Europe can no longer “completely depend” on the United States. “We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands,” she said.

After being a dutiful ally for more than six decades, it may be time for South Koreans, too, to take their destiny into their own hands.",Is South Korea’s Alliance with the United States Worth It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/trump-south-korea-alliance.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.

Trump’s Asia Trip

President Trump started a five-country trip to Asia over the weekend, arriving in Japan for a series of meetings and public events with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

“Trump was in Japan yesterday, and plans to also visit Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Or, as Trump calls them, ‘China.’” — JAMES CORDEN “Following the president’s trip, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will then kick off his own 13-day trip to apologize for everything Donald Trump says.” — JAMES CORDEN

“On his way to Asia, he stopped off in Hawaii. Of course that’s Obama’s home state — very popular there — so people there did not want to say to Trump, ‘Aloha.’ They wanted to say, ‘Aloha.’ Look it up.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

Jimmy Kimmel looked at the trip from one of his favorite angles: He wondered about the eating habits of Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe and other world leaders.

“For lunch yesterday, before they played golf, they served Trump a hamburger made from American beef. That’s what they said, it’s made from American beef. I always wonder why when the leaders from other countries visit, they do that. Like when the prime minister of Italy was at the White House, they served him pasta. And he’s like, ‘Oh, great, pasta again.’ Why give these people what they already get a better version of all the time? They’re not hamsters that can only eat pellets. They’re people. If you’re going to make Donald Trump a hamburger in Japan, make him a hamburger with Japanese beef. Or maybe — and I know this is crazy — maybe pull him off the children’s menu for five seconds and serve him a bowl of noodles or something.” — JIMMY KIMMEL

Stephen Colbert Reacts to the Texas Church Shooting

Stephen Colbert took a moment during his show to address the mass shooting on Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Tex. He urged viewers to channel their frustration and sadness into a passion for gun control.

“Nothing gets done to control the guns that kill 10,000 people a year around America, not just in these mass killings. And doing nothing, as I’ve said before, is unacceptable. But it’s unnatural, it’s inhuman. It just goes against our nature — we want to fix things. You want to respond to something terrible like this, not just now but at any time in human history.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

The Punchiest Punchlines (Mayoral Edition)

“Mayor Bill de Blasio has a 33-point lead. After hearing this, the New York Giants said, ‘What’s a lead?’” — CONAN O’BRIEN, on Tuesday’s New York City mayoral election “Her name is Juli Briskman, and she just got fired for flipping off Trump’s motorcade. Wait a second, if you can’t give people the finger in traffic, then what’s the point of driving? That’s how we say ‘hello’ in New York! Especially if you’re from out of town. Hey, welcome to Manhattan.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, discussing a woman who was fired from her job after making an obscene gesture at Mr. Trump’s motorcade

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

Back Story

One hundred years ago today, one of the century’s most momentous uprisings hit St. Petersburg. The Russian Revolution’s eventual outcome, the Soviet Union, offered hope for some but delivered suffering for many.

Photo

Throughout the centenary year, we explored the legacy of Communism in a series of Op-Eds, “Red Century.”

Perhaps less noted is how the revolution changed culinary history. Millions of émigrés of the remains of the Russian Empire took their cuisine with them.

“As the American, wandering a foreign land, longs for ham and eggs country style, so does the Russian exile want borsch, the national Russian soup with his meal,” The Times wrote in 1935. “And in New York he gets it.”

A Parisian cookbook from 1938 described borscht as “a Russian soup made from beef, duck, pork belly, garnished with cabbage julienne and beetroot.” (It also provided a Polish version.)

To this day, restaurants in Hong Kong serve “lor soong tong,” a soup derived from the borscht made by migrants from Russia and Eastern Europe who sought refuge in what was then a British colony.

And just last month, Ukraine sought to widen the soup’s global reach on Twitter: “@Google & @Apple, time to have a borscht emoji!”

“President Trump’s tax plan takes dead aim at New York City,” he said. “It would undermine the success that we have achieved, and despite the hype, it would undermine the middle class in this city and, I would say, all over the country.”

The room, which had embraced him with a standing ovation as he mounted the stage, greeted his comments about the tax plan mostly with silence, the sound of cutlery on breakfast plates audible throughout the speech. Applause finally came after Mr. de Blasio celebrated the leadership of Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, on the issue, as well as that of Republican congressmen like Representative Dan Donovan, who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn.

Jay Kriegel, a senior adviser at the Related Companies, a real estate firm, praised Mr. de Blasio’s emphasis on the tax proposal. Mr. Kriegel led a campaign for the New York business community to oppose a similar effort to change the tax deductibility during the Reagan administration.

The Association for a Better New York is opposed to Mr. Trump’s proposal to do away with state and local tax deductions, which have been in place since 1913, and most in attendance on Monday appeared to agree with Mr. de Blasio. But many declined afterward to be quoted on the substance of his address for fear of angering an incumbent mayor on the day before all expected him to be returned to office for another four years.

“This is a guy who has come a long way in four years. Very polished, no teleprompter,” said John H. Banks III, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. “It didn’t surprise me that he didn’t try to make news.”

Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group, agreed, but added that “it would have been better, even better, if he specifically urged the audience” — some of whom are donors to Democrats and Republicans alike — “to express their concerns to particular New York House members who are in favor or on the fence about voting against the legislation.”

By contrast, she said, the mayor’s promise during a brief question-and-answer session with the audience to “definitely address the need for reform of the city’s property tax system was quite specific and firm.”

The choice to host Mr. de Blasio for a major address less than 24 hours before polls open in New York City was not the mayor’s, according to spokeswomen for Mr. de Blasio and the association. After the group invited the mayor, it was the only date they could find that would accommodate schedules as well as the availability of the room.

Shortly after the speech, Mr. de Blasio published an essay with Business Insider, a web publication, on the Republican tax proposal theme, saying it was akin to asking “hardworking New Yorkers” to withdraw $1,000 in cash and then “find a hedge fund manager to give it to.”","As de Blasio Looks to 2nd Term, He Sees a City Threatened by Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-trump-tax-plan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Beyond loans, the team of six curators have been scouting for art from private collections. They have acquired more than 600 works, including Piet Mondrian’s 1922 “Composition With Blue, Red, Yellow and Black,” bought in 2009 for $27.9 million from Christie’s auction of the collection of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Bergé. Another important purchase was a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and Child by Giovanni Bellini, which museum officials say demonstrates a commitment to highlighting works that reflect different religions.

“What is the Louvre Abu Dhabi? It’s a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times,” said Jean-François Charnier, the project’s chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.

Some museum curators feared the Louvre Abu Dhabi’s buying spree could send global art prices surging. But Jean-Patrice Marandel, a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said the new museum “has not affected the market at all.”

“It does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor,” he added.

A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be. Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some “daring positions dealing with religion and nudity.”

Mr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah. It will be exhibited with a sixth-century Quran and gothic Bible.

The museum commissioned a new piece by the American artist Jenny Holzer, who carved three stone walls with historic scripts in cuneiform, Arabic and French, drawing from a Sumerian “Creation Myth” and an essay on self-determination by Michel de Montaigne, the Renaissance philosopher.

“I had to have the content reviewed, but no one said no,” she said, when asked if there were any restrictions. She hopes to create an app for museum visitors to pick their own creation myths to project on the stone walls.

Abu Dhabi officials are already preparing for the future. Mr. Mubarak predicted that the Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a domino effect and that the construction contract for the long-planned Guggenheim Abu Dhabi could be awarded next year. (A Guggenheim spokesman declined to comment.)

In the meantime, Jean-Luc Martinez, the director of the Louvre Museum, said the project has already had a dramatic effect in France. “Thanks to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, our museums were forced to work together after 50 years of development.”

“We have some egos,” he added, with Gallic understatement. “That’s a revolution in mentality.”","Louvre Abu Dhabi, a Cultural Cornerstone Where East Meets West",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/design/louvre-abu-dhabi.html

Private scholarships should be a lifeline for students who want to avoid debt. But there’s an awful glitch in the system: Students who get private scholarships risk losing financial aid they were awarded from their state or school. Their private scholarships don’t save them a dime.

Like many students, when I thought about college I worried most about affording it. Rice University, in Houston, where I am a senior, is known for generous financial aid packages, but I still had to take out student loans to cover the full cost.

As a college freshman, I saw an episode of “Shark Tank” on which an entrepreneur claimed that millions of private scholarships go unused every year. He was pitching Mark Cuban and the other investors on an app that was intended to match students with private scholarships. I was fascinated: Maybe I could avoid taking on thousands of dollars in debt in college. All I had to do was answer a few questions, submit my résumé and personal statement, and wait to collect.

But when I talked with friends who were also concerned about financing college, they told me that I probably shouldn’t bother applying for private scholarships. They told me about a significant wrinkle in my plan. It’s called “scholarship award displacement.”

I learned that any money I received from private companies, my church or even from a crowdsourcing campaign had to be reported to my college or university. The school would then evaluate the reported funds, and could decrease my financial aid by the same amount.

Doesn’t this seem strange? Why should students bother applying for scholarships if colleges are allowed, and in many cases pushed by federal and state regulations, to effectively take them away?

It also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks in the Fremont factory were moving more slowly than other parts of the manufacturing system.

“We are adding robots at the choke points and making the lines go really fast,” Mr. Musk told analysts during a webcast on Wednesday. “Speed is the ultimate weapon.”

Getting to market with the Model 3, which will carry a base price of about $35,000, has been a humbling experience so far. Tesla built just 260 Model 3 sedans in its most recent quarter — considerably short of its target of 1,500.

And the sluggish pace has coincided with a rash of job cuts and allegations of lax safety standards on the assembly line from its workers.

While Wall Street analysts and media coverage have focused on the shortfall in Model 3 production, Mr. Musk concentrated Wednesday on the fact that Tesla expected to deliver record numbers of its higher-priced Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles in the last three months of the year.

But the company also reported wider losses than expected for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Revenue from auto sales increased 8 percent to $2.08 billion, compared with the same period a year ago, but the company lost $619.4 million, versus posting a profit of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2016.

Tesla shares were off nearly 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report and the production update, falling below $306, more than 20 percent lower than their midyear peak.

And even as the company is making plans for a factory in China and possibly more plants in the United States, some analysts are questioning Tesla’s overall competence in the intricate processes of mass vehicle production.

One analyst, Clement Thibault of Investing.com, said Wednesday that Tesla’s vertically integrated manufacturing system — which includes building many of its own major components, like batteries and seats — is out of step with tried-and-true industry practices.

“There’s a reason traditional car companies have an established decentralized business model,” Mr. Thibault said. “Tesla believes it can centralize the process, but lacks any real world evidence to back up its claim.”

Since it began production in late summer, Tesla has sold the new Model 3 only to its employees, rather than begin filling the hundreds of thousands of orders from buyers who have put down $1,000 deposits.

While Mr. Musk has said the employee-only sales strategy was meant to reward Tesla’s work force, analysts have surmised that it was also a way to discover and correct quality problems before the vehicle is made available to the public.

The bottom line, however, is that Tesla has yet to prove that it can meet the huge demand it has created for the new Model 3, and that it is capable of joining the big leagues of auto manufacturing.

Further delays will most likely benefit competitors such as General Motors and Nissan, which offer electric vehicles in the Model 3’s price range. And new electrified models are in the works from automakers like Volkswagen, Daimler and Toyota.

“At this point in the game, all eyes are on the Model 3,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Tesla needs to ensure its production volume is achieved. But perhaps more importantly, Tesla needs to ensure the vehicle is being produced in a quality manner.”

Tesla is experiencing a number of labor-related issues as it works to increase its annual production output to 500,000 vehicles a year from about 100,000.

Last month, the company fired hundreds of workers for what it described as subpar performance. Mr. Musk said on the webcast that the company was looking to hire new employees with skills better suited to its production goals.

But some workers have said that they were dismissed because they supported a union organizing drive conducted with the help of the powerful United Automobile Workers, which represents hourly employees at the three big Detroit automakers.

One worker, Daniel Grant, said he had supported the union effort because of unsafe conditions in the Tesla factory — and he believed he had been fired for it.

“Management pushed us hard, and it created very real risks for us working on the line,” Mr. Grant said in an email. “That’s why I wore a union T-shirt, and that’s why I handed out fliers.”

The U.A.W. has joined workers to file complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the company of harassing and dismissing employees for their organizing activities.

“I don’t believe I was fired for performance,” said Mr. Grant, who said he had been injured on the job and fired a few days later.

Workers have said that Tesla’s production systems can cause injuries linked to repetitive stress. Other employees say that they were not properly trained to handle some hazardous chemicals, and have experienced burns, rashes and eye injuries.

Tesla has said that the dismissals were based only on performance reviews and that it would never act against employees based on their union views. It will not discuss individual cases.

On Tuesday, water and electricity to the camp were shut off, and detainees were supposed to move to temporary housing in Lorengau, a city close by on the island.

Many of the men refused, citing previous attacks by residents in Lorengau. Instead the migrants barricaded themselves inside, using solar power for their phones and digging wells for water as police cars circled.

“It’s very surprising to see it come to this level,” said Jonathan Pryke, Pacific Islands program director for the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “It just seems like a complete mess.”

By Thursday, conditions in the camp appeared to have declined.

One detainee, Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, said the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger, anxiety and the fear of attack and disease.

“Heat, humidity, hunger and incessant mosquitoes are taking their toll,” Mr. Boochani wrote on Facebook. “This is not a hunger strike. It is a situation that the Australian government has created, forcing people into starvation and these harsh conditions by refusing to offer a safe place for resettlement.”

By Friday, detainees said conditions were leading to illness. One asylum seeker, Imran Mohammad, said in a text message that three diabetic men had fallen ill because they were unable to get insulin, and the camp was strewn with garbage.

Who is responsible?

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea each claim the other is responsible for relocating the men until a permanent solution can be found.

Australia has pledged 250 million Australian dollars, or $193 million, for the men’s food and security at the facilities in Lorengau for the next year.

Julie Bishop, Australia’s foreign minister, said on Thursday that it made “no sense” for the detainees to remain at the camp. But Nat Jit Lam, the regional representative of the United Nations’ refugee agency, said the temporary housing was incomplete and unsafe.

“I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay — not in that state,” Mr. Lam told ABC Radio of Australia.

In a statement issued Thursday, the agency said: “Australia remains responsible for the well-being of all those moved to Papua New Guinea until adequate, long-term solutions outside the country are found.”

What will happen to the detainees?

Australia has consistently said it will not accept the men for resettlement.

They have all been given the option of permanent residency in Papua New Guinea, or applying to resettle in Cambodia or Nauru, the location of a second offshore facility run by the Australian government. None of the men still on Manus have accepted the offer, according to reports.

American officials said dozens if not hundreds of refugees from Manus and Nauru would be accepted in the coming weeks and months. About 50 men already moved to the United States in September under a deal brokered by former President Barack Obama.

Jacinda Ardern, the new prime minister of New Zealand, also said this week she would an honor a predecessor’s pledge to accept 150 refugees. The Australian government has been reluctant to allow New Zealand to accept the men, fearing it would open a legal backdoor to Australia.

In the waning days of the campaign, Ms. Guadagno veered to the right on immigration, accusing Mr. Murphy of seeking to turn New Jersey into a “sanctuary state,” releasing a controversial TV ad about an infamous murder in Newark and declaring, inaccurately, that her opponent would allow violent criminals to stay in the country.

Other Notable Races

In the New York City suburbs, several races have turned quite vicious. In the Nassau County race for county executive, a mailer suggests one candidate would “roll out the welcome mat” for the violent street gang MS-13. In the Westchester County executive race, issues have taken a back seat to talk about a Rolex watch, unpaid parking tickets and so-called dark money from a Trump-friendly PAC.

The next district attorney in Suffolk County on Long Island will face pressing questions about how to handle the opioid epidemic and MS-13. The sitting district attorney, who had announced months ago he would not seek re-election, was charged last month with trying to derail a federal investigation into a brutal assault by the county’s former police chief.

The candidates to replace him are Ray Perini, a Republican, and Tim Sini, a Democrat.

And President Trump’s influence on local politics has been deeply felt in Greenwich, Conn., where political newcomers, many of them women, are seeking seats on the council that handles town business.

A Constitutional Convention?

And finally, a statewide proposition, Proposition 1, would force a monthslong, everything-on-the-table examination of New York State’s founding document by authorizing a constitutional convention — the first in the nation in more than a quarter-century.

The question has split some like-minded groups, such as the League of Women Voters of New York and Planned Parenthood, while uniting some conservatives and major labor groups.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

If he pulls this deal off, his political maneuvering could be used as a sort of template for other executives.

Complications are already adding up. Qualcomm is expected to reject the bid as opportunistic and too cheap. And analysts and investors have raised the prospect that a merger of the two companies might be blocked by government regulators, either on antitrust grounds or because Broadcom could still be considered a foreign company buying sensitive technology.

But Mr. Tan and his team have already made moves to address some of those issues. Publicly, Broadcom said the plan to move its legal headquarters to the United States was tied to Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code, including the cutting of corporate tax rates. But getting on the good side of the Trump administration — which will have a say in takeovers like the Qualcomm bid — was another factor, according to a person briefed on the matter.

In an interview, Mr. Tan, 65, played down any connection between his headquarters announcement at the White House and the Qualcomm bid, asserting that the timing had been coincidental.

“We think very long term,” he said. “What we perceive is that the business environment has steadily improved. As we want to grow our business in the long term, that makes it easier to choose to redomicile in the U.S. to sustain our growth trends.”

That Mr. Tan is in the driver’s seat for consolidation in the chip industry reflects his unlikely rise in the technology world. At the White House last Thursday, he recounted being “an 18-year-old skinny kid” from Malaysia who had been able to attend M.I.T. only because he won a scholarship.

He eventually jumped into the chip business, showing off a mastery of operations and an eye for high finance and deal making. Mr. Tan ended up at Broadcom’s predecessor, Avago Technologies, in 2006, soon after the investment firms Silver Lake and KKR bought the company. Avago’s corporate history can be traced back to Hewlett-Packard.

Much of Mr. Tan’s tenure since then has been spent thinking about the long-term future of the semiconductor business. He has long been a proponent of consolidation, buying established chip franchises with healthy profit margins and selling off the parts that are not financially successful.

Mr. Tan’s deal-making streak began in earnest in 2013, when Avago bought LSI, a maker of networking chips, for $6.6 billion. Two years later, Avago bought Emulex for $606 million, and then the much-bigger Broadcom for $37 billion. The deal for Qualcomm would be $130 billion including debt.

Mr. Tan has for years pushed growth by acquisition. Underpinning the strategy is a recognition that the semiconductor business has largely matured. The rate of revolutionary change has slowed, and chip companies have focused more on price competition, leading to lower profit margins. His approach has been to gain scale by buying market leaders and then running those companies more efficiently — while also investing in technologies that customers like Apple want.

The Biggest Tech Deals If accepted, Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm would be the largest tech deal in history. Below are the 12 largest to date (values include debt). Broadcom-Qualcomm Dell-EMC Paypal Spinoff From eBay Qualcomm-NXP JDS-SDL Avago-Broadcom SoftBank-ARM HP Enterprise Spinoff E.D.S Spinoff From G.M.

“Hock’s competitive advantage comes from understanding customer needs and market shifts in the chip space better than anyone in the world,” Kenneth Hao, a managing partner at Silver Lake who helped bring Mr. Tan to Avago, said in a statement.

But consolidation has led to concerns that the chip industry could become concentrated in the hands of just a few big players. Qualcomm itself is in the midst of acquiring NXP Semiconductor for $38.5 billion, while Broadcom is still awaiting national security approval for its $5.5 billion takeover of Brocade Communications.

Some analysts have wondered whether Broadcom, with Singapore as its legal headquarters, could face issues with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government group that examines takeovers for threats to national security. But while a deal could face such a review, neither company believes that it would be the main obstacle to a transaction getting done, according to several people briefed on the bid. Broadcom’s operations are largely in the United States, and its legal base is in Singapore primarily because of that country’s low tax rate.

Antitrust approval may also be a concern. In January, the Federal Trade Commission brought charges against Qualcomm, accusing the company of abusing its monopoly in certain chips by charging unreasonable rates to partners like Apple, a company with which Qualcomm has a series of long-running legal fights. But Republican antitrust enforcers, picked by Mr. Trump, may take a more lenient approach to mergers.

The biggest issue may simply be that Qualcomm believes the current offer, worth about $70 a share, is too low. Qualcomm’s trove of patents — among the most formidable in the world of wireless networking — remains a hugely valuable asset. And the company could also believe that closing the NXP acquisition and reaching either a victory over or a settlement with Apple would lift its stock price.

But Qualcomm, the longtime leader in cellphone chip technology, has been grappling with a sagging stock price and investor wariness that the Apple fight will continue for some time.

On Monday, Qualcomm said that its board was weighing Broadcom’s offer.

Mr. Tan said in the interview that he believed that, should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, he could make peace with Apple.

But to win over Qualcomm, Broadcom may need to do something it hasn’t done before: wage a hostile takeover, including by replacing at least part of its quarry’s board.

Virginia Is Becoming Two States in One

Virginia’s politics are becoming sharply bifurcated by region in ways that reflect the country’s political trends. The so-called “urban crescent,” stretching from the Washington suburbs down to greater Richmond and east toward the Chesapeake Bay, is growing rapidly thanks to an influx of transplants who are transforming it into a Democratic bulwark. The western half of the state, as well as the southern tier bordering North Carolina, are seeing little population growth, and in some places even a decline, while becoming deeply Republican.

These trends are turning Virginia from purple to blue, but it is an uneven progression for Democrats because — as in much of the country — many of their core voters are less likely to vote in nonpresidential years. So while Hillary Clinton carried Prince William County, a booming and ethnically diverse Washington exurb, by 21 points last year, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, only won it by eight points in 2013.

A Virginia Democrat with rural roots such as Mr. Northam, who still carries the accent of his native Eastern Shore, may be able to outperform Mrs. Clinton’s dismal numbers in the Republican-trending rural reaches of the state. But even if Mr. Gillespie performs as well as Mr. Trump in the countryside, it will not be enough to win if he cannot cut into the growing Democratic advantage in Virginia’s population centers, especially in vote-rich northern Virginia. After all, Mr. Trump still lost the state by more than five points even as he dominated rural Virginia.

The Education Divide Could Still Matter

The gulf between college-educated whites and white voters without a college degree was a defining demographic split of the 2016 presidential election, but the divide has not been as pronounced in the elections held since.

Still, could the education gap be poised for a comeback? A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll ahead of the race, among other surveys, showed Mr. Northam holding a clear lead among well-educated white voters, while giving Mr. Gillespie a vast advantage edge among white voters without a degree.

If Mr. Gillespie struggles to run ahead of Mr. Trump among well-educated voters, it might be a warning sign that even establishment-friendly Republicans cannot count on returning to pre-2016 levels among a group that used to lean their way. And it should worry Republicans in historically conservative, well-educated districts across the Sun Belt, like those in Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Houston.

Black Voter Turnout Is Still Crucial for Democrats

In Virginia, African-Americans make up 19 percent of the population, the second highest of any state carried by Hillary Clinton. They have lifted Democrats in the urban centers of downstate Virginia, like Richmond or Norfolk, which combine to rival Northern Virginia’s contribution to statewide Democratic margins.

But Democrats have struggled to rally strong turnout among black voters since President Barack Obama was last on the ballot, even as white Democratic turnout surged in a string of special elections across the country.

More weak turnout among black voters in a regularly scheduled election could be interpreted as a clue that the Obama-era surge is waning, while a stronger turnout would lift Democratic hopes in competitive congressional districts with a sizable African-American population.

How to Read the Tea Leaves as Returns Come In

The early returns in Virginia can often be misleading because Fairfax County, the state’s most populous locality and a pillar of Democratic strength, typically reports its results late at night. But Loudoun County just next door may offer some better, and earlier, insights about the outcome of the race — to say nothing of how high-income moderates are responding to the Trump-era Republican Party. A fast-growing jurisdiction that was heavily farmland until recent decades, Loudoun has become a bellwether for if a Republican can win or even remain competitive in Virginia.

When Mr. Gillespie lost by less than a single point statewide when he ran against Senator Mark Warner in 2014, the Republican carried Loudoun by about 450 votes.

Another large locality that will be telling is Virginia Beach. A hub of active-duty and retired military, it often favors Republicans, including Mr. Trump last year. But Mr. Northam lives in nearby Norfolk and if he is able to come close to breaking even in Virginia Beach it will greatly complicate Mr. Gillespie’s path to victory.

____

Downballot Races Could Make a Difference

While the governor’s race has gotten the bulk of the attention in Virginia, all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also up for grabs. Democrats, reeling from their losses last year and determined to cut into the Republican House majority, have fielded candidates against 54 of the 66 House Republicans.

And while it is usually the top of the ticket that drives turnout, the two parties have poured so much money into a group of contested House races that there may be something of an updraft in a handful of increasingly diverse districts.

This is most likely to happen in Prince William County and a pair of nearby independent cities, Manassas and Manassas Park, which include growing Hispanic populations and have a seen a surge in early voting participation compared to the governor’s race four years ago.

How the New Jersey Governor’s Race Could Go

The contest to replace Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey has largely flown under the national radar because Mr. Murphy has so dominated the race. But New Jersey offers a potential boon to Democrats eager to consolidate control in more liberal-leaning states.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Should Mr. Murphy win, New Jersey would become the sixth state in the country to have Democrats in control of both the statehouse and the state Legislature. Look for Mr. Murphy to exceed previous candidates in the heavily urban northern part of the state, particularly Hudson, Essex and Bergen counties, to lock the election up early.

What to Watch in Other Races Across the Country

There are a number of other regularly scheduled and special elections across the country on Tuesday. In Washington State, if Democrats win a hotly contested State Senate election in the Seattle suburbs, they could take full control of state government and end up with a “blue wall” along the West Coast.

The stakes are somewhat lower in county executive races in Westchester, N.Y. and Nassau County, N.Y., but each will be watched as another indicator of how Republicans are holding up in traditionally Republican, well-educated areas. Here is a breakdown of key issues in New York-area races, including the one for New York City mayor.

And there is a Maine ballot measure that would expand Medicaid over the wishes of the state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage. Not only would it provide health care to thousands of low-income Maine residents, but it will be taken as a measure of the popularity of the Affordable Care Act after Republicans failed to repeal the law this year.",What to Watch For in Virginia: Governor’s Race Is Test of Trump’s Impact,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/election-day-2017.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.","Some of that is simply politics. But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

A Lesson to Learn?

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

What Doesn’t: Crime, Race or Mental Health

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Mass Shootings Happen Everywhere

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the world’s weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 incident. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

Virginia Is Becoming Two States in One

Virginia’s politics are becoming sharply bifurcated by region in ways that reflect the country’s political trends. The so-called “urban crescent,” stretching from the Washington suburbs down to greater Richmond and east toward the Chesapeake Bay, is growing rapidly thanks to an influx of transplants who are transforming it into a Democratic bulwark. The western half of the state, as well as the southern tier bordering North Carolina, are seeing little population growth, and in some places even a decline, while becoming deeply Republican.

These trends are turning Virginia from purple to blue, but it is an uneven progression for Democrats because — as in much of the country — many of their core voters are less likely to vote in nonpresidential years. So while Hillary Clinton carried Prince William County, a booming and ethnically diverse Washington exurb, by 21 points last year, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, only won it by eight points in 2013.

A Virginia Democrat with rural roots such as Mr. Northam, who still carries the accent of his native Eastern Shore, may be able to outperform Mrs. Clinton’s dismal numbers in the Republican-trending rural reaches of the state. But even if Mr. Gillespie performs as well as Mr. Trump in the countryside, it will not be enough to win if he cannot cut into the growing Democratic advantage in Virginia’s population centers, especially in vote-rich northern Virginia. After all, Mr. Trump still lost the state by more than five points even as he dominated rural Virginia.

The Education Divide Could Still Matter

The gulf between college-educated whites and white voters without a college degree was a defining demographic split of the 2016 presidential election, but the divide has not been as pronounced in the elections held since.

Still, could the education gap be poised for a comeback? A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll ahead of the race, among other surveys, showed Mr. Northam holding a clear lead among well-educated white voters, while giving Mr. Gillespie a vast advantage edge among white voters without a degree.

If Mr. Gillespie struggles to run ahead of Mr. Trump among well-educated voters, it might be a warning sign that even establishment-friendly Republicans cannot count on returning to pre-2016 levels among a group that used to lean their way. And it should worry Republicans in historically conservative, well-educated districts across the Sun Belt, like those in Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Houston.

Black Voter Turnout Is Still Crucial for Democrats

In Virginia, African-Americans make up 19 percent of the population, the second highest of any state carried by Hillary Clinton. They have lifted Democrats in the urban centers of downstate Virginia, like Richmond or Norfolk, which combine to rival Northern Virginia’s contribution to statewide Democratic margins.

But Democrats have struggled to rally strong turnout among black voters since President Barack Obama was last on the ballot, even as white Democratic turnout surged in a string of special elections across the country.

More weak turnout among black voters in a regularly scheduled election could be interpreted as a clue that the Obama-era surge is waning, while a stronger turnout would lift Democratic hopes in competitive congressional districts with a sizable African-American population.

How to Read the Tea Leaves as Returns Come In

The early returns in Virginia can often be misleading because Fairfax County, the state’s most populous locality and a pillar of Democratic strength, typically reports its results late at night. But Loudoun County just next door may offer some better, and earlier, insights about the outcome of the race — to say nothing of how high-income moderates are responding to the Trump-era Republican Party. A fast-growing jurisdiction that was heavily farmland until recent decades, Loudoun has become a bellwether for if a Republican can win or even remain competitive in Virginia.

When Mr. Gillespie lost by less than a single point statewide when he ran against Senator Mark Warner in 2014, the Republican carried Loudoun by about 450 votes.

Another large locality that will be telling is Virginia Beach. A hub of active-duty and retired military, it often favors Republicans, including Mr. Trump last year. But Mr. Northam lives in nearby Norfolk and if he is able to come close to breaking even in Virginia Beach it will greatly complicate Mr. Gillespie’s path to victory.

Downballot Races Could Make a Difference

While the governor’s race has gotten the bulk of the attention in Virginia, all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also up for grabs. Democrats, reeling from their losses last year and determined to cut into the Republican House majority, have fielded candidates against 54 of the 66 House Republicans.

And while it is usually the top of the ticket that drives turnout, the two parties have poured so much money into a group of contested House races that there may be something of an updraft in a handful of increasingly diverse districts.

This is most likely to happen in Prince William County and a pair of nearby independent cities, Manassas and Manassas Park, which include growing Hispanic populations and have a seen a surge in early voting participation compared to the governor’s race four years ago.

How the New Jersey Governor’s Race Could Go

The contest to replace Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey has largely flown under the national radar because Mr. Murphy has so dominated the race. But New Jersey offers a potential boon to Democrats eager to consolidate control in more liberal-leaning states.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Should Mr. Murphy win, New Jersey would become the sixth state in the country to have Democrats in control of both the statehouse and the state Legislature. Look for Mr. Murphy to exceed previous candidates in the heavily urban northern part of the state, particularly Hudson, Essex and Bergen counties, to lock the election up early.

What to Watch in Other Races Across the Country

There are a number of other regularly scheduled and special elections across the country on Tuesday. In Washington State, if Democrats win a hotly contested State Senate election in the Seattle suburbs, they could take full control of state government and end up with a “blue wall” along the West Coast.

The stakes are somewhat lower in county executive races in Westchester, N.Y. and Nassau County, N.Y., but each will be watched as another indicator of how Republicans are holding up in traditionally Republican, well-educated areas. Here is a breakdown of key issues in New York-area races, including the one for New York City mayor.

And there is a Maine ballot measure that would expand Medicaid over the wishes of the state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage. Not only would it provide health care to thousands of low-income Maine residents, but it will be taken as a measure of the popularity of the Affordable Care Act after Republicans failed to repeal the law this year.",What to Watch For in Virginia: Governor’s Race Is Test of Trump’s Impact,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/election-day-2017.html

Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home. Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.

I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.

There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders. A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.

There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets. One of the most frequent excuses: “I’m only going to the store (or the gym).” Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds. Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.

“A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds,” said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. “All it takes is gravity – the distance to the ground – to cause a head injury.”

Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury. “There’s often a rebellion aspect among teens,” Mr. Swart said. “They say, ‘All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe. Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.’” College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.

I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle. I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases I’ve observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.

The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the child’s (or adult’s) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures. When the straps are too loose (or, as I’ve often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.

The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head. The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.

“A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt – it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it,” Mr. Swart said.

Another excuse I’ve heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions. And that is true. You don’t even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion. A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head. What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.

If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones. His organization had three “extremely cheap” helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three “very expensive” ones ($150 and above) and, he said, “their performance level was almost identical.”

So if you’re not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said. They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.

Now, don that helmet, enjoy the ride and come home safe and sound.",Buckle Up a Helmet to Save a Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/well/buckle-up-a-helmet-to-save-a-life.html

Eliminating or weakening Energy Star and other efficiency programs is absolutely going in the wrong direction.

Energy efficiency is not new — it was our grandparents’ energy policy: Don’t waste. Save as much as you can for later when you, or future generations, might need it.

We need energy efficiency to accommodate emerging technologies and population growth, which are putting demands on our electricity grids that our grandparents never imagined. We can do so much more than shutting off our lights or keeping a close eye on the thermostat.

That’s where smart policy and programs come into play.

Our federal agencies run some of the most innovative efficiency programs in the world. They work with American manufacturers on the latest efficiency technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness. They develop efficiency standards for household appliances, saving families an average of $500 per year. They provide testing and expertise to local and state governments trying to adopt the most effective building-efficiency codes for homes and commercial buildings.

This is not federal bureaucracy run amok. It’s good government that will save taxpayers money and drive our economy. To critics who say that “government intervention isn’t needed to save energy” or “efficiency standards are intrusive federal mandates,” the best response is simply to invoke a decades-long record of economic and environmental success across the nation, dating back at least 30 years, when the first legislation authorizing federal efficiency standards was signed by President Ronald Reagan.

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html

Medical journals have published case reports of allergic responses to food additives, including anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction that causes the throat to constrict.
But many allergists say such reactions are extremely rare, noting that the reports are anecdotal and that rigorous double-blinded studies have not found evidence that allergies to food additives exist.
(Dr. Simon acknowledged he has served as a consultant on food additives for the International Association of Color Manufacturers.)
Unlike severe allergic reactions to a food, like peanuts, which occur immediately, the reactions to additives tend to be delayed for several hours or even days, making them difficult to trace, he said, and there are no good diagnostic tools for identifying food additive allergies.","Doctors disagree on whether food additives like dyes, preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers and other substances can provoke a true allergic reaction.

But many allergists say such reactions are extremely rare, noting that the reports are anecdotal and that rigorous double-blinded studies have not found evidence that allergies to food additives exist.

“It’s very, very rare to see hives from a chemical that’s a food additive, because these are small molecules that typically don’t trigger allergic reactions,” said Dr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “No one’s saying it doesn’t happen, but the reports in the literature are handfuls — they’re not in the thousands.”

In 1986, however, after more than a dozen deaths were linked to severe allergic reactions to sulfite preservatives used to prevent green vegetables from turning brown, the Food and Drug Administration banned restaurants from using sulfites on raw fruits and vegetables.

The agency also requires foods containing yellow dye No. 5 to list the color on the label, saying the dye can cause hives in rare cases, estimated at “fewer than one in 10,000 people.”

In recent years, however, as consumer demand for natural foods has risen, food manufacturers have been replacing synthetic additives with natural ones derived from plants, insects and other animal products. These natural substances are more likely to provoke an allergic reaction because they contain proteins that our immune systems might react to, said Dr. Ronald Simon, an allergist and immunologist at Scripps Clinic Carmel Valley in San Diego, who reviewed the literature for UpToDate, a clinical information resource used by doctors.

These natural additives include substances like a red food dye called carmine or cochineal extract, which is made from insects; a yellow dye made from the fruit of the annatto tree; psyllium, a source of dietary fiber derived from seed husks; and guar gum, which is made from a bean and is used as a binder and emulsifier in food and drugs. All of these have been implicated in rare cases of anaphylaxis.

Allergic reactions have also been reported from carrageenin, a thickener derived from seaweed; the jelling agent pectin; gelatin; and Mycoprotein/, a fermented fungus used as a meat substitute and marketed under the brand name Quorn.

Our immune system recognizes these natural proteins, Dr. Simon said, “because it evolved to protect us against invading organisms and to recognize protein structures in fungi and bacteria or cancer cells.” He said the immune system is less likely to recognize a synthetic additive. (Dr. Simon acknowledged he has served as a consultant on food additives for the International Association of Color Manufacturers.)

Dr. Swerlick, the dermatologist who treated Ms. Eisenberg, agreed that reactions to synthetic additives are rare and not well understood, making them even more difficult to identify. In a 2013 paper, he described 11 patients he had seen over a five-year period, all of whom came in with chronic skin disorders that cleared up significantly when drugs containing coloring were replaced by dye-free medications. (Skeptics say that hives generally come and go and there is no proof that the removal of dyes caused the patients’ skin to clear.)

Each of Dr. Swerlick’s cases was slightly different, he said, so it was “a bit of detective work.” One 61-year-old patient had chronic skin problems on his hand, but the rash flared up suddenly, shortly after he refilled a prescription for diabetes pills and noticed that the color had changed from off-white to dark purple. The new pills, it turned out, contained a blue dye. Another patient, a 42-year-old man, had suffered from a rash for almost a year but noticed it resolved when he went on vacation and left his toothpaste, which contained a blue dye, at home.

Many of the patients had “a drug allergy list that’s 20 drugs long,” Dr. Swerlick said. “You realize they can’t be allergic to all these medications. It must be something common to all of them, like a dye. That’s one of the clues.”

He said people concerned about dye additives should watch for reactions to items that contain food coloring, such as red velvet cake and drinks like Powerade and Crystal Light. Patients can look up the ingredients in prescription and nonprescription drugs by reading the label or using the online resource Daily Med.

Unlike severe allergic reactions to a food, like peanuts, which occur immediately, the reactions to additives tend to be delayed for several hours or even days, making them difficult to trace, he said, and there are no good diagnostic tools for identifying food additive allergies. One hint that you may have an allergy to an additive is if you develop a reaction to a prepared product or a restaurant item, even though you tolerate the same food when you make it at home.

“There’s reason to be skeptical,” Dr. Swerlick said. “But I think the allergy community historically has equated absence of proof with proof of absence.”",Could You Be Allergic to Additives in Food or Drugs?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/well/eat/could-you-be-allergic-to-additives-in-food-or-drugs.html

And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

What Doesn’t: Crime, Race or Mental Health

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Mass Shootings Happen Everywhere

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the world’s weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 incident. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology. It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails. And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now. Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said.

Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car. If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.

Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the driver’s seat. On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.

Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, has not said much about how it plans to make money despite maintaining what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors. Waymo said its autonomous vehicles have driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads — with safety drivers — as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator.

In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first application of Waymo’s driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.

Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.

About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average.
“You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,” Mr. Mazur said.
But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main storyDemocrats, meanwhile, have been quick to seize on analyses finding middle-class tax increases.","The Times analysis looks at the direct effect of the tax changes on Americans’ incomes and does not account for changes in economic growth that Republicans say will amplify the impact of the tax cut and deliver higher wages to Americans across the income spectrum. Economic models disagree about the size of those effects, but generally agree they would be smaller in the initial years after a bill was passed since the tax cuts would take a while to filter throughout the economy.

Still, Republican leaders in Congress and the White House haven’t just argued that the bill would have broader economic advantages. Rather, they have repeatedly described it as a tax cut for middle-class families.

“This whole tax reform is designed for the middle-class family that’s working so hard, for that Main Street business that’s working so hard,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on MSNBC on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, went further, telling the MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt over the weekend that “nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase” under the bill.

Few independent economists find evidence to support that claim. Analyses published since the plan was introduced last week have consistently found that some middle-class families would see their taxes go up immediately, compared with existing law. One such analysis, from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 8 percent of middle-income earners would pay more in 2018 — and 21 percent in 2027 — with upper-middle-class taxpayers more likely to see their taxes rise.

The Times analysis accounts for the differing financial situations of Americans who look relatively similar on paper. It shows significant differences in how “typical” families might fare under the Republican bill.

Consider, for example, a four-person family earning about $75,000 a year. There are nearly 150,000 such taxpayers in the United States, according to data from the Census Bureau. About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average. But the other third’s taxes would go up, by nearly $700 on average, and some would pay thousands of dollars more than under current law.

The Benefit for the Middle Class Under the Republican tax proposal, 68 percent of taxpayers who earned between about $50,000 and $160,000 in a family of three would get a tax cut, but 29 percent would see their taxes rise. In about a decade, the number who got a tax cut would decrease to 53 percent. 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100% PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100%

The bill is devised to allow millions of Americans to simplify their tax returns — to file, as Republican leaders put it, “on a postcard.” The plan would most likely simplify taxes for some taxpayers, who would choose to take advantage of the plan’s more generous standard deduction. But the analysis suggests that among lower- and middle-class families, the greatest benefits of the bill flow to those taxpayers who already file simple returns and do not itemize their taxes.

The millions losing out under the bill would largely be families with more complicated finances, who now generally itemize their deductions. The bill would eliminate many common and valuable tax deductions that, in some cases, would eliminate thousands of dollars in tax benefits. This would be particularly acute for taxpayers who deducted state and local income and property tax payments, interest on student loans, or the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers.

The plan could be particularly costly for Americans facing large medical bills. Nearly nine million taxpayers collectively deducted about $84 billion in medical expenses from their taxes in 2015. The House bill would eliminate that deduction.

Mark Mazur, the director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said any attempt to reform the tax system — as opposed to just a broad-based tax cut — would have winners and losers. But he noted that many of the provisions that would benefit middle-class taxpayers in the House bill were set to expire or lose value over time.

“You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,” Mr. Mazur said. “That’s not what this is.”

The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. The organization’s model does not yet fully account for the tax bill’s treatment of so-called pass-through income, which is business income that is taxed at the individual rate under current law. And because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances.

The source of the tax increases is rooted in the structure of the Republican bill. The plan would roughly double the size of the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,200 for individuals. That could yield a substantial tax cut for many middle- and lower-income families that now take the standard deduction, or whose itemized deductions amount to less than those thresholds.

But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.

Its elimination of the deduction for medical expenses could hit some families particularly hard because medical bills can be so large, unpredictable and unavoidable. Of the roughly 6.5 million middle-class families whose taxes would rise in 2018 under the bill, about 800,000 took advantage of the medical expense provision, deducting more than $17,000 on average from their taxes. Nearly 200,000 middle-class families owed no income tax under the current law at least in part because the medical-expense exemption offset their taxable income.

The Republican proposal would also be costly for many large families. That’s because, in addition to raising the standard deduction, the plan would eliminate the so-called personal exemption, which lets most taxpayers deduct about $4,000 for every person in their household. The plan would replace the exemption with an expanded child tax credit, but that would fill only part of the gap for many families. Fewer than 40 percent of middle-class families with at least three children would receive a tax cut under the plan, compared with nearly 80 percent of families without children.

Negotiations over the House bill are continuing, and details could change. In the Senate, Republicans such as Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have pushed to expand the child tax credit further, a move that could mitigate many of the tax increases on middle-class families, but that would force leaders to find other sources of revenue to offset the change.

Expect to see a lot of Rosalie Jones today.

She’s the New York suffragist on the “I Voted” stickers being distributed at polling locations across the city.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced this week that the state would create two suffragist statues — one of Ms. Jones, and the other of Sojourner Truth — in New York.

Ms. Truth, who was born into slavery and was sold three times before escaping to freedom in 1826, was a prominent women’s rights advocate and abolitionist until she died in the late 1800s. Her statue will be erected on the Empire State Trail in Ulster County.

Ms. Jones led a two-week, 150-mile trek on foot from New York City to Albany with other “suffragist pilgrims” to hand-deliver a petition to the governor in 1912. (Women won the right to vote in New York five years later.) Her statue will be erected in Cold Spring Harbor State Park on Long Island.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — One minute the Holcombes were a tight-knit family praying in the tiny church on Fourth Street.

The next, eight of them were gone.

Bryan and Karla Holcombe, a guest preacher and his wife, were dead.

Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, gone. Their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, gone.

And four of their grandchildren — Noah, Emily, Megan and Greg — gone.

Twenty-six people were killed when Devin P. Kelley opened fire on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in this small Texas town, including the child Crystal was carrying, officials said. According to the Wilson County sheriff, Joe Tackitt Jr., as many as half of the victims were children.

And the gunman nearly wiped out the Holcombe family, leaving Joe Holcombe, 86, Bryan’s father, to mourn the loss of the generations he had raised. “We know where they are now,” he said in an interview, his voice strained by exhaustion. “All of our family members, they’re all Christian. And it won’t be long until we’re with them.”

It is a cruelty of mass shootings that they sometimes inflict double or triple blows on families, killing one brother while injuring another. But even in a nation accustomed to attacks of larger and larger proportions, the scale of the Holcombes’ loss was particularly brutal.

The Holcombes lived in homes near one another on family land in the woods around Sutherland Springs. The younger generations lived in double-wide trailers and the grandparents in a modern log cabin. “They weren’t clandestine,” said Terry Bolf, a longtime friend of the family. “Their gate was always open.” Family life centered on religion. Bryan Holcombe, who also ministered at the Wilson County jail, was a guest preacher at First Baptist in Sutherland Springs on the day he died.

The day before, his daughter-in-law Crystal was at the county 4-H competition surrounded by her children, at least one of whom won an award, said Bob Baker, a Sutherland Springs resident who attended the event. A few days before that, Noah, 18 months, was bouncing on employees’ desks at her father’s office, digging into Halloween jack-o’-lanterns full of leftover candy.

Her father, Marc Daniel Holcombe, went by Danny, and worked as a mechanic at F&W Electrical in Floresville.

At F&W on Monday, employees were red-eyed and trembling. One of the star employees was dead. Danny had just celebrated his 15-year anniversary there. He worked 10- to 12-hour days and was known in the company as “MacGyver” because he could find a fix to nearly any problem.

He took his faith seriously and liked to pull up Bible verses using an app on his phone. When he saw Jennifer Kincaid last week and spotted a fog light out on her car, he insisted he would fix it on Monday. “I think that’s hit everyone hard, to know that not only is he gone,” Ms. Kincaid said, “but his daughter is gone as well.”

Photo

Danny and his wife had tried for a baby for a long time, Ms. Kincaid added, and when she got pregnant, his wife “quit her job and devoted her life to having that baby and being a mom.”

Danny and his father, Bryan, were “clones,” said another colleague, Jay Dunn. They both had red beards and shared a quirky sense of humor. Mr. Dunn said that whenever they were patching up a machine and were not sure the fix would last, Danny would joke that “it would hold until the Rapture.”

Bryan was a local business owner who made custom canvas covers for trailers, Mr. Dunn said. Danny’s mother, Karla, was involved in the First Baptist vacation Bible school, and she ran a Bible school clinic for other churches, even lending props to them.

The family was also close to the pastor at First Baptist, Frank Pomeroy, who lost his daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, a seventh grader at Briesemeister Middle School.

The community hosted a vigil for victims on Monday, gathering to remember the Holcombes and others. But Mr. Dunn said he had not attended because “their entire family is pretty much gone.”

But just looking at how different income groups fare is only part of the story. Even among high-income Americans, the plan seems designed to reward those who don’t work for a living — or more precisely, the less you actually do to earn your income, the bigger your tax break. Business owners would owe less in taxes than high-earning professionals; passive investors, who just sit there and collect dividends, would owe less than those who at least run their businesses. And wealthy heirs, who did nothing to earn their wealth except choose the right parents, would pay no taxes at all.

Wait, there’s more. You may have heard that the plan would end the deductions for state and local income and sales taxes — which is true, if you’re an ordinary working American. But if you’re a business owner — or can pretend to be a business owner, since the law would open huge new opportunities for tax avoidance — you would still be able to deduct those taxes as business expenses.

In short, Trumpist tax policy is as elitist if not more elitist and anti-populist than the policies of previous Republican administrations. Same old, same old.

But what about Trump’s more or less naked white nationalism? Isn’t that a departure? Well, how different is it from Ronald Reagan’s talk about welfare queens driving Cadillacs, or the elder Bush’s Willie Horton ad? And in any case, we don’t have to argue about the past: Just look at how Ed Gillespie has campaigned in Virginia over the past few months.

Gillespie is, as I said, a consummate Republican insider, former chairman of the Republican National Committee and counselor to George W. Bush. So what does it say about the Republican establishment and its values that he has run a campaign completely focused on stirring up white racial hostility? As The Washington Post put it, “His campaign’s thrust has not been just a dog whistle to the intolerant, racially resentful parts of the Republican base; it’s been a mating call.”

So has Gillespie faced strong criticism from establishment Republicans for waging such a gutter campaign? No — there has been a bit of tut-tutting from lower-level figures, but hardly anything from people whose condemnation might matter.

In particular, if “never Trump” Republicans really wanted to purge Trumpism from the party, they’d be urging voters to reject Gillespie for his vile tactics.

7 Reasons New Yorkers Should Care About Election Day Image Mayor Bill de Blasio received 74 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary on Sept. 12. But turnout was low: About 435,000 Democrats voted, the third lowest total since at least the mid-1960s. Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times

Today is Election Day, which, in large measure in the New York region, is where civic duty runs headlong into predictable outcomes — portending a low-energy, low-turnout sort of event.

Mayor Bill de Blasio , a Democrat, is expected to coast to re-election in New York City over his Republican challenger, Nicole Malliotakis ; in the New Jersey governor’s race, Philip D. Murphy , a Democrat, holds a double-digit lead over Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno , a Republican.

So why should New Yorkers care about Election Day? We’ll give you seven reasons and story lines why.

1. TURNOUT: Mr. de Blasio has spent much of his re-election campaign pushing get-out-the-vote efforts, after only about 14 percent of registered Democratic voters turned out for the New York City primary in September. The mayor would not only like to beat his opponents by an overwhelming margin, he wants to be able to say that his campaign energized New Yorkers to vote in what has been a low-key election.

2. MANDATE: The margin of Mr. de Blasio’s victory — and his overall percentage of the vote — will either deliver him a plausible mandate, or deliver a blow to his second-term influence right at the start. To succeed with many of his proposed policies, from higher taxes on the wealthy to expanded early childhood education, the mayor needs support from Albany. He will find himself with even less sway in the state capital if his challengers together take a large percentage of the vote.

3. COATTAILS: Does Mr. de Blasio have coattails? Several races in the City Council are tight . Should Democratic candidates in Brooklyn with ties to Mr. de Blasio prevail — such as Justin L. Brannan in Bay Ridge or Mathieu Eugene in central Brooklyn — the mayor may be in a better position to influence the race for City Council speaker , one in which he is expected to become involved in after the election.

4. TRUMP: In Westchester and Nassau Counties, the contested county executive races have been viewed as local bellwether tests of how President Trump’s first 10 months in office are being seen in the suburbs. Although there are more registered Democrats than Republicans in both counties, Republicans have traditionally held the county executive seats.

5. PROPOSITIONS: There are a total of five ballot measures in New York and New Jersey, none more contentious than Proposition 1 in New York, which offers voters a chance to convene a constitutional convention. There hasn’t been one in the United States for a quarter of a century, and opponents here are spending a lot of money to keep that streak. In theory, many of the worst practices of Albany could be fixed. Then again, many lawmakers and even civil liberties groups say that more harm than good would come of it.

6. CIVIC DUTY: The number of votes cast for mayor in New York City has fallen in each of the last four elections (since more than 1.5 million votes were cast in 2001). Not to get all preachy, but going out to vote today might be seen as a chance not only to cast a ballot for a candidate but also to boost the health of our democracy.

7. MUSIC: Four years ago, the mayor emerged to the victory stage to Lorde’s “Royals,” which featured the chorus, “We’ll never be royals.” It was a distinctive statement, following 12 years of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and Mr. de Blasio’s image as a champion of the underclass. Assuming he wins, his choice of victory song will be noticed.

China plans to return the favor when Mr. Trump arrives Wednesday for what the Chinese Foreign Ministry says is his first visit to Beijing. The Chinese are calling it “a state visit-plus,” promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City.

The welcome is planned to make Mr. Trump feel important, reflecting the belief of at least some Chinese officials that they know just how to handle an outspoken tycoon with a big ego.

But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his “China Dream” — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world.

Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a “new type of great power relations,” the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.

The concept is closely associated with Mr. Xi, who has been pitching it since he was vice president. But the Obama administration viewed it as code for allowing China to establish a sphere of influence in Asia, with the United States withdrawing to minimize conflict.

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told state news media last week he hoped Mr. Trump’s visit would revive the idea and allow the two nations to build a “constructive partnership.” The vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, said the two leaders would discuss a “blueprint” for developing relations.

Chinese analysts believe the timing works to Mr. Xi’s advantage. Mr. Trump will be arriving as he faces new questions about the Russia investigation at home and criticism abroad for appearing to abandon American leadership on issues from climate change to trade liberalization.

In contrast, Mr. Xi has been basking in the aftermath of a party congress last month that elevated him to the same status as the nation’s founding father, Mao Zedong.

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Xi has positioned China as a stable alternative to the United States, willing to take on the obligations of global leadership and invest in big infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe much as the United States did after World War II.

“China, for the first time, is not in a humble position regarding the United States,” said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Usually the American president has the advantage. This is the first time there is an equal relationship between the two leaders.”

Mr. Xi is now the unquestioned paramount leader of China, Professor Yan added, while Mr. Trump only “represents himself.”

Asked on Sunday about the disparity, Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States. “We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Xi may also be counting on personal chemistry between the two men. They appeared to bond when they first met at Mr. Trump’s Florida estate in April, and Mr. Trump has since called Mr. Xi numerous times, often to ask him to get tougher on North Korea.

In interviews, Mr. Trump has frequently praised Mr. Xi and described him as a friend, often in effusive terms unusual for an American president speaking of the leader of China’s authoritarian, one-party state. At times, Mr. Trump has even repeated points made by Mr. Xi in their conversations.

Still, Chinese officials, known for their attention to detail and protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries, appear to be somewhat on edge over what Mr. Trump might say, and how he might say it, during the visit.

Twitter is blocked in China, but it is generally accessible on foreign cellphones. “How President Trump communicates with the outside — this is not something you need to worry about,” said Mr. Zheng, the vice minister, when asked if the American president would be able to use his favorite social media platform.

Beijing’s anxieties about the visit are due at least in part to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s view of China.

Mr. Trump’s call to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific” emphasizing Australia, India and Japan echoes the view of the national security establishment in Washington that China’s growing clout in Asia must be managed or even contained.

But Mr. Trump has also embraced those who say the United States must take a much tougher position on trade with China, including Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. They say that Beijing is exploiting America’s openness while keeping its own markets closed, and Washington must insist on reciprocity even at the risk of a trade war.

This clashes with a third view in the administration, often associated with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that considers China an inseparable economic partner and business opportunity for the United States.

Photo

Mr. Kushner served as go-between in arranging the president’s first meeting with Mr. Xi but has taken a lower profile since then, in part, officials have said, because of concerns about his efforts to bring Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures.

John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, tilted the White House away from criticism of Beijing in an interview on Fox News last week, saying China had beaten the United States on trade but “that doesn’t make them an enemy.”

He also said that China has “a system of government that has apparently worked for the Chinese people.”

The remarks drew heckles from many in Washington who cited China’s human rights record but praise from the Chinese news media as reflecting the more equal relationship that Mr. Xi seeks.

Mr. Trump’s top concern is expected to be North Korea and its nuclear arsenal, and many analysts believe Mr. Xi will use the potential for greater Chinese pressure on North Korea to draw Mr. Trump closer to embracing a “great power” relationship.

“As Trump needs Xi’s help with the North Korean challenge and as he is not a traditional realist, he may agree, to the chagrin of his advisers,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.

Accepting China as a partner has been a fraught proposition for Mr. Trump’s predecessors. When former President Bill Clinton agreed to work toward “ a constructive strategic partnership in the 21st century,” he was criticized for cozying up to China just a few years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Two decades later, human rights in China remains a potential point of friction, with some in the administration lobbying Mr. Trump to press Mr. Xi on the fate of Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in July after eight years in prison.

Like the Obama administration in its latter years, though, Mr. Trump has not made a priority of such issues, even as Mr. Xi has conducted a sweeping crackdown on civil society.

With more than two billion users worldwide, Facebook relies on complaints to police its content. So, Mr. Elwood used Facebook’s internal complaint tool to report the Keven Eversley profile and 27 others showing evidence of deception. In all but a couple of cases, Facebook responded with a standard message of thanks for the feedback but said the profiles did not violate its community standards — even though those standards require users to give their “authentic identities.”

“The reporting process is frustrating,” Mr. Elwood said. “Facebook seems to be lagging way behind the problem.”

Facebook estimates that as many as 60 million accounts, 2 to 3 percent of the company’s 2.07 billion regular visitors, are fakes. Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, testified before Congress that about 5 percent of its 330 million users are “false accounts or spam,” which would add up to more than 16 million fakes.

“Spammers and bad actors are getting better at making themselves look more real,” Mr. Edgett said.

Independent experts say the real numbers are far higher.

On Twitter, little more than an email address is needed to start tweeting. Facebook’s requirement that users be their authentic selves means the company asks for a smattering of information to sign up — name, birthday, gender and email address. But few checks exist to verify that information.

“Part of the problem is that Facebook is a black box,” said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College. “They do what they do, and we don’t know to what degree their operations can even handle these issues — not to mention how handling them maps with their economic model.”

In fact, fighting too hard against deception may clash with the business models that have allowed the companies to thrive. Facebook, Google and Twitter all offer self-serve advertising systems allowing anyone in the world to buy, target and deliver ads for as much — or as little — money as they wish to spend. More scrutiny could hamper growth.

Facebook, for instance, reported record profits this week in its quarterly earnings even as executives testified about Russian exploitation of their services. Shares of the social network soared to an all-time high on Wednesday afternoon after the news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, insisted in the earnings call that the company is prepared to sacrifice profits to crack down on illicit activity.

“Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” he said.

Whether public concern about the manipulation of the platforms might at some point threaten the business remains to be seen. But many customers who run up against the fakery problem end up unhappy.

Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government relations at Vietnam Veterans of America, noticed last summer a look-alike Facebook page calling itself Vietnam Vets of America that initially borrowed the real group’s logo. Linked to a website hosted in Bulgaria, the upstart page pushed viral content, weighing in on N.F.L. players’ protests of police shootings. It posted looping videos that were months or years old but presented them as breaking news, he said.

“Sometimes their grammar was off,” Mr. Goldsmith said, but there was no way to know who was behind the page.

Soon, the look-alike page had 200,000 followers — more than the 120,000 than the page of the real group, which has a long history of service, a congressional charter and chapters around the country. Mr. Goldsmith said the linked website had few ads, so he suspected a political motive, probably in line with the Russian campaign to divide Americans.

In August, Mr. Goldsmith began complaining to Facebook. But officials there hesitated; hosting pages for millions of groups, they were hardly equipped to assess in detail whether a particular veterans group was worthy and another was not.

Finally, in late October, Facebook shut the newer page, deciding it had illicitly stolen the intellectual property of the older page. But Mr. Goldsmith said the experience was disturbing.

And during the playoffs, closer Aroldis Chapman liked an Instagram post that urged the Yankees not to bring back Girardi, though he later said it was an accident.

In an interview on the WFAN radio station that ran concurrently with Cashman’s conference call, Girardi disputed the idea that there were any communication problems and described his relationship with Sanchez as supportive.

“I think Brian was looking for something different, and evidently I didn’t fit the mold,” said Girardi, who nonetheless did not give an alternative reason for his dismissal.

Cashman, who dismissed reports that hinted at increasing friction between him and Girardi this season or that Girardi did not work well with the analytics staff, also said that Girardi’s managerial gaffe in the postseason — neglecting to call for a replay challenge that may have prevented a loss to the Cleveland Indians in Game 2 of an American League division series — had nothing to do with his ouster.

Asked if Girardi would have been back had the Yankees reached the World Series instead of losing in a seven-game American League Championship Series to the Houston Astros, Cashman said: “It’s tough to put a hypothetical in there. We went where we went.”

After the Yankees lost Game 7 on Oct. 21, they returned home the next day. Cashman gave his recommendation to Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s principal owner, the next day, and Girardi was informed the following day, a Tuesday. The decision was announced two days later, on Thursday morning — an off day during the World Series.

Though Cashman, whose contract has expired as well, said he had not yet reached an agreement on a new deal with Steinbrenner, he made clear that he would like to return. He said there were other priorities: the move of Kevin Reese from pro scouting director to director of player development, scouting meetings that wrapped up Friday, next week’s general manager meetings and the hiring of a new manager.

That last task is certain to garner a great deal of attention. Of the six teams that parted ways with their managers at the end of this season, only the Yankees have yet to name a replacement, and Cashman indicated that the search was just getting underway.

He is winnowing a list of prospective candidates to bring in for interviews. He declined to say how many people would be interviewed but said that a previous relationship with the Yankees or managerial experience was not a prerequisite.

“There’s no perfect person that checks every box,” Cashman said. “I don’t care whether they’re Hall of Famer categories.”

Asked if Alex Rodriguez, who served this season as an adviser to Steinbrenner while being paid $21 million for the final year of his contract, was a candidate, Cashman said, “I definitely do not want to go through who may or may not be a candidate.”

But he promised a transparent process, one in which — as with the club’s last managerial opening, which occurred after Joe Torre was pushed out 10 years ago — each candidate will meet with the local news media after being interviewed.

While Girardi — acutely prepared but with a stilted personality — seemed the antithesis of the avuncular Torre, Cashman said it would be a mistake to think the Yankees would be turning toward somebody who was solely a master communicator.

The best candidate will also have to also be well versed in analytics, understand the role of sports science and be willing to challenge conventional thinking.

“It’s an easy narrative to run to the opposite of what you already had,” Cashman said. “If somebody was too, for instance, structured and demanding, then you want to go from an old-school, heavy-handed personality to a new-school players’ manager — that’s not a narrative I’m falling into. We’re looking for the best person possible.”

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Photo

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

A Growing Gap

Economic inequality is a well-known issue in the United States and around the developed world. Not only has a gulf grown between the haves and the have-nots, but so has the gap between the haves and the have-mores.

An outgrowth of this has been the creation of gilded ghettos. While far nicer and more comfortable than their urban counterparts, these gilded ghettos similarly narrow the vision of the people who live in them and their understanding of people outside of them. They also set their residents on a trajectory in life that is hard to stray from.

In this case, these gilded ghettos are perpetuating wealth, a sense of safety and access to great education. A byproduct is that they often unintentionally exclude others from those same opportunities.

“It’s the defining element of our time,” said Richard Florida, author of “The New Urban Crisis” and professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto. “Economic inequality is an important component, but it’s not what is getting people angry. It’s this geographic separation of people, these clusters of extreme affluence on the one hand and concentrated pockets of poverty on the other hand. The old middle-class neighborhoods are gone.”

Mr. Florida is referring to neighborhoods mixed by income and occupation. His father was a factory worker, but lived next door to his uncle who was an executive at Colgate-Palmolive.

“They were best buddies,” Mr. Florida said. “My dad was poorer. My uncle was richer. My dad was a Democrat, but my uncle was a Republican. That’s unimaginable today. They wouldn’t live next to each other.”

He said in the 1970s 70 percent of people lived in middle-class neighborhoods, but today only 40 percent do.

Photo

The effect is that people in different socioeconomic groups do not spend time with one another. That lack of contact causes different points of view for sure, but it also leads to very different outcomes in life.

“We used to think of these divides as city and suburbs, with the poor in the city and the rich in the suburbs,” Mr. Florida said. “But the truth of the matter is we have this patchwork of concentrated affluence surrounded by much larger areas of concentrated disadvantage. The interesting thing is this wealth divide is not city-suburb anymore. It’s chock-a-block. We look more like a third-world country, where poor and rich are bumped up against each other.”

Before he became president, Donald Trump had a life that was defined by the gilded ghetto he created for himself. He lived and worked in Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper he developed and opened in 1983. He ate at restaurants he knew, like the “21” Club. When he traveled, he went by private plane. He spent time at the resorts and golf clubs he owned.

Now even wealthier people are buying apartments that stretch into the sky on Manhattan’s so-called Billionaires’ Row along Central Park South. For a reported $220 million, Kenneth Griffin, the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, bought a four-floor condominium with a view of Central Park.

That building and others that have gone up are filled with apartments costing $30 million or more.

Even if these are extreme examples, that walling off is solidified, even among people closer in income level and occupation. Bay Colony, a development in affluent Naples, Fla., is separated from the rest of the high-end Pelican Bay development by its own gate — in other words, a gated community within a gated community.

On the one hand, such gating allows people to spend time with exactly the type of people they have the most in common with; on the other hand it creates an echo chamber of beliefs and expectations that further separates the have-mores from everyone else.

“If you had $10 million, the first thing people think is you’d be able to do the things important to you,” said Paul K. Piff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. “You get yourself more space. You choose to live in a neighborhood with other like-minded people. You can curate your life in so many different ways that make it more comfortable.

Photo

“But at the same time it becomes this physical and psychological barrier between you and the rest of the world,” Mr. Piff added. “That can slowly erode our natural psychological tendencies to orient toward others. It’s a basic component of empathy. It helps you see their common humanity. Without that concept you don’t have that empathy.”

He pointed to a study in the Chronicle of Philanthropy that showed affluent people who lived among other affluent people were less charitable than people who lived in more mixed neighborhoods.

Immigrant Beginnings

Ms. Allen didn’t grow up in a wealth bubble. Her father immigrated from Italy and worked construction jobs in Chicago before starting his own company.

She said her group of affluent residents, brought together by the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, were inspired to help after listening to Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, discuss his book, “Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis,” which talks about the opportunity gap between rich and poor young people in the United States and how it is making upward mobility difficult.

That group has committed to spending $350,000 over two years, with a focus on practical things like increasing school attendance and parental involvement and decreasing how often people change homes and schools. The group’s goal, Ms. Allen said, is modest: to help these children get a bit further up the socioeconomic ladder.

“I ended up in a lucrative field,” Ms. Allen said. “We worked hard, yes. But plenty of people work hard, and they’re not getting anywhere, and they don’t have the kinds of jobs that are lucrative.”

While such charitable efforts aim to make improvement, they are limited in their impact. What they cannot do is give disadvantaged children the networks that their more prosperous peers have.

Thomas Peters, president and chief executive of the Marin Community Foundation in Novato, Calif., said people often associated the county with affluent towns like Mill Valley and the enormous wealth of Silicon Valley. But Marin County’s gilded ghettos abut areas of extreme poverty.

“You could go from Mill Valley about five minutes and be in an area in San Rafael where families are jammed together in a single one-bedroom apartment,” he said. “And the deal is they rent it by a third of a day. You have that room or couch for eight hours — and that’s a five-minute drive from some of the most gorgeous homes in America where people could get lost in the house.”

Mr. Peters said some of the work of the foundation was to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley wealth and the poverty in other parts of the county through grants, but also access to its donor networks. The 400 families involved with the foundation have given $1.3 billion and have another $1.7 billion committed to give.

“We can address the fact that there are thousands of kids here who have all the natural ability and biologically vested intelligence to do spectacularly in life, but whose opportunities to do so are restricted,” he said.

Still, Mr. Peters is cognizant that the children who benefit from grants and the mentorship of successful donors are the lucky few. It is not something, in the parlance of the region, that is scalable.

“It’s heartbreaking to admit that,” he said. “But it’s what we have. It’s what we can do. Absent the answer to a grand plan, this is a good plan.”

Up From Middle Class

Michael Novogratz and his wife, Sukey, who are billionaires, grew up middle class and met at Princeton University. He was a star wrestler and went on to become a partner at Goldman Sachs and the chief operating officer at the Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund that went public in 2007. They have deep networks in college sports, the Ivy League and the highest echelons of finance that would seem to allow them to get the biggest bang for any buck they spent to help even the playing field.

Yet Mr. Novogratz said he and his wife were the exception to the rule when they began moving from their middle-class roots in the 1980s to the exclusive world they now inhabit.

“Social mobility in the country has gone down, not up,” he said. “Some of it is, it’s harder to get into the schools and the jobs that create these robust networks of opportunity.”

One program he supports is Beat the Streets, which uses wrestling to help disadvantaged urban children. He said about 12,000 young people go through its programs in a year.

“These kids are taking two subways and a bus to get to practice,” he said. “We’re trying to get them into college. The wrestling world becomes a network for them. It’s very tough for that group to get that jump forward. We’ll cherry pick a couple of kids each year, and they’ll go to Stanford, Princeton or the Air Force academy.”

While those children have every opportunity to build a robust network, the ones not picked could struggle to get access to networks similar to those that propel their more-affluent peers to comfortable lives.

Correcting the effect of these gilded ghettos on people not fortunate to live, work and raise children in them may not be easy.

Mr. Florida is resigned to America remaining divided and hopes for a mutual respect among socioeconomic groups that do not live side by side.

“We’re now so sorted into different geographies that the best we can hope for is a mutual coexistence,” he said. “Clustering is what drives people. You’re not going to unify people.”

Instead, he thinks Americans who are aware of this wealth divide can do worse than emulate Canada. Forget the idea of the melting pot, he said. “In Canada, we always consider the country a mosaic. It’s respect our differences, our identity and become more of a Canadian dream.”

Mr. Piff of the University of California is more optimistic. He is hoping that finding ways to foster connections across class lines can help rich and poor to understand each other better.

“People empathize with the people they want to,” he said. “It’s kind of threatening to our social values to acknowledge that perhaps people might find themselves in positions they didn’t deserve or in situations they didn’t cause. It’s easier for someone who believes the world is a meritocracy to empathize with someone who clearly didn’t bring something on themselves, like Syrian refugees.”

His suggestion is to draw from early work on race relations and create opportunities for contact among people who live in vastly different economic worlds.

“Writing checks and volunteering reinforces the gap between you and someone who is receiving your care,” he said. “There are benefits to making just one good friend who is different than you, one friend who gets you to see yourself in their eyes, to humanize their experience. You extrapolate from your friend to the broader world around you.”

Just Work Harder?

That connection, at least from the Atlanta example, can change people’s views. Brian Friedman, an adviser to wealthy families, and his wife, Vanessa, a college professor, live in Tucker, Ga., an Atlanta suburb with a median income of $64,388. They had focused their charity internationally until they visited Thomasville Heights, which they had never seen in over two decades of living in Atlanta.

“People would say, ‘They should just work harder, this is the United States’,” he said. “What we found is that just isn’t true. There are people living in our backyard with developing-world standards.”

The group brought together from the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta knows it could take a decade or more to help improve Thomasville Heights. But he said last year the amount of moving among apartments was down, and the number of people showing up at parent teacher conferences, a focal point of affluent neighborhoods, went from 10 to 80.

“We can’t take credit for all of it,” Mr. Friedman said. “But at least we’re helping the schools.”",They’re Rich but Trying to Reach Beyond the Money Bubble,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/your-money/money-bubble-economic-inequality.html

These incidents are peculiarly American tragedies, and what’s particularly heartbreaking is that they aren’t shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the U.S. do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.

Two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history have occurred in the last six weeks. So let’s not just mourn the dead, let’s not just lower flags and make somber speeches. Let’s also learn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence – a public health strategy.

America Has More Guns Than Any Other Country

The first step is to understand the scale of the challenge America faces: The U.S. has more than 300 million guns – roughly one for every citizen – and stands out as well for its gun death rates. At the other extreme, Japan has less than one gun per 100 people, and typically fewer than 10 gun deaths a year in the entire country.

We Have a Model for Regulating Guns: Automobiles

Gun enthusiasts often protest: Cars kill about as many people as guns, and we don’t ban them! No, but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach I’m suggesting.

We don’t ban cars, but we work hard to regulate them – and limit access to them – so as to reduce the death toll they cause. This has been spectacularly successful, reducing the death rate per 100 million miles driven by 95 percent since 1921.

Take a look at the history of motor vehicle safety since World War II:

Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled 1946 9.35 8 1968 First federal safety standards for cars 6 4 2016 2 1.18 ’50s ’60s ’70s ’80s ’90s ’00s ’10s Deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled 1946 9.35 1950 1968 First seatbelt offered in an American car First federal safety standards for cars 8 1974 55 m.p.h. national speed limit 1993 Car safety ratings introduced 6 1978 Tennessee is first to require child safety seats 1999 Airbags, invented in 1951, become mandatory 1984 4 New York is first to require seat belt use 2000 Mandatory reporting of defects by carmakers 2016 2 1.18 ’46 ’50s ’60s ’70s ’80s ’90s 2000s ’10s ’16 The New York Times | Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

The Liberal Approach is Ineffective. Use a Public Health Approach Instead.

Frankly, liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive. The 10-year ban on assault weapons accomplished little, partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts (and partly because even before the ban, such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes).

The left sometimes focuses on “gun control,” which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales. A better framing is “gun safety” or “reducing gun violence,” and using auto safety as a model—constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them.

What would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars? It would include:

Background Checks 22 percent of guns are obtained without one Protection Orders Keep men subject to domestic violence protection orders from having guns Ban Under-21s A ban on people under 21 purchasing firearms (this is already the case in many states) Safe Storage These include trigger locks and guns and ammunition stored separately, especially when children are in the house Straw Purchases Tighter enforcement of laws on straw purchases of weapons, and some limits on how many guns can be purchased in a month Ammunition Checks Experimentation with a one-time background check for anybody buying ammunition. End Immunity End immunity for firearm companies. That’s a subsidy to a particular industry Ban Bump Stocks A ban on bump stocks of the kind used in Las Vegas to mimic automatic weapon fire Research ‘Smart Guns’ “Smart guns” fire only after a fingerprint or PIN is entered, or if used near a particular bracelet.

If someone steals my iPhone, it’s useless, and the same should be true of guns. Gun manufacturers made child-proof guns back in the 19th century (before dropping them), and it’s time to advance that technology today. Some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the U.S. each year, now about 200,000, and available to criminals.

We also need to figure out whether gun buybacks, often conducted by police departments, are cost-effective and help reduce violence. And we can experiment more with anti-gang initiatives, such as Cure Violence, that have a good record in reducing shootings.

Fewer Guns = Fewer Deaths

In Texas on Sunday, it seems that a man living near the church grabbed his gun and confronted the shooter after he left the church. It may be that this defensive use of a weapon saved lives, and the N.R.A. often hails this view that guns are necessary to counter gun violence.

But really? Can anybody possibly see what unfolded in Texas as a success of gun policy?

It is true that guns are periodically used defensively. One study by the Violence Policy Center found that in 2012 there were 259 justifiable homicides by a private citizen using a firearm.

But the problem is that lax laws too often make it easy not only for good guys to get guns, but also for bad guys to get guns. The evidence is overwhelming that overall more guns and more relaxed gun laws lead to more violent deaths and injuries. One study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a gun in the house was associated with an increased risk of a gun death, particularly by suicide but also apparently by homicide.

In 2015, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tweeted that he was “embarrassed” that his state was ranked second (behind California) in requests to buy new guns, albeit still with one million requests. “Let’s pick up the pace Texans,” he wrote. Abbott apparently believes, along with the N.R.A., that more guns make a society more safe, but statistics dispute that. Abbott should look at those charts.

Mass Shootings Are Not the Main Cause of Loss of Life

Critics will say that the kind of measures I cite wouldn’t prevent many shootings. The Las Vegas carnage, for example, might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions I make.

That’s true, and there’s no magic wand available. Yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention, they are not the main cause of loss of life. Much more typical is a friend who shoots another, a husband who kills his wife – or, most common of all, a man who kills himself. Skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves, there’s nothing we can do. In fact, it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult, suicide rates drop.

Here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total, and the same is true of self-defense – despite what the N.R.A. might have you believe.

America Is Moving in the Wrong Direction

Yet while we should be moving toward sensible regulation, in fact we’ve been moving in the opposite direction. Gun laws have been loosened in many parts of the country. Check out these maps:

Tightening Gun Laws Lowered Firearm Homicide Rates

For skeptics who think that gun laws don’t make a difference, consider what happened in two states, Missouri and Connecticut. In 1995, Connecticut required background checks before obtaining a gun, while in 2007 Missouri eased gun laws.

The upshot? After tightening gun laws, firearm homicide rates dropped 40 percent in Connecticut. And after Missouri eased gun laws, gun homicide rates rose 25 percent.

One of the lessons of gun research is that we often focus just on firearms themselves, when it may be more productive to focus on who gets access to them. A car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45-year-old woman with no criminal record, but may be dangerous when used by a 19-year-old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders.

Yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves (such as the assault weapons ban) rather than on access. In many places, there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms.

In these two states, the laws affected access, and although there’s some indication that other factors were also involved in Connecticut (and correlations don’t prove causation), the outcomes are worth pondering.

There is a Shocking Lack of Research on Guns

There’s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence, largely because the N.R.A. is extremely hostile to such research and Congress rolls over. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did try to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding.

Here is the American toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973-2012 – and the number of National Institutes of Health research grants to explore each problem over that same time.

The Right Type of Training Could Go a Long Way

One approach that could reduce the abuse of guns is better training. As a 13-year-old farm boy in Oregon, I attended a N.R.A. gun safety class (which came with a one-year membership to the N.R.A., making me an N.R.A. alum who despises what that organization has become). These classes can be very useful, and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it’s loaded, keeping one’s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target.

Yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the N.R.A. or for carrying guns than for, say, safe storage. This is a missed opportunity, for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol, the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence, the need for safe storage, and so on. Here’s what researchers found that the gun classes they audited actually covered:

A Way Forward: On Some Issues, Majorities Agree

It may sometimes seem hopeless to make progress on gun violence, especially with the N.R.A. seemingly holding Congress hostage. But I’m more optimistic.

Look, we all agree on some kinds of curbs on guns. Nobody believes that people should be able to drive a tank down Main Street, or have an anti-aircraft gun in the back yard. I’ve been to parts of northern Yemen where one could actually buy a tank or an anti-aircraft gun, as well as fully automatic weapons — and that area’s now embroiled in a civil war – but fortunately in America we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry.

So the question isn’t whether we will restrict firearms, but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict.

Check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety:

Agree with the following: Households with no guns Gun households 50% Background checks for all gun buyers 93% 96% Preventing mentally ill from buying guns 89 89 Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes 88 85 Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists 82 84 Background checks for private sales and at gun shows 77 87 Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases 72 89 Ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun 67 79 A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence 61 75 New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns 57 71 Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence 56 81 Creating a federal database to track gun sales 54 80 A ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines (10+ bullets)* 52 77 Households with no guns Gun households Agree with the following: 50% 93% Background checks for all gun buyers 96% 89 Preventing the mentally ill from buying guns 89 Nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes 88 85 Barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists 82 84 Background checks for private sales and at gun shows 77 87 Federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases 72 89 A ban on modifications that make a semi- automatic gun work like an automatic gun 67 79 A ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence 61 75 New gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns 57 71 Congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence 56 81 Creating a federal database to track gun sales 54 80 A ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines (10+ bullets)* 52 77 The New York Times | Sources: Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April (questions on mental illness, no-fly lists, background checks for private sales and federal database); Quinnipiac University National Poll conducted Oct. 5-10 (all other questions) | *A Pew Research Center survey found only 44 percent of gun owners favored such a ban.

Looking ahead, I’m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level, and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations. Maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market.

But the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it. In particular, note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases.

If you’re wondering how we managed to crank out all these charts and data in the immediate aftermath of the Texas shooting, here’s the secret: We didn’t. We spent weeks gathering the information and preparing the charts, because we knew that there would be a tragedy like this one to make it all relevant.

That’s the blunt, damning truth: Sunday’s horror was 100 percent predictable. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.

Some of you will protest, as President Trump did, that it’s too soon to talk about guns, or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points. Yet more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). And it’s not just gang-members: In a typical year, more pre-schoolers are shot dead in America (about 75) than police officers are.

Yes, making America safer will be hard: There are no perfect solutions. The Second Amendment is one constraint, and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby. It’s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be, and in any case this will be a long, uncertain, uphill process.

But automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach: Just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off,, it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible, politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in America by one-third – or more than 10,000 lives saved each year.

So let’s not just shed tears for the dead, give somber speeches and lower flags. Let’s get started and save lives.",How to Reduce Shootings,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html

In the aftermath of the Texas horror, politicians led by President Trump are trying to steer away from the obvious issue of what to do about the gun industry’s wanton sale of military-style rifles and pistols on the domestic market.

Mr. Trump called the rampage a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation.” This is the cynical evasion devised by the National Rifle Association, which warmly endorsed candidate Trump, who now parrots the diversionary talking point that we must first control for mental illness.

In fact, President Trump signed a law in February revoking an Obama-era regulation that made it more difficult for the mentally ill to purchase guns.

Mr. Trump, who spoke favorably as a candidate of vigilante shootouts for self-defense, also suggested that if a civilian had not briefly exchanged shots with the Texas shooter after the massacre, the casualty toll “would have been much worse.” The implication was that the bloodshed in Texas, which also included more than 20 wounded, actually makes the case for more guns — that the disease of gun violence is also its cure.

This is a fantasy, not a rational argument; it doesn’t bear the slightest scrutiny. As our colleague Nicholas Kristof notes, the United States outstrips the world in both gun ownership per capita and gun deaths per capita. States with higher proportions of gun ownership also have rates of death by guns higher than the national average. Incidents in which victims kill attackers in self-defense are vanishingly few compared with gun homicides, and suicide is by far the leading cause of gun deaths.

From expanded background checks to assault weapons bans, proposals put forward by gun-safety proponents, unlike continually increasing private American arsenals, would do something to thwart mass shootings. The Texas killer was not motivated by racial hatred, as was the killer of the Charleston churchgoers, but by family grievance, underlining the lethal combination of domestic abuse and firearms. Abusers’ access to guns increases the risk of intimate partner homicide as much as fivefold, according to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. While federal law prohibits those convicted of domestic violence, as Mr. Kelley was, from buying or possessing firearms, the Air Force failed to add him to a federal database, allowing him to pass necessary background checks. The right law was on the books but enforcement was lax.

And yet so many politicians continue to promote the wares of the gun industry. Two years ago, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tweeted “I’m embarrassed: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind California. Let’s pick up the pace Texans. @NRA.” On Monday he said the problem was out of human hands.

“We have evil that occurs in this world,” Governor Abbott declared, as if from a pulpit, equating all manner of global terrorist attacks, including the murder of eight last week by a truck driver in Manhattan. When asked how the evil of gun violence can be overcome, he replied “you do that by working with God.” Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, even envisioned “arming some of the parishioners or the congregation so that they can respond” if another massacre occurs.

This is the level of pro-gun argument being offered by Republican leaders and some Democrats. It is made in service to the N.R.A. and the gun industry, not the American public.",Mass Shootings Don’t Have to Be Inevitable,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/texas-guns-shooting-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Sherry had a pool. I had my period. I was 16 and had been having it for four years. (I mean once a month, not constantly). Of course, we had been planning to spend the whole day in the pool. So when I told her I wasn’t going to swim — and why — she looked at me like I was crazy. Sherry grabbed me by the hand and took me into the womb of this beautiful, white, creamy chic apartment in the desert, held up a tampon, and said: “Pammy. Are you serious?!!! You put this in. Right now. Are you kidding me? This will help you. I’m about to change your life. This is the end and the beginning.” (I do believe I’m paraphrasing here — but it’s my memory and it’s special and I am grateful to Sherry forever for it).

I was afraid to put the tampon in. In fact, I was convinced it wouldn’t go in. That I was the one woman on the planet who didn’t have the right equipment.

But it worked. We went swimming. And my life was better after that. Now, I had a new feeling. That it was kind of cool that I had a period at all. My body had an ability to work like this. To go through cycles. And do a thing that women get to do. I felt like I was a part of something bigger. In life. And I didn’t have to suffer. And I could go swimming … without leaving a trail of chum for the sharks … anytime I wanted. (Update: Now I never swim, and I think I have about four periods left.)

O.K. So now. I’m a mother to three girls. And here I go in the opposite direction of my own childhood experience.

“Hey, girls. Grab a mirror and explore yourself.”

“Want to have a talk about sex? Anything?”

“What kind of razors do you want? Mach3? That’s the kind Mommy uses.”

“You have a boyfriend now … so … I’m not … saying … you are sexually active … but … regardless, I made you an appointment … at the lady-parts doctor.”

All to be met with a pillow or hand held up in front of their faces followed by an, “Ew. Stop, Mom! I got this! I’ll ask my sister.”

And now I realize that if my mom had ever said anything to me about my vagina, I would have thrown her out the window. I mean, I can’t even take it if she touches my hair.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season?","Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.

In the first episode of the new season of “Stranger Things,” we saw a mysterious, inflamed storm bearing down on Hawkins. By the end of the nine-episode run its identity had been revealed: Puberty.

That strangest thing of all shared screen time, of course, with the latest disaster to emerge out of the Hawkins Lab, which loosed malevolent vines and “Demodogs” upon the luckless town and again made poor Will Byers, who really has had a terrible year, captive to an otherworldly demon. Hopper almost died at least once, and Joyce was again pushed to the brink by both her boyfriend Bob’s brutal Demomauling and her son’s tribulations.

via Giphy

But the success of the very good second season of “Stranger Things” is largely thanks to the equal tribute it paid to the often scary convulsions of adolescence, whether it was a heartbroken Mike being a pill to everyone or an equally despondent Eleven shattering windows with her angst.

The nerds left the basement and looked for love amid the monsters, dividing Dustin and Lucas as each pined after the new girl Max. Nancy and Jonathan took their relationship to the next level, with the help of a vodka-swilling conspiracy cupid. Eleven went through a rebellious phase, running away and dabbling in shoplifting as she questioned her own identity, before returning with a moody new “MTV punk” look.

The attention given to their growth and struggles elevated a season that, while suspenseful, was pretty repetitive from a plot standpoint — the lab screwed up, Will was victimized, monsters escaped, Eleven saved the day. For all of the 1980s blockbuster references and “Stranger Things 2” Hollywood sequel marketing, the creators Matt and Ross Duffer clearly get that in TV, investing in your characters is what makes viewers invest in your show.

As with last season, the story got going efficiently. Will beheld a tentacled shadow monster in the Upside Down and Dustin took in a slimy creature whose true nature wasn’t revealed until it feasted on the family pet. (“I’m sorry,” Dustin told Dart as he locked it in the cellar. “You ate my cat.”)

Nancy mourned Barb, getting smashed on Halloween party punch and setting out with Jonathan to get proof of the lab’s complicity in her death. At the rustic Chez Hopper, the chief and Eleven ate TV dinners and had fights fueled by past traumas: She chafed at her captivity by a domineering father figure, shades of Papa Modine, while he fretted about losing another little girl.

Things intensified after Will got terrible advice from Bob about how to deal with monster — basically, face it and tell it to go away — which resulted in the boy becoming part of it instead. The show cleverly played with Will’s connection to the menace, revealing him to be not a “spying” asset but rather a double-agent liability, a threat to manage with tricks and a series of hypodermic needles. (Again: Will’s had a tough time.)

The monster lacked the horrifying, Gothic edge of last year’s Demogorgon. So it was a big spidery storm beast that controlled wicked vines and devil dogs? Or what? And aren’t we full up on smoke/shadow monsters after “Lost,” “Game of Thrones” and probably others I’m forgetting? But its amorphousness did make for some of the season’s most terrifying scenes, such as the moment at the end of the third episode when it invaded Will’s body.

Noah Schnapp in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

As Will, Noah Schnapp was the linchpin of the season after being offscreen for most of the first one. He was a marvel, by turns heartbreaking, explaining to Joyce the hold the monster had on him, and creepy. (“He likes it cold.”) With his sensitive, soulful eyes and bowl-cutted fragility, Will looks like the result of someone at the Hawkins lab splicing D.N.A. of Elliott from “E.T.” and Danny Torrance from “The Shining.” But by the end he was in full Linda Blair mode, raging convincingly against the space-heater exorcism that eventually set him free (for now, at least).

The rest of the kids retained their power to charm even as the show asked more of them, too, this time around, splitting them into subplots that were more emotionally demanding than last year’s bike-bound adventures.

Finn Wolfhard was prickly and tender as Mike, a boy who didn’t know what do to with all of his feelings, culminating in his meltdown with Hopper. Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) gave a fine portrayal of a fraught rite of passage: The first time your loyalties are torn between your pals and your crush. As Dustin, Gaten Matarazzo carried entire stretches of the show by himself. His fraternal bond with Steve (Joe Keery) — whose redemption was as delightful as it was unexpected — was maybe the most touching love story of the season.

Millie Bobbie Brown proved that she wasn’t a one-season wonder, telegraphing Eleven’s varying shades of pain with great nuance and holding her own with David Harbour through the push-and-pull of their complex, evolving relationship. (Will someone please wipe her bloody nose though?) And while the kids get most of the attention, the show simply doesn’t work without Mr. Harbour’s and Winona Ryder’s deeply felt performances.

The newcomers were more of a mixed bag. Sadie Sink (Max) was a spirited addition to the “party” (the term refers to a team of players collaborating within a role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons). Brett Gelman was sublimely obnoxious as the investigator Murray Bauman. Sean Astin’s flair for openhearted, St. Bernard-like devotion was ideal for Bob the sacrificial galoot.

Dacre Montgomery in “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

But after Billy’s (Dacre Montgomery) strong Scorpions-fueled arrival, the show seemed to lose sight of what to do with him. By the end he was an unfocused denim-wrapped bundle of rage and tire squeals. (I did enjoy his final episode moment with Mrs. Wheeler, though.)

Then there was the ill-advised detour into a Pat Benatar video. After Eleven went down the mental misery hole with her addled mother, she was moved to seek out the other lab refugee she saw in the flashbacks, and who we saw, in the season-opening scene, using telepathy to thwart the Pittsburgh police. This was Kali, and it turns out she was not part of a robber gang, as it initially seemed, but was leading a crew of misfits on a revenge quest against those who had persecuted her at the lab.

Kali was the Darth Vader to Eleven’s Luke Skywalker, urging her to give in to her hate and draw her power from the dark side of the Upside Down force. While Eleven flirted with the notion, she ultimately realized that revenge meant orphaning others, the way she had been, and decided to head home and save her friends instead.

A scene from “Stranger Things 2.” Netflix

It was perhaps worthwhile, from a character development standpoint, to have Eleven confront and make uneasy peace with her anger, and see what she might have become had she not found such loving support in Hawkins. But from the on-the-nose opening musical cue — Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” as she was literally running away — the episode was a mishmash of bad barrel-fire ’80s urban cliché and overwrought conflict. It didn’t help that the vengeful and manipulative Kali, with her sinister eyeliner, was a clear callback to “Temple of Doom” (Kali ma!), which took heat even in 1984 for its ghoulish depiction of Indian culture. (Tone-deaf exoticism is one reference the Duffer Brothers should have left in the ’80s.)

Eleven got a sweet makeover out of it, at any rate, returning to Hawkins looking like Trinity from the “Matrix.” She arrived just in time to close the interdimensional gate — did we really need Will to give us this obvious bit of strategy? — and get a birth certificate of her very own, completing her transformation from a gifted but tormented science project to Jane Hopper, a real-live girl with a mother and father. Whatever transpires in future “Stranger Things” installments, she’ll have that going for her.



One surprise was how long it took Eleven to rejoin her crew from the first season. They didn’t get together until the very end and even then, spent only minutes in each other’s company. It was an audacious and unexpected choice, as well as a slightly disappointing one given their shared chemistry. (There’s always next year, I guess, as promised by the final shot of a still-raging Upside Down.)

But it was of a piece with a season that throughout poignantly gestured at that fraught time when we all leave the basement and face life’s terrors and thrills on our own, as glimpsed in the culminating sequence at the Snow Ball ’84. After the four boys assembled on the fringes, one by one they left for new frontiers on the dance floor, with mixed results. (Oh Dustin, your time will come.)

It was a remarkable little scene and the perfect ending, capturing the anxiety, excitement, terror and occasional heartbreak that follows when you leave the cocoon of your party and enter a world that only gets stranger.

A Few Thoughts While We Enjoy a Baby Ruth

• “What’s at the X?” Bob wondered as he looked at Will’s map. “Pirate treasure?” You may recall that as Mikey in “The Goonies,” one of the ur-texts of “Stranger Things,” Sean Astin led the hunt for One-Eyed Willy’s loot. It was one of several fun meta moments this season. (See also: Max dismissing Lucas’s description of last season’s events as “a little derivative in parts.”)

• In the premiere recap I doubted that Dr. Owens was truly on Joyce’s side, as he said, but it turns out he more or less was. I probably should have guessed the Duffers would upend expectations attached to the lab doctors, after Matthew Modine’s evil turn, and Paul Reiser, who played a duplicitous character in “Aliens,” another of this series’ touchstones.

• “Mistakes have been made,” Dr. Owens told Nancy and Jonathan. “You killed Barbara,” Nancy countered. “Abundant mistakes,” he replied.

• R.I.P. Barb, finally.

• Your turn: Did “Stranger Things 2” recapture the magic of the first season? Were you fine with Eleven being away from the main action for so long? How many puffs of Farrah Fawcett Hair Spray does it take you to achieve Harrington-like coif perfection?

WASHINGTON — A former Trump campaign adviser told Congress he had a private conversation with a Russian deputy prime minister during the 2016 presidential campaign and that at least two members of the president’s team were aware, providing more details to what is publicly known about Moscow’s access to President Trump’s circle, according to a congressional transcript released late Monday.

“I’ll send you guys a readout soon regarding some incredible insights and outreach I’ve received from a few Russian legislators and senior members of the Presidential administration here,” the former adviser, Carter Page, wrote in a July 8, 2016, email to campaign staff members after he spoke with Arkady Dvorkovich, the deputy prime minister.

The New York Times first reported the fact that Mr. Page notified campaign officials about his meetings in Moscow, but the transcript, which is over 200 pages long, discloses the names of those advisers — Tera Dahl and J.D. Gordon — and the identity of the Russian official, Mr. Dvorkovich. Mr. Page’s testimony also revealed that more campaign staff members were aware of his July 2016 trip to Russia than had previously been disclosed, including Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general.

Mr. Page’s eight-hour testimony, under oath, to the members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, came the same week as the first charges were announced in the special counsel’s investigation into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian officials.

About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average.

Economic models disagree about the size of those effects, but generally agree they would be smaller in the initial years after a bill was passed since the tax cuts would take a while to filter throughout the economy.

Still, Republican leaders in Congress and the White House haven’t just argued that the bill would have broader economic advantages. Rather, they have repeatedly described it as a tax cut for middle-class families.

“This whole tax reform is designed for the middle-class family that’s working so hard, for that Main Street business that’s working so hard,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on MSNBC on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, went further, telling the MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt over the weekend that “nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase” under the bill.

Few independent economists find evidence to support that claim. Analyses published since the plan was introduced last week have consistently found that some middle-class families would see their taxes go up immediately, compared with existing law. One such analysis, from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 8 percent of middle-income earners would pay more in 2018 — and 21 percent in 2027 — with upper-middle-class taxpayers more likely to see their taxes rise.

The Times analysis accounts for the differing financial situations of Americans who look relatively similar on paper. It shows significant differences in how “typical” families might fare under the Republican bill.

Consider, for example, a four-person family earning about $75,000 a year. There are nearly 150,000 such taxpayers in the United States, according to data from the Census Bureau. About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average. But the other third’s taxes would go up, by nearly $700 on average, and some would pay thousands of dollars more than under current law.

The Benefit for the Middle Class Under the Republican tax proposal, 68 percent of taxpayers who earned between about $50,000 and $160,000 in a family of three would get a tax cut, but 29 percent would see their taxes rise. In about a decade, the number who got a tax cut would decrease to 53 percent. 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100% PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100%

The bill is devised to allow millions of Americans to simplify their tax returns — to file, as Republican leaders put it, “on a postcard.” The plan would most likely simplify taxes for some taxpayers, who would choose to take advantage of the plan’s more generous standard deduction. But the analysis suggests that among lower- and middle-class families, the greatest benefits of the bill flow to those taxpayers who already file simple returns and do not itemize their taxes.

The millions losing out under the bill would largely be families with more complicated finances, who now generally itemize their deductions. The bill would eliminate many common and valuable tax deductions that, in some cases, would eliminate thousands of dollars in tax benefits. This would be particularly acute for taxpayers who deducted state and local income and property tax payments, interest on student loans, or the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers.

The plan could be particularly costly for Americans facing large medical bills. Nearly nine million taxpayers collectively deducted about $84 billion in medical expenses from their taxes in 2015. The House bill would eliminate that deduction.

Mark Mazur, the director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said any attempt to reform the tax system — as opposed to just a broad-based tax cut — would have winners and losers. But he noted that many of the provisions that would benefit middle-class taxpayers in the House bill were set to expire or lose value over time.

“You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,” Mr. Mazur said. “That’s not what this is.”

The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. The organization’s model does not yet fully account for the tax bill’s treatment of so-called pass-through income, which is business income that is taxed at the individual rate under current law. And because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances.

The source of the tax increases is rooted in the structure of the Republican bill. The plan would roughly double the size of the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,200 for individuals. That could yield a substantial tax cut for many middle- and lower-income families that now take the standard deduction, or whose itemized deductions amount to less than those thresholds.

But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.

Its elimination of the deduction for medical expenses could hit some families particularly hard because medical bills can be so large, unpredictable and unavoidable. Of the roughly 6.5 million middle-class families whose taxes would rise in 2018 under the bill, about 800,000 took advantage of the medical expense provision, deducting more than $17,000 on average from their taxes. Nearly 200,000 middle-class families owed no income tax under the current law at least in part because the medical-expense exemption offset their taxable income.

The Republican proposal would also be costly for many large families. That’s because, in addition to raising the standard deduction, the plan would eliminate the so-called personal exemption, which lets most taxpayers deduct about $4,000 for every person in their household. The plan would replace the exemption with an expanded child tax credit, but that would fill only part of the gap for many families. Fewer than 40 percent of middle-class families with at least three children would receive a tax cut under the plan, compared with nearly 80 percent of families without children.

Negotiations over the House bill are continuing, and details could change. In the Senate, Republicans such as Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have pushed to expand the child tax credit further, a move that could mitigate many of the tax increases on middle-class families, but that would force leaders to find other sources of revenue to offset the change.

It’s a good question to ask when planning a menu. The original New World Thanksgiving dinner — a several-days-long feast — was lavish, but it is likely that green vegetables were not abundant.

Gourds, melons, pumpkins and squashes were the vegetables of choice, or carrots and parsnips grown from seed brought by the settlers. Dried native corn was ground, and either baked into cakes or cooked for porridge. Berries and other wild fruits such as plums, gooseberries and grapes were much appreciated.

But mostly there was game to eat, and plenty of it. Wild turkeys and pheasants, ducks, geese and swans were spit-roasted, as was a vast supply of venison. Cod and lobster were plentiful. Shellfish was abundant, too; huge coastal beds were stacked with oysters, clams and mussels, just waiting to be plucked.

Over centuries, the Thanksgiving menu has changed. Giant turkeys and hams now dominate the meal, and vegetables have more real estate on the sideboard. In many respects, however, the repertoire has remained the same — somewhat bland and soft. We put forth mashed potatoes, soggy peas, green-bean casserole, creamed onions, marshmallow-topped canned sweet potatoes and bread stuffing. Salads are shunned by many Thanksgiving cooks. (With exceptions, of course.)

I get it. Nostalgia makes us, myself included, crave these dull and mellow accompaniments. Even so, I’m usually inclined to tinker just a little. I monkey around with the bird’s seasoning, and, for the vegetables, I want some bright flavors and colors to contrast with the generally monochromatic basics. I always turn my cranberries into spicy chutney, for instance. This year, I’m playing with basic vegetables like carrots, cauliflower and brussels sprouts.

Mashed carrots may bring baby food to mind, or a fancy French purée, but these “smashed” ones are something else, and they have texture. Add the salty tang of feta cheese and lots of chopped fresh mint, and the carrots’ sweetness becomes a playful partner in a new scheme. Throw a little garlic at them, and a hint of crushed red pepper.","Same Vegetables, New Flavors",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/dining/thanksgiving-vegetable-recipes.html

“Internetting With Amanda Hess”

(ALL IMAGES SOURCED FROM THE INTERNET.)

Remember a few years ago when there was all this criticism

of magazines for promoting completely unrealistic

standards for how women are supposed to look?

Well, now celebrities can just Photoshop themselves and put

the results out on Instagram.

And we can do it too.

Now that these digital beautifying tools are

in our own hands, it can make us feel like we have all this

control over our images.

Do we, though?

You don‘t have to get digital plastic surgery in order to be

a person online, but there are a lot of companies that strongly

suggest that you do.

There are endless selfie editing apps that give us smoother

skin, smaller noses, higher cheekbones, narrower chins,

longer eyelashes.

A lot of them just make you whiter — which is so messed up.

All across social media, a very particular beauty ideal

is being encoded.

Super white, hyper-feminine, and creepily youthful.

Snapchat even made a Marie Curie filter that gave her big,

fluttery eyelashes — for International Women’s Day.

And a button called Beauty Effect popped up on the screen

of musical.ly, a lip syncing app that is super popular among

really young girls.

They decided that a bunch of

digital facelifts before they could be seen singing along

to their favorite songs.

Some research suggests that sending out a selfie can give

us a momentary self-esteem boost

because it makes us feel like we have control over how

we’re seen.

Maybe these apps make us feel better about the way we look —

or maybe they make us feel worse without them.

One user of Meitu, a Chinese beauty app,

said she was so enamored of the edited version of her face that

she wished she could live in the world of her phone all

the time.

Um, yikes.

Instead of comparing ourselves to Photoshopped pictures

of celebrities, we can compare ourselves to idealized versions

of ourselves.

Instead of a fashion magazine editor deciding

what’s beautiful, we have technology companies urging us

to download apps and press their buttons.

It all makes beauty standards feel scientific.

Just like Fitbits count our steps and calculate

the calories we’ve burned, and sleep monitors track our REM

cycles and know just when to wake us up,

beauty apps seem to map out our faces objectively

and algorithmically determine what’s wrong with them.

And once we send a selfie out into the world,

we get even more data back that seems to tell us how popular

our faces are compared to other people’s faces.

And interactions are all gamified,

which means that we keep tapping,

looking to see if anyone liked us.

It’s become really common for younger users of Instagram

to post a selfie, and if it doesn’t get enough likes,

delete it so they don’t seem unpopular.

The whole picture of who we are online is being molded by

app companies hungry for engagement numbers.

We’re always being nudged to post content that gets more

attention from other users —

the kind of stuff that makes other people addicted

to our feeds.

Something as seemingly frivolous as a selfie can actually push

a lot of addictive psychological buttons.

The same picture can elicit feelings of admiration, envy,

disdain, and self-doubt — sometimes all at the same time.

Taking a selfie is often criticized as a deeply

narcissistic act.

I don’t really think that’s true.

To me, the selfie is a request to participate in the

online world.

Putting your face on the internet is no more vain than

showing up at a party and seeing your friends.

But these apps don’t care about us becoming fully realized

people online.

To them, our faces are marketing opportunities.

They make us question our worth, and then sell us a filter

to fix it.

Jay Kriegel, a senior adviser at the Related Companies, a real estate firm, praised Mr. de Blasio’s emphasis on the tax proposal. Mr. Kriegel led a campaign for the New York business community to oppose a similar effort to change the tax deductibility during the Reagan administration.

The Association for a Better New York is opposed to Mr. Trump’s proposal to do away with state and local tax deductions, which have been in place since 1913, and most in attendance on Monday appeared to agree with Mr. de Blasio. But many declined afterward to be quoted on the substance of his address for fear of angering an incumbent mayor on the day before all expected him to be returned to office for another four years.

“This is a guy who has come a long way in four years. Very polished, no teleprompter,” said John H. Banks III, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. “It didn’t surprise me that he didn’t try to make news.”

Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group, agreed, but added that “it would have been better, even better, if he specifically urged the audience” — some of whom are donors to Democrats and Republicans alike — “to express their concerns to particular New York House members who are in favor or on the fence about voting against the legislation.”

By contrast, she said, the mayor’s promise during a brief question-and-answer session with the audience to “definitely address the need for reform of the city’s property tax system was quite specific and firm.”

The choice to host Mr. de Blasio for a major address less than 24 hours before polls open in New York City was not the mayor’s, according to spokeswomen for Mr. de Blasio and the association. After the group invited the mayor, it was the only date they could find that would accommodate schedules as well as the availability of the room.

Shortly after the speech, Mr. de Blasio published an essay with Business Insider, a web publication, on the Republican tax proposal theme, saying it was akin to asking “hardworking New Yorkers” to withdraw $1,000 in cash and then “find a hedge fund manager to give it to.”","As de Blasio Looks to 2nd Term, He Sees a City Threatened by Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-trump-tax-plan.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Then there is the Status of Forces Agreement, signed between the two nations in 1966 and renewed twice. It has been understood to grant the United States military nearly exclusive jurisdiction over its personnel, such that even high-profile offenses committed by American soldiers against South Korean citizens go unpunished.

One of the most heinous examples happened in 2002 when an American military vehicle ran over two middle-school students, crushing them to death. The perpetrators were shielded from South Korean authorities and a United States military court dismissed the case.

More recently, the United States military has refused to take responsibility for its environmental degradation of its base in central Seoul.

Being an ally has also meant deploying soldiers for America’s wars — to Vietnam, where some 5,000 South Koreans died and many suffered from exposure to the United States-made chemical weapon known as Agent Orange; and to Iraq in the 2000s, despite enormous local protests. Government officials from that time have explained that the Iraq deployment came in response to the Bush administration’s threat to reduce the number of Americans stationed in South Korea.

But the biggest cost of the alliance has been the erosion of South Korea’s sovereign spirit. There is enormous support among South Koreans for the United States military presence, and it isn’t simply a reflection of national goodwill toward America. It speaks volumes about just how much South Korea has become psychologically dependent on a foreign army as a potential barrier against North Korea, despite an annual national defense budget amounting to about 2.7 percent of its G.D.P. and a nearly 650,000-strong military.

Washington knows full well that stationing its soldiers on South Korean soil isn’t an act of charity. America offers protection, but only in return for influence over its lesser allies’ affairs.

Still, many South Korean conservatives consider any critique of the alliance blasphemous, even as Seoul finds itself being called a freeloader by President Trump. He has also demanded that South Korea pay for the American-made missile-defense system deployed here, which has had the effect of provoking Chinese outrage and economic retaliation against South Korea. (In a gesture at damage control, a senior White House official later took back the freeloader statement, admitting South Korea is a “model ally” that spends sufficiently on its own defense, and the administration had to reiterate that Seoul wasn’t being asked to pay for the missile shield, at least for now.)

South Korea has pulled out all the stops to prepare for Mr. Trump’s state visit on Tuesday. Domestic news outlets have been fixated on every detail, fretting over whether his single-night stay means he isn’t invested in South Korea. (He is spending two nights in both Tokyo and Beijing.)

That obsessiveness itself is tragic. Consider Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to incite war here, and the majority of the American public’s indifference to Korean lives — a poll from September found 58 percent of Americans support military action against Pyongyang if peaceful means cannot put a stop to its weapons program, even as a congressional report recently concluded that a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula could leave up to 300,000 people dead in the early days of fighting.

In the age of Trump, South Korea should look to an example set by another longtime American ally. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany didn’t hesitate to say in May that Europe can no longer “completely depend” on the United States. “We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands,” she said.

After being a dutiful ally for more than six decades, it may be time for South Koreans, too, to take their destiny into their own hands.",Is South Korea’s Alliance with the United States Worth It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/trump-south-korea-alliance.html

The Khan Sheikhoun investigation, the first such in-depth video forensics report carried out by the team, illustrated the potential for such projects. “We’re increasingly seeing the value in this type of reporting, and The Times has committed to making it a part of how we gather and report the news,” said Marcelle Hopkins, the deputy editor of the video department. “It has been done in the past with human rights organizations and some smaller investigative organizations, but we’ve recognized that this is something that can be extremely useful in reporting.”

But its deep entanglements with slavery did not.

“Princeton’s history is American history writ small,” said Martha Sandweiss, the history professor who led the project. “From the beginning, liberty and slavery were intertwined.”

The Princeton research is being released amid renewed debate about slavery, the Civil War and national memory. It also arrives nearly two years after a student group at Princeton called the Black Justice League occupied the president’s office and demanded, among other things, that Woodrow Wilson’s name be removed from places of honor on campus because of his racist ideas and actions.

Wilson, a Princeton graduate and former president of the university, kept his place, and that controversy quieted down. The new research does not come with any recommendations for action. But Professor Sandweiss said she hoped it would foster a broader, more fully informed conversation about history and racial justice.

“Woodrow Wilson doesn’t just come from nowhere, “ she said. “He comes from this particular place.”

Unlike slavery research at some other institutions, the Princeton project was a bottom-up affair, originating with an undergraduate class that Professor Sandweiss began teaching in 2013, with help from the university’s archivist, Dan Linke. Early on, she told the administration what she was doing and said she didn’t think it would be “embarrassing to Princeton,” she recalled.

As the project grew, it was supported piecemeal by various partners, including the university’s art museum, which has commissioned a large-scale outdoor installation by the artist Titus Kaphar commemorating the 1766 slave sale, and the McCarter Theater, which has commissioned seven plays inspired by the research, to be performed later this month as part of a two-day public symposium.

[Playwrights on putting the ghosts of Princeton’s racial past onstage]

Earlier this year, the project got more formal support from the administration, in the form of a grant from the Princeton Histories Fund, established in the wake of the Wilson controversy to support “aspects of Princeton’s history that have been forgotten, overlooked, subordinated or suppressed.”

Princeton’s current president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, who will speak at the symposium, issued a statement praising the project’s “creativity, diverse perspectives and rigorous academic standards,” which he said he hoped would promote “a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of our history.”

That history is certainly imposing. Princeton, founded in 1746 as the College of New Jersey, is the nation’s fourth-oldest university, and the one most associated with the American Revolution. Its sixth president, John Witherspoon, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In 1783, the Continental Congress briefly met in Nassau Hall, in the same room where campus lore holds that a cannonball (fired by Alexander Hamilton, no less) decapitated a portrait of George III six years earlier.

Today, that room is lined with oil portraits of the university’s presidents, the first nine of whom owned slaves. (The researchers found no evidence that the university itself ever owned slaves.) On a recent morning, Professor Sandweiss paused in front of the likeness of Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751-1819).

Smith, a Presbyterian minister, helped inspire the colonization movement, which advocated resettling freed slaves in Africa. (Many leading colonization advocates, the researchers discovered, had Princeton connections.)

But at a time when many educated whites believed that blacks had separate evolutionary origins, Smith also argued that racial differences were purely due to environment, and even advocated interracial marriage.

“Historians are fond of going around saying, ‘It’s complicated,’” Professor Sandweiss said. “But it is complicated.”

Professor Sandweiss’s team, which included some 30 students and two full-time postdoctoral fellows, Craig Hollander and Joseph Yannielli, looked at subjects familiar from studies at other universities, like slavery-related donations and slave ownership among professors, including one who owned a slave as late as 1840.

But they also zeroed in on one of the distinctive, and fateful, aspects of Princeton’s history: its heavily Southern student body.

In the archives, they found evidence of early administrators’ eagerness to recruit students from the South. To nail down some hard data, a dozen graduate students gathered in the archives one night and, with the cast album of “Hamilton” blaring, tracked down the places of origin for more than 2,000 names in their database of pre-Civil War students.

Roughly 40 percent of students from the college’s founding until 1861, the researchers determined, came from the slaveholding South, with the figure spiking as high as nearly two-thirds in the early 1850s. (The figure for Harvard and Yale at that time was about 9 percent.) And as slavery moved southwest, a heat map on the website shows, so too did the student body.

“Princeton had more students from Mississippi in the decades before the Civil War than it does today,” Professor Sandweiss said.

This fact heavily influenced the culture at Princeton, which became more conservative as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified.

In town, Southern students (as well as many Northern ones) encountered something unfamiliar: a proud, and longstanding, free black community. But inside the campus gates, the university was maintained as a safe space for the sons of slaveholders.

Unlike at Harvard and Yale, abolitionists were generally not invited to speak on campus. And when they did show up, violence sometimes ensued. In 1835, a gang of students descended on the town’s African-American neighborhood in an attempt to lynch a white agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society who had come to address a secret meeting. (Researchers found no records of any attempts to discipline those students.)

The next year, at commencement, a white student from South Carolina attacked a black abolitionist minister, Theodore Sedgwick Wright, shouting a racial slur. The university’s president, James Carnahan, a onetime slaveholder, published a letter denying that the attacker was a Princeton student or that any actual violence had occurred, and blaming Wright for the disturbance.

But Princeton’s compromise over slavery, like the nation’s, didn’t hold forever. In the university’s archives, R. Isabela Morales, a graduate student, found an 1846 diary in which a student from Mississippi described going out with other “Southern bloods” to hunt down a local black man they had scuffled with and “try him in the worshipful court of Judge Lynch.”

Another group of students, led by John Maclean Jr., a professor who later became Princeton’s first nonslaveholding president, mustered to try and stop them. The man was still “whipped within an inch of his life,” the diarist exulted, “to the silent Satisfaction of all the arrayed collegians from the South!”

“Princeton had a reputation as this moderate place, where Northerners and Southerners got along,” Ms. Morales said. “But here, 15 years before the Civil War, you have them dividing along battle lines to fight over the question of race.”

Photo

As Southern states began seceding, Southern students began leaving campus. In student autograph books, Ms. Sandweiss’s team found poignant inscriptions traded by friends who would soon meet on the battlefield. “Basically, they’re going off to kill their roommates,” Professor Sandweiss said.

The researchers have yet to figure out just when Southern students (like the Virginia-born Wilson, class of 1879), started coming back after the Civil War, and in what numbers. But the instinct to keep the sectional peace reasserted itself.

An article on the website tells the story of the Civil War memorial carved on a wall just inside Nassau Hall in the 1920s — the only one anywhere in the country, Professor Sandweiss said, to give no indication of which cause the names inscribed there fought for.

The initial plan was to group them by side. But the university’s president at the time, John Grier Hibben, overruled it, saying “no one shall know on which side these young men fought.”

Photo

On today’s campuses, the battles are often fought over monuments themselves. One of the new plays commissioned for the project, by Nathan Alan Davis, features a rawly funny dialogue between a statue of John Witherspoon, Princeton’s slave-owning Revolutionary War-era president, and a contemporary African-American student armed with a blowtorch.

As part of the aftermath of the Wilson controversy, Princeton is already discussing ways to make its iconography more reflective of its current diversity.

“If you walk around campus, you see a lot of dead white men,” Professor Sandweiss said. “That’s not untrue to our history, but it is deeply untrue to what Princeton has worked hard to become in the past few decades.”

“From my perspective, transparency is lacking here and that’s the most important thing, especially because you’re working with public money.”","Known as one of the most influential figures in the world of international contemporary art, Ms. Ruf was hired to run the Stedelijk in 2014. Her tenure has been distinguished by critically acclaimed programming and an ambitious collaboration with the renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to redesign the museum’s layout to better present its permanent collection.

Ms. Ruf’s sudden departure, accompanied by only very general public statements from Stedelijk officials and, until now, just a single quote from Ms. Ruf in a news release, had cast a shadow on her reputation and left lingering concerns about the Stedelijk board’s ability to govern with transparency. The situation has also raised broader questions about the accountability of government-owned Dutch cultural institutions, which are substantially funded by the state and owe the public explanations of their policies and practices.

Ms. Ruf agreed to an exclusive interview by email with The Times, saying that she hoped to clarify her role in what she called a “misunderstanding.” She advised that her responses would be vetted by her lawyers before being sent to The Times.

All of her side activities were “contractually approved by the Stedelijk” before she took the job, Ms. Ruf wrote. Throughout her responses, she said several times, “I am confident that I reported everything in good faith.”

Madeleine de Cock Buning, the acting chairwoman of the museum’s supervisory board was forwarded Ms. Ruf’s comments and replied by email saying that the board had begun two independent investigations. “We have decided not to answer questions of the media while the investigations are going on,” she added.

Ms. Ruf, who was born in Singen, Germany, and who worked as a curator and choreographer, mostly in Switzerland, came to the Stedelijk from the Kunsthalle Zurich, where in 12 years as director she made a name for herself by mounting cutting-edge exhibitions by artists such as Trisha Donnelly, Wade Guyton and Seth Price.

Mark Reutter, who was chairman of the Kunsthalle’s board at the time, said that her contract with the Kunsthalle allowed her to do outside work as an art adviser and consultant. The Kunsthalle does not have its own collection and does not purchase artworks, so there was no potential conflict of interest.

Ms. Ruf’s primary side activity while employed by the Kunsthalle was working as a salaried art adviser to the wealthy Swiss publisher and art collector Michael Ringier, who, over 20 years, collected a trove of more than 4,000 works of contemporary art with Ms. Ruf’s help.

When she was offered the job at the Stedelijk, Ms. Ruf wanted to continue this kind of art advisory work, she said, adding that she had sought and received approval from the museum’s board to do so. She said she then established Currentmatters for this purpose.

The Stedelijk’s most recent annual report lists 18 “additional functions” that Ms. Ruf provided, such as acting as a jurist for international art prizes, advising or serving on boards of art institutions in Moscow, Rome, Vienna and Dhaka, Bangladesh, and advising the American bank Goldman Sachs on their corporate art collection in London.

Benno Tempel, director of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, said that he felt it was acceptable for museum directors to sit on juries and boards, but “if there’s money involved, that money should go to the institution.”

Jo Houben, director of the Dutch nonprofit organization Culture+Entrepreneurship, which established a local code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said that any side activities that benefit an individual rather than the institution they work for is not consistent with the code’s principles.

“But there’s a big difference if the board allowed her to do that and they knew what was happening,” he added. “If the supervisory board allowed the director to do something, and it turns out to be not a good choice, then the board may have to resign.”

Mr. Houben added that the Stedelijk building is owned by the city of Amsterdam, and the city and the Dutch state finance the institution. “So if you work there you have to be aware that you work with public money and behind the public money are public values, and that means you work for the public and not for your private interest,” he said.

Under a rule in the code of ethics called “comply or explain,“ he added, it’s fine for an organization to make its own special arrangements that deviate from the code, but the document recommends that the institution inform the public about it in its annual report or some other public document. “I don’t see any place where the board communicates that they don’t follow the code,” Mr. Houben said.

In 2015, Currentmatters reported a profit of about $500,000 to the Dutch tax authorities, but Ms. Ruf said that the number was misleading: “Many people wrongly assumed these profits came from side activities conducted in 2015 while I was artistic director of the Stedelijk Museum,” she said. “In fact, this profit statement reflects legitimate income from activities conducted before 2015, primarily a parting bonus for past work from the Ringier Collection in the amount of 1 million Swiss Francs.”

Ms. Ruf said that her actual earnings from “approved side activities” were 104,000 euros, or around $120,000, per year in 2015 and 2016. She said that the €378,000 she reported in 2015, and €628,000 that she earned in 2016 came from “activities conducted before 2015,” and primarily reflected the bonus from Mr. Ringier. On Wednesday, Ms. Ruf is required to report her 2016 earnings to the Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands and these figure will become publicly available.

Mr. Ringier confirmed in a phone interview that he had given Ms. Ruf the “thank you gift” of 1 million francs, paid in installments over 2015 and 2016. He said that he did this because Ms. Ruf added value “in the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions” to his collection.

“The money that I think everybody talks about in this company is the money she got for the 20 years of work for us,” Mr. Ringier said. “It had nothing to do with an ongoing advisorship.”

“We absolutely wanted to avoid a conflict of interest,” Mr. Ringier said.

Even though Ms. Ruf said the Stedelijk’s board had approved her side activities for the Ringier collection, she said that she and Mr. Ringier decided it would be best if they no longer worked together, and she sent her last invoice in December 2014.

The Stedelijk’s board did not respond to questions about whether Ms. Ruf reported to the museum that she received the bonus from Mr. Ringier. Ms. Ruf declined to comment on that question.

In spite of what she said were efforts to report everything in good faith, questions remained about whether her arrangement with the Stedelijk from the beginning followed international and national codes of ethics.

Mijntje Lückerath-Rovers, a professor of corporate governance at Tilburg University and the chairman of the committee that drafted the code of ethics for arts professionals in the Netherlands, said in a phone interview, “If there was some logical explanation, they could have said, ‘Sorry that we were not that transparent in the beginning, we now want to be as transparent as possible, and here is what happened.’ ” In that case, she said, Ms. Ruf could have kept her job.

The absence of any such explanation “does give the outside world, including me, the idea that something is not completely right,” Professor Lückerath-Rovers said. “From my perspective, transparency is lacking here and that’s the most important thing, especially because you’re working with public money.”",Museum Leader Who Resigned Calls Controversy a ‘Misunderstanding’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/amsterdam-beatrix-ruf-stedelijk.html

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word.","When I first read these lines early this summer in The Paris Review, which published an excerpt, I was floored. I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

Photo

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:",The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

There is widespread agreement that the industry failed to properly represent less educated white voters, and that this was part of why last year’s polls were too favorable to Democrats. It’s likely to remain a big issue, at least as long as white voters split so decisively on educational lines. The postelection report of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the nation’s leading polling association, reached a similar conclusion.

One possible fix is to weight by education, which would give more or less weight to certain respondents to ensure that less educated voters represent the appropriate share of the poll’s final estimate. For many public polls, weighting by education would make a big difference. It could move an otherwise lightly weighted poll by as much as four percentage points toward the Republicans in the Virginia governor’s race, for example, based on an analysis of the most recent Upshot/Siena College poll. With the Democrat, Ralph Northam, holding a modest lead in most polls, the difference could be enough to flip several surveys in the state.

There are a few pollsters in Virginia — like The Washington Post and Quinnipiac — that do weight by education, and did so before the 2016 presidential election. Most others weren’t weighting by education before 2016 and aren’t weighting by it today.

The disparity can be extreme. Sixty-six percent of likely voters were listed as college graduates in the latest Christopher Newport University survey of Virginia, well above the range of 49 percent to 52 percent in Upshot estimates. Mr. Northam led by six points in the Christopher Newport University poll. A Gravis poll, which showed Mr. Northam ahead by five points, had four-year college graduates at 60 percent of the electorate. A tied Roanoke poll had the college-educated share of the electorate at 57 percent.

The relative lack of change among public pollsters doesn’t mean that the pre-election polls in Virginia or elsewhere are doomed to miss by as much as they did in 2016. By most accounts, the 2016 polling error took a perfect storm: Just about everything that could break Mr. Trump’s way appears to have done so. Next time, it could be the Democrats who beat turnout expectations and sway undecided voters. There’s also no guarantee that the stark educational divide of the 2016 presidential election will be as prominent without Mr. Trump on the ballot, or as important with midterm voters, who tend to be more educated.

But the lack of change hints at a bleak possibility: a mismatch between the scale of the challenge facing the survey research industry and the capacity of many individual public pollsters to respond.

Education Is a Mystery

It might seem obvious that the 2016 election would drive public pollsters to adopt big changes. But many individual public pollsters were reasonably satisfied by their results, even though the industry as a whole seemed to get it wrong.

It’s not completely unreasonable. Last year’s polling error was an odd one. It was almost perfectly distributed across the battleground states to maximize the electoral consequences. There were large errors in a small number of states where Mrs. Clinton had a big lead, like Wisconsin and Michigan. But elsewhere the errors were more typical, or even nonexistent. Virginia is one such state: Mrs. Clinton led by five or six points in all the final polling averages; in the end, she won by 5.3 points.

If pollsters didn’t take any surveys in the Midwest, most or all of their results were probably in the margin of error. Their result might have leaned toward Mrs. Clinton, like everyone else’s, but they could explain that away: There is a lot of evidence that undecided voters broke toward Mr. Trump. And most public pollsters didn’t conduct enough polls, late enough in the race, to be sure of just how well or poorly they really did.

Some pollsters did take enough surveys late enough in the race to merit a re-examination, but they didn’t think education was decisive. Patrick Murphy of Monmouth University, for instance, found that weighting by education would have explained only one percentage point of bias in his surveys.

But perhaps the bigger issue is that education is a mystery: It’s hard for pollsters to even know if they’re getting it wrong, let alone to fix it.

“I don’t weight to education because it’s pretty hard to find accurate benchmarks for a likely-voter profile based on education,” said Matthew Towery of Opinion Savvy, a firm that often conducts state polls using automated calls. “That’s not something that’s necessarily easily ascertained most of the time.”

He’s right. It’s not easy to weight by education, and it’s especially tough for pollsters who rely on voter registration files — the “big data” that powers most campaigning polling and analytics. Many pollsters use voter file data, rather than dialing telephone numbers at random (known as random digit dialing, or R.D.D.), to conduct their surveys and estimate the composition of the electorate.

Voter files offer pollsters rich demographic and political data to help them weight their survey and estimate the likely electorate. R.D.D. surveys have their own advantages, but the loss of this data is a considerable disadvantage, especially in a low-turnout election. Unsurprisingly, the Virginia polls that at least partly use R.D.D. have occasionally produced somewhat outlying results.

But the voter file has a weakness: Education is not reliably included on public voter files. To weight by education, pollsters using the voter file have to look elsewhere — something pollsters who trust the voter file are generally reluctant to do. Not coincidentally, only two of the nonpartisan Virginia pollsters using a voter file appear to weight by education; all but one of the pollsters using random digit dialing in Virginia do, most likely using the census.

What’s the alternative? A pollster could ask voters how much education they have in order to match estimates for the likely electorate from some other source, but there isn’t a definitive benchmark for weighting. There still isn’t universal agreement about how many voters in 2016 had a college degree: There’s a wide 10-point gap between the exit poll results and the census postelection survey.

The combination of the uncertainty around the true educational composition of the electorate and the reluctance to weight voter-file surveys by self-reported measures has been enough to deter many public-voter-file-based surveys from weighting by education.

These same factors pose a challenge to private partisan pollsters. But the pace of change among them has nonetheless been far greater.

All but one of the 10 private partisan pollsters interviewed for this article have begun to do something about education, whether by weighting or by other means.

“This is the first time ever that I’ve weighted education, getting ready for some elections in 2018,” said Glen Bolger, a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies, a prominent Republican polling firm, “because education is a pretty damn good predictor.”

For private pollsters, there is a lot more acceptance of the problem — and more acceptance that they just got it wrong, especially on the Democratic side. The big private polling firms conducted more than enough surveys, in enough states, late enough in the race, to have no illusions about whether their results were meaningfully biased.

Some of them were already doing something about it before the election, but now they’re generally doing more. There’s still uncertainty about the exact way to do it, but most private pollsters are persuaded by the necessity of change — uncertainty is no longer an excuse to do nothing.

“It’s kind of a cop-out,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research. “You can’t say I can’t deal with education because I don’t know the exact weight of it. You wouldn’t not weight on race because you couldn’t figure it out.”

Is It Enough?

The debate among private pollsters, especially on the Democratic side, has instead advanced to a different stage: whether weighting by education is enough.

The cause for debate is simple. Even weighting by education wouldn’t have been enough to give Mr. Trump the polling edge. One possibility, often advanced by more traditional firms, is that the residual error could be explained by turnout or shifts among undecided voters.

But there’s a more ominous possibility. It wasn’t just that polls didn’t capture enough less educated white voters; it was also that they didn’t get the right less educated white voters.

Perhaps the polls missed less educated voters in the most rural areas. Maybe they missed those who don’t work in office jobs, in old-economy sectors like manufacturing or agriculture. Or maybe they missed voters with low levels of social trust or a lower propensity to volunteer, who have long been less likely to respond to surveys and may have been more likely to support Mr. Trump in 2016.

If true, the problem is a lot more difficult to solve. Weighting by education would not be an adequate remedy, since “baristas aren’t exchangeable with factory workers,” as David Shor of Civis Analytics puts it. Civis is the Democratic firm that has probably been the most vocal about the possibility that the polling industry suffers from bigger nonresponse challenges than can be fixed by weighting by education.

The possibility of a deeper kind of nonresponse bias is now broadly held in the Democratic analytics world, but it’s nowhere near a consensus across the polling industry. That’s in part because there’s limited public evidence to support it at this stage. It’s also because many traditional pollsters are skeptical of analytics firms with an economic incentive to argue that traditional polling is broken or even impossible. But traditional pollsters mentioned some of these issues as well.

Research in this area seems poised to continue for the foreseeable future. But most of these efforts are occurring out of the view of public polling firms. If something is more profoundly wrong with public polling than weighting by education alone can address, it’s hard to see how many public polling firms will be able to do anything about it.","After a Tough 2016, Many Pollsters Haven’t Changed Anything",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/upshot/after-a-tough-2016-many-pollsters-havent-changed-anything.html

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster.

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

Mundy delves deeply into a transitional pre-Betty Friedan moment in American life when institutional discrimination was the norm.
At the end of the war, virtually all of the female code breakers were given their walking papers and returned to civilian life.","In an era when history is being updated to reflect the math and science accomplishments of 20th-century women with such accounts as Margot Lee Shetterly’s “Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race,” Mundy’s book offers valuable insights and information about those unsung women who made crucial contributions during wartime.

Their work was often mind-numbingly tedious and frustrating as the women spent 12-hour days and seven-day weeks in steamy offices staring at incomprehensible columns of numbers and letters and trying to decipher patterns. They learned to recognize ciphers — where one letter is substituted for another letter or number — and to interpret “additives,” extra numbers thrown in to stump prying eyes. They built and operated “bombe” machines to decode the thousands of German messages sent out via the complex Enigma machine, work that was done in conjunction with Bletchley Park.

Mundy’s narrative turns thrilling as she chronicles the eureka moments when the women succeed in cracking codes, relying on a mixture of mathematical expertise, memorization and occasional leaps of intuition. Thanks to their efforts in retrieving and passing along vital information about enemy battle plans and the whereabouts of Japanese vessels, the American military was able to sink enemy supply ships, shoot down enemy planes and blunt attacks on American targets. This was emotionally fraught work since the women occasionally learned, in advance, that the Japanese had targeted ships in regions where their loved ones were serving. As Mundy writes, “Some of the women broke messages warning about attacks before they happened but were helpless to avert them.”

In the run-up to the D-Day landing in Normandy, the women were also charged with creating phony coded American messages to deceive the Germans about the site of the invasion.

A former Washington Post reporter, Mundy was inspired to tackle this book after her husband, Mark Bradley, a veteran Justice Department official, read a declassified World War II document about a counterintelligence operation, which noted that many women schoolteachers worked on the project.

The author of three previous books that touch on feminist themes, Mundy paints a vivid portrait of the daily lives of these energetic single young women — the upheaval and challenges of adjusting to the high-pressure military environment, the condescension and sexism from male colleagues and superiors, the cramped living quarters, the constant anxiety over brothers and boyfriends in harm’s way, the wartime romances, weekend high jinks and stress-related breakdowns.

Three-quarters of a century later, with firsthand recollections of World War II vanishing daily in the obituary columns, Mundy was able to track down and interview more than 20 former code breakers such as Ann Caracristi, an English major at Russell Sage College who turned out to be such a problem-solving prodigy that as a 23-year-old she became the head of an Army research unit. Dorothy Braden Bruce, a 97-year-old former Virginia schoolteacher known as Dot, described the tense experience of decoding urgent data from Japanese supply ships and also offered up amusing and poignant details about wartime life.

These accounts are supplemented by numerous oral histories, declassified documents and exhaustive research at the National Archives. Mundy delves deeply into a transitional pre-Betty Friedan moment in American life when institutional discrimination was the norm. As she points out, a 1941 Navy memo proposed paying female clerks, typists and stenographers $1,440 per year, while men in the same posts were to receive $1,620. The gap grew even larger higher up the ladder: Female Ph.D.s were slated for $2,300 salaries compared with $3,200 for their male counterparts.

The author unearths the stories of pioneers like Agnes Meyer Driscoll, a math, physics and language whiz who joined the Navy in 1917, broke Japanese codebooks in the 1920s and ’30s and went on to train a generation of male code breakers, only to be patronized and pushed aside during World War II. The talented cryptologist Elizebeth Smith Friedman was hired by the Coast Guard in 1927 to break the code of rumrunners and went on to work for other federal agencies, designing the codes used by the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the C.I.A. Yet her husband, the Army code breaker William Friedman, was sometimes given credit for her work.

In her effort to cram in an enormous amount of information and give so many women their due, Mundy’s book suffers at times since it’s hard to keep track of her vast cast of characters, many with similar backgrounds. As their stories began to blur, I found myself frequently flipping back to remind myself who was who. When she attempts to tell the tale thematically, her time-shifting can be confusing. At the end of Part Two of the book, it’s the summer of 1944, the United States military has just retaken Guam and Dot Braden is feeling optimistic that the Allies are doing well in the Pacific. When Part Three begins a few pages later, we’re back in 1943; then the story abruptly zigs to dismal times in 1942.

At the end of the war, virtually all of the female code breakers were given their walking papers and returned to civilian life. Only a few superstars were asked to stay on (among them Caracristi, who went on to become the first female deputy director of the National Security Agency).

For these accomplished and resourceful women, who had been given a heady taste of professional success, it was jarring to have to fight to be accepted to top graduate programs on the G.I. Bill or embark on traditional paths as wives and mothers. Warned not to reveal their secret wartime lives, many remained silent about their valuable service. Thanks to Mundy’s book, which deftly conveys both the puzzle-solving complexities and the emotion and drama of this era, their stories will live on.",The Women Who Helped America Crack Axis Codes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/books/review/liza-mundy-code-girls-world-war-ii.html

At around 11:20 a.m. local time, the gunman, identified as Devin Patrick Kelley, exited his vehicle and opened fire with a rifle outside the church, according a spokesman of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Mr. Kelley, who was wearing all-black tactical gear and a mask, then entered the church, and continued to fire inside. Most of the victims were found inside the church. Two were found outside.

After Mr. Kelley exited the church, he shot at residents who had come outside. A church neighbor returned fire with a rifle and hit the gunman. Mr. Kelley got into his vehicle and fled north towards Guadalupe County, with neighbors driving after him in pursuit.

First Baptist Church is in Sutherland Springs, Tex., about 30 miles east of San Antonio. Mr. Kelley lived in New Braunfels, Tex., a city about 35 miles north of the shooting.

Sunday worship service, according to the church’s website, is scheduled for 11 a.m.

YouTube videos of recent Sunday services at the church show at least 30 people in attendance, including many children. The victims of Sunday’s shooting ranged from 18 months to 77 years of age, according to law enforcement officials.",What Happened at the Texas Church Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/05/us/texas-church-shooting.html

Reading her is akin to taking the subway. If you miss a train, another will be along shortly.

I was about to gently drop this book behind my couch when something happened. It began to get not just good but very good. The tone warmed; the arguments grew sharper.

“Aging Thoughtfully” is framed as a conversation and, although these two are friends, it grows heated. You begin to sense that while one is talking, the other is chalking his or her pool cue.

Nussbaum lands the first real blow. After Levmore argues that mandatory retirement ages are a boon for society, in part because they allow young people a chance for promotion in the work force, she replies they are “one of the great moral evils of our times.”

We’ve fought discrimination based upon race, disability and sexual orientation. “Age,” she writes, “is the next frontier.” As to young people’s need for advancement, she posits: “Just imagine the response if people were to say, let’s exclude women and minorities from the workplace, because there are not enough jobs — or, more pointedly, because ‘they’ are taking ‘our’ jobs.”

Levmore returns fire after Nussbaum deplores planned retirement communities like The Villages in Central Florida. These are places where the residents live in burped-shut and kid-free bubbles of golf, happy talk and sunshine. She finds them scary and superficial, their residents lacking in curiosity and altruism.

My blink reaction is to concur. I’d rather have an eye plucked out than live in The Villages. Yet Levmore is persuasive when he asks what’s wrong with middle-income people enjoying “some of the affluence of the nation they helped build.”

His argument is in part class-based. “During most of their lives they observed people with higher incomes traveling abroad, buying second homes, sending children to private colleges, and subscribing to The New Yorker.” They have earned comfortable lives. He likens these communities to the “safe spaces” some college students insist upon.

Levmore is at home with statistical and fiscal argument; Nussbaum is the more supple writer. She loses her way in “Aging Thoughtfully” when she approaches her topics through the lengthy parsing of works like Richard Strauss’s opera “Der Rosenkavalier” or Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.” These sections devolve into tedious plot summary.

When Nussbaum seizes upon examples from her own life, she is vastly more persuasive. She reports, for example, that she declines sedation while undergoing a colonoscopy. For one thing, there are no pain nerves in the colon.

For another, she wishes to confront the actualities of her body. One of her themes is the need to fight our instinctive disgust at aging bodies. She recalls the era-defining book “Our Bodies, Ourselves,” and wonders where that spirit of investigation into health and sexuality went. “I fear that my generation is letting disgust and shame sweep over us again, as a new set of bodily challenges beckons.”

Neither Nussbaum nor Levmore oppose surgical procedures to make one look younger, at least when these are not absurd or don’t take the place of exercise and proper diet. “There is nothing wrong with wanting to look better,” Nussbaum writes, “it’s what we all do every day.”

We take a dim view of Botox injections because we notice them only when they go badly, she suggests. We should judge by best cases instead. The hard part will be to steer a “course between the Scylla of excessive deference to ‘nature’ and the Charybdis of obsession with flight from age.”

We are in a boomlet of frisky writing about growing old, from Michael Kinsley’s “Old Age: A Beginner’s Guide” to the several memoirs from the English editor Diana Athill to Arlene Heyman’s story collection “Scary Old Sex.”

Let’s also toast Jane Juska, who died on Oct. 24, for her 2003 memoir, “A Round-Heeled Woman.” It had plenty to say about late-life sexual desire, and said it well.

Nussbaum and Levmore are as interested in asking the right questions as they are with notching the right answers. This seems appropriate.

“I see all these programs as a unit of sorts,” said Houston’s director, Cristina Rivera-Garza, “a group interested in developing the writers of the 21st century: bilingual, diverse and representative of the communities thriving in the United States.”

The Houston and Cal State programs are also developing activist efforts to support local Hispanic populations (Houston’s has grown by more than 200,000 from 2000 to 2016; Los Angeles County’s by about 600,000). Cal State’s program director, Alex Espinoza, said its students will help residents in largely Spanish-speaking East L.A. write biographical narratives that counter those “too often generalized in the media” — and by the Trump administration.

Indeed, these programs could be seen as something of an artistic challenge to the administration’s stance on Hispanic immigrants, represented by its plans to revoke the DACA program protecting undocumented students from deportation, the proposed Mexican border wall, and the removal this year of the White House Spanish-language website.

Collectively, the programs could play a significant role in developing young writers who publicly voice varied aspects of the Hispanic experience.

The Juárez-El Paso geography — two communities intertwined culturally and economically, separated by a parched Rio Grande barely waist deep — is a topic the students and professors have explored in their literary work. Perhaps the starkest difference between the cities is the drug-related violence on the Juárez side, which they depict with disturbing visceral images and blunt, uncensored vocabulary.

Juárez-El Paso is the largest metropolitan area on the border, with a combined population of more than two million, but the walk from downtown Juárez to downtown El Paso takes less than half an hour.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Alessandra Narváez-Varela used to walk across that border almost every day from Juárez to classes at the University of Texas, and to help out in the restaurant her family owns in El Paso. She has a B.S. in biology and a B.A. in creative writing. She spent a year in medical school, but “it didn’t feel like it was supposed to feel,” she said. Poetry did. Now 31, in El Paso’s bilingual M.F.A. program, she is writing to reconcile her dual identity and to give voice to women’s issues, especially involving female anatomy, that initially drew her to medicine. “Once you have that kind of conversation with the body you can’t let it go,” she said.

Oddly, while Ms. Narváez-Varela’s deepest roots lie in Spanish, she did not feel confident composing poetry in her native language. Her college writing had always been in English. “Maybe the Spanish speaker in me felt relegated to second-class-citizen status after adopting English as the language for my poetry,” she said.

I attended a presentation Ms. Narváez-Varela gave at a national writer’s conference in Los Angeles in which she explained how a workshop in the program had helped her find her Spanish voice.

She had written a poem in Spanish called “Ovarian Cancer,” filled with graphic imagery (she compared cancer to a bleeding fetus). Classmates had told her the beat pattern didn’t flow and criticized her use of rhyme. Ms. Narváez-Varela realized she had been unconsciously translating from English. She projected on a screen a copy of the poem, hand-edited by classmates, and an English translation, pointing out to the audience phrases she had originally conceived in English.

“Spanish, and the way it’s used to create music in poetry, differs radically in terms of syllables and rhyme,” she discovered. “It was a humbling workshop for me, but an enlightening one, too.”

Ms. Narváez-Varela went on to explore Mexican and American identities using Spanglish, the mixing of languages in the same sentences. In her poem “Real Mexican,” she describes, in raw and troubling language, a Mexican-American ex-convict so confused about his Hispanic identity he doesn’t know what name to call himself. In the opening line the character says: “Tony, Toño, Antonio, Anthony, it doesn’t matter, honey....”

“I had never before adopted a persona that explored Spanglish’s complexity and its meaning to me as a Mexican citizen naturalized in the U.S.,” Ms. Narváez-Varela said. “I realized this was a projection of my own anxieties as a Mexican-American. I had unconsciously judged others by the way they spoke Spanglish.” She said she was trying to show how the character’s use of Spanglish “is a vital manifestation of his identity as a marginalized member of both societies.”

Writing the poem helped her see the artistry of “a language as valid and beautiful as English or Spanish, as hybrid as African-American English, and therefore as deserving of a place in poetry.” Huizache, a journal of Latino literature, has just published “Real Mexican.”

Many important Hispanic fiction writers have attended traditional M.F.A. programs. I spoke with three of the masters — Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz and Esmeralda Santiago — about how they bridge two languages in their writing and about their graduate school experience. Each said that their M.F.A. programs did not recognize the Spanish-speaking side of their identities, either by assigning Latino authors or by supporting the Spanish element of their work.

Photo

Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”

She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.

The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”

In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.

When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”

“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”

Mr. Díaz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican-American writer, attended Cornell University’s M.F.A. program and now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In graduate education, he advocates for “ties to scholars working on the intersections of languages, on Creoles, on multilingualism.”

He explained his own mental translation process this way: “If I’m writing a character who is Spanish dominant, they talk and think within me in Spanish and I translate most of it into English. Some words refuse translations — sometimes it’s the joy of the word, or the energy it pulses with in the original Spanish sentence.” For example, Mr. Diaz freely employs English expletives in his work, but sometimes opts for rough Spanish equivalents.

Ms. Santiago, author of the memoir “When I Was Puerto Rican” and an M.F.A. graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, writes entire drafts bilingually. “I write as fast as I can and don’t worry whether what appears on the page is in English or in Spanish,” she said. “Later, when I’m editing, I will translate almost all of the Spanish into English if it’s for publication in that language. English and Spanish are for me the same language.”

•

In the El Paso program, faculty members strive to respond effectively to students who write in English, Spanish or both. Professors try to accommodate students in individual conferences by working in their preferred language. “I’ll speak in English and they’ll speak in Spanish,” said Daniel Chacón, one of 10 faculty members. “Then I might reiterate and clarify in Spanish.”

Whatever their level of proficiency, students must grapple with both languages. “They have to make the effort to bridge the gap,” said the director, José de Piérola. “It can be a shock to be stressed in this way, but it makes you grow.”

In one of Mr. de Piérola’s workshops, a student who spoke little Spanish led a group critique of a student’s short story. The story was in English, but he could not understand the group members who spoke in Spanish, and had to turn for explanations to fully bilingual classmates.

Many of the readings are available in translation, but even the students who feel challenged reading in the second language are encouraged to wrestle with the original texts. Some rely on tools like Google Translate, despite its limitations for interpreting literary language.

“When the Spanish speakers read American poets in English and vice versa, it changes their relationship to their own tradition,” Ms. Cote-Botero said.

She described how she might teach students to experiment with their writing by contrasting English and Spanish versions of the sonnet. She explained that Shakespeare standardized the English line using a steady five-beat pattern. “It’s closest to English speech and to the heartbeat,” she said.

One widely quoted example is Shakespeare’s opening line “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” The Spanish form, on the other hand, is based on a 14-syllable line. When students “mix the two, interesting things appear,” she said. By remaining “inside the boundaries of your own tradition you’re more at risk for repeating yourself.”

With a bilingual approach, Mr. Chacón said, “you can play with your own language a little more. James Joyce was able to play with language because he grew up with Gaelic and paid attention to its sound.”

To expose his students to writing styles in other languages, he adds to his reading lists translations of Japanese Zen koans and the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.

By encouraging students to explore different literary traditions and settings, the El Paso program is about more than just two languages.

Looking back as she approaches graduation next month (her thesis is a book of poetry about women), Ms. Narváez-Varela said that writing bilingually has pushed her beyond her comfort zone. This was a key reason she chose the program, and she hopes to carry that experience into a community college teaching position.

As a Mexican woman exploring life beyond the border, she will continue through her poems, she said, to “ask the hard questions, and expect no answers, or several, as playfully and passionately as possible.”","Seeking a Voice, via a Bilingual M.F.A., in Writing and in Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/education/edlife/bilingual-mfa-writing.html

“We learn our deepest ways of intimacy with mother,” she wrote. “Automatically we repeat the pattern” — taking the role of either mother or child — “with everyone else with whom we become close.”

Kirkus Reviews called the book ”a stimulating convergence of personal and cultural inquiry.” It remained on the New York Times best-seller list for over a year.

Ms. Friday dealt with other subjects, as the author of “Jealousy” (1985), “The Power of Beauty” (1996) and even a work of fiction, “Lulu: A Novella” (2012). But fantasy was her specialty, and the subject of four more of her books, including “Women on Top: How Real Life Has Changed Women’s Sexual Fantasies” (1991) and “Men in Love: Men’s Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love Over Rage” (1980).

Discussing ""Men in Love” in 1980, she told People magazine: “The major theme in men’s sexual fantasies is the sexually aroused woman. It’s still hard for most men to believe that women enjoy sex.”

Ms. Friday became a frequent guest on television talk shows, called on to discuss almost any issue that particularly affected women. She often took the unfashionable side of an argument.

On the late-night show “Tomorrow” in 1981, she and the host, Tom Snyder, flirted as they discussed the topic of sexual initiative.

“I think men are very much waiting for women to take the initiative,” Ms. Friday said with a smile. A minute or two later, she acknowledged, “We can’t really develop further in terms of sexual equality or whatever until men have adapted to our changes.” When Mr. Snyder asked for advice on adapting, she laughed and answered, “Well, honey, you could work on it!”

Fifteen years later, appearing on Bill Maher’s Comedy Central talk show “Politically Incorrect” to discuss sexual harassment in the office, she minimized the phenomenon’s seriousness (“The workplace is the meeting and mating place”) and contended that men were equal victims of harassment and even of domestic violence. Mr. Maher pronounced her “out of your mind if you think that’s a problem” and challenged her to elaborate.

“Women are tough,” Ms. Friday replied. “Women are rough. And we’ve been angry for a long, long time.”

Nancy Colbert Friday was born on Aug. 27, 1933, in Pittsburgh to Walter Friday and the former Jane Colbert. Some biographical references say that her father died when she was 2; others report that her parents divorced.

In any case, Nancy, her older sister and their mother soon moved to Charleston, S.C., where Nancy attended Ashley Hall, the prestigious girls’ prep school. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1955 and moved to Puerto Rico, where she worked as a travel reporter and editor.

In the 1960s she moved to New York. A 1995 Esquire article looked back on her life at that time: She took a job in public relations, the article said, that allowed her to “dance at the hippest discos and sleep with drunken poets” before meeting her first husband, the columnist and author Bill Manville.

Ms. Friday talked about preferring the company of men to that of women and seemed to take pride in a Ms. magazine review of one of her books, which included the observation “This woman is not a feminist.” In a 1996 interview with Salon, she said, “I would no more go to a consciousness-raising group and talk about my intimate life with my husband than fly to the moon.”

She and Mr. Manville, who were married in 1967, were living in London when she began working on “My Secret Garden.” They divorced in the mid-1980s. In 1988 she married Norman Pearlstine, then the managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, in a boldface-names ceremony at the Rainbow Room (the best man was the film producer and director James L. Brooks; Donald Trump was a guest). The Pearlstines divorced in 2005.

Ms. Friday leaves no immediate survivors.

She told The Times in 1977 that she had made a deliberate decision not to have children. “It isn’t something that every woman automatically does well,” she observed. “Besides, I still have these anxieties and doubts, and I don’t want to pass that on to another generation.”","Nancy Friday, 84, Best-Selling Student of Gender Politics, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/obituaries/nancy-friday-84-best-selling-student-of-gender-politics-dies.html

Tobias is a Labrador retriever with one job: sniffing out invasive Argentine ants wherever they hide. He’s really good at it, and with his help, a fragile island ecosystem may be spared a repeat inundation with the pests.

Santa Cruz Island is 25 miles off the coast of Southern California, part of Channel Islands National Park. The island’s rich, rugged environment — which includes more than 1,000 kinds of plants and animals, including the bald eagle and the island fox — is threatened by Argentine ants, one of the world’s most successful and wily invasive species.

The ants are one in a long line of threats that The Nature Conservancy has worked to overcome since it bought most of the island in 1978. In one section, the ants chased away flower-pollinating bees, native ants, spiders and other insects crucial to local ecology.

They are nearly impossible to get rid of; it had never been done with an infestation as large as Santa Cruz’s. But Christina Boser, an ecologist who leads the conservancy’s ant eradication project, devised an aerial assault, dropping tiny sugar water beads spiked with diluted poison from helicopters.

The campaign, largely in 2015 and 2016, appears to have killed off the ants. Still, if even one colony has survived, this elaborate effort might have been wasted.

Mr. Trump called the rampage a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation.” This is the cynical evasion devised by the National Rifle Association, which warmly endorsed candidate Trump, who now parrots the diversionary talking point that we must first control for mental illness.

In fact, President Trump signed a law in February revoking an Obama-era regulation that made it more difficult for the mentally ill to purchase guns.

Mr. Trump, who spoke favorably as a candidate of vigilante shootouts for self-defense, also suggested that if a civilian had not briefly exchanged shots with the Texas shooter after the massacre, the casualty toll “would have been much worse.” The implication was that the bloodshed in Texas, which also included more than 20 wounded, actually makes the case for more guns — that the disease of gun violence is also its cure.

This is a fantasy, not a rational argument; it doesn’t bear the slightest scrutiny. As our colleague Nicholas Kristof notes, the United States outstrips the world in both gun ownership per capita and gun deaths per capita. States with higher proportions of gun ownership also have rates of death by guns higher than the national average. Incidents in which victims kill attackers in self-defense are vanishingly few compared with gun homicides, and suicide is by far the leading cause of gun deaths.

From expanded background checks to assault weapons bans, proposals put forward by gun-safety proponents, unlike continually increasing private American arsenals, would do something to thwart mass shootings. The Texas killer was not motivated by racial hatred, as was the killer of the Charleston churchgoers, but by family grievance, underlining the lethal combination of domestic abuse and firearms. Abusers’ access to guns increases the risk of intimate partner homicide as much as fivefold, according to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. While federal law prohibits those convicted of domestic violence, as Mr. Kelley was, from buying or possessing firearms, the Air Force failed to add him to a federal database, allowing him to pass necessary background checks. The right law was on the books but enforcement was lax.

And yet so many politicians continue to promote the wares of the gun industry. Two years ago, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tweeted “I’m embarrassed: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind California. Let’s pick up the pace Texans. @NRA.” On Monday he said the problem was out of human hands.

“We have evil that occurs in this world,” Governor Abbott declared, as if from a pulpit, equating all manner of global terrorist attacks, including the murder of eight last week by a truck driver in Manhattan. When asked how the evil of gun violence can be overcome, he replied “you do that by working with God.” Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, even envisioned “arming some of the parishioners or the congregation so that they can respond” if another massacre occurs.

This is the level of pro-gun argument being offered by Republican leaders and some Democrats. It is made in service to the N.R.A. and the gun industry, not the American public.",Mass Shootings Don’t Have to Be Inevitable,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/texas-guns-shooting-trump.html

People tend to do things, like donate organs, when it’s the default option as opposed to something they need to request. They tend to be less likely to miss appointments if you tell them how many other patients show up for theirs. They tend to be more likely to engage in preventive behaviors like using sunscreen if you focus on the benefits, not the harms. Many are turning to ideas like these to improve medication adherence.

But those excited about the potential of behavioral economics should keep in mind the results of a recent study. It pulled out all the stops in trying to get patients who had a heart attack to be more compliant in taking their medication. (Patients’ adherence at such a time is surprisingly low, even though it makes a big difference in outcomes, so this is a major problem.)

Photo

Researchers randomly assigned more than 1,500 people to one of two groups. All had recently had heart attacks. One group received the usual care. The other received special electronic pill bottles that monitored patients’ use of medication. Those patients who took their drugs were entered into a lottery in which they had a 20 percent chance to receive $5 and a 1 percent chance to win $50 every day for a year.

That’s not all. The lottery group members could also sign up to have a friend or family member automatically be notified if they didn’t take their pills so that they could receive social support. They were given access to special social work resources. There was even a staff engagement adviser whose specific duty was providing close monitoring and feedback, and who would remind patients about the importance of adherence.

This was a kitchen-sink approach. It involved direct financial incentives, social support nudges, health care system resources and significant clinical management. It failed.

The time to first hospitalization for a cardiovascular problem or death was the same between the two groups. The time to any hospitalization and the total number of hospitalizations were the same. So were the medical costs. Even medication adherence — the process measure that might influence these outcomes — was no different between the two groups.

The researchers in this trial deserve praise for their frank assessment of their results, as well as for trying to brainstorm ways in which they might achieve success in the future. Getting patients to change their behavior is very hard. In the past, we’ve tried making drugs free to patients to get them to adhere to their medications and improve outcomes. That failed. We’ve tried lotteries (as in the study above) to nudge people to achieve better compliance. That failed.

Maybe financial incentives, and behavioral economics in general, work better in public health than in more direct health care. There have been successes, after all, with respect to weight loss — although these seemed to disappear over time. We’ve also seen promise with respect to smoking cessation, although these come with caveats as well.

Experts caution that the interventions that achieve success are often very intensive. They demand a great deal of attention, and can be quite expensive. Moreover, they are very focused, usually on a single issue or condition.

“We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you.","Even before the launching of the missile on Saturday, which was intercepted en route to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the crown prince had staged another surprise demonstration of the kingdom’s newly aggressive posture toward Iran and Lebanon. The prince hosted a visit from Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who stunned the region by announcing his resignation, via video from Riyadh, in protest against Iran’s undue influence in Lebanese politics.

Even some of Mr. Hariri’s rivals speculated that his Saudi sponsors had pressured him into the statement. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, said over the weekend that the Saudis had all but kidnapped Mr. Hariri. Mr. Nasrallah urged Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon for power-sharing talks “if he is allowed to come back.”

On Monday, Saudi Arabia released a photograph of Mr. Hariri meeting with King Salman that was widely seen as an effort to contradict the theory that the prime minister was effectively a hostage.

The Saudi claims that Iran had provided the missile could not be independently verified.

Mr. Jubair, the foreign minister, said the missile had been smuggled into Yemen in parts, assembled in Yemen by operatives from Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, and fired from Yemen by Hezbollah.

A statement from the Saudi Arabian news agency said “experts in military technology” had determined from the remains of that missile and one launched in July that both had come from Iran “for the purpose of attacking the kingdom.”

Citing allegations of Hezbollah’s role, Thamer al-Sabhan, minister of state for Persian Gulf affairs, said Monday that Saudi Arabia considered the missile attack an act of war by Lebanon as well.

“We will treat the government of Lebanon as a government declaring a war because of Hezbollah militias,” Mr. Sabhan told the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya network. “Lebanon is kidnapped by the militias of Hezbollah and behind it is Iran.”

The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran called the accusation of Iranian involvement in the missile attack “baseless.”

“These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim.

Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Saudi Arabia of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior & risky provocations,” in a statement on Twitter. Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.

American officials have previously accused Iran of arming its Yemeni allies, the Houthis. But it was unclear how Saudi experts would know how or why Iran provided the missiles.

With help from allies including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, Saudi Arabia has enforced a sea and air blockade around Yemen since it launched an attack on the Houthi forces there more than two years ago.

In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday. American officials tracking the situation said that as many as 500 people, including at least 11 princes, had been rounded up in a wave arrests directed by Prince Mohammed in the name of a crackdown on corruption.

Some are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges while others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Men were sleeping on mats on the floor of the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been transformed into a singularly luxurious prison to house the detainees.

The arrests cemented Prince Mohammed’s dominance over military, foreign, internal security, economic and social affairs inside the kingdom, freeing him to pursue an aggressive confrontation with Iran. That posture has been a hallmark of his rise over the two and a half years since his father, King Salman, 81, took the throne.

Prince Mohammed has sharply escalated a cold war with Iran, stepping up Saudi Arabia’s efforts to push back Iranian influence in the Syrian civil war, plunging the kingdom into a protracted military conflict against Iranian-allied forces in Yemen, and isolating neighboring Qatar in part for being too close to Iran.

His hawkish stance toward Iran also appears to have formed the basis for a close bond with President Trump, who visited Riyadh this year and maintained a conspicuous silence over the weekend about Prince Mohammed’s campaign of arrests. On Tuesday while traveling in Asia, he praised the arrests, saying the king and crown prince “know exactly what they are doing.”

Mr. Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently left Riyadh after his third visit this year. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner stayed up talking together until the small hours of the morning at a ranch in the desert, according to an American official briefed on the trip.

Mr. Kechichian, of the King Faisal Center, said the arrests and the confrontation with Iran represented the convergence of two long-term agendas for Prince Mohammed.

“Inside he has been able to put his men into positions of influence and he has pushed aside his rivals,” Mr. Kechichian said. “And ever since President Trump’s visit to Riyadh there has been a very consistent policy with the essential coordination of the United States, and Iran is in the bull’s-eye.”

Robert Jordan, a former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now practices law in the region, said Prince Mohammed’s aggression was “compounded somewhat by what people would call a green light from President Trump.”

Mr. Trump has encouraged Saudi Arabia and its allies “to be more forceful against Iran, and to take more charge of their own neighborhood, and they have taken that to heart,” Mr. Jordan said. “They know America will have their back.”

Saudi Arabia also said Monday that it would “temporarily” close Yemen’s land, sea and air ports of entry in response to the missile firing, in order to tighten inspections and stop any weapons shipments. It pledged to provide for “the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews.”

However, the United Nations said that two aid flights scheduled for Monday had not been allowed to depart for Yemen.

“We’re trying to see whether we can get our normal access restored,” Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said at a daily briefing. “We underscored to all parties the need for regular humanitarian access.”

The United Nations considers Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, one of the world’s biggest humanitarian emergencies. Roughly 17 million people — 60 percent of the population — need food assistance, and seven million are at risk of famine. Nearly 900,000 Yemenis have been sickened by cholera.

Saudi Arabia accompanied its accusations against Iran with the announcement that it would pay bounties of up to $30 million for information leading to the capture of 40 Houthi leaders in Yemen.

“We fear nothing,” one leader on the list, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, said in a defiant speech on Monday in the Yemeni capital, Sana.

He called the arrests ordered by Prince Mohammed “a coup leading to the throne” and invited any dissident Saudis to take refuge in Yemen. “We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you. None will endure injustice.”

Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said over the weekend that its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile. Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit Sana with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.

With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since.

While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the direct command of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say. But the Saudi intervention appears to have unintentionally brought the Houthis and Iranians closer together, Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, noted.

The Saudi claim about Iran’s responsibility for the missile attack was difficult to evaluate in part because of the long and complicated history of illicit weapons shipments to Yemen.

South Yemeni forces acquired Soviet missiles during their civil war with what was then North Yemen before it ended in 1994, and the subsequent national government of Yemen, whose institutions are now under the control of the Houthi faction, had said as long ago as 2002 that it had bought a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea.

State Department cables published by WikiLeaks indicate that Yemen had resumed buying North Korean missiles as recently as 2009. But the Houthi alliance with Iran makes it impossible to rule out the possibility that Tehran provided or procured the missiles, even if they were manufactured in North Korea.

Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.

Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.","Saudi Arabia Charges Iran With ‘Act of War,’ Raising Threat of Military Clash",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-iran-missile.html

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

On Sunday, material from that hacking became public. The Paradise Papers exposed the hidden financial dealings of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Queen Elizabeth and the athletic apparel company Nike, among many others. As revelations about tax-dodging airplane purchases and secret Russian ownership in tech companies came to light, Appleby declared that it takes its clients’ confidentiality seriously and billed itself as “not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act.”

In an age in which personal consumer data is routinely plundered for profit, it’s smart public relations for law firms like Appleby and the tax havens in which their clients hide their assets to present themselves as victims of a global crime epidemic. There is also genuine belief operating here. Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, the founders of the law firm whose hacked files formed the heart of the Panama Papers, described their work as safeguarding their clients’ fundamental right to privacy in their financial affairs. Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca insisted that when their customers asked them to set up hundreds of thousands of anonymous companies, trusts and foundations, it too was in the interest of privacy.

However, in the world of offshore finance, privacy long ago became a corrosive secrecy.

Appleby is a major player in a global offshore industry that helps multinational corporations and the mega-wealthy legally move money beyond the reach of the taxman through a network of tax havens and secret financial centers.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Do you like movie trivia? Ross Trudeau returns to test our mettle.

Today’s Theme

Four famous lines from well-known movies are offered in the grid, clued with just the titles: Your job is to match them to the actors who said them. Those entries are also part of the theme: CRUISE LINE (59A), for example, is the answer to the SHOW ME THE MONEY (42A) line from “Jerry Maguire.” It’s also a real phrase in its own right, and is clued as “Carnival, say, or a further hint to 42-Across.”

Tricky Clues

6A: Is it GIF with a hard G or a soft G? No one knows for sure, although it’s said that because the G stands for “graphics,” which has a hard G, GIF should be pronounced that way. Either way, surely we have better things to argue about.

13A: “Canine supporters” could be all the wonderful rescue organizations that abound (Like Elayne Boosler’s Tails of Joy), but today we’re talking teeth, so the answer is GUMS.

30A: Get to know your hockey moves! A DEKE, which is a fake-out on the ice, comes up every now and then and is worth knowing.

71A: Nice wordplay! “What I may turn into” is not really about Mr. Trudeau morphing into something. It’s about what the word “I” could become, and that’s the ROYAL WE.

17D: TIL that “metathesiophobia” is the fear of CHANGE. And I hope it stays that way.

Constructor Notes

A couple thoughts: 1. ""Going Off Script” includes four white actors. Moreover, the SHOW ME THE MONEY line was also spoken by Cuba Gooding Jr., a black actor who goes uncredited in this puzzle (despite upstaging Tom Cruise). 2. “Going Off Script” also comprises four male actors. The original version did include WOODLINE/I FEEL PRETTY OH SO PRETTY, which got axed because it yielded asymmetric themers. But then again, Natalie Wood, an American with Russian parents, was cast to play Maria, a Puerto Rican. Dios. Aside from Ms. Wood, I only found revealers that referenced white males (PENNLINE, CRYSTALLINE, SHORTLINE), let alone ones that matched with legitimately iconic movie quotes. So, open question: If Hollywood’s gender/race representation problem means that, after an honest effort, you only can find white male actors for your ___LINE puzzle, do you scrap it? Is doing otherwise cynical and opportunistic? Is the choice mitigated if you subsequently construct an UZI GAL GODOT puzzle? (Very interested in collaborating on that puzzle. Let’s chat.)

“General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean it’s not our history,” she said on Tuesday with an impossibly straight face, utterly ignoring Kelly’s “compromise” comment and his gauzy eulogy of Robert E. Lee.

“Probably that he has to deal with you guys on a daily basis,” she said.

She needs a vocabulary lesson. The bloat of Trump’s ego is a flaw. The plunge of his necktie: also a flaw. Being answerable to a skeptical news media may be an inconvenience — or, for someone as thin-skinned as he is, an absolute torment — but it’s not a flaw. It also happens to be a vital component of democracy, should she and her boss care to reacquaint themselves with that.

When her boss does something execrable, she validates it at greater length and with more passion than most paid sycophants would muster. She chalked up that tweet of his about Mika Brzezinski (“bleeding badly from a face-lift”) to a laudably bold retaliation against a merciless adversary, and she used it as a springboard to swoon over him anew. “I think the American people elected somebody who’s tough, who’s smart and who’s a fighter,” she said. “And that’s Donald Trump.”

She zealously parrots his contention that there’s no evidence of anything untoward between his campaign and Russia, dismissing his hapless namesake’s infamous meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian emissary as “pretty standard campaign operating procedure.”

She edits out the revelation that George Papadopoulos — once named by Trump himself as an important adviser to the campaign — was trying to coordinate with Moscow. When that news broke on Monday, she said that it had “nothing to do with the president.”

So began an audacious week when she came into her mendacious own. She asserted that Trump had not politicized the deaths of eight people in Lower Manhattan because the immigration complaints that he almost instantly raised were ones that he had bellowed about before. So he was — what — grandfathered in? Well, then, so are gun-control advocates who react to yet another mass shooting by repeating their observation that this nation is drowning in firearms.

Jim Acosta of CNN asked her why, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump called the American justice system “a joke” and “a laughingstock.”

“That’s not what he said,” she shot back — it’s like a reflex with her — and later added, “He said the process has people calling us a joke and calling us a laughingstock.” Wow. Huge difference. Small problem: Acosta’s description of Trump’s remarks came closer to his verbatim words than her tortured, wishful version did.

She’s awful at this, but that makes her an excellent fit for an administration in which mediocrity, inadequate experience and nepotism run rampant.

Besides, she’s serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. (To listen to her pronounce “priorities” is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb.)

She’s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump’s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of place. Hence her repeated references to being a working mom and managing a boisterous brood at home. Hence her invocation of religion — she’s the daughter of a rather well-known pastor — when asked during one briefing how she’d explain Trump’s worst behavior to her own children.

“When it comes to role models, as a person of faith, I think we all have one perfect role model,” she answered, characteristically using a non sequitur as an evasion. “I point to God. I point to my faith. And that’s where I would tell my kids to look.”

Mr. Paul, 54, has long stood out in the well-to-do gated neighborhood south of Bowling Green, Ky., that he calls home. The senator grows pumpkins on his property, composts and has shown little interest for neighborhood regulations.

But the spectacle of the incident — one former doctor attacking another in broad daylight — was altogether different. Competing explanations of the origins of the drama cited stray yard clippings, newly planted saplings and unraked leaves.

“We don’t have squabbles out here,” said Jackie Douglas, a neighbor of the two men. “If you can afford to live out here, you tend to your own business.”

The two men were anything but strangers. Mr. Paul and Mr. Boucher have lived next to each other for 17 years, and at one point even worked at the same hospital. Mr. Boucher practiced for many years as an anesthesiologist and invented a rice-filled vest used for back pain. He now lives alone, neighbors said.

Matthew J. Baker, a lawyer for Mr. Boucher, called the matter “a very regrettable dispute” between neighbors over a “trivial” matter.

The incident “has absolutely nothing to do with either’s politics or political agendas,” Mr. Baker said in a statement on Monday. “It was a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial.”

“We sincerely hope that Senator Paul is doing well and that these two gentlemen can get back to being neighbors as quickly as possible,” Mr. Baker said.

In Kentucky and in Washington, Mr. Baker’s comment about the “trivial” nature of the dispute prompted speculation about what had gone down, and how long Mr. Paul would remain at home.

Neighbors said it was well known that the men had strongly divergent political views — Mr. Paul is a libertarian who identifies as a Republican; Mr. Boucher is a registered Democrat. But they said the dispute had more to do with long-simmering tensions over their adjacent properties than politics.

“They just couldn’t get along. I think it had very little to do with Democrat or Republican politics,” said Jim Skaggs, who developed the gated community and who lives nearby. “I think it was a neighbor-to-neighbor thing. They just both had strong opinions, and a little different ones about what property rights mean.”

Asked about long-leveled allegations that Mr. Paul had disregarded neighborhood regulations, Mr. Skaggs, who is also a former leader of the county Republican Party, said that the senator “certainly believes in stronger property rights than exist in America.”

Mr. Porter, who says he spoke with Mr. Paul on Saturday after the incident, said the senator told him he and Mr. Boucher had not talked in years. Mr. Porter said he was not familiar with any landscaping disputes between the two neighbors.

“He is still unsure why he was attacked,” Mr. Porter said. “I don’t know if he knows why he was attacked.”

Doug Stafford, a senior strategist to Mr. Paul, declined to answer questions about the dispute on Monday. He said only that it was “a pending, serious criminal matter involving state and federal authorities.”

On Sunday, Mr. Paul wrote on Twitter that the altercation was an “unfortunate event.” Initial reports described his injuries as “minor,” and a spokeswoman for Mr. Paul said the senator was “fine.”

The three Kentucky Republicans, who requested anonymity to discuss the case, said Mr. Paul had been embarrassed by the incident and was not interested in drawing attention to it.

Mr. Paul spoke on Monday with his fellow Kentucky senator, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who wished him a speedy recovery.

Mr. Boucher was charged with fourth-degree assault and released on $7,500 bond. He is set to appear in court on Thursday. He was also ordered to not have any contact with Mr. Paul or his family and staff, and to stay at least 1,000 feet away from the senator unless Mr. Boucher was in his own home, next door.

Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges, a spokesman for the Kentucky State Police, said that if Mr. Paul’s injuries are deemed severe enough by the Commonwealth of Kentucky’s prosecuting attorney, Mr. Boucher could be tried at a circuit court level for a felony.

“We have many things happening that we hope, we hope — in fact, I’ll go a step further — we hope to God we never have to use,” Mr. Trump said.

When pressed by a reporter, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he still thought negotiations with North Korea would be a waste of time, making an uncharacteristic effort to avoid a remark that might have inflamed tensions.

“I don’t want to say that — I just don’t want to say that,” Mr. Trump said. “You can understand.”

His visit to Seoul was the most diplomatically challenging leg of Mr. Trump’s 12-day, five-country trip through Asia, bringing him face to face with a public and a president wary of his combative approach on North Korea. To many of Mr. Moon’s progressive supporters, Mr. Trump poses as much of a threat to peace as Mr. Kim, if not more so.

“Don’t come, Trump! You talk about war whenever you open your mouth,” a large banner read during a protest near the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday. “Go away, Trump!” hundreds of labor activists and other progressives shouted in downtown Seoul, where thousands of police were deployed to keep security. “No Trump, no war!”

A short distance away, across a police blockade, hundreds of conservatives welcomed Mr. Trump with South Korean and American flags. South Korean conservatives are deeply skeptical of Mr. Moon’s approach, calling it naïve. They back Mr. Trump’s hawkish view of the North, although they, too, stop short of supporting war on the Korean Peninsula.

“We believe in Trump!” their signs read.

Mr. Trump’s visit to South Korea appeared choreographed to avoid potentially provocative moments. Unlike many previous presidents, he eschewed the traditional visit to the Demilitarized Zone separating the North and South, where past American commanders in chief have peered into the North through binoculars, projecting a menacing mien.

Video

And while his advisers have signaled that Mr. Trump may soon return North Korea to the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, he did not address that issue on Tuesday.

Mr. Trump’s change in tone notwithstanding, his advisers have increasingly been making the case that North Korea’s ambition is to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force, and that traditional deterrence — fear of overwhelming retaliation — cannot stop the North once it has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.

Many observers are skeptical of both assertions, especially in South Korea, which would suffer greatly if a pre-emptive strike on the North led to all-out war. They argue that the leaders of Pyongyang’s Communist regime are not planning to use nuclear weapons to attack the United States or its allies, because they know that Washington would overwhelmingly counterattack. Rather, they say, North Korea is building its nuclear weapons out of fear, hoping that the arms will protect the country from invasion — or from outside intervention, in the case of a domestic uprising — allowing the North to focus on economic development.

In addition, all of the countries around North Korea, even its old allies China and Russia, have said they would oppose war on the Korean Peninsula.

“The view that North Korea would start war to communize Korea doesn’t make sense anymore,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “North Korea knows that if it ever uses a nuclear weapon, it means self-destruction.”

South Korean officials said they hoped that Mr. Trump’s visit to this densely populated capital of 10 million people would bring home to him the consequences of a potential war. Mr. Moon supports Mr. Trump’s call for “maximum” sanctions and pressure, but says that those alone will never persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

Mr. Moon has urged Washington to engage the North with dialogue and discuss a way out for Pyongyang. But so far, Mr. Trump has ignored such requests, even ridiculing Mr. Moon’s efforts as “appeasement.”

American officials in the region, too, were hoping the president’s trip would help Mr. Trump gain a new perspective on how Seoul and Tokyo view the threat from up close; the regional trends affecting Asia beyond North Korea, including Chinese assertiveness; and the costs and consequences of military action, according to one U.S. official.

From a dining hall at Camp Humphreys, where Mr. Trump had lunch with troops, to the Blue House, where he met with Mr. Moon, everything he saw on Tuesday could become a fiery battlefield in the event of a military exchange with North Korea.

But if the firsthand experience left an impression on Mr. Trump, he did not show it. At times, his tone was almost blithe. Before being briefed by American and South Korean military commanders, he said of the confrontation with the North, “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out — has to work out.” General Vincent Brooks, the American commander, wore a grim expression as he listened to the president.

Mr. Trump also reprised his role as a chief salesman for the American defense industry. “South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Trump said. “And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.”

On the eve of a visit to China, Mr. Trump also made a pointed plea for countries around the world to use their influence to bring North Korea to heel, saying, “It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.”

But in a reminder of the challenge that Washington faces keeping even its allies on the same page, South Korea invited an 88-year-old Korean “comfort woman,” or a former sex slave for Japan’s World War II military, to Mr. Trump’s state banquet and put on the menu a dish of shrimp said to have been caught in waters near a set of disputed islets.

The sex slave issue is one of the most contentious dividing Tokyo and Seoul, and the islets — known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan — lie at the center of a bitter territorial dispute. The Japanese government protested the banquet arrangements, accusing South Korea of “moves that could negatively affect the close coordination” among the allies.

As Mr. Trump arrived in Seoul, there was renewed evidence of activity at a site in North Korea where the regime has conducted underground nuclear tests. It was not clear, however, whether the activity suggested another imminent test or merely construction on a tunnel that could be used for tests.","No War Threats From Trump, Who Tells Koreans ‘It Will All Work Out’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/asia/trump-korea-south-north.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships at Instagram, was a beauty editor there. Emily Weiss, the Into the Gloss founder and Glossier C.E.O., was an intern. In 2006, the magazine became a backdrop for the popular MTV series “The Hills.”

Ms. Wintour appointed Amy Astley, who had been the beauty editor of Vogue, to oversee Teen Vogue. Its small (6¾” x 9”!) pages featured the high-budget fashion editorials that are its parent magazine’s signature, for the low starting price of $1.50 per issue (“about as much as a ChapStick,” the late media critic David Carr wrote). Its accompanying website became a meeting place for young people.

Arabelle Sicardi, also a writer, said that before she read Teen Vogue’s web forums, she saw fashion and beauty as alien subjects.

“I had never thought that fashion ever applied to me, really, so having people my age to talk to and share our interpretations of it was something that I really cherished,” she said. “She went on to become a blogger and was featured in Teen Vogue for her work. Later, the magazine hired her as an intern and regular contributor.

“Teen Vogue is my family,” Ms. Sicardi said. “I grew up in those hallways. I was probably at the magazine for longer than I was ever in a classroom.”

Elaine Welteroth, the print magazine’s second and final leader, had been a mentor to Ms. Sicardi. Ms. Welteroth took over from Ms. Astley in 2016 and was officially named editor in chief this spring, in a grim climate for magazines aimed at the older-teen set (R.I.P. CosmoGirl, YM, Teen People, Elle Girl).

The youngest-ever editor in chief at Condé Nast — she is 30 — Ms. Welterorth quickly became an Instagram celebrity and received heaping praise for the magazine’s newly “woke” tone. Teen Vogue 2.0, as she reimagined it, wasn’t just about clothes and makeup; it was about news, politics and social justice, too.

In her first year, Ms. Astley had emphasized how crucial it was for her to create a product that was “racially, ethnically diverse, fashion-wise diverse. We don’t say someone is or isn’t Teen Vogue.” The magazine entered the field at a time when millennials were just beginning to document their lives online, with LiveJournal and MySpace, and the platforms that continue to replace print publications showcase diversity even more effectively.

It wasn’t until 2015, after a decade of mostly white, mostly famous cover stars, that Teen Vogue changed course, with a cover featuring three little-known black models. The issue became the year’s best seller, underscoring the appetite for fashion magazines that reflect some version of real life.

“I’ve always been a queer, gender-nonconforming kid and person,” said Kate Lesniak, the publisher of Bitch Media. “I never really cared about those magazines because I never saw myself in them at all, in any way.”

But recently, Ms. Lesniak noticed a shift in the tone and presentation of Teen Vogue.

“In the last year and a half or two years,” she said, it had become “a mainstream media outlet in print that reflected people like me back to ourselves. Teen Vogue did an incredible job of amplifying communities of color and queer people as well.”

That representation has come in the form of articles that criticize racial insensitivity, trumpet black feminism and explain how to be a transgender ally, as well as a guide to anal sex that received mixed reviews, mostly from adults. Ms. Welteroth also courted activist-actresses like Rowan Blanchard, Hari Nef and Yara Shahidi, who now serve as unofficial brand ambassadors to their combined millions of followers.

Readers and admirers lamented the end of Teen Vogue’s print run after the announcement.

Teen Vogue will continue to publish articles online, leaving Seventeen and J-14 as the only mainstream print lifestyle magazines for that age demographic.

“All the teen magazines that existed 10, 15 years ago that don’t exist now, they’re the reason I became a writer,” Ms. Fitzpatrick said.

Ten up-and-coming designers and a drive for diversity in fashion — which is to say, the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund awards ceremony and dinner. This year, it extended its inclusivity from people to boroughs.

By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals — a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.

“Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,” said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.

She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.

Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.

WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.

Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.

Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.

The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.

Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.

On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.

Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)

But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”

But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.

It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

A Growing Gap

Economic inequality is a well-known issue in the United States and around the developed world. Not only has a gulf grown between the haves and the have-nots, but so has the gap between the haves and the have-mores.

An outgrowth of this has been the creation of gilded ghettos. While far nicer and more comfortable than their urban counterparts, these gilded ghettos similarly narrow the vision of the people who live in them and their understanding of people outside of them. They also set their residents on a trajectory in life that is hard to stray from.

In this case, these gilded ghettos are perpetuating wealth, a sense of safety and access to great education. A byproduct is that they often unintentionally exclude others from those same opportunities.

“It’s the defining element of our time,” said Richard Florida, author of “The New Urban Crisis” and professor of business and creativity at the University of Toronto. “Economic inequality is an important component, but it’s not what is getting people angry. It’s this geographic separation of people, these clusters of extreme affluence on the one hand and concentrated pockets of poverty on the other hand. The old middle-class neighborhoods are gone.”

Mr. Florida is referring to neighborhoods mixed by income and occupation. His father was a factory worker, but lived next door to his uncle who was an executive at Colgate-Palmolive.

“They were best buddies,” Mr. Florida said. “My dad was poorer. My uncle was richer. My dad was a Democrat, but my uncle was a Republican. That’s unimaginable today. They wouldn’t live next to each other.”

He said in the 1970s 70 percent of people lived in middle-class neighborhoods, but today only 40 percent do.

Photo

The effect is that people in different socioeconomic groups do not spend time with one another. That lack of contact causes different points of view for sure, but it also leads to very different outcomes in life.

“We used to think of these divides as city and suburbs, with the poor in the city and the rich in the suburbs,” Mr. Florida said. “But the truth of the matter is we have this patchwork of concentrated affluence surrounded by much larger areas of concentrated disadvantage. The interesting thing is this wealth divide is not city-suburb anymore. It’s chock-a-block. We look more like a third-world country, where poor and rich are bumped up against each other.”

Before he became president, Donald Trump had a life that was defined by the gilded ghetto he created for himself. He lived and worked in Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper he developed and opened in 1983. He ate at restaurants he knew, like the “21” Club. When he traveled, he went by private plane. He spent time at the resorts and golf clubs he owned.

Now even wealthier people are buying apartments that stretch into the sky on Manhattan’s so-called Billionaires’ Row along Central Park South. For a reported $220 million, Kenneth Griffin, the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, bought a four-floor condominium with a view of Central Park.

That building and others that have gone up are filled with apartments costing $30 million or more.

Even if these are extreme examples, that walling off is solidified, even among people closer in income level and occupation. Bay Colony, a development in affluent Naples, Fla., is separated from the rest of the high-end Pelican Bay development by its own gate — in other words, a gated community within a gated community.

On the one hand, such gating allows people to spend time with exactly the type of people they have the most in common with; on the other hand it creates an echo chamber of beliefs and expectations that further separates the have-mores from everyone else.

“If you had $10 million, the first thing people think is you’d be able to do the things important to you,” said Paul K. Piff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. “You get yourself more space. You choose to live in a neighborhood with other like-minded people. You can curate your life in so many different ways that make it more comfortable.

Photo

“But at the same time it becomes this physical and psychological barrier between you and the rest of the world,” Mr. Piff added. “That can slowly erode our natural psychological tendencies to orient toward others. It’s a basic component of empathy. It helps you see their common humanity. Without that concept you don’t have that empathy.”

He pointed to a study in the Chronicle of Philanthropy that showed affluent people who lived among other affluent people were less charitable than people who lived in more mixed neighborhoods.

Immigrant Beginnings

Ms. Allen didn’t grow up in a wealth bubble. Her father immigrated from Italy and worked construction jobs in Chicago before starting his own company.

She said her group of affluent residents, brought together by the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, were inspired to help after listening to Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, discuss his book, “Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis,” which talks about the opportunity gap between rich and poor young people in the United States and how it is making upward mobility difficult.

That group has committed to spending $350,000 over two years, with a focus on practical things like increasing school attendance and parental involvement and decreasing how often people change homes and schools. The group’s goal, Ms. Allen said, is modest: to help these children get a bit further up the socioeconomic ladder.

“I ended up in a lucrative field,” Ms. Allen said. “We worked hard, yes. But plenty of people work hard, and they’re not getting anywhere, and they don’t have the kinds of jobs that are lucrative.”

While such charitable efforts aim to make improvement, they are limited in their impact. What they cannot do is give disadvantaged children the networks that their more prosperous peers have.

Thomas Peters, president and chief executive of the Marin Community Foundation in Novato, Calif., said people often associated the county with affluent towns like Mill Valley and the enormous wealth of Silicon Valley. But Marin County’s gilded ghettos abut areas of extreme poverty.

“You could go from Mill Valley about five minutes and be in an area in San Rafael where families are jammed together in a single one-bedroom apartment,” he said. “And the deal is they rent it by a third of a day. You have that room or couch for eight hours — and that’s a five-minute drive from some of the most gorgeous homes in America where people could get lost in the house.”

Mr. Peters said some of the work of the foundation was to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley wealth and the poverty in other parts of the county through grants, but also access to its donor networks. The 400 families involved with the foundation have given $1.3 billion and have another $1.7 billion committed to give.

“We can address the fact that there are thousands of kids here who have all the natural ability and biologically vested intelligence to do spectacularly in life, but whose opportunities to do so are restricted,” he said.

Still, Mr. Peters is cognizant that the children who benefit from grants and the mentorship of successful donors are the lucky few. It is not something, in the parlance of the region, that is scalable.

“It’s heartbreaking to admit that,” he said. “But it’s what we have. It’s what we can do. Absent the answer to a grand plan, this is a good plan.”

Up From Middle Class

Michael Novogratz and his wife, Sukey, who are billionaires, grew up middle class and met at Princeton University. He was a star wrestler and went on to become a partner at Goldman Sachs and the chief operating officer at the Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund that went public in 2007. They have deep networks in college sports, the Ivy League and the highest echelons of finance that would seem to allow them to get the biggest bang for any buck they spent to help even the playing field.

Yet Mr. Novogratz said he and his wife were the exception to the rule when they began moving from their middle-class roots in the 1980s to the exclusive world they now inhabit.

“Social mobility in the country has gone down, not up,” he said. “Some of it is, it’s harder to get into the schools and the jobs that create these robust networks of opportunity.”

One program he supports is Beat the Streets, which uses wrestling to help disadvantaged urban children. He said about 12,000 young people go through its programs in a year.

“These kids are taking two subways and a bus to get to practice,” he said. “We’re trying to get them into college. The wrestling world becomes a network for them. It’s very tough for that group to get that jump forward. We’ll cherry pick a couple of kids each year, and they’ll go to Stanford, Princeton or the Air Force academy.”

While those children have every opportunity to build a robust network, the ones not picked could struggle to get access to networks similar to those that propel their more-affluent peers to comfortable lives.

Correcting the effect of these gilded ghettos on people not fortunate to live, work and raise children in them may not be easy.

Mr. Florida is resigned to America remaining divided and hopes for a mutual respect among socioeconomic groups that do not live side by side.

Photo

“We’re now so sorted into different geographies that the best we can hope for is a mutual coexistence,” he said. “Clustering is what drives people. You’re not going to unify people.”

Instead, he thinks Americans who are aware of this wealth divide can do worse than emulate Canada. Forget the idea of the melting pot, he said. “In Canada, we always consider the country a mosaic. It’s respect our differences, our identity and become more of a Canadian dream.”

Mr. Piff of the University of California is more optimistic. He is hoping that finding ways to foster connections across class lines can help rich and poor to understand each other better.

“People empathize with the people they want to,” he said. “It’s kind of threatening to our social values to acknowledge that perhaps people might find themselves in positions they didn’t deserve or in situations they didn’t cause. It’s easier for someone who believes the world is a meritocracy to empathize with someone who clearly didn’t bring something on themselves, like Syrian refugees.”

His suggestion is to draw from early work on race relations and create opportunities for contact among people who live in vastly different economic worlds.

“Writing checks and volunteering reinforces the gap between you and someone who is receiving your care,” he said. “There are benefits to making just one good friend who is different than you, one friend who gets you to see yourself in their eyes, to humanize their experience. You extrapolate from your friend to the broader world around you.”

Just Work Harder?

That connection, at least from the Atlanta example, can change people’s views. Brian Friedman, an adviser to wealthy families, and his wife, Vanessa, a college professor, live in Tucker, Ga., an Atlanta suburb with a median income of $64,388. They had focused their charity internationally until they visited Thomasville Heights, which they had never seen in over two decades of living in Atlanta.

“People would say, ‘They should just work harder, this is the United States’,” he said. “What we found is that just isn’t true. There are people living in our backyard with developing-world standards.”

The group brought together from the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta knows it could take a decade or more to help improve Thomasville Heights. But he said last year the amount of moving among apartments was down, and the number of people showing up at parent teacher conferences, a focal point of affluent neighborhoods, went from 10 to 80.

“We can’t take credit for all of it,” Mr. Friedman said. “But at least we’re helping the schools.”",They’re Rich but Trying to Reach Beyond the Money Bubble,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/your-money/money-bubble-economic-inequality.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I could be the size of Marlon Brando in ‘Apocalypse Now,’ who’s going to know?”

You would understand if Mr. Hamill, now 66, had a conflicted relationship with “Star Wars,” which put him on a pop-cultural pedestal.

The spacious dwelling is hardly a shrine to “Star Wars” — it’s mostly decorated with artwork of cherubs and the Beatles, Mr. Hamill’s own cultural obsession, though you might spot a photo of the 2-year-old Nathan frolicking with Yoda on the set of “Return of the Jedi.”

Mr. Hamill is not unduly nostalgic, but he conducts himself with an impish refusal to grow up. In conversation, he will sometimes stretch on the floor in yoga poses; he’ll slip into the exaggerated voices of famous colleagues — the adenoidal clip of the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas or the disaffected monotone of Mr. Ford.

In many ways, he is still the boy who was fascinated with cartoon voice actors, musical theater, stage magicians and ventriloquists, and whose favorite film was “King Kong.”

Proudly recalling a fight scene from “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Hamill said, “For me, sitting in the rancor’s hand, I was going all Fay Wray — it’s like a major accomplishment to me. But it was always that way. I’d say ‘Hey, you guys, my face is on the back of a box of C-3PO’s cereal!’”

The son of a Navy officer, Mr. Hamill was the middle child of seven siblings. He had an itinerant upbringing, living in California, Virginia and Japan, attending nine schools in 12 years and perpetually feeling like the new kid.

When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Hamill was interested in acting, but really wanted to be involved in show business however he could. “If I didn’t get a part, no problem,” he said. “Then where do I go? I sell tickets. I make props. I make posters. I don’t have to be in the show – I want to be near the show.”

He landed early roles on “General Hospital” and “The Partridge Family.” And then, of course, came “Star Wars”: a strange screenplay, still in flux when he read it, with sentient robots, laser swords and a supernatural spirituality bound up in a fable about good and evil.

Mr. Lucas said he chose Mr. Hamill from a pool of young actors because he brought a measure of humanity to a film full of space vehicles and special effects. “I needed a protagonist who was comfortable treating these things both casually and seriously in order to give that world an air of authenticity,” Mr. Lucas said. He added that Mr. Hamill “brought a boyish enthusiasm and exuberance that really defined the character,” and that “made Luke accessible and relatable to people in the first ‘Star Wars’” and its sequels.

Mr. Hamill committed fully to the material, but was unsure it would find a wider audience. “I thought, even if this thing doesn’t slay at the box office, it’s got midnight cult movie written all over it,” he said. “Move over, ‘Rocky Horror,’ ‘Star Wars’ is here!”

Instead, “Star Wars” became an international phenomenon, tying Mr. Hamill to his character and to Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford — even now, he sometimes accidentally calls them “Harry and Carrison” — as they promoted the movie together.

When the critic John Simon wrote in New York magazine that Mr. Ford had performed “adequately,” Mr. Hamill “uninspiredly” and Ms. Fisher “wretchedly,” Mr. Hamill said, “We had T-shirts made: ‘adequate, uninspired and wretched.’ I said, ‘Harrison, adequate’s practically a rave compared to what we got.’”

Mr. Ford said that during this time, “the three of us were like a very small tribe in the wilderness. We really were figuring this out as we went along.” Mr. Hamill struck him as “a very bright, sincere young actor,” who Mr. Ford said “seemed probably the most clear on what he was doing.”

Mr. Hamill, who receives a percentage of the “Star Wars” royalties, did not go onto a mainstream career, but he is hardly rueful now. Of his cohort, Mr. Hamill said Mr. Ford was the one meant for matinee idol status: “He’s a brilliant actor — that’s a given,” he said. “He’s also a leading man. When I tested for this thing, I assumed he was the protagonist and I was his annoying sidekick.” Mr. Hamill believed he’d find his destiny on a different path — one that was less glamorous, but that fully embraced his affection for the esoteric, the offbeat and the weird.

After two blockbuster sequels, “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980 and “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, Mr. Hamill believed the “Star Wars” story was complete. With newfound visibility, he decided to pursue a lifelong dream of performing on Broadway, where he had played John Merrick in “The Elephant Man.” “I wasn’t getting character parts in movies and television,” he explained. “Unless you’re Meryl Streep, they don’t let you do accents.”

He starred in the Broadway production of “Amadeus” while “Return of the Jedi” was still in theaters. But his 1985 musical “Harrigan ’n Hart,” about a pair of 19th-century variety-theater stars, was a notorious dud, running less than a week of regular performances.

Over the next 30 years, Mr. Hamill was cast in cult films and TV shows, often poking fun at his inability to shed his “Star Wars” legacy. He played an interstellar fighter pilot in the Wing Commander video games, and on “The Simpsons,” he portrayed himself playing Nathan Detroit as Luke Skywalker in a mediocre dinner-theater production of “Guys and Dolls.” Perhaps his best-known work from this era was providing the voice of the malevolent Joker in several animated Batman TV shows, movies and video games.

He was always comfortable being part of the “Star Wars” subculture, gladly attending conventions and engaging with the people he calls U.P.F.s (for “ultra-passionate fans”).

“It’s clearly not for everyone — I get that,” Mr. Hamill said. “But the passion of it all is just astonishing. The way it’s become part of the fabric of their lives — ‘I met my wife at this movie, we named our child Leia’ — it’s moving.”

He was not involved in the much-maligned “Star Wars” prequels from 1999 to 2005. And when Mr. Lucas invited him and Ms. Fisher to a lunch in 2012, to tell them he was giving control of Lucasfilm to Kathleen Kennedy and that a new “Star Wars” trilogy was being planned, Mr. Hamill had no expectation of being asked to participate. “We figured we had the middle three,” he said. “It was over.”

When Mr. Lucas said their characters would be included in these new films if they wanted to play them, Mr. Hamill said, “I was completely stunned. Carrie, not a minute went by — she slapped the table and goes, ‘I’m in!’ I said, ‘Carrie, poker face!’”

Mr. Hamill needed more time to think. “I was just really scared,” he said. “I thought, why mess with it? The idea of catching lightning in a bottle twice was ridiculously remote.”

He also feared that audiences would reject him and his veteran co-stars, all these years after their “Star Wars” heyday. “No one wants to see the 50-, 60-, 70-year-old versions of us, running around, bumping heads on the Death Star,” he said. “It’s sad.”

Mr. Hamill thought he would have some cover to refuse “The Force Awakens,” expecting that Mr. Ford would not return.

“He’s too old and too rich and too cranky,” Mr. Hamill said. “He’s not going to do this.” But when Mr. Ford said yes, Mr. Hamill realized he had to agree, too: “Can you imagine if I was the only one to say no? I’d be the most hated man in nerd-dom.”

Soon after accepting, Mr. Hamill got to bask in the adulation of “Star Wars” fans eager to see him on new adventures with the young novices Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). He trained to get into shape and met with Lucasfilm artists. But deeper behind the scenes, J.J. Abrams, the director of “The Force Awakens,” and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, a writer of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi,” were realizing their ever-expanding script could not accommodate Luke’s story line. (The screenplay was credited to Mr. Abrams, Mr. Kasdan and Michael Arndt.)

“The idea of it was so enormous,” Mr. Abrams said. “It became clear that there was no way that that movie could also include those chapters. That had to be the next movie.”

Eventually Mr. Abrams had to tell Mr. Hamill that Luke would not be a significant character in “The Force Awakens.” “I let him know before he read the script that his role was minimal,” Mr. Abrams said. “I don’t think he knew just how minimal until he read it.”

In their next conversation, Mr. Abrams acknowledged, Mr. Hamill was “not particularly happy with how little he was in it.”

Mr. Hamill does not deny his initial disappointment, though he said he was mostly afraid that Luke’s big reveal at the end would fall flat. “If it smacks the audience as a cheat or a gimmick, if there’s a big groan in the house, the egg’s on my face, not J.J.’s,” he said.

Amid lingering feelings of petulance, Mr. Hamill traveled to London in 2014 for a table read — he jokingly calls it a “table listen” — of the “Force Awakens” script. He had no dialogue, so Mr. Abrams instead asked him to read the narration. (“I think he wanted to break me, like you break a racehorse,” Mr. Hamill said.) Still, he was excited to meet Ms. Ridley and Mr. Boyega, and to reunite with Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Ms. Fisher and Mr. Ford.

Mr. Ford, who had not seen Mr. Hamill in many years and shared no scenes with him in “The Force Awakens,” lamented that they had worked together on the early “Star Wars” movies far less than viewers realize.

“The number of onscreen days that I spent with Mark were very, very few,” he said. “I knew Chewbacca better.”

Yet as soon as he spotted Mr. Hamill there, Mr. Ford said, “aside from the obvious passage of time, which had happened to both of us, he was very much the same guy, albeit bearded.”

“He’s very centered in his own experience and his own life,” Mr. Ford said. “He’s not a grandstander. He’s a quiet, sincere, workmanlike presence, and that’s what we’re there for.”

Mr. Hamill has come to appreciate his extended cameo in “The Force Awakens” — “when they talk about you that much in a movie before you even show up, that’s fabulous,” he said.

But now he and the “The Last Jedi” creators understand how much is riding on them with this film.

“I told him, everyone is going to be leaning forward for your first words in this,” said Rian Johnson, the “Last Jedi” writer and director. “Obviously, Mark came into this one with higher expectations for what we do with the character.”

Mr. Johnson said “The Last Jedi” also treated Mr. Hamill as an actor who has lived a whole life since he first played Luke. “In the same way that as a young man, he embodied the characteristics we all connected with — the youthfulness and innocence — he now embodies a person full of soul and experience,” Mr. Johnson said.

While Mr. Hamill tries not to dispute the “Star Wars” filmmakers on big plot points — he’s still not sure whether Mr. Lucas always intended for Luke and Leia to be brother and sister — he found himself full of strong opinions about how the character he has been associated with for 40 years should be presented in “The Last Jedi.”

“That’s the hard part,” Mr. Hamill said. “You don’t want to admit how possessive you’ve become. There are times where you go, ‘Really? That’s what they think of Luke? I’m not only in disagreement – I’m insulted.’ But that’s the process and you thrash it all out.”

The film has become an unexpectedly poignant document since Ms. Fisher died in December. Though their contact was fitful in her final years, Mr. Hamill said that Ms. Fisher was a reliably caustic companion and correspondent — someone who brought a wicked sense of humor to the occasionally onerous media events they attended together and offered him a constant reminder of his obligation to “Star Wars.”

Several years ago, when Ms. Fisher noticed in a theater program that Mr. Hamill had referred only elliptically to his “Star Wars” work, he said, “She goes, ‘What’s your problem?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s theater, I want it to be more focused on theater.’ She goes, ‘I am Princess Leia. You’re Luke Skywalker. Get used to it.’”

More remorsefully, Mr. Hamill spoke of his frustration that Ms. Fisher would not get to complete this trilogy of films.

“She deserved that second act,” he said. “Harrison was more prominent in VII, I’m more prominent in this one, and she was meant to be more prominent in the last one. Her timing was perfect, except in this case.”

His “Star Wars” colleagues say that there is something fitting about the fact that the devoted, less heralded Mr. Hamill is the only lead actor from the original films presently involved with the franchise — “He’s the last man standing,” said Mr. Ford, whose character met his demise in “The Force Awakens.”

But Mr. Ford was reluctant to speculate what this distinction might mean to Mr. Hamill.

“It means what it means to him, and that’s all that matters,” he said. “I’m sure what he represents in the story is something worthy of attainment by those younger characters, and” — his voice took on an uncharacteristically whimsical tone — “that it’s all linked together in some cosmically glorious way that will assure Mark work for years to come.”

Photo

Mr. Hamill prefers not to scrutinize this too closely either. Pleading self-consciousness, he said he has not watched the original “Star Wars” movies outside of theaters and has seen “The Force Awakens” only twice.

“All I notice are flaws,” he explained. “‘Oh, why did I do that?’ ‘Look at my hair.’ ‘What was I thinking?’”

During production of “The Force Awakens,” he allowed himself to watch the audition reels of actors who were also considered for Luke Skywalker — Will Seltzer, Robby Benson, William Katt — and was struck by what he saw. “They were all great,” Mr. Hamill said. “They all could have been really good Luke Skywalkers, which really makes me appreciate the arbitrariness.”

One film Mr. Hamill goes back to frequently is “A Hard Day’s Night,” Richard Lester’s madcap comedy about the Beatles happily enduring the hardships of celebrity as they are pursued by fans.

As a teenager, Mr. Hamill said, “I saw it originally going, ‘Oh, can you imagine it? Girls chasing me down the street! It looks like so much fun.’” But when he viewed it again recently, he saw it in another light. “It’s like a horror movie,” he said. “They’re trapped. They can’t go anywhere.”

One scene that stuck in Mr. Hamill’s mind was the “Can’t Buy Me Love” sequence, when the Fab Four are running through a field, clowning around, blissfully free of the gravitational forces awaiting them in the outside world.

“It’s the one time they spontaneously feel exuberance and joy,” Mr. Hamill said. “It plays so differently now, when you’re on the other end of it.”",Luke Skywalker Speaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — This is a perfect puzzle for a Friday. It’s a puzzle by Kameron Austin Collins and Brendan Emmett Quigley and, if I can make a recommendation, it is best done curled up on the couch with a fine beverage, and the knowledge that the weekend is at hand. Maybe there’s some music playing in the background, and some good chocolate nearby. All I know is that I smiled all the way through this puzzle, and I hope you did, too.

The reason I smiled is because this was the most satisfying tug-of-war I’ve been a part of in a long time. I didn’t know all the answers. Well, my brain did, mostly, but the answers weren’t always at the surface. I had to dig for some of them, and work the grid for others.

Meaty, lively entries (I was actually surprised that there were only two debuts today), and a mostly clean grid. Sneaky clues that are just out of reach, but which fall upon second look.

22A: The trick to a clue like “You, overseas” is to know that it is asking you for the word “You” in a foreign language (hence the clue word “overseas”). Got that? Good. Now your job is to figure out which language. There are a lot to choose from. TOI, for example, means “you” in French, but that’s not the answer. Now, if you know about the lean and hungry CASSIUS, who went on to be one of the recipients of Julius Caesar’s famous “Et tu”’s, you can fill that in, and that gives you the S. The only language I know that has a word meaning “you” that begins with an S is German, and the word is SIE.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.","Some of that is simply politics. But Ms. Lupton believes that those simplistic judgments are rooted in a quirk of psychology that makes them hard to avoid, and harder still to alter once they take hold.

“In political psychology there’s this notion of confirmation bias: that you have a predetermined belief about either an outcome or in this case whether a person is good or bad,” she said. That bias leads people to subconsciously select information that reinforces those beliefs — and to ignore facts that are inconsistent with it.

That helps explain how Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s champions in the West seemed to overlook signs that she might not be a paragon of liberal democratic values after all.

In a 2013 interview with the BBC, for instance, she brusquely dismissed questions about rising violence against the Rohingya, saying that Buddhists had also been displaced from their homes and that there was fear “on both sides.” Asked why the violence had overwhelmingly affected Muslims, she deflected, saying that Buddhists lived in fear of “global Muslim power.”

Though such episodes mounted during her rise, they conflicted with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s saintly image, and so went largely unnoticed. Western leaders continued to embrace her, building her legitimacy as they pressured the transitional government to hold elections that were widely expected to elevate her to power.

“Confirmation bias is so powerful that we can ignore information that conflicts, and don’t even notice we’re doing it,” Ms. Lupton said.

That can feed a much more significant political bias, experts say, toward believing that a political system will take on the characteristics of its leader. In fact, the truth is often the opposite.

Together, those biases make it easy to conclude that if heroic individuals could just win power, that would be enough to bring democracy and freedom.

“We’re always in search of the leader that we can rely on to be our partner so that we can just kind of sign off on that person and go back to worrying about other things,” said Elizabeth Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist who studies American foreign policy.

A Long Line of Would-Be Saviors

The simple story of a crusading leader who will transform a nation rarely works out that way.

The United States once championed the Afghan leader Hamid Karzai as the democratic successor to the Taliban’s oppressive regime. But Washington was disappointed to find that Mr. Karzai, rather than rising above the problems of corruption and cronyism that had beset Afghanistan, established an inner circle that embodied them.

“If you hold up a leader as a paragon of virtue, you may aid in consolidating their power, which can have all kinds of unintended consequences,” Ms. Saunders said.

In Rwanda, President Paul Kagame was hailed as his country’s savior when he took office, with Western support, after the 1994 genocide. But despite successes in reducing poverty, he has proved to be an authoritarian leader. Opposition politicians often end up in prison, in exile or dead. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread military detention and torture.

And it was easy to support the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement when it was a rebel group fighting Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader currently under indictment for genocide in Darfur. But after the group’s officers and allies took power in the newly independent South Sudan, they helped plunge the country into civil war.

It is not only Western leaders who make such misjudgments. In the 1960s and ’70s, activists worldwide cheered the rise of African independence leaders like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, many of whom later hardened into dictators.

There are exceptions, such as Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president of South Africa. But the Mandelas are so uncommon, and their successes rely on so many factors clicking into place, that they are still marveled over as wondrous mysteries, including among frustrated activists in Myanmar.

‘Features of a Dictator’

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is not Mr. Kagame or Mr. Mugabe, but after less than 20 months in office she is showing hints of the traits that define such leaders.

Upon winning power, she quickly sidelined many of the activists and civil society groups that had aided her rise. “She is only listening to those close to her,” said U Yan Myo Thein, an activist with the pro-democracy 88 Generation group and a former political prisoner, characterizing her inner circle as a “personality cult.”

“This is one of the features of a dictator,” he said.

As international plaudits for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi continued to mount, some in Myanmar saw growing signs that she was consolidating power and suppressing critics.

“Though they claim themselves as an icon of democracy, they want to centralize and control everything,” Kyaw Thu, who leads the prominent civil society group Paung-Ku, said of the elected government. He added, “Anyone not supporting their agenda is the enemy.”

Dozens have been charged under a law that restricts criticism of the government, an echo of the imprisonment of dissidents under military rule.

Aaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said such measures “have characterized N.L.D. rule in Myanmar,” referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party.

Even beyond her stance on the Rohingya, he said, “Aung San Suu Kyi has not been a particularly liberal leader.”

A Lesson to Learn?

Though senior policymakers seem confident in their habits, younger voices are beginning to question whether the international community, after so many such disappointments, might have something to learn.

“This pattern is far too frequent to be ignored,” Tim Hirschel-Burns, a Peace Corps officer in Benin, wrote on his personal blog.

Perhaps the underlying model, of reforming a troubled country by installing a promising leader, might have the problem backward, he argued. Perhaps change needs to come bottom-up, even if this is harder and messier and takes longer.

“People in these countries, just as we are, are largely products of their environments,” he wrote.

Treating Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as somehow above Myanmar’s problems allowed the world to see only her “moral righteousness and bravery rather than the political force she represented,” he added.

Even leaders who say all the right things and show good intentions tend to reflect the systems through which they rise. If those systems remain broken, it is fair to blame leaders for their mistakes, but unrealistic to expect a different outcome.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, after all, may be enacting a version of democratic rule that is in line with what many of Myanmar’s citizens demand.

A 2015 survey by Asia Barometer found that most respondents in the country opposed checks on executive power, believed religious authorities should have a role in lawmaking and said citizenship should be tied to religion. Support for a strong-handed ruler was high and support for full rights for minorities was low.

“People want democracy in the sense of being rid of dictatorship and having a leader that’s popularly elected,” said Thant Myint-U, a historian and former United Nations official. “But that’s very different from accepting the whole panoply of liberal values, especially when it comes to issues of race, ethnicity or gender equality.”

It is worth asking how much of the Western anger now directed at Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, including calls to revoke her Nobel Peace Prize, is partly buyers’ remorse from supporters who regret their own role in transforming her into such a powerful symbol.

WASHINGTON — Then there was one.

Syria announced during United Nations climate talks on Tuesday that it would sign the Paris agreement on climate change. The move, which comes on the heels of Nicaragua signing the accord last month, will leave the United States as the only country that has rejected the global pact.

According to several people who were in a plenary session at the climate talks in Bonn, Germany, a Syrian delegate announced that the country was poised to send its ratification of the Paris agreement to the United Nations.

“This is the very last country that actually announced, so everyone has joined and the U.S. is now so isolated,” said Safa Al Jayoussi, executive director of IndyAct, an environmental organization based in Lebanon that works with Arab countries on climate change.

A White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, pointed reporters to a statement the administration made when Nicaragua joined the pact, noting there had been no change in the United States’ position.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

If you are reading this on a mobile device or tablet, you can listen to the interview here.

All warmed up? Good, let’s see if we can achieve a personal best today.

Today we follow the path the marathoners will run on Sunday, by BOROUGH, and we are starting at the bottom of the grid. For example, the race begins on Staten Island, but that borough is no where to be seen, unless you jump down to 67A’s “Step 1: A passenger ship since 1817” and fill in FERRY. I got that through the crossings, because I wasn’t think about a small FERRY being a ship. However, we’re specifically thinking about the STATEN ISLAND FERRY from that clue, and the borough is implied.

We then lope — sorry, I mean run — into BROOKLYN, with 51A’s “Step 2: An old baseball team,” which is, of course the (BROOKLYN) DODGERS.

Keep up a good pace and, if you get lost, send up a flare or click here to see the entire theme.

5A: TIL that a small cape, like the one in Provincetown, is also called a SPIT.

17A: Not sure whether the Little Dipper is in URSA MAJOR or URSA MINOR? Fill in URSA M_ _OR, and use the crossings, Luke.

27A: Ha! You thought that was a political clue, didn’t you? “Trump is often involved in these” is a bridge clue today. The answer is BID.

15D: I honestly thought that “Faces With Tears of Joy” was some piece of artwork that I hadn’t learned about, but it turns out that today’s answer is the laugh-til-you-cry EMOJI.

49A: The city of Zagazig is not only in EGYPT, it’s extremely fun to say out loud.

Peter Sagal: In 2016, my friend Greg Pliska asked me to come do the “play-by-play” at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament finals in Stamford, CT. I went and had a great time, including running into some old friends in the puzzle community. That inspired me to start solving the puzzle myself, and I’ve been doing it daily since around that time. In fact, it’s become a daily ritual in the “Wait, Wait ...” offices: we solve the puzzle together after our daily editorial meeting.

So, when Mike Selinker got in touch to ask me if I’d collaborate with him as a “celebrity,” I was thrilled. I had actually begun poking around with practice grids myself, thinking how gratifying it would be to make a puzzle for The Times, and was envious of the other folk who had gotten to work on one for the anniversary project. Mike and I met on a cruise a few years ago, and he helped me create a trivia game for the entertainers.

My first idea for the puzzle was shot down and I was a bit at sea as to what to do. I wanted to do something that related to my career, as many guest constructors had done, but didn’t know how to work the idea of a “quiz show host” into the puzzle. Maybe the clues were riddles with the solution being the answer? That didn’t work. Mike pointed out that I also am known for running marathons (13 so far, and I write a bi-monthly column for Runners World) and maybe that was a theme ... so I suggested in turn a “map” of the New York Marathon, which at that time was a few months off.

Mike responded amazingly. He constructed a grid in which a series of answers suggesting the five boroughs of the race, as a map, with the themed clues indicating their order in the race (Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Manhattan again.) The clues are all phrases that suggest the name of the boroughs without naming them. He also managed to get in the phrase NEW YORK MARATHON and even BOROUGH.

I love the puzzle because it combines two things I enjoy when they happen to appear in the puzzle: first, the unwritten answer (i.e., you have to mentally provide the word BRONX to complete the answer CHEER) and the physical form of the puzzle; that is, it’s relevant where the answers appear in the grid.

As said, the grid was entirely Mike’s work. I contributed to the cluing as best I could, which was both difficult and a delight. As Mike pointed out to me, some words, like AGA, have appeared in the puzzle many times, and its a challenge to come up with new ways of cluing them. Of my clues that made it through the editing process, I’m most happy about 36 Across and 29 Down.

This really was great fun. It makes me want to try to construct one on my own, although it’ll be a huge leap from simply kibbitzing to doing it all myself. At any rate, I hope solving it gives puzzlers the same sense of pleased satisfaction I’ve gotten from doing the puzzle the last year.

One last important note: I couldn’t very well co-author a puzzle about the New York Marathon without running it, so I signed up with Achilles International to be a guide for a blind runner, as I’ve done three times before. I’ll be helping to guide an accomplished para-athlete named Asim Baig, and we’re raising money for Achilles and Mr. Baig.

Mike Selinker: A couple years ago on the JoCo Cruise, I helped Peter Sagal out with the clues for a game show — I know, right? — and so it seemed about time for him to return the favor. Peter was a more-than-willing collaborator, and we fleshed out a lot of ideas that didn’t really go anywhere. Eventually I posed to Peter, who runs a lot of marathons, the obvious question “What about a marathon puzzle?” Peter wanted to run the New York Marathon this week, and so he came up with this insane and stellar idea of drawing a map of the entire marathon route. To which I said, “Uh, yeah, I think I can do that,” and came up with this.

Actually, the first grid also had a 26-letter message — RUN AND RUN TILL THE RACE IS DONE — running from the second R in FERRY to the N and E at the start of NEW YORK MARATHON, with the black squares being the bridges between the boroughs. Which was great except Will went, “Okay, but why?” And he was — stop me if this sounds familiar — completely correct. I ripped that out and made a much better grid with Will and Peter’s guidance.

Once that was done, Peter clued the first pass all by himself, and he’s the best crossword cluer ever. That brain is crammed with so much trivia, he’s probably had to delete the node that tells him how to use a fork. I had no freaking idea about half the stuff he crammed into there. For me though, the best clues of his are the ones that just roll off as effortless comments, like the ones for MOO, IMHO, and ROCK ON. It was a great three-way collaboration with me, Peter, and Will. I hope we get to do it again soon. Now Peter just has to teach me how to be a radio god and we’re even. Meanwhile, I’ll also be doing a marathon of a different kind, playing Dungeons & Dragons all day to benefit children hospitals for [Extra Life].

The number of Americans with heart failure increased to 6.5 million in 2011-2014 from 5.7 million in 2009-2012, according to the American Heart Association.

More than 10 percent of those over age 80 have heart failure, and more patients are living longer with advanced disease. Even as the death rate from heart attacks is falling, the figure for heart failure is rising.

Yet there are no widely accepted guidelines for dealing with these patients as they near death. Cancer specialists regularly move their patients to hospice at the end of life, for instance, but few cardiologists even think of it. Heart patients account for just 15 percent of hospice deaths, while cancer patients make up half, according to a recent study.

That paper, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, reviewed a number of ways in which heart patients are let down at the end of life. Implanted defibrillators often remain activated until the very end, for example, even for those in hospice.

A fifth of heart patients with defibrillators get shocked by them in the last few weeks of life, and 8 percent get shocked minutes before dying. Most patients are never told that they can ask that the defibrillators be turned off.

“Getting shocks at the end of life is not really helping patients live longer or better,” said Dr. Larry Allen, a heart failure specialist at the University of Colorado and an author of the study.

“We shouldn’t have a single one of these cases happening,” said Dr. Haider Warraich, a cardiology fellow at Duke University and first author of the study.

Experts often focus on the strides made in preventing and treating heart disease. Its incidence has declined by 70 percent in the past 50 years. People have heart attacks later in life than they used to, are more likely to survive them, and often live for years afterward with few or no symptoms.

“We are very proud” of that progress, said Dr. Patrice Desvigne-Nickens, a medical officer at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Still, she added, cardiologists and their patients should be discussing end-of-life options and palliative care earlier in the course of heart failure.

“Everyone is uncomfortable with end-of-life discussions,” she said. “The field of cancer may be ahead of us. We should learn from looking at their example.”

But cardiologists thrive on the dramatic saving of lives, said Dr. Michael Bristow, a cardiologist at the University of Colorado Denver. They devote their professional lives to rescuing patients having heart attacks and bringing them back from the brink.

End-of-life care is not typically their focus; neither do they spend much time pondering what some of their patients may experience in the future. “Those who go into cardiology are not necessarily ones who want to deal with death and dying,” Dr. Bristow said.

The very nature of end-stage heart failure makes it all the more difficult to prepare.

“Very few patients understand the trajectory of the disease,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, a heart failure specialist at Vanderbilt University. The path has peaks and valleys, but as the patient declines, each peak is a little lower than the one before.

And often doctors do not tell patients what to expect.

“Unfortunately, when you have patients with a chronic illness like heart failure, everyone thinks someone else will talk about it,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Too often, no one takes ownership of the last stage of the journey with the patient.”

Dr. Ellen Hummel of the University of Michigan, one of a small number of doctors specializing in cardiology palliative care, said the typical patient with cancer will usually experience a “fairly predictable” decline.

“They will be less able to take care of themselves,” she said. “They will be more symptomatic and come back to the hospital more frequently. And once this starts, it will probably continue until they die. Most people can see the end coming.”

But patients with end-stage heart failure are more likely to have wild swings, Dr. Hummel said, veering from feeling better to being terribly ill.

“It is confusing to both the patient and provider. Are they actually dying, or can we rescue them from a particular episode of worsening?”

Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University, agreed: “The issue is knowing who is really at the end of life.” For patients with heart failure, seesawing between good periods and bad, it can be very difficult to make the call.

Dr. Allen recently discussed all this with a patient, Ed Harvey.

Mr. Harvey, 75, has an implanted defibrillator, and his heart is weakening, pumping progressively less blood. Dr. Allen gave him medications that helped for a while, but, Dr. Allen said, “we have maxed out on what can be done.”

He can’t say with any certainty how long Mr. Harvey has. But now is the time, Dr. Allen told him, to talk about the end of life.

Mr. Harvey still feels pretty good, but “when you have congestive heart failure and it is not getting any better, you know that day is going to come,” he said.

He has been living with heart failure for more than a decade, and fears becoming a burden as his heart gets worse. It is now so weak that the only medical option left is an implantable pump. He knows that soon he will need full-time care.

“I have elected that if it got to that point,” he said, “put me in a hospice and let me go.”","For Patients With Heart Failure, Little Guidance as Death Nears",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/health/heart-failure-hospice.html

It also doesn’t hurt that, by virtue of his speedy ascension to All-N.B.A. status and contention for other top individual honors, Antetokounmpo is on a course to be eligible for a so-called “supermax” contract extension from the Bucks via the league’s new Designated Player Exception during the 2020 off-season, which would put him in line for a new deal well in excess of $200 million.

As he tweeted in July, to the presumed glee of every Milwaukeean, “I got loyalty inside my DNA.”

An Unexpected Loss

The connective tissue that links this star, team and city runs as dense as you’ll find on the N.B.A. map, perhaps surpassed only by Nowitzki’s two decades’ worth of roots in Dallas or maybe the deep bonds shared in San Antonio by Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Milwaukee hasn’t simply been the backdrop for Antetokounmpo’s fairy tale rise to American stardom; it has been home for virtually his whole family for all but the first few months of his N.B.A. life.

Antetokounmpo admits, furthermore, that the unexpected death of his father just over a month ago has him leaning on his adopted hometown more than ever. Charles Antetokounmpo died of a heart attack on Sept. 29 at age 54.

“I can feel the love from the city every day I step on the floor,” Giannis Antetokounmpo said. “For me, what I’m going through now, I appreciate it even more.”

Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo, who moved from Nigeria to Greece as undocumented immigrants in 1991 in search of a better life, secured the necessary paperwork to relocate to Milwaukee along with Giannis’s two younger brothers halfway through his rookie season. Kostas Antetokounmpo is a redshirt freshman at the University of Dayton now, but the rest of the family moved into a new downtown complex before this season, with Giannis and Alexandros Antetokounmpo (a high school sophomore) housed on the fifth floor and Charles and Veronica on the fourth.

After years of well-chronicled struggle for the family in a northern section of Athens known as Sepolia, they have found Milwaukee as idyllic as it was portrayed to be in the sitcom “Happy Days,” where not even the frigid winters can detract from the comfort they’ve experienced as a unit.

Only now, as they confront Charles’s death, even more responsibility has been heaped on the ever-widening shoulders of the Bucks’ phenom. Veronica Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, has moved up a flight to be with her sons on the fifth floor in the wake of her husband’s death.

“Leading your family is a lot tougher than basketball,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially right now. But I’ve got to be strong for my family.

“Things,” he continued, “are going to get better.”

Places to Improve

The areas for on-court improvement are obvious for Antetokounmpo even as he stuffs box score after box score. His outside shot still needs copious amounts of work — he is not close to trusting it in times of need — and there is room for growth in reading the game at both ends, consistently making his teammates better and refining his decision-making.

Yet it’s also ridiculous, and rather cold, to nitpick what is missing from Antetokounmpo’s blossoming game given the level he is consistently hitting with that 7-foot-3 wingspan of his. Doubly so at a time of profound grief.

“He’s like a plane that just started taking off,” Kidd said. “He’s at 10,000 feet.”

When he arrived in Wisconsin, via the 15th overall pick in the 2013 N.B.A. draft, Antetokounmpo was measured at 6 feet 9 inches and weighed less than 200 pounds. A half-decade later, he is closing in on 240 pounds, and coaches and teammates routinely refer to him as a 7-footer.

The Milwaukee assistant coach Frank Johnson, noting Antetokounmpo’s bulked-up body and added strength, said, “He gets bumped now and he loves it.”

As for his perimeter game, Johnson preaches patience, pointing to the countless nights of extra shooting he is getting alongside the mentoring “Coach Sweeney” — the Bucks assistant coach Sean Sweeney. The way Johnson talks about the work-in-progress jumper is reminiscent of what league observers said for years about Shaquille O’Neal’s persistent free-throw woes.

“If he had that already,” Johnson said, “it wouldn’t be fair.”

Terry, the Bucks guard, said: “Of course he has to keep working on his outside game. But Giannis just has a peaceful confidence about himself. You can see it. Last year, he didn’t have that.”

The legendary Kobe Bryant, now in his second season of retirement, had seen enough coming into training camp to challenge Antetokounmpo via Twitter in late August to make a bid for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award.

Asked why he set such a high target, as part of his #MambaMentality campaign, Bryant said last week via email that he was moved by Antetokounmpo’s “rare physical gifts that are matched by a rare inner passion.”",The Unspeakable Greatness of Giannis Antetokounmpo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/sports/basketball/giannis-milwaukee-bucks.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Amid all the work and publicity, Mr. Johnson is raising money for InGrained Hospitality Concepts, a group of new restaurants that he is planning, with a focus on rice and other grains. Mr. Johnson developed a passion for rice as he traveled the world and studied the African diaspora under the wing of Mr. Smalls. His parents also recalled his helping his grandmother clean rice as a boy.

On his Chefs Club menu, rice makes more than one appearance, and rises to a star attraction in the form of “con’con,” a dish of jollof sticky rice about the size of a moon pie, sweetened with coconut and topped with an eggplant curry and basil. It exudes comfort and grandeur at once.

He is cooking the food he wants, a right that he said was slipping away at the Cecil, which has recently rebranded itself as a steakhouse, with a new chef and a new menu. Gone are the collard green salad and the gumbo with Chinese chicken sausage, replaced by more-traditional fare like fried calamari, garlic spinach and steaks.

How and why the Cecil went from a restaurant that aimed for uncharted tastes to one banking on mainstream crowd-pleasers is a matter of dispute among Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smalls and Richard D. Parsons, an owner of the Cecil and a former chief executive of Time Warner.

Mr. Parsons said diners from outside Harlem were reluctant to trek during the week to the restaurant, at the corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and West 118th Street. And the menu was “too exotic,” he added, for the Cecil to become a weeknight habit for neighborhood residents.

“You’re not actually looking for a cinnamon-dusted guinea fried hen with piri-piri rice on the side,” he said.

Mr. Smalls, who remains an owner but had no hand in the new steakhouse menu, disagreed, blaming poor management and a business plan that he said failed to adequately adjust when a planned lunchtime seating never materialized.

Photo

The Cecil is also tethered financially to Minton’s, a sibling restaurant next door that never found its niche as Harlem’s version of the Rainbow Room, as Mr. Smalls and Mr. Parsons had envisioned. “The Cecil was the workhorse in the brother-sister relationship,” Mr. Smalls said.

As the owners tinkered to find the right formula, the restaurants closed, then reopened. Caught in the middle was Mr. Johnson, who started out as chef de cuisine of the Cecil and ended up as executive chef of both restaurants. The job, though, came with little autonomy.

Photo

Mr. Johnson, 33, said he needed to lay a foundation for himself; his wife, Samiyyah Chapman; and their 3-month-old twins. He told his bosses he wanted a bigger role and more restaurants.

“When they said to me they really didn’t want to do anything else, I had to go look in the mirror and say, ‘Would I be content here working for the next 10 years?’” he said. “At that point, I don’t mean to sound cocky, but I’m just better than that.” He resigned in June.

All three men remain on good terms. In an interview, Mr. Parsons called Mr. Johnson “the illustrious JJ” with admiration. Together, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Smalls have written a 375-page cookbook, “Between Harlem and Heaven: Afro-Asian-American Cooking for Big Nights, Weeknights, and Every Day,” to be published in early February. (Veronica Chambers, who co-wrote the memoirs of the chefs Marcus Samuelsson and Eric Ripert, also collaborated on the cookbook.)

Mr. Johnson has forged ahead alone in other ventures. He was trying to persuade Stephane De Baets, a founder and the president of Chefs Club, to invest in Ingrained Hospitality when another idea came to Mr. De Baets. “Why don’t you come do a pop-up to show me first your cuisine?” Mr. De Baets recalled asking him.

In August, Mr. Johnson previewed dishes at Chefs Club Counter, a new fast-casual sister of Chefs Club. “Within half a day, all tickets were sold,” said Mr. De Baets, who is considering an investment in Mr. Johnson’s restaurant group.

That success led to the longer stay at Chefs Club, a cavernous space with an open kitchen where diners can watch the chefs in action.

Mr. Johnson has filled the menu with brightly colored dishes and flavors, seen most obviously in a shared plate of cornmeal-crusted sea bass, seasoned with turmeric, that takes up an entire bowl and leaves just enough room for purple sweet potatoes, roasted carrots, papaya and long beans.

A few dishes, like udon noodles with braised goat, and piri-piri prawns, have followed Mr. Johnson to Chefs Club from the Cecil. His favorite dessert is a rice milk pop of raspberry and hibiscus with crispy puffed rice drizzled on top.

At Chefs Club, Mr. Johnson also did something he could never do at the Cecil: He put his name on it, placing the neon letters “JJ” in the window. He also required the restaurant to play his days-long soundtrack, which he commissioned a D.J. to compile. On a recent night, several diners bobbed their heads and swayed in their seats.

Music plays as much of a role in dining as food, Mr. Johnson said, recalling how his Puerto Rican grandmother played salsa while she prepared sofrito and plantain dumplings, and how his black American grandmother, raised in the Rocky Mountains, played Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Earth Wind & Fire as she made cherry pies and traditional Southern food.

His taste runs to ‘90s neo-soul and hip-hop. “That’s part of the diaspora,” he said. “That’s when I feel like black artists were having the best times in their careers. They were able to really put their music out. Like Biggie, Tupac, Wu-Tang, Mariah, Erykah Badu, they were talking about real stuff that was happening in our lives.”

For $360, a diner can have everything on the menu in a tasting that Mr. Johnson calls “It Was All a Dream,” a nod to The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Juicy.”

“This is a dream for me,” he said. “I get to the cook the food of who I am and listen to the music that I want to listen to.”

Mr. Johnson said he also wants to create jobs and hire people who look like him. His give-back attitude appears to come from his parents, Marcela Johnson, a retired teacher, and Joe Johnson, a bookkeeper who still runs a youth basketball program in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, where they raised their son and his younger sister. The family traveled on vacation to Barbados, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and North Carolina — trips that, in reflection, helped him see the African diaspora firsthand.

Though Mr. Johnson excelled in a variety of sports, including skiing, basketball and soccer, he wanted to be a chef. His mother insisted that, despite the expense, he study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. After graduating, he worked in New York at Tribeca Grill and the Smith, then as a personal chef and later in an executive dining room at Morgan Stanley.

In 2011, as a contestant on “Rocco’s Dinner Party,” a Bravo reality TV show hosted by the chef Rocco DiSpirito, Mr. Johnson wooed the judges with a dish of smothered shrimp and grits.

The meal caught the eye of Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, who said Mr. Johnson reminded him of his father, who would prepare the same Lowcountry dish for special occasions. Mr. Smalls reached out to Mr. Johnson, and they developed a teacher-apprentice relationship. Mr. Johnson accompanied Mr. Smalls on educational trip to Ghana, and that led to the job at the Cecil.

Mr. Johnson is now likely on his way to achieving a fame that has eluded Mr. Smalls, who recalled an exchange with Josh Ozersky, the food critic who picked the Cecil as Esquire magazine’s best new restaurant in America in 2014.

Saying the food was amazing, Mr. Ozersky told Mr. Smalls, “It’s a shame you won’t get credit for it.”

Mr. Smalls remembered pushing back. “It’s not important that I’m the person that’s cooking the food and most remembered for it. It’s important that it’s remembered,” he said. “If I did something right in selecting a protégé who is going to make that a platform, then I ain’t mad.”

Salvadorans, who make up about 60 percent of those in the Temporary Protected Status program, were first granted protection in March 2001 after a series of earthquakes in the country.","Many of the more than 300,000 people shielded from deportation under the program have lived in the United States for years and bought homes, embarked on careers and given birth to children who are American citizens.

Now they face an uncertain future.

People protected under the program will be given six months to leave after their current permissions expire. The temporary status for the 86,000 Hondurans and 5,000 Nicaraguans in the program expires in early January, and Monday was the deadline for the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether to renew that status. It has until Thanksgiving to decide whether to extend the protection for thousands of Haitians.

The program covers 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

The Trump administration’s decisions to rescind the temporary protection status for Nicaraguans is part of its effort to reduce both legal and illegal immigration to the United States. The administration has moved aggressively to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes and reducing the number of refugees.

Democratic members of Congress and immigration advocates called the move inhumane.

Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said that sending tens of thousands of people back to Central American nations still recovering from natural disasters or internal strife could destabilize those countries.

In a statement, Mr. Cardin said the effort was part of the “White House’s radical anti-immigration agenda,” which ignored an honest assessment of conditions in each of the countries.

A coalition of immigration groups also criticized the Trump administration for ending the protection.

“The Trump administration’s recommendation to terminate temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of people from all over the globe living in the United States is cruel and shameful,” Steven Choi, the executive director for the New York Immigration Coalition, said at a news conference on Monday in New York. “America will not be greater or safer by sending back people who’ve made their lives here.”

Belinda Osorio, 48, who arrived in 1991 in the United States from Honduras seeking work, said she was relieved the news had not been as bad as she had feared. She had read and heard that her temporary protected status would be cut off immediately.

Still, it was only a postponement of the panic that was to come.

“I don’t think six months is going to fix anything because what are we going to do after six months?” said Ms. Osorio, a housekeeper at one of the Disney World resort hotels in Orlando, Fla. “We’re not going to leave. I’m not going to leave my country. I’m not going to take my kids to a dangerous country.”

She said that she was afraid that if they were forced to return to Honduras, her 14-year-old son would be forced to join a violent gang. Her 72-year-old mother has been threatened by gang members who have demanded money from her, and Ms. Osorio said she feared she and her children, as returnees from the United States, would have it even worse.

Like many other recipients of temporary protected status, Ms. Osorio built a life here expecting that she would not be forced to return anytime soon. She had married an American citizen, another hotel employee, with whom she had two children; it was through her job that her family had medical insurance. For years, she said, she had been trying to apply for a green card based on her marriage, and she hoped she would succeed before the temporary program expired.

“At least I have hope with my husband, but there’s a lot of people, they don’t have nothing. Their only hope is T.P.S.,” she said. “It’s not fair after so many years working so hard in this country, and they just want to get rid of us just like that.”

John F. Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and now the White House chief of staff, had extended temporary protected status for Haitians in May, giving them an additional six months to stay in the country.

Salvadorans, who make up about 60 percent of those in the Temporary Protected Status program, were first granted protection in March 2001 after a series of earthquakes in the country. Their protective status will expire next year, on March 9.

The status is renewed periodically, and recipients have to keep their permits updated to avoid deportation, paying $495 each time. The Obama administration typically granted 18-month waivers.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus.

When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia.
On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug.","The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records — from Saudi Arabia’s government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund — stands in stark contrast to those aims. By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals — a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.

“Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,” said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.

She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.

Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.

WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.

Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.

Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.

The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.

Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.

On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.

Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)

But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”

But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.

It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

Now we’re in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean — and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.",Saudi Money Fuels the Tech Industry.

When volunteers were called up to the line, without thought I stepped forward. Hirota, oddly enough, did not. Instead he donned a whistle and took a place on the outside, as one of the steerers.

Our team would be coached by the kiyari-shu, the procession’s leader, who would sing regional songs to cheer us up and dictate the length of our suffering at each waypoint; nine in total.

Presently, he sang for us to lift. We pressed the shrine a full arm’s length above our heads and the men around me started chanting, “Ya, ya, ya!” I joined the rhythm, the acceleration, and just like that our ship was underway.

The enthusiasm, however, wore off quickly. Feet were stepped on, dances were performed out of sync, and then an unexpected fight broke out between the left and right sides—which is to say unexpected only by me. It’s actually a completely regular occurrence during the procession, where one bearer shouts, “Come at me!” and the two sides attempt to hurl the mikoshi to the ground by pitching it onto and over the backs of the opposing team.

I let my side down, by dumbly absorbing blows, instead of heaving back punishment.

But what surprised me the most was how quickly carrying the mikoshi went from fun, social activity to actual labor to medieval punishment I’d have traded my morals to escape. While the others lounged on a blue tarp, guzzling beer and feasting on store-bought trays of sushi, tempura and onigiri, I spent the break huddled in a remote corner, convinced the next few hours were going to take years off my life.

“It’s heavy, isn’t it?” Hirota said. He was already tipsy, and wanted me to be, too.

“More than I thought, but maybe with both of us next time, it won’t be so bad.”

Photo

Hirota sighed. Bad news. Since he was a leader... he didn’t have to say any more. Since he was a leader there would be no challenging ourselves together. While I bore the load with the rest of the grunts, Hirota’s entire lifting duties would consist of holding a whistle, and he probably knew that when he recruited me.

“It’s an important position,” he called back, leaving to join the others.

I took a long pull of the sake he left and spat half of it on the grass. I couldn’t believe it — shanghaied! By the samurai of dubious origin.

What happened to ganbarro?

The tradition of carrying the mikoshi is centuries deep, though which exact century is still up in the air. One of the first recorded mentions of mikoshi took place in 794 A.D. in Kyushu, where the god of the Usa Hachiman Shrine was brought outside on a palanquin to either — depending on accounts — ensure the safe construction of the Great Buddha at the Todaiji Temple or suppress a revolt. Possibly both.

However, by the beginning of the 11th century, while Murasaki Shikibu put the finishing touches on what many consider the world’s first novel (“The Tale of Genji”), her contemporaries in Kyoto were already marching mikoshi through the city streets to ward off malevolent spirits and natural disasters as a part of their festivals.

Today these processions still take place, and not only on a grand scale like the Sanja Matsuri in Tokyo and the monthlong Gion Matsuri in Kyoto, and not only in every city, but in almost every neighborhood of every city in Japan.

As we entered the third rest stop, another procession was pulling away. It was our neighbor — or rather, the neighboring community, which was holding their festival on the same day. Unlike ours, their ujigami was ensconced in a large, wheeled float that was covered in paper lanterns and pulled by its bearers via two enormous dockyard ropes.

Photo

Also unlike ours, their procession was musical. Drummers and flute players sat inside, sending out a charged and playful melody. An ujigami is a Shinto deity and therefore has no name, no features, no disposition, but it can retain a certain characteristic. Whereas our ujigami liked to be jostled and bobbed like an upside down pendulum, this one liked music. I watched a 4-year-old girl run after the float, trying to wallop the two enormous tao drums sticking out from its rear like exhaust nozzles on a space shuttle. They were too high for her, but still she lunged, arms flailing in rhythmic circles, until she finally got close enough to hop up and deliver a bang.

A big hollow sound answered back and she ran into her father’s arms, dirt-scraped, smiling, triumphant. “They don’t have enough people. This will be their last year,” a man said.

This struck me as sad. Partly because their group was only slightly smaller than ours, but there was something else. You see, Miyoshi lies on the far southern tip of the Boso Peninsula, where every weekend surfers and cyclists flock in from Tokyo and Yokohama to take advantage of the beaches and ocean-view roads, but between those coasts lies a landscape that echoes of a pastoral past.

A place where farmers sell crops via unmanned, roadside stands to customers who pay on the honor system; where crows are formidably enormous, and the summer growth is so explosive it foams right into passing traffic; where every summer morning Asian lilies open with a pop(!)—scenting the air with licorice—and every summer night bush-league yakuza rattle past your windows, gunning motorcycle engines.

There’s a delicate balance to it all that is held together by a community willing to bend and band together.

But what happens to a place when its people are no longer strong enough to take care of their community another year?

Photo

I watched the procession disappear back into its neighborhood for the last time, where the drumbeats faded to a murmur: the sound of an ujigami retiring.

“Even if I drink sake, my spirit doesn’t get drunk, until the matsuri is over,” our kiyari-shu sang. It’s not exactly the accompaniment you’d expect to hear at a religious procession.

These songs — some silly, others bawdy, most not for children — weren’t going to help anyone up the steps of enlightenment; they were made to lift the spirits of generations of farmers, who were out seeking their gods in their own way.

But at the time, I could not see that. By now, all of my fellow grunts had either drunken themselves stuporous or had long since been rendered mute by pain. And yet the kiyari-shu still pushed — always prolonging each dance so that it was longer than the last; once we had given the supreme effort, he always found a new verse and kept on singing. My breaking point came at the seventh leg. I had made it seven hours. Seven hours of that unfamiliar god towering over, biting into my shoulder, and I hurt right down to the skeleton.

When the dance was finally over, I practically threw my beam on the sawhorse and stormed off through the crowd.

I walked down a country road bordered by rice fields until I was far enough away to have to consider whether I should just walk home. Unsure, I stopped. While the Japanese countryside may lack the sheer expansive scale of a heartland, it is heartlandish. At this point in the summer, the rice stalks were dense, yellowing and just starting to bend. Herons, white as candles, patrolled the shadows of their rows. A hand touched my arm.

Photo

It was Hirota. I was too angry to talk, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, he offered a can of Pineapple Strong Zero — my favorite — and we drank in silence next to the rice fields, watching the wind comb them. “I wanted this to be fun for you,” Hirota finally said.

He was always trying to include me. And how many foreigners come to live in Japan, especially rural Japan, and find inclusion just out of reach? I suddenly felt ashamed of my anger. Here was the man who signed the lease for my apartment, without my even asking him; who taught me how to wrestle octopus and fist-sized mollusks from the ocean floor and later how to dice them up into fresh sashimi. He had invited me into his home and counted me among his community, and it was about time I started acting like it.

On our return, I scooped up one of those balloon-size sake bottles off the blue tarp, and tilted it back with the rank and file until we were all sputtering alcohol. If the summer matsuri is as much about sharing happiness as sharing hardship then it was time for me to even the balance.

I grabbed a shovel and drew a sumo ring in the dirt. Ten minutes later, I was standing outside of it, holding up the fat arm of a fisherman who had ousted me.

When it was time to march again, Hirota put his whistle around my neck and took my place in line. But for the final length, we went together.

Back at the shrine, after 20 minutes of continuous jostling, the men holding the mikoshi were crumbling. Backs were bending and the right side was starting to buckle. One man shouted, “Let this be the last one. Ganbarro!”

“Ganbarro!” we answered back.

And the kiyari-shu found another verse and kept on singing.

The Kanda Matsuri (gotokyo.org/en/kanko/chiyoda/event/kandamatsuri) (mid-May, 2019) features several processions, including floats with characters from famous folk stories, samurai on horseback and the Sengan mikoshi (weighing in at approximately 3.75 tons). It takes place in odd numbered years, alternating with the Sanno Matsuri (japan-guide.com/e/e3065) (mid-June, 2018).

Osaka’s Tenjin Matsuri (osaka-info.jp/en/events/festivals_events/post_20) (mid-July) is most notable for the brilliant 90-minute firework display that lights up a traditional fleet procession crisscrossing the city’s Okawa River. Visitors can view the torch-lit boats from several historic vantage points, including Osaka Castle.

The Gion Matsuri (jnto.go.jp/eng/spot/festival/gion_matsuri) is sometimes referred to as the most famous festival in Japan. It spans the entire month of July and features numerous events; the highlight occurs on July 17: an extravagant procession of 32 ornately decorated floats, known as yamahoko, which have been recognized by Unesco’s World Heritage list for their outstanding cultural value.","In Rural Japan, Lifting a Shrine and Building a Friendship",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/travel/shrine-at-japan-festival.html

In the past two weeks, he has brought on weirdo characters like Butterscotch, part of a long tradition of creepy clowns, and a guy doing a Dracula impression who can’t stop making bad puns (“I don’t want to sound like your mummy but …”), a bit that spun out unexpectedly into a story of addiction that led this bad joker to attend the Lestat Institute for Word Therapy. The fake institute, complete with serious-looking people in white lab coats, evoked Albert Brooks’s classic sendups of the conventions of comedy.

Just because the premises of these sketches are tethered to a tradition doesn’t mean they aren’t peculiar. Mr. O’Brien’s brand of silliness has always been delightfully, often gruesomely askew. Recently, he began a sketch by asking strangers what they thought about the news that Sears would no longer be carrying Whirlpool appliances. But this man-on-the-street premise was only the setup, because after a few people expressed normal curiosity or indifference, one man appeared stunned, immediately called his family, went home and buried himself alive while they watched. The video ended in another interview with a person showing mild interest in the news, but in the background, the family looked down on the grave and set it aflame.

While some jokes are connected to the calendar, like the clown for Halloween, many of them are evergreen. A punch line about the daily goings-on in Washington can get easy laughs from like-minded viewers. But they won’t age well, and Mr. O’Brien, generally speaking, aims for jokes that depend less on the news cycle than his competitors do.

This even extends to how Mr. O’Brien handles politics. While he does an ordinary joke or two about President Trump every night, he also produced one of the most truly daring episodes of political comedy this year, with a September show shot entirely in Israel and the Palestinian territories, one of his many episode-long forays into other cities. Mr. O’Brien floated in the Dead Sea, engaged in some terrible haggling with street vendors and delivered a minute-long history of the area that covered thousands of years.

Much of the special was simply Mr. O’Brien unscripted, making a connection with game strangers and turning that into an amusing scene. But he didn’t only stay light. When he traveled to the West Bank barrier, he bumped into pro-Palestinian activists, who criticized Zionism, describing a Palestinian girl killed by an Israeli settler. He spent most of this awkward but compelling exchange listening, without defensiveness, and then posted the entire 24-minute segment online. Inevitably, his show was criticized for bias, but wading into this dispute, even clumsily, displayed an admirable willingness to take risks.

Earlier this year, there were rumors that “Conan” was shifting to a weekly format, and Lord knows, after being a daily talk-show host since 1993, he has earned the right to a slower schedule. But here’s hoping he sticks around, because more than anyone else on air, he is a reminder that talk-show hosting is an art form deserving respect. The increasing politicization of late-night comedy has been great for ratings, and has helped certain hosts find their voices, but it’s worth examining if it comes at a cost. Comedy doesn’t need to serve a political end to be important.",The Most Riveting Host in Late Night (and the Most Overlooked),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/arts/television/conan-obrien-artistic-risks-late-night-talk-show.html

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean? I stared at my mostly finished grid and then I saw it. Running down the center of the grid was the phrase HEAVY METAL BANDS. And across the center of the top three grids was POINT BLANK RANGE.

O.K., Mr. Arbesfeld, now I’ve got you. Across the middle of my grid, I had ___ OPTIC CABLE, so I filled in FIBER across the middle of grid No. 4. Sure enough, it was an answer and I conquered that grid.

Since this is the first appearance of a Walls and Doors puzzle, I asked Mr. Arbesfeld to tell me a bit about how it came to be:

Constructor Notes

I got the idea initially from a Sunday puzzle back in January called “Rolling in the Aisles,” in which the word HA was used as a rebus for Down clues, but yet blocked off from the accompanying Across clues. It seemed to me that the Across clues had walls, while the Down clues had doors. I think this also struck a chord for me because of the 2016 election, in which one candidate talked of building walls while the other wanted to open doors. And finally, there’s a Jackson Browne song I love with the same title. I initially created it in a more traditional crossword puzzle manner for a Thursday, but found that it was too easy. So then I hit upon the idea of making each of the nine 5x5 sections its own puzzle, with the six interlocking 15-letter entries running through. This seemed much more suitable as a Sunday Variety puzzle, so I presented it to Will Shortz as such.

I really enjoyed this puzzle, with its roller coaster ride of mulling over clues and conquering grids. I would definitely do one of these again.",Variety Puzzle: Walls and Doors,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/crosswords/variety-puzzle-walls-and-doors.html

Beyond loans, the team of six curators have been scouting for art from private collections. They have acquired more than 600 works, including Piet Mondrian’s 1922 “Composition With Blue, Red, Yellow and Black,” bought in 2009 for $27.9 million from Christie’s auction of the collection of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Bergé. Another important purchase was a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and Child by Giovanni Bellini, which museum officials say demonstrates a commitment to highlighting works that reflect different religions.

“What is the Louvre Abu Dhabi? It’s a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times,” said Jean-François Charnier, the project’s chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.

Some museum curators feared the Louvre Abu Dhabi’s buying spree could send global art prices surging. But Jean-Patrice Marandel, a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said the new museum “has not affected the market at all.”

“It does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor,” he added.

A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be. Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some “daring positions dealing with religion and nudity.”

Mr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah. It will be exhibited with a sixth-century Quran and gothic Bible.

The museum commissioned a new piece by the American artist Jenny Holzer, who carved three stone walls with historic scripts in cuneiform, Arabic and French, drawing from a Sumerian “Creation Myth” and an essay on self-determination by Michel de Montaigne, the Renaissance philosopher.

But my experience last week made me wonder if maybe the victims deserve a little space where we can just think about them, and the loss, before we throw ourselves into the fight.

Bret: I think we can and need to do both. We need to learn about the dead and honor the lives they led — or, in the case of the murdered children, the lives they might have led. But we shouldn’t shy away about talking about gun laws right now, or be cowed into not “politicizing” an event that has become so horribly commonplace that there’s no way not to politicize it.

How have we become a country in which one person can wipe out 26 people — 7 percent of the entire community! — because profoundly disturbed people have easy access to what amounts to a weapon of mass destruction?

Gail: You’re right. And when our president said “it’s a little bit soon” to start talking about guns, I did instinctively feel it was time to start talking about guns.

We’re definitely not going to have any disagreements here. Which brings me back to New York last week. Your column about living next to the terror attack was perfect. The one relief after a horrible event like that is the way average people come together. And people who in most circumstances wouldn’t be average — like a lot of your neighbors near the financial district — lose all their ego for a moment and just find comfort in being part of the group.

Bret: Thanks so much, Gail. That really was the striking thing: In the face of a terrorist and terrible carnage, people behaved with composure, decency and courage. I wanted to write a column that paid tribute to this, to the simple neighborliness and good citizenship of New Yorkers.

Gail: I remember right after 9/11 going down and seeing the hulk of the tower and running into Hillary Clinton, who was then one of our senators. She’s always had a not-unsurprising guarded reserve around the media, but that day she seemed to have lost all her barriers. She was just talking away about who was doing what, and what President Bush had said on the plane, and it occurred to me that she presumed that at that moment we were just two people in the community. That our normal roles had dissolved because nobody could possibly care about anything except the tragedy.

Maybe that was part of the reason I was so enraged at President Trump for instantly trying to make the story about how tough he is on ISIS. I can’t remember the last time I got so viscerally angry at a politician.

Bret: Among my 10 million or so objections to presidential candidate Trump, one of them was that he would be incapable of fulfilling the moral, emotional and symbolic role of the office. Obama and Bush both did, and I’ll never forget Clinton’s moving speech after the Oklahoma City bombing. But it’s the mark of the narcissist that he won’t, or can’t, perform the role, because ultimately the only person whose needs and feelings concern him are his own.

Gail: We are now really well aware of the difference between an egotist, which is pretty much all politicians, and a narcissist, which is somebody you just cannot have in the top job.

Bret: Speaking of rage, it also enraged me that he wasted no time turning the tragedy into a talking point about immigration. If he wants to talk immigration, he should spend a day in Stuyvesant High School, the elite magnet public school that was the endpoint of the terror attack, and note how many of the students there are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, many of them Muslim, by the way.

Gail: You’re so right. Look, this is making me angry all over again. Let’s change the subject for a moment. The Republicans have finally come up with a tax plan. What did you think?

Bret: Must it always be death or taxes?

I basically like it. It does four important things: It gives us an internationally competitive corporate tax rate and should reduce profit-shifting overseas; it simplifies the tax code.

Gail: Immediate prediction: Any simplification will become complicated before these people are through.

Sorry, go on.

Bret: It gets rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax, enacted in 1979 to hit a handful of tax-evading high-earners that now hits about five million taxpayers; and it decreases the subsidy to the real-estate industry with caps on the mortgage-interest deduction. Also, it doesn’t mess with our 401(k)’s, as some of us feared it would.

Music to your ears, too, right? I know our readers totally agree with me on this one.

Gail: Well, for starters …

As Steven Rattner wrote in The Times last week, the bill doesn’t do anything about a huge loophole known as “carried interest” that drastically reduces the tax rates for folks like hedge fund operators and, um, real estate developers.

Bret: That loophole is no different from paying the capital-gains rate on the sale of a home, but you know I’m antediluvian on this subject. Please continue.

Gail: Also, I do not understand why the party that is constantly at war with family planning changed the family exemption in a way that hurts people with a large number of children.

Bret: Here you make an excellent point. I can’t defend everything.

Gail: And the thing about eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes is just a raid on the blue states. One which I am eager to hear more about from Republican House members in places like New York, New Jersey and California.

Let me ask you — do you think this has a chance of passing?

Bret: Sixty-forty, I’d say, though with this Congress you never know. Tax cuts unite both the traditional and the Trumpian wings of the party, and Republicans know that if they can’t cut taxes they may as well not exist. Then again, all politics is local and most politicians care a lot more about their own political future than the party’s. It’ll also be interesting to see how Bob Corker votes: Don’t be surprised if he does to tax reform what McCain did to the Obamacare repeal — another reminder of the self-defeating nature of Trump’s politics of insult.

Gail: Whatever they finally come up with is going to increase the deficit mightily, which is one of Corker’s issues. I know your friend Paul Ryan would like to take care of that problem by slicing into Social Security and Medicare, and if that becomes a point of contention, it’ll keep the red-state Democrats from straying in the Senate.

Bret: We’ll see. Entitlement reform would be a good idea for the long-term health of the federal fisc, but a Republican Congress that can’t pass tax reform certainly isn’t going to change Medicare and Social Security anytime soon. I think a lot depends on the outcome of the governor’s race in Virginia, and what it says about the ideological future of the G.O.P.

Gail: Wow, Virginia. You’ve got a Republican candidate who was, until about 10 minutes ago, a super-establishment centrist. And now he’s yelling about immigrants and gang violence and people plotting to tear “our statues” down. This would, I guess, be the new Robert E. Lee wing of the party.

Bret: More like, “something old; something new,” but in any event depressing. Gillespie started the race trying to distance himself from Trump, who lost Virginia to Clinton by five points, by running an economics-themed campaign. Then Gillespie nearly lost the primary to a Trumpkin, and it all became about dead Confederate generals and bogus Latin American gang scares.

You know, the real issues.

Gail: Has anybody promised to bomb North Korea? This does sound very familiar.

Bret: If Gillespie wins, the lesson will be that any “conventional” Republican is going to have to do a convincing imitation of a Bannonite if he wants to win the primary and the general election. It will just accelerate the capitulation of the G.O.P. to the Bannonites, while Republicans with inner red lines are going to keep walking away from the party. The only silver lining I see here is that it slightly increases the chances of creating a third party.

Gail: So if you were in Virginia, would you be voting for Ralph Northam, the Democratic lieutenant governor? Or writing in “none of the above”?

Most interesting Republican news of the weekend was the new Bush book that reveals that George H. W. voted for Hillary Clinton while W. took the none-of-the-above dodge.

Can I just mention here that people who refuse to pick between the two major parties in important races are being weenies who just want to demonstrate their vast moral superiority?

Bret: Before last year’s election, my Trump-curious conservative friends kept telling me that an election is a choice and a none-of-the-above vote was a cop-out, and that’s about the only point on which we agreed. So I voted for Hillary.

I vote in New York City, thank God, so I don’t know local Virginia issues too well. But I’d probably vote for Northam. First, because he’s a former Army doctor and strikes me as smart and middle of the road. But mainly because I think that if voters don’t punish Republican candidates for becoming Bannonites, there’s nothing to stop the party from continuing to move in that direction.

Gail: Except for the Virginia saga, this year’s round of elections is pretty obscure — there are some very important state legislative races around the country, but I kinda doubt the whole world will be watching.

The other big governor’s race is a contest to see whether the people of New Jersey would like to endorse the career of Chris Christie by electing his lieutenant governor to succeed him. Christie may be the only major elected official in the country with worse public approval ratings than Trump. Not expecting much suspense on that one. Although it will give us a chance to rerun those pictures of him sunbathing on the state beach while it was closed to the public.

Anything else you’re following?

Bret: Did I mention that I also thank God that I don’t live in New Jersey?

Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman to win the New York City Marathon for 40 years. I was thrilled for her.

In the end, her only opponent was Tim Ryan, a young congressman and former high school quarterback star from Ohio’s 13th District, the ailing industrial region surrounding Youngstown and Akron. Ryan offered a splash-of-cold-water speech just before the vote: “We got wiped out,” he said, according to a recording of his remarks. “We’re toxic in the Midwest, and we’re toxic in the South.”

Pelosi won easily, but fully a third of the Democratic caucus voted against their leader, and Ryan’s insurrection seemed to have left a mark: After the election, three well-liked and nonrebellious members — Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and David Cicilline of Rhode Island — were chosen by the caucus to help manage the rebranding of the party. The three of them spent the first half of 2017 dutifully interviewing nearly every member of the caucus and conducting more than a dozen listening sessions with authors, pollsters and former Obama cabinet secretaries. They hosted a dinner at which the party’s various factions — the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the conservative Blue Dogs and the New Democrats, among others — mingled as if meeting for the first time.

In late July, Pelosi, Bustos, Jeffries and Cicilline stood on a stage with six other Democrats under a wiltingly hot summer sky in the city park of Berryville, Va. — a town of 4,306 residents in a purple district within easy driving distance of Washington — and unveiled their new agenda, titled “A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.” The phrase, which had been poll-tested by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was an intentional echo of F.D.R.’s New Deal — and, less intentionally, of a Papa John’s pizza slogan. But its biggest debt was to the author of “The Art of the Deal,” and to his crimson-jowled populism.

“A Better Deal” called for retraining in America’s fading manufacturing sector, renegotiating trade deals, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and fighting the corporate consolidation that had affected the prices of everything from eyeglasses to beer. None of the 10 speakers invoked President Barack Obama. In fact, one of the key provisions in “A Better Deal” — renegotiating drug prices for Medicare recipients — was an implicit rebuke of the former president, who had agreed with the pharmaceutical industry to freeze Medicare drug prices in exchange for its support of the Affordable Care Act.

But even before the rollout, Pelosi diminished the substance of “A Better Deal” in an interview with The Washington Post, clarifying that it was not “a course correction, but it’s a presentation correction.” A Quinnipiac poll in August found that only 33 percent of Democrats and 12 percent of independents had a favorable opinion of the new Democratic agenda. The self-consciousness of the rebranding, one congressman mused to me at the time, “seems like what you would do in a different era.”

There was a stiff-jointedness to the whole spectacle, a sense of the Democrats’ trying to regain the use of muscles they had let atrophy over the previous eight years. Obama, after all, used to make this sort of thing look easy. Conflating the American story with his own — “This is who we are” — the president conveyed, even in policy irresolution, an unshakable sense of his and America’s place in the world. “I love the guy, I miss him,” Scott Peters said of Obama. “But organizationally, the party is in disarray. We’re at the lowest level of elected officeholders since Hoover. We got a bit lazy and found ourselves relying on Barack Obama’s charisma, and it left us in bad shape.”

Barring seismic developments, the G.O.P. is still likely to control both the White House and the Senate until at least January 2021. But nine months into Trump’s presidency, the chances of the Democrats’ retaking the House are much better. Multiple polls in recent months have shown generic Democratic candidates beating generic Republicans by as many as 15 points — a spread that, in past elections, correlated with winning more than enough seats for the Democrats to gain a House majority next year. And if they do, the consequences will be enormous. A Democrat-controlled House in 2019 would very likely derail the Republican legislative agenda. It could also conceivably set the stage for impeachment proceedings against the president — a move that many Democrats have openly proposed for months now.

But the Democrats’ path back from the wilderness is not a short one. No president since Ronald Reagan has won the presidency as convincingly, twice over, as Obama did — but those victories papered over an extraordinary decline in his party that became suddenly unignorable on Nov. 9, 2016. The Democratic National Committee today is an understaffed, demoralized bureaucracy. It has raised less than half of what its Republican counterpart has taken in so far this year. (Other party organizations — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — are faring better.)

Democratic presidents have generally been less than attentive to the financial and electoral health of their party, during and after their presidencies. The Northwestern political-science professor Daniel J. Galvin writes in his 2010 book, “Presidential Party Building,” that since John F. Kennedy, each of them “neglected, exploited or undercut his party’s organizational capacities.” Galvin found that this maltreatment was because such presidents had operated with “deep and durable majorities” in Congress. After the Democrats lost theirs in 1994, President Bill Clinton awakened to the virtues of party-building. Galvin predicted that Obama would most likely have sufficient reason to do the same.

Instead, Obama was every bit as indifferent as his predecessors. After he took office, his campaign’s formidable grass-roots organization, rechristened Organizing for America, became what some party leaders complained was a “shadow organization” that drained resources from the D.N.C. while championing the president rather than the Democratic Party as a whole. The president did not have anywhere near the kind of close relationship with the last D.N.C. chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, that George W. Bush had with the Republican National Committee chairmen Ed Gillespie and Ken Mehlman.

In 2012, Obama’s campaign chose not to contribute any money to the D.S.C.C. during that cycle — and then, emerging from its victory that year with a $20 million debt, the campaign promptly offloaded it onto the D.N.C. In early 2014, Obama assured Senate Democrats that keeping the Senate majority was his “No. 1 priority.” Months passed without any further action. Finally, two months before the midterms, Obama informed Harry Reid by phone that he was authorizing a $5 million transfer of D.N.C. funds to Senate election efforts. Reid tersely replied, “It shouldn’t have been this hard.”

Few of the Obama campaigns’ innovations have meaningfully outlasted his presidency. Their once-pioneering digital-organizing operation, for example, went largely to ground in 2016, while the party failed to fully grasp even the basics, like the usefulness of digital advertising. “What I can tell you,” says Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who oversaw an analysis of the party’s shortcomings in the last election cycle, “is that our candidates and their staff told us that the Republicans did much better digitally than we did. And they spent more than us on digital.” (Teddy Goff, Obama’s former digital director, says: “I sincerely wish the technology built in the two Obama campaigns had been put to better use for 2016 and races down the ballot.”)

State Democratic Party leaders complain about O.F.A. — rebranded again recently as Organizing for Action — hoarding campaign resources to little end. And Priorities USA, the extravagantly funded super PAC that was started to support Obama’s 2012 campaign, never built the kind of entrenched ground-level presence maintained by its analogues on the right. In contrast, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative network financed by David and Charles Koch, spent the Obama years establishing a network of more than three million activists in 36 states and mobilizing them to protest against Obamacare, environmental regulations and tax increases — becoming what the group’s president, Tim Phillips, described to me as “a state-based long-game organization that would always be there.” The current chairman of Priorities USA, Guy Cecil, acknowledges the disparity: “Most of our activities, most of our structures, are built around individual fights, or individual candidates, or individual organizations, and I think that’s put us at a disadvantage.”

Organizational and technological lapses do not fully account for the Democratic Party’s travails. “All that stuff is like the field-goal team,” the Obama strategist David Axelrod told me. “None of it will help you if you haven’t already moved 80 yards down the field. Being technologically proficient wouldn’t have saved Obama if he didn’t also have a consistent, compelling message.”

But that message had grown threadbare by 2016. No longer was it sufficient to campaign on hope and change, or even on the president’s successful efforts in 2009 to stave off a deep recession. The uneven economic recovery raised questions about the party’s obliviousness to the impunity of Wall Street and the gap between the megawealthy and everyone else. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York congressman who was an author of “A Better Deal,” admits, “We developed a blind spot for the economic challenges that still remained unmet.”

By the end of Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party had lost nearly a thousand seats in state legislatures across America. It had forfeited its majority in both the House and the Senate. A mere 16 of the nation’s 50 governors were Democrats — and that number dwindled to 15 in August, when Jim Justice of West Virginia announced with a grinning Donald Trump at his side that he, too, had decided to become a Republican.

A few days after the election, Ian Russell quit his job as the deputy executive director of the D.C.C.C. and cashed in his frequent-flier miles on a trip to Ireland. He watched Trump’s swearing-in on his phone in a Dublin pub over a pint of Guinness, and then a few more. The following morning, he threw his bags in a rental car and began a sort of weeklong post-traumatic odyssey, rambling westward to the coast.

Russell, now 33, had spent the past six years at the D.C.C.C. trying to help the Democrats regain the House majority that they lost to the Republicans in the 2010 midterm election. During every election cycle, political journalists and donors would file into one of the drab conference rooms inside the D.N.C. headquarters near the Capitol and watch as D.C.C.C. officials like Russell unveiled maps and polling data in support of the claim that this election cycle — unlike the last one — was going to break for the Democrats. Each time, Russell maybe half-believed it.

But election night left him reeling. It wasn’t just that Trump had upset Clinton — including in Russell’s home state, Michigan — or that the Democrats emerged 24 seats short of a House majority. What gnawed at him was a fear that Trump might actually win over Democratic voters more lastingly. Benton Harbor, a few miles down the road from Russell’s hometown in the western part of the state, lost its last Whirlpool manufacturing facility years ago. The childhood friends of his who remained in the area had renounced the Democrats and were now Trump voters. “Trump could transform American politics,” he remembers thinking at the time. “He could truly scramble things.”

But Russell’s fears of a unifying, postpartisan pragmatist in chief swiftly proved unjustified. Rather than focusing on jobs and infrastructure projects, Trump immediately set in motion an attempt to repeal Obamacare and ordered a travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, which was met with demonstrations at airports across the country. On Jan. 30, the nonpartisan Hill analyst Stuart Rothenberg published a column headlined “Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018.” Rothenberg reasoned that overly aggressive new presidents tended to be judged harshly by the electorate in the middle of their first term. “The House map favors Republicans, but the midterm dynamic could well prove more powerful,” he wrote, listing 20 Republican seats — out of 24 the Democrats would need to flip the House — that, if typical midterm election patterns held, would most likely be imperiled. “Nothing is yet guaranteed, but don’t be surprised if the House is up for grabs in the fall of 2018.”

Late on his last evening in Ireland, Russell was drinking a final Guinness and listening to a passable folk band at the Palace Bar in Dublin while halfheartedly scrolling through the news back home on his phone when he came across Rothenberg’s column. He read through to the end with an accelerating heartbeat. It seemed big news to him that Rothenberg, a dispassionate prognosticator, had confidently issued such a prediction just 10 days into Trump’s presidency.

Back in Washington, Russell joined a relatively new political media consulting firm, Beacon Media, and started hunting for prospective 2018 House candidates. In early March, he traveled to California’s Orange County — historically a G.O.P. stronghold, though its wealthy population included growing numbers of Asian-Americans who tended to vote Democratic. In Irvine he met with Dave Min, a wry 41-year-old law professor who had worked on the Hill as a senior policy adviser to Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Min, the father of three young children, had never considered running for political office before. But he was also a son of Korean immigrants and was appalled by the Trump administration’s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States. The incumbent congresswoman of California’s 45th District, Mimi Walters, was a little-known two-term Republican who had never faced serious opposition. She had won by nearly 18 points in 2016, but Clinton beat Trump in the district by more than five points. A strong anti-Trump sentiment in 2018 could work to Min’s benefit. In April, he told Russell that he was in.

Russell then traveled to the Illinois suburbs just west of Chicago. Like California’s 45th District, the Sixth District of Illinois had been reliably Republican for decades. But Clinton beat Trump there by seven points, and already its six-term congressman, Peter Roskam, was avoiding public appearances lest he be called upon to answer for the president. The progressive women’s group Emily’s List had referred Russell to Kelly Mazeski, a longtime public servant on local boards and commissions who had already decided to challenge Roskam. Mazeski was a breast-cancer survivor whose platform, she told me recently, was “health care, health care, health care.” Russell helped Mazeski time her announcement for May 4, the day Roskam and his fellow House Republicans voted for a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Scores of candidates were announcing their intentions in terrain recently considered inhospitable to Democrats: West Virginia, Texas, Kansas. Some aspirants Russell met lacked the talent to match their enthusiasm. Others were hot property and elected to go with one of Beacon Media’s competitors. But by Labor Day, Russell and his firm had picked up 10 Democratic challengers. Among them were a few beguiling dark horses, like a 46-year-old physician and former Y.M.C.A. national health officer from Portage, Mich., named Matt Longjohn. Undeterred by his lack of political experience, Longjohn was challenging Fred Upton, a Republican who had represented Michigan’s Sixth District for three decades.

Russell himself grew up in the Sixth District and cast his first ballot as a registered voter against Upton in 2002. Back then, the incumbent seemed invincible. But now, after leading the committee that wrote the legislation seeking to eviscerate Obamacare, Upton was avoiding town halls and any other public events.

Still, when I met Russell recently, his optimism was tempered by previous electoral disappointments. The Democratic Party now has more candidates than it can support, and next spring is likely to be a season of what national Democratic officials tactfully refer to as “messy primaries.” And even with Trump as a foil, Russell’s candidates were struggling to make a case for themselves. “Right now it’s such a target-rich environment for us,” he told me. But “we’re having trouble explaining why we’re the heroes and the Republicans are the villains. At some point, our narrative will have to become more coherent than it is now.”

In pursuit of the 24 seats Democrats need to win the House, the D.C.C.C. intends to target 80 Republican-held districts — a dozen more than the party went after in its 2006 bonanza year, when it captured a majority after gaining 31 seats. Many of next year’s seem to be fanciful propositions, or strategic plays designed to force the G.O.P. to spend resources where it would rather not. In other cases, the D.C.C.C. is counting districts held by controversial Republicans — Chris Collins of New York, with his aggressive advocacy of a biotech firm in which he held substantial investments; Duncan D. Hunter of California, with the possibility of a federal indictment for supposed campaign fund malfeasances hanging over his head — who nonetheless appear safe, at least for the moment. But four Republican representatives in potential swing districts — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dave Reichert, Charlie Dent and Pat Tiberi — have already announced their retirement in advance of 2018, and more are expected to follow before the end of the year.

Only two times in the last century (during the Great Depression and after the Sept. 11 attacks) has a president’s party not suffered electoral losses midway into his first term. Those losses — an average of 32 House seats in each such midterm since 1862 — increase to 36 when the president’s approval rating is under 50. President Trump’s polling average has never once exceeded a favorability rating of 48 percent, and it now hovers at about 37 percent.

“I think the best thing the Democrats can do,” Zac Petkanas, formerly the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign, told me, “is find as many people with a pulse, with a D next to their names, in as many districts as possible, and run on Obamacare and standing up to Trump.” But so much of the politics, and political mood, of Trump’s presidency is off the map of previous experience that other Democrats have seemed at times at a loss for how to respond. What to make of the late August NBC poll, for instance, that showed Democrats being viewed unfavorably by 54 percent of those surveyed, which was better than Republicans (61) and Trump (61), but also Pelosi (64)? Was that good news or bad news? And what about the D.C.C.C. focus groups and polls yielding the conclusion that voters broadly dislike Trump but are also put off by candidates who profess to be “standing up to Trump,” on the grounds that such resistance will only guarantee more dysfunction in Washington?

Republicans are hopeful that, Trump being the exception to almost every political rule, the historical trends of wave elections will also not apply to him. “Clinton came up against a wave in 1994 because he had campaigned as a centrist but then led with gays in the military and Hillarycare,” Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, told me. “The 2006 election was a wave because Republicans were defending the Iraq war and crippled by a late-breaking ethics scandal. Democrats faced a wave in 2010 because of Obamacare. So it’s been issues that have driven wave elections. This time around, I think it’s more a personal antagonism to Trump. And the question is, how critical will that be in shaping the attitudes of swing voters?”

But by Rove’s own analysis, two of the last three wave elections were triggered by health care policies that did not approach the deep unpopularity of the G.O.P.’s attempts this year to repeal or otherwise roll back Obamacare. And Trump’s base cannot be counted on to prevent a wave in 2018, because a key constituency — less-educated white voters — is a group that tends not to show up during midterms. They may have even less motivation to do so next year, considering Trump’s periodic denunciations of the Republican lawmakers who will need their votes.

But in four special elections to fill seats vacated by House Republican incumbents this year, the Democrats fell short — and in the case of Georgia’s Jon Ossoff, lost by four points even after raising an unheard-of $23 million. His was the most expensive House race ever, and the fact that Democratic donors spent so heavily on a loss may help explain why the party’s fund-raising has diminished since then. The Democrats’ base — young and nonwhite voters — is no better than Trump’s at showing up for midterm elections and is unhelpfully clustered in urban districts. Many suburban and rural districts were artfully gerrymandered by Republican state legislators after the 2010 census and have proved impenetrable since then; they aren’t likely to change hands without a healthy number of recent Republican voters being persuaded to vote Democratic.

There is also a less quantifiable problem, the one that vexed Pelosi’s team in the months after the election: the Democratic Party’s chronic difficulty explaining just what it stands for. “There’s a deep worldview among conservative intellectuals that moved its way through a fear of fascism in the 1940s, through think tanks and campaigns and the California tax revolt of the 1970s,” Felicia Wong, president of the progressive Roosevelt Institute, says. “And basically the Democrats don’t have that. The New Deal was one thing, and the Great Society was another thing. The party never fully recognized that Jim Crow and segregation were economic decisions. That left Democrats with an incoherent economic argument. The result is that they lack a historical vocabulary.”

Questions about the interplay of race and economics, of course, aren’t just historical after the 2016 election — as much as politicians and operatives might want them to be. Plenty of progressives hold the view, as the MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid has argued on Twitter, that white working-class voters “resent the changes that racial and religious multiculturalism have brought to societies where people like them have been the majority.” But a former colleague of Reid’s at MSNBC, Krystal Ball, now president of the People’s House Project — which seeks to elect Democratic congressional candidates in G.O.P. districts — insists that the primary motivation of these voters is economic. “People who are holding onto their livelihoods by their fingernails thought that at least Trump gave a crap,” she says. “Maybe it was a pack of lies he was selling them, but at least he didn’t hold them in contempt. And frankly there’s a lot of contempt from certain corners of our party. And a billion dollars’ worth of ads saying we’re not elitists won’t change that.”

Early on the morning of July 27, a group of House Democrats held a private gathering in the Capitol basement with a special guest: Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff, who over a decade ago, when he was an Illinois congressman, served as chairman of the D.C.C.C. Looking ahead to 2018, Emanuel offered a broad-brushstroke plan of attack: “Find the specific issues that resonate in your district,” he said, according to one meeting participant’s notes. “We want to appeal to Trump voters who are already pulling away from him.” In particular, “Suburbs are our best opportunities.” On the matter of ideological purity, he was blunt: “It’s not a question of left versus center — it’s forward versus backward.”

If this advice sounded familiar, it was because Emanuel advocated the same strategy a dozen years earlier, when he was trying to lift his party out of the trough it had occupied since the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of the House by the Republicans in 1994. Emanuel focused on recruiting more centrist candidates who were well liked in their districts rather than on ideological darlings of the national party. “The people who criticized me back in 2006 were from my own party,” he told me recently. “When I was recruiting candidates, I’d get yelled at: ‘Why is he getting all these sheriffs and military guys?’ It’s because they were running in red districts!”

The election cemented Emanuel’s legend as a tactician — none of the Democrats attending the July 27 meeting expressed skepticism about his advice — but his strategy has never sat well with the party’s progressive activists. “I would just point to the fact that Rahm Emanuel’s Democrats who won in 2006 couldn’t hold those seats,” Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (P.C.C.C.), which supports, trains and funds candidates, told me.

She was referring to the nearly a dozen Democrats who rode the 2006 wave into Congress, only to wash back out of it with the Tea Party wave four years later. (Three more had lost in 2008.) “I would suggest a counterfactual,” she went on: “If we had true economic populist champions who made the case to the American people about fighting for a strong economic agenda, we might have had more lasting success.” Or as the P.C.C.C.’s other founder, Adam Green, put it to me: “If there’s a Democratic wave in 2018, progressives won’t just ride that wave — we will cause that wave.”

Of course, activists like Green and Taylor also vowed to be the tip of the party’s spear in the previous cycle, with not much to show for it. Indeed, the Breitbart chairman and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon scornfully likens the Democrats’ ideological tussles to a “pillow fight,” further charging that progressives will never accomplish their goals “until they have a Breitbart on the left,” he told me. “Our stock in trade is going after the Republican establishment. There’s no one like that on the other side.”

Most if not all Democrats are more than happy to watch Bannon’s kamikaze antics wreak havoc on the opposition. Still, some in the party rue the lack of pugnacity on their own side. “There are two types of Democrats,” David Krone, Harry Reid’s former chief of staff, told me one afternoon this summer in the Midtown Manhattan office where he now works as a consultant for an investment firm. “There are killers, and there are whiners. Unfortunately, we have too many of the latter and not enough of the former.”

Krone considers piety an obstacle to progressive policies. “Democrats are not that pure,” he told me, with a biting smile. “All those guys have a transactional component to them.” Under Reid’s leadership, the Democrats managed to pass important legislation like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act while also thwarting a stream of conservative bills generated by the Republican-controlled House. But it was also Reid who held his colleagues to the deal that garnered the pharmaceutical industry’s support for Obamacare by agreeing to take Medicare drug prices off the table. When the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for outside-group contributions, Reid did not join the chorus of bemoaners. Instead, he ordered up a super PAC, called the Senate Majority PAC, to help keep the Senate in Democratic hands during the 2010 and 2012 cycles. “Reid just never pretended to be something he wasn’t,” Krone said. “You don’t want to pass health care? Fine. Don’t make deals. Keep losing.”

In the Democratic Killers Hall of Fame, Krone places Emanuel and Pelosi. But lately, Krone observed, the party seemed to be tilting toward the whiners — beginning with the excuses offered for Hillary Clinton’s defeat. “It’s insane,” he said. “They freaking lost! They can blame anyone they want to, but they fail to look in the mirror.”

The 2018 cycle, Krone argued, was no time for squeamishness. Again he cited the example of his former boss Reid, who, like many Democrats in 2010, was a heavy underdog going into his final Senate race. Rather than be cowed by a Republican field that, at the peak of the Tea Party movement, had been infiltrated by the party’s fringe, Reid turned that to his advantage. His campaign waded into the Republican primary, targeting the most formidable G.O.P. opponents one by one until the only one left standing was Sharron Angle: a Tea Party favorite who once crusaded against water fluoridation and claimed multiple American cities were under the rule of Shariah law. Reid beat her easily.

By way of contrast, Krone pointed to Russ Feingold, the Wisconsin senator who, with John McCain, was a standard-bearer for campaign-finance reform, as well as a crusader for civil liberties during the Bush years. Feingold lacked Reid’s appetite for the jugular, losing to Ron Johnson in 2010 and then again in 2016. “He had his foot on Johnson’s neck, and then he let up, because he was up in the polls,” Krone lamented. “They don’t hand out participation trophies in politics.” If the party limited itself to high-minded campaigning and legislating, “We’ll lose again, and Kennedy” — the Supreme Court justice — “will retire, and Trump will get to appoint another conservative crazy, and the Democrats will wonder how things got to be so horrible.”

Still, the party faces a conundrum in its pursuit of Trump voters whose anxieties aren’t just economic but cultural as well. Prevailing in some red districts may require, at minimum, tempering the party’s progressivism on social issues. “When anybody talks about a so-called litmus test for candidates, that upsets me,” Representative Cheri Bustos told me. “I’m from Illinois, where I’m the only downstate Democrat in our entire delegation. I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, and my core values are very much in line with what hard-core Democrats believe. I don’t ever lie about my views. However, I also don’t talk about issues that are by their very nature divisive. If asked, I’ll answer I’m pro-choice. But then I’ll get back to the economy.”

But a week after Bustos and I spoke, the D.C.C.C.’s chairman, Ben Ray Luján, enraged liberal groups by saying that his organization would not oppose House candidates in favor of restricting abortion. Seeking to douse the fire, Meredith Kelly, the D.C.C.C. communications director, released a statement clarifying that the D.C.C.C. listed abortion rights as among the “fundamental tenets of the Democratic Party” and that the recruits it was backing “represent the values of the party.”

Adam Green of the P.C.C.C. was adamant on the prospect of anti-abortion recruits: “We wouldn’t welcome candidates who are pushing anti-choice policies into the big tent any more than we would welcome racists and people who want to deregulate Wall Street.” Green wasn’t buying the implication by Bustos and other moderates that the Democratic Party will regain a majority only if it backs away from progressive ideals. He urged me to talk to Rick Nolan, a progressive rural Minnesota congressman who, he said, “wins the right way.”

Nolan is a folksy 73-year-old journeyman politician and businessman who has long advocated a single-payer health system. He also hunts, fishes, makes his own maple syrup and in other ways stays attuned to the culture of Minnesota’s Eighth District. Taking Green’s advice, I asked Nolan whether he would welcome an anti-abortion candidate into the Democratic caucus. “Wholeheartedly,” he said. “If there’s a fault today among Democrats, it’s that they’ve got the worst litmus test known to humankind. If we want to achieve the goals progressives want, we’ve got to get back into the majority. Democrats are damned fools if they don’t see that.”

There was one thing on which the Democrats I interviewed, across the spectrum — Adam Green, David Krone, Krystal Ball, Meredith Kelly — agreed: that I should watch a YouTube ad that was posted in June on behalf of a 52-year-old Wisconsin ironworker named Randy Bryce. Bryce, whose prodigious mustache has earned him the nickname Ironstache, is aiming to unseat the current officeholder of Wisconsin’s First District, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House. The emotionally charged ad announcing his campaign culminates in a challenge: “Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C.”

One rainy late summer afternoon, I met up with the ad’s creator, a 42-year-old Army veteran named Bill Hyers, in a Washington hotel bar overcrowded with well-dressed young professionals. Hyers was sipping an old-fashioned when I arrived. He was dressed in a T-shirt and khaki shorts, his preferred business attire. Hyers has successfully managed the campaigns of well-established Democratic politicians like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and his own politics are straightforwardly liberal. At the same time, he harbors a Holden Caulfield-esque disdain of insincerity and believes that this quality, more than whining or ideological perfectionism, explains his party’s state of decline.

“What’s terrible about Democrats like Rahm Emanuel,” Hyers said, “is that it matters more to them if you’re a candidate who can raise money from very wealthy people than if you have an argument to make. They look at everything through the old Clinton triangulation strategy. Put out very carefully prepared statements. Don’t let anyone get to your right. Deny and ignore. Never have an honest dialogue. It was a bad strategy back in the ’90s. But it’s even worse today, because we can now have 24-7 access to candidates, and people can see when they’re not being authentic. Everything Hillary Clinton did was carefully scripted — they could see that.”

Hyers’s client Bryce has been the undisputed breakout star of the 2018 cycle so far; the announcement ad has attracted millions of views. (Such enthusiasm, it should be said, does not yet make Bryce any less of a long shot: The D.C.C.C. does not currently include Wisconsin’s First District among its 80 targeted seats.) The afternoon we met, Hyers showed me a rough cut of an ad for his newest client, a former Army champion boxer and ex-opioid addict from Staten Island named Boyd Melson — known in the ring as the Rainmaker — who is running for New York’s 11th District. Melson’s YouTube rollout, like Bryce’s, is replete with stirring proletarian imagery: neighborhoods festooned with American flags, an aloof Republican incumbent dodging town halls, Melson alone in the ring pummeling the air with slow-motion jabs. It suggests a trailer for “Rocky Goes to Washington.”

“I can only take a little credit for them,” Hyers admitted after the two-and-a-half-minute ad came to an end. Bryce’s and Melson’s ads, he told me, had a co-producer: Matt McLaughlin, a veteran of TV advertising who “didn’t know campaigns and politics, but he knows art.” Hyers did not think the party’s need for “authentic candidates” and a little theatrical verve were incompatible. If anything, the role the confluence of those two perceived assets played in Trump’s victory is one of the few inarguable lessons of the 2016 election.

This lesson, however unacknowledged, is playing out across the 2018 electoral landscape. In Kentucky, a former Marine fighter pilot named Amy McGrath appears in a bomber jacket, declaring that her “new mission” is to “take on a Congress full of career politicians.” Assessing her candidacy’s apparent long odds, she says, with a cockeyed grin, “We’ll see about that.” Another web ad shows a dashing scientist in a white lab coat: Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher now running to represent California’s 48th District and billing himself as the very definition of a “problem solver.”

In mid-August, I spoke to Ian Russell’s latest client, a telegenic Marine veteran and two-term state representative from Lewiston, Me., named Jared Golden. Lewiston today is a hollowed-out exoskeleton of a textile mill town. “Our way of life is under attack here,” Golden said. “We’re a classic case of the America that’s being left behind. The social-identity issues that have been emphasized in Portland don’t resonate in rural Maine. It’s damaged the Democratic brand here, to be honest. We’re a community of hard-working people who may not be highly educated, but that doesn’t mean we’re not intelligent. The majority of the folks here voted for Donald Trump, and I can tell you that the description of them as a basket of deplorables is just dead wrong.”

Golden told me that his neighbors had until recently thought of themselves as Democrats. Golden himself still is. When we spoke, he had just decided to run in Maine’s Second District against the Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin. Golden would be the fifth Democrat to enter the race. He seemed to have little use for the national party’s “A Better Deal” pitch, telling me, “It’s going to take more than a glossy new policy document to take back the U.S. House.”

What, then, would it take? A few days after I spoke with Golden, Ian Russell traveled to Lewiston and shot his candidate’s announcement ad. It mixes twilit images of small-town Maine with footage of the candidate in combat fatigues; later, he jogs down a country road wearing a T-shirt that says, “Pain Is Weakness Leaving the Body.” The ad excoriates the Republican incumbent but also bipartisan trade deals and unnamed political leaders who push “issues that don’t impact your life.”

The word “Trump” is not mentioned in the two-minute ad. Nor is the word “Democrat.”",A Post-Obama Democratic Party in Search of Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/magazine/a-post-obama-democratic-party-in-search-of-itself.html

The staff changed its technique, re-vasectomized about 75 chimps with the new method, and hasn’t had a pregnancy since.

The sanctuary also has learned to care for frail chimps. Many animals from labs have been infected with H.I.V. and hepatitis for vaccine experiments, and some have diabetes (not related to experiments).

They are often old: Some arrive near 50 years of age, and the lifespan of chimps in captivity runs from 50 to 60 years. Occasionally chimps are deemed too old even to handle the stress of being sent to the sanctuary.

The sanctuaries hope eventually to put themselves out of business. If all goes as planned, in another 50 years or so, there will be no more lab retirees.

Chimps will still be in zoos and, as the laws now stand, private owners could still breed them. But since the demand for their use in research is now zero, that is unlikely to happen on a large scale.

Most privately owned laboratory chimpanzees are also headed for retirement centers. New Iberia has shipped 22 animals to Project Chimps, where Bo and his cohort now live, but still has nearly 200.

The Project Chimps facility, which formerly housed gorillas, is still being renovated for chimps. They will get to play in eight acres of walled-in open space, with trees, a stream and an open meadow — once the walls are fixed. (Unlike gorillas, chimps are agile climbers.)

Those left at New Iberia aren’t isolated. They live in groups in large, dome-shaped outdoor cages. The domes have a bit less than a 1,000 square feet of floor space.

Although chimps in research were once housed in smaller cages, and in isolation for experiments, practices have changed; labs and sanctuaries have recognized that it is cruel to house chimps alone.

The only other private chimps still at research institutions include 46 owned by the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, and one at the University of Georgia. Yerkes is looking for retirement facilities for its chimps and has sent seven to the Chattanooga Zoo.

Yerkes also sent eight chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo in England, prompting an outcry from animal welfare advocates in this country and in Europe. The move prompted a lawsuit, because the Fish and Wildlife Service approved it even though advocates insisted there were better options in the United States.

Yerkes said that the English zoo was well equipped and enlisted comment from Dr. Goodall, who said she had visited the facility and supported the move.",Lab Chimps Are Moving to Sanctuaries — Slowly,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/science/chimps-sanctuaries-research.html

WASHINGTON — A former Trump campaign adviser told Congress he had a private conversation with a Russian deputy prime minister during the 2016 presidential campaign and that at least two members of the president’s team were aware, providing more details to what is publicly known about Moscow’s access to President Trump’s circle, according to a congressional transcript released late Monday.

“I’ll send you guys a readout soon regarding some incredible insights and outreach I’ve received from a few Russian legislators and senior members of the Presidential administration here,” the former adviser, Carter Page, wrote in a July 8, 2016, email to campaign staff members after he spoke with Arkady Dvorkovich, the deputy prime minister.

The New York Times first reported the fact that Mr. Page notified campaign officials about his meetings in Moscow, but the transcript, which is over 200 pages long, discloses the names of those advisers — Tera Dahl and J.D. Gordon — and the identity of the Russian official, Mr. Dvorkovich. Mr. Page’s testimony also revealed that more campaign staff members were aware of his July 2016 trip to Russia than had previously been disclosed, including Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general.

Mr. Page’s eight-hour testimony, under oath, to the members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, came the same week as the first charges were announced in the special counsel’s investigation into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russian officials.

China plans to return the favor when Mr. Trump arrives Wednesday for what the Chinese Foreign Ministry says is his first visit to Beijing. The Chinese are calling it “a state visit-plus,” promising grand pageantry in the Great Hall of the People and the ancient roofed pavilions of the Forbidden City.

The welcome is planned to make Mr. Trump feel important, reflecting the belief of at least some Chinese officials that they know just how to handle an outspoken tycoon with a big ego.

But the pomp will also be a chance for Mr. Xi to showcase his “China Dream” — a vision of his nation joining or perhaps supplanting the United States as a superpower leading the world.

Mr. Xi is expected to propose some version of what he has called a “new type of great power relations,” the idea that China and the United States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical pattern of conflict between rising and established powers.

The concept is closely associated with Mr. Xi, who has been pitching it since he was vice president. But the Obama administration viewed it as code for allowing China to establish a sphere of influence in Asia, with the United States withdrawing to minimize conflict.

The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told state news media last week he hoped Mr. Trump’s visit would revive the idea and allow the two nations to build a “constructive partnership.” The vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, said the two leaders would discuss a “blueprint” for developing relations.

Chinese analysts believe the timing works to Mr. Xi’s advantage. Mr. Trump will be arriving as he faces new questions about the Russia investigation at home and criticism abroad for appearing to abandon American leadership on issues from climate change to trade liberalization.

In contrast, Mr. Xi has been basking in the aftermath of a party congress last month that elevated him to the same status as the nation’s founding father, Mao Zedong.

Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Xi has positioned China as a stable alternative to the United States, willing to take on the obligations of global leadership and invest in big infrastructure projects across Asia and Europe much as the United States did after World War II.

“China, for the first time, is not in a humble position regarding the United States,” said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Usually the American president has the advantage. This is the first time there is an equal relationship between the two leaders.”

Mr. Xi is now the unquestioned paramount leader of China, Professor Yan added, while Mr. Trump only “represents himself.”

Asked on Sunday about the disparity, Mr. Trump denied being at a disadvantage, citing stock market gains and low unemployment in the United States. “We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we’ve ever had, and he knows that and he respects that,” Mr. Trump said of the Chinese president. “We’re going in with tremendous strength.”

Mr. Xi may also be counting on personal chemistry between the two men. They appeared to bond when they first met at Mr. Trump’s Florida estate in April, and Mr. Trump has since called Mr. Xi numerous times, often to ask him to get tougher on North Korea.

In interviews, Mr. Trump has frequently praised Mr. Xi and described him as a friend, often in effusive terms unusual for an American president speaking of the leader of China’s authoritarian, one-party state. At times, Mr. Trump has even repeated points made by Mr. Xi in their conversations.

Still, Chinese officials, known for their attention to detail and protocol when hosting foreign dignitaries, appear to be somewhat on edge over what Mr. Trump might say, and how he might say it, during the visit.

Twitter is blocked in China, but it is generally accessible on foreign cellphones. “How President Trump communicates with the outside — this is not something you need to worry about,” said Mr. Zheng, the vice minister, when asked if the American president would be able to use his favorite social media platform.

Beijing’s anxieties about the visit are due at least in part to uncertainty about the Trump administration’s view of China.

Mr. Trump’s call to build a “free and open Indo-Pacific” emphasizing Australia, India and Japan echoes the view of the national security establishment in Washington that China’s growing clout in Asia must be managed or even contained.

But Mr. Trump has also embraced those who say the United States must take a much tougher position on trade with China, including Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. They say that Beijing is exploiting America’s openness while keeping its own markets closed, and Washington must insist on reciprocity even at the risk of a trade war.

This clashes with a third view in the administration, often associated with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that considers China an inseparable economic partner and business opportunity for the United States.

Mr. Kushner served as go-between in arranging the president’s first meeting with Mr. Xi but has taken a lower profile since then, in part, officials have said, because of concerns about his efforts to bring Chinese investors into his family’s real estate ventures.

John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, tilted the White House away from criticism of Beijing in an interview on Fox News last week, saying China had beaten the United States on trade but “that doesn’t make them an enemy.”

He also said that China has “a system of government that has apparently worked for the Chinese people.”

The remarks drew heckles from many in Washington who cited China’s human rights record but praise from the Chinese news media as reflecting the more equal relationship that Mr. Xi seeks.

Mr. Trump’s top concern is expected to be North Korea and its nuclear arsenal, and many analysts believe Mr. Xi will use the potential for greater Chinese pressure on North Korea to draw Mr. Trump closer to embracing a “great power” relationship.

“As Trump needs Xi’s help with the North Korean challenge and as he is not a traditional realist, he may agree, to the chagrin of his advisers,” said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.

Accepting China as a partner has been a fraught proposition for Mr. Trump’s predecessors. When former President Bill Clinton agreed to work toward “ a constructive strategic partnership in the 21st century,” he was criticized for cozying up to China just a few years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.

Two decades later, human rights in China remains a potential point of friction, with some in the administration lobbying Mr. Trump to press Mr. Xi on the fate of Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died in July after eight years in prison.

Like the Obama administration in its latter years, though, Mr. Trump has not made a priority of such issues, even as Mr. Xi has conducted a sweeping crackdown on civil society.

Appleby, based in Bermuda, is one of the world’s largest offshore law firms. Its files offer a rare inside look at more than a dozen aircraft trusts structured by American financial institutions for privacy-seeking plane owners, primarily foreigners who otherwise would not be allowed to register with the F.A.A. There is a premium on American registration because it increases a plane’s resale value, the bureaucratic requirements are less costly and complex, and it is believed to draw less scrutiny as the aircraft moves around the world.

Among the plane owners seeking Appleby’s services were Shaher Abdulhak, a Yemeni businessman worth an estimated $9 billion whose investments included a Coca-Cola distributor in the Middle East; UPL, an Indian producer of industrial chemicals and pesticides; and Rashid Sardarov, a Russian oil billionaire and longtime client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose leaked records in 2015 became known as the Panama Papers.

In serving these clients, files show, Appleby dealt with the two banks that are the most prolific creators of American aircraft trusts: Wells Fargo and Bank of Utah. It is easy to see how Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and offices in 42 countries, might find a lucrative niche catering to the wealthy elite. Less obvious is how Bank of Utah, with 18 branches confined to one state, took the same path.

As it happens, a group of former Wells Fargo trust officers joined Bank of Utah about 10 years ago and created what would become a profitable part of the bank’s business. The bank collected $8.8 million in trust fees in 2016 — an increase of $1.1 million from the previous year, according to its most recent annual report.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Mr. Croasmun and Mr. Hansen took issue with the suggestion that they were exploiting a loophole to bypass restrictions on foreigners registering aircraft in the United States. By filling the role of “U.S. citizen” for registration purposes, the bank provided a valuable service for, say, multinational companies whose top executives might not be American, they said. The bank is clearly sensitive to concerns raised about the trusts. Its website carries a statement distancing itself from the planes it registers in its name, noting its only role is that of trustee.

In the case of Mr. Mikhelson, the trail leading from Russia to Utah began in September 2012, with an email to Appleby from the Moscow office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young. The firm wanted Appleby to set up a complex corporate structure for an unnamed client to purchase a Gulfstream jet, valued at roughly $65 million, and retain possession of it through a chain of companies in six countries.

From the outset, the goal was clear: “This structure,” wrote Svetlana Yakushina of Ernst & Young, “should allow registering the aircraft with the aviation authorities of the United States.”

How a Wealthy Foreigner Obtains U.S. Registration for a Private Jet The Russian oligarch Leonid Mikhelson wants to buy and register a private jet in the U.S., which requires American citizenship or residency. So a company he owns in Belize uses its company in the Cayman Islands, which uses its company in the British Virgin Islands to create a new company in Panama to buy the jet and record it in the Isle of Man for tax purposes, and to enter into a trusteeship with the Bank of Utah, which registers the jet in the U.S.

The arrangement would also permit the owner to avoid certain taxes, most notably a value-added tax of 20 percent if the jet were registered and used in the European Union. A six-page memo prepared by Ernst & Young laid out a plan to exploit a tax loophole offered by the Isle of Man, where about 1,000 privately owned aircraft are recorded on a government registry for tax purposes. Appleby and other similar firms maintain offices there.

The Isle of Man allows owners to escape the value-added tax, or VAT, through a paper-shuffling scheme, wherein the jet is held by a company based there but leased to another company elsewhere, both controlled by the same owner. The tax is technically deferred into the future, through use of a special account managed by Ernst & Young, and then canceled out by the corporate structure. Research by the investigative journalists consortium suggests that Isle of Man-registered aircraft have escaped more than $1 billion in taxes.

According to a flow chart created by Appleby’s Isle of Man office for the Mikhelson account, the ownership chain for his jet began in Panama, with a company called Golden Star Aviation, which registered on the Isle of Man and then leased the aircraft to a Cayman Islands company called SWGI Growth Fund. Both companies were controlled by Mr. Mikhelson.

Mr. Mikhelson declined to answer questions about his plane. His representative released a statement saying, “Mr. Mikhelson acts strictly within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with applicable legislation at all times.”

By June 2013, lawyers at Appleby still had not learned of Mr. Mikhelson’s role, other than being told that the Gulfstream’s owner was Russian. Once the lawyers were informed of his identity by a Swiss firm that manages Mr. Mikhelson’s finances, they conducted a background check and concluded that, as with other clients from Russia, where the political and legal environment can be unstable, working for him would be “high risk.” But they decided to proceed.

Sanctions and ‘Citizenship’

A due-diligence report by Appleby noted Mr. Mikhelson’s source of wealth — valued currently at about $18 billion — from oil and gas investments, notably through Novatek, Russia’s largest nongovernment-owned gas company. Mr. Mikhelson’s main business partner is Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Mr. Putin’s. The two businessmen are the primary investors in Sibur, a Russian gas-processing company.

Included in the report was a list of questions to determine if Mr. Mikhelson had any connections to the United States, including whether he had assets or maintained an address there. The answer to all of them was “no.” Flight records show that the plane has rarely, if ever, flown to the United States and instead makes trips within Russia or occasionally to cities in Europe and China.

Despite its lack of a connection to the United States, Mr. Mikhelson’s private jet was soon on its way to securing a registration with the F.A.A., thanks to Bank of Utah. It is not clear if the bank was ever told, or inquired, about the identity of the owner of the aircraft. Mr. Croasmun said that files indicated the owner “was Russian” but that identifying details were missing.

Whatever the case, the trust agreement for Mr. Mikhelson’s Gulfstream, filed with the F.A.A., does not name him in the document. Instead, the owner is listed as Golden Star Aviation, the Panamanian company he used to buy the plane.

For context, Smart — like South Carolina’s coach, Will Muschamp — is a former assistant to Alabama Coach Nick Saban. And for all of Saban’s defensive innovations, the great coach’s true hallmark is his extreme-Zen outlook, in which celebrating only gets in the way of further accomplishment. At his current rate of self-congratulation, Saban, 66, is on track to bask in the glory of the five national titles he has won (so far) around a decade after he retires.

And Smart is not wrong. Challenges remain for Georgia, not least Saturday’s trip to No. 10 Auburn (7-2). As always, Georgia finishes against Georgia Tech, whose option offense is overlooked at one’s peril. Then there is the Southeastern Conference title game, which will be either a rematch against Auburn or a heavyweight fight against — who else? — Alabama. The Crimson Tide are also 9-0 and are currently first in the A.P. poll, first in the coaches’ poll and (for now) second in the selection committee’s rankings.

“We really just stayed humble,” the Georgia sophomore J.R. Reed said of his team’s mind-set. “And we know that, hey, the playoffs really start right now, and we lose one, we’re out. But we don’t really focus on that.”

“I guarantee you,” added Reed, referring to the fact that Georgia was at that moment minutes away from clinching its first appearance in the SEC title game since 2012, “half the guys don’t even know that yet.”

The Bulldogs were helped Saturday not only by their effort between the hedges at Sanford Stadium, but also by Kentucky’s loss, which ensured Georgia’s spot in the SEC title game on Dec. 2. Alabama and Auburn won, making potential future Bulldogs wins against them more impressive in the committee’s eyes, and Notre Dame’s victory kept the luster on Georgia’s 20-19 victory over the Fighting Irish in September.

Finally, Ohio State and Penn State lost, damaging the Big Ten’s playoff hopes and holding out the possibility that — Reed’s analysis aside — Georgia might be able to absorb a loss and still make the four-team playoff.

That mouthful of scenarios, with far-flung games involving teams Georgia will not play having profound consequences on its season, illustrates the dizzying reality of college football today. Though there are roughly the same number of good football programs in 2017 as in 1980, these days it is much harder, or at least more complicated, to be crowned national champion when the season is done.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Here is how the Bulldogs captured the 1980 title. They won all their regular-season games. Then they played in the Sugar Bowl, because they were invited, and there they beat Notre Dame, which also was there because it was invited. The Irish were ranked No. 7 in the final A.P. poll, making them the only Georgia opponent that finished ranked. Georgia also was the country’s only undefeated team, and so when the Bulldogs won their bowl, they were voted No. 1. Ta-da! National champions.

Today, 12-0 against arbitrarily weak opposition will not cut it. Teams often line up strong intersectional competition to improve their playoff résumés. They play in a conference title game. Their win-loss record is considered in the context of their schedule strength. And then they must win two more games against teams who were selected not to please bowl officials, but because they were dispassionately judged to be the best of the best.

For whatever reason, in the postseason era — going back to the first Bowl Championship Series title game after the 1998 season — Georgia, the flagship team of one of the top states for recruiting, has been consistently great but never the best. Under Mark Richt from 2001 to 2015, for instance, Georgia finished ranked 11 times, and in the top 10 five times. But it never made the national postseason during a span in which SEC teams won nine titles.

So perhaps Smart’s myopic mind-set is, well, smart. Georgia has not yet done the things for which they hang your picture and speak of you a half-century hence.

Smart’s players showed all evidence after the game of buying into his vision, repeating his koans like “keep chopping” and “humility’s a week away,” and emphasizing that they were concerned exclusively with winning the next game.

In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday.
“We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you.","Even before the launching of the missile on Saturday, which was intercepted en route to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the crown prince had staged another surprise demonstration of the kingdom’s newly aggressive posture toward Iran and Lebanon. The prince hosted a visit from Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who stunned the region by announcing his resignation, via video from Riyadh, in protest against Iran’s undue influence in Lebanese politics.

Even some of Mr. Hariri’s rivals speculated that his Saudi sponsors had pressured him into the statement. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, said over the weekend that the Saudis had all but kidnapped Mr. Hariri. Mr. Nasrallah urged Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon for power-sharing talks “if he is allowed to come back.”

On Monday, Saudi Arabia released a photograph of Mr. Hariri meeting with King Salman that was widely seen as an effort to contradict the theory that the prime minister was effectively a hostage.

The Saudi claims that Iran had provided the missile could not be independently verified.

Mr. Jubair, the foreign minister, said the missile had been smuggled into Yemen in parts, assembled in Yemen by operatives from Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, and fired from Yemen by Hezbollah.

A statement from the Saudi Arabian news agency said “experts in military technology” had determined from the remains of that missile and one launched in July that both had come from Iran “for the purpose of attacking the kingdom.”

Citing allegations of Hezbollah’s role, Thamer al-Sabhan, minister of state for Persian Gulf affairs, said Monday that Saudi Arabia considered the missile attack an act of war by Lebanon as well.

“We will treat the government of Lebanon as a government declaring a war because of Hezbollah militias,” Mr. Sabhan told the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya network. “Lebanon is kidnapped by the militias of Hezbollah and behind it is Iran.”

The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran called the accusation of Iranian involvement in the missile attack “baseless.”

“These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim.

Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Saudi Arabia of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior & risky provocations,” in a statement on Twitter. Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.

American officials have previously accused Iran of arming its Yemeni allies, the Houthis. But it was unclear how Saudi experts would know how or why Iran provided the missiles.

With help from allies including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, Saudi Arabia has enforced a sea and air blockade around Yemen since it launched an attack on the Houthi forces there more than two years ago.

In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday. American officials tracking the situation said that as many as 500 people, including at least 11 princes, had been rounded up in a wave arrests directed by Prince Mohammed in the name of a crackdown on corruption.

Some are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges while others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Men were sleeping on mats on the floor of the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been transformed into a singularly luxurious prison to house the detainees.

The arrests cemented Prince Mohammed’s dominance over military, foreign, internal security, economic and social affairs inside the kingdom, freeing him to pursue an aggressive confrontation with Iran. That posture has been a hallmark of his rise over the two and a half years since his father, King Salman, 81, took the throne.

Prince Mohammed has sharply escalated a cold war with Iran, stepping up Saudi Arabia’s efforts to push back Iranian influence in the Syrian civil war, plunging the kingdom into a protracted military conflict against Iranian-allied forces in Yemen, and isolating neighboring Qatar in part for being too close to Iran.

His hawkish stance toward Iran also appears to have formed the basis for a close bond with President Trump, who visited Riyadh this year and maintained a conspicuous silence over the weekend about Prince Mohammed’s campaign of arrests. On Tuesday while traveling in Asia, he praised the arrests, saying the king and crown prince “know exactly what they are doing.”

Mr. Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently left Riyadh after his third visit this year. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner stayed up talking together until the small hours of the morning at a ranch in the desert, according to an American official briefed on the trip.

Mr. Kechichian, of the King Faisal Center, said the arrests and the confrontation with Iran represented the convergence of two long-term agendas for Prince Mohammed.

“Inside he has been able to put his men into positions of influence and he has pushed aside his rivals,” Mr. Kechichian said. “And ever since President Trump’s visit to Riyadh there has been a very consistent policy with the essential coordination of the United States, and Iran is in the bull’s-eye.”

Robert Jordan, a former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now practices law in the region, said Prince Mohammed’s aggression was “compounded somewhat by what people would call a green light from President Trump.”

Mr. Trump has encouraged Saudi Arabia and its allies “to be more forceful against Iran, and to take more charge of their own neighborhood, and they have taken that to heart,” Mr. Jordan said. “They know America will have their back.”

Saudi Arabia also said Monday that it would “temporarily” close Yemen’s land, sea and air ports of entry in response to the missile firing, in order to tighten inspections and stop any weapons shipments. It pledged to provide for “the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews.”

However, the United Nations said that two aid flights scheduled for Monday had not been allowed to depart for Yemen.

“We’re trying to see whether we can get our normal access restored,” Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said at a daily briefing. “We underscored to all parties the need for regular humanitarian access.”

The United Nations considers Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, one of the world’s biggest humanitarian emergencies. Roughly 17 million people — 60 percent of the population — need food assistance, and seven million are at risk of famine. Nearly 900,000 Yemenis have been sickened by cholera.

Saudi Arabia accompanied its accusations against Iran with the announcement that it would pay bounties of up to $30 million for information leading to the capture of 40 Houthi leaders in Yemen.

“We fear nothing,” one leader on the list, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, said in a defiant speech on Monday in the Yemeni capital, Sana.

He called the arrests ordered by Prince Mohammed “a coup leading to the throne” and invited any dissident Saudis to take refuge in Yemen. “We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you. None will endure injustice.”

Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said over the weekend that its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile. Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit Sana with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.

With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since.

While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the direct command of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say. But the Saudi intervention appears to have unintentionally brought the Houthis and Iranians closer together, Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, noted.

The Saudi claim about Iran’s responsibility for the missile attack was difficult to evaluate in part because of the long and complicated history of illicit weapons shipments to Yemen.

South Yemeni forces acquired Soviet missiles during their civil war with what was then North Yemen before it ended in 1994, and the subsequent national government of Yemen, whose institutions are now under the control of the Houthi faction, had said as long ago as 2002 that it had bought a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea.

State Department cables published by WikiLeaks indicate that Yemen had resumed buying North Korean missiles as recently as 2009. But the Houthi alliance with Iran makes it impossible to rule out the possibility that Tehran provided or procured the missiles, even if they were manufactured in North Korea.

Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.

Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.","Saudi Arabia Charges Iran With ‘Act of War,’ Raising Threat of Military Clash",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-iran-missile.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

“The market mix has also changed in the past five years,” he said. Demand for aftermarket car wheels is down, but sales of truck and sport-utility wheels are up 30 percent, he said.

At 72, John Nordquist, a real estate manager in Chicago, is always going for the right look. With five cars and trucks in his family, including a 1978 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1995 Chevy pickup, he buys wheels the way that some people buy sneakers.

Mr. Nordquist has 20 wheels on the road, plus spares, and at least another set of wheels and tires for each vehicle, usually going up in size for the replacements.

“When you’re over 70, it’s O.K. to look cool,” he said. “I want my cars to look just a little different than the run of the mill.”

Wheel aficionados — from classic car enthusiasts and dedicated racers to off-roaders — can choose from a dizzying array of looks and brands. And they don’t necessarily have to leave the showroom to do it. Most original equipment manufacturers, or O.E.M.s, offer customers upgraded wheel choices — larger rims, different colors, sexier designs — when they order the car.

“More often than not, buyers ask about the wheels on a new car,” said Peter Fearon, a sales consultant at Helms Brothers Mercedes-Benz in Queens.

Ordering upgraded wheels has broad appeal. “While men are interested in doing that, many women are as well,” Mr. Fearon said. A 2018 C Class sedan, for example, can be ordered with one of six optional wheel sets, ranging in size from 17 inches to 19 inches.

They can be a visible indicator of premium status when a new car rolls off the lot.

“Wheels are a key differentiator for AMG and play a major role in the purchase decisions of our customers,” said Melina Evangelisti, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz’s AMG performance division. AMG’s in-house engineers, like those at many carmakers, design the wheels for its vehicles and buy them from suppliers like OZ, Borbet and Enkei.

Aluminum alloys have replaced steel as the material of choice, making wheels lighter and reducing a vehicle’s unsprung weight — the mass of its suspension components. Less unsprung weight, particularly in the wheels, is better: A heavier wheel is harder to get going and harder to stop once it is.

“That impacts the efficiency as well as the performance of the car,” Mr. Edmonds said.

Dropping weight at the corners is crucial for racecars, and the quest to shave seconds off lap times has led engineers to use new materials, like forged magnesium and carbon fiber, which uses lightweight carbon fabric and special plastic resins to make feather-light wheels. Ford has developed carbon fiber wheels for its GT, and Porsche this summer introduced a set for its 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series that it claims are 20 percent stronger and lighter than normal forged alloys. The price in Europe for a set of four? Just under $18,000.

Mr. Donnelly may love wheels, but he’s not sold on carbon fiber, yet.

“Magnesium is proven for racing, for O.E.M. and the aftermarket, but carbon fiber doesn’t have enough history yet in the marketplace,” he said. “That will change rapidly. Resins will get better — they have a heat issue now — and the weave of the material will advance. And the price points will come down.”

Buyers have reason to be cautious. While federal and state safety standards can be exhaustive for cars and S.U.V.s, there are none that are enforced in the United States for wheels, Mr. Donnelly said.

“Germany and Japan have government regulations that require aftermarket wheels to meet certain quality standards and fit a vehicle correctly,” he said.

That can make picking replacement wheels a tricky affair.

“You have to start with the vehicle,” said Mr. Edmonds, the Tire Rack executive. “By doing that, you know what some of the technical specs have to be — not just the diameter and width, but also the bolt pattern, the offset, the load-carrying capacity of that wheel.”

And then there are practical considerations. “If you’re going to run those wheels in the winter, they need a finish that’s durable and will handle the salt and the chemicals on the road,” he said. “And the wheel needs to clear everything that’s behind it, like the brakes and the suspension components.”

The Tire Rack uses digital scanning equipment to create a three-dimensional model of the wheels it sells as well as the pieces behind them on specific vehicles.

“We can virtually fit the wheel on the car and ensure it will clear everything,” Mr. Edmonds said.

For drivers who consider their car little more than an appliance, any rim will do. But for some, a wheel purchase is simply an exercise in expression.

“You have the people who want the vehicle to reflect themselves,” said Rebecca Lindland, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “We women notice jewelry, earrings.

Ritz-Carlton Has Become a Gilded Cage for Saudi Royals

From the stately rows of palm trees on its 52-acre grounds to the grand double staircase to the glittering ballroom chandeliers, it is easy to see why the six-year-old Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, has played host to billionaires, heads of state and members of the Saudi royal family.

Which is why it is all the more jarring that former government ministers, prominent businessmen and members of the royal family — the House of Saud — are being held captive in the five-star hotel, which was swiftly converted over the weekend into what is almost certainly the world’s most luxurious prison.

In a shaky video that appears from its metadata to have been shot early Monday morning in the hotel’s Ballroom B , people can be seen lying on mats covered with brightly colored blankets in floral motifs while guards in dark uniforms are visible in the background. In a corner stands a rifle, which appears to be an American standard military-issue M4, its civilian variant or a copycat.

Saudi Arabia finds itself in the midst of a crackdown on corruption that began on Saturday night with the arrest of dozens of people, at least 11 of whom were princes, including the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal . By Monday, American officials tracking the situation said that has many as 500 people had been rounded up in the ongoing sweep.

The country’s attorney general, Sheikh Saud al-Mujeb, said on Monday that detainees had been subjected to detailed interrogations. He said the investigations were being conducted in secret to protect the integrity of the legal procedures and to ensure that the detainees’ high social status would not exempt them from justice.

Members of the royal family have been prohibited from leaving the country, sparking fear and concern. It was a striking turnabout for elites accustomed to lives of extreme privilege and the freedom to jet off to Paris, London or New York at the drop of a hat.

While the stated goal of the arrests was fighting corruption, some observers see the crackdown as part of the consolidation of power by the country’s young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman .

Less than two weeks earlier, powerhouses of global capital including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, were among the 3,500 invitees, estimated to control $22 trillion in assets, who streamed down the red carpet and into the hotel for the Future Investment Initiative , a conference that was nicknamed “Davos in the Desert.”

Back in May, the Riyadh Ritz was festooned with American flags as the palatial hotel played host to President Trump on his first trip abroad as commander in chief. His predecessor, President Barack Obama, stayed at the hotel in 2014.

Ballroom B, where the video footage appears to have been taken, is just shy of 20,000 square feet, and can be used as a banquet room seating 1,400 people or a reception accommodating 2,000 people.

As with most public spaces in the kingdom, the hotel does not permit shorts, skirts or tank tops. It asks that guests dress modestly, either in local attire, smart casual or formal wear.

The hotel’s website said on Monday: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, the hotel’s internet and telephone lines are currently disconnected until further notice.” A spokesman for the hotel did not immediately respond to a request on Monday night for a comment about the detained guests.

But many of those tools do not apply to today’s deals, as A.M.D.’s Chinese pact shows.

A.M.D.’s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.

The park represents Beijing’s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China’s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.

Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.

Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.

Photo

But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.

Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers. China already makes the world’s fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers. With A.M.D.’s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make China’s supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.

“We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,” an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.

Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.’s control was not involved in chip development.

Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips. Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.

“When they first announced the partnership I was shocked,” said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.

“You would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,” Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. “It should. It’s surprising it isn’t.”

New Rules for a New Era?

For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.

Called “Unrestricted Warfare,” the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.

Some American officials see in it a guide to China’s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.

“There’s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,” said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.

Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China’s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.

Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them. The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules. But the W.T.O. has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.

At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm’s business.

The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.

“Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,” said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce.

“If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,” he said, “the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China — selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.”",China’s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/made-in-china-technology-trade.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

With more than two billion users worldwide, Facebook relies on complaints to police its content. So, Mr. Elwood used Facebook’s internal complaint tool to report the Keven Eversley profile and 27 others showing evidence of deception. In all but a couple of cases, Facebook responded with a standard message of thanks for the feedback but said the profiles did not violate its community standards — even though those standards require users to give their “authentic identities.”

“The reporting process is frustrating,” Mr. Elwood said. “Facebook seems to be lagging way behind the problem.”

Facebook estimates that as many as 60 million accounts, 2 to 3 percent of the company’s 2.07 billion regular visitors, are fakes. Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, testified before Congress that about 5 percent of its 330 million users are “false accounts or spam,” which would add up to more than 16 million fakes.

“Spammers and bad actors are getting better at making themselves look more real,” Mr. Edgett said.

Independent experts say the real numbers are far higher.

On Twitter, little more than an email address is needed to start tweeting. Facebook’s requirement that users be their authentic selves means the company asks for a smattering of information to sign up — name, birthday, gender and email address. But few checks exist to verify that information.

“Part of the problem is that Facebook is a black box,” said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College. “They do what they do, and we don’t know to what degree their operations can even handle these issues — not to mention how handling them maps with their economic model.”

In fact, fighting too hard against deception may clash with the business models that have allowed the companies to thrive. Facebook, Google and Twitter all offer self-serve advertising systems allowing anyone in the world to buy, target and deliver ads for as much — or as little — money as they wish to spend. More scrutiny could hamper growth.

Facebook, for instance, reported record profits this week in its quarterly earnings even as executives testified about Russian exploitation of their services. Shares of the social network soared to an all-time high on Wednesday afternoon after the news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, insisted in the earnings call that the company is prepared to sacrifice profits to crack down on illicit activity.

“Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,” he said.

Whether public concern about the manipulation of the platforms might at some point threaten the business remains to be seen. But many customers who run up against the fakery problem end up unhappy.

Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government relations at Vietnam Veterans of America, noticed last summer a look-alike Facebook page calling itself Vietnam Vets of America that initially borrowed the real group’s logo. Linked to a website hosted in Bulgaria, the upstart page pushed viral content, weighing in on N.F.L. players’ protests of police shootings. It posted looping videos that were months or years old but presented them as breaking news, he said.

“Sometimes their grammar was off,” Mr. Goldsmith said, but there was no way to know who was behind the page.

Soon, the look-alike page had 200,000 followers — more than the 120,000 than the page of the real group, which has a long history of service, a congressional charter and chapters around the country. Mr. Goldsmith said the linked website had few ads, so he suspected a political motive, probably in line with the Russian campaign to divide Americans.

In August, Mr. Goldsmith began complaining to Facebook. But officials there hesitated; hosting pages for millions of groups, they were hardly equipped to assess in detail whether a particular veterans group was worthy and another was not.

Finally, in late October, Facebook shut the newer page, deciding it had illicitly stolen the intellectual property of the older page. But Mr. Goldsmith said the experience was disturbing.

“I don’t think they’re taking a very proactive approach,” he said of Facebook. “There was a foreign entity targeting American vets and inserting itself into divisive debates.

He gave up soccer. Then he had to give up running. He has tried swimming and cycling, but he said, “My heart is not in it.” Some days he can barely walk.

And he has no memory of any doctor warning him that he could get arthritis.

“It’s like a dirty little secret,” said Kocher, who is also the associate director of the division of sports medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital. “It’s not that anyone is covering up. It’s just that it’s not well known.”

But as someone who spends his days repairing torn knee ligaments in teenagers, he is worried. He has written a paper, soon to be published, that says the number of A.C.L. operations at 26 children’s hospitals in the United States has soared as more children and adolescents play sports that involve twisting the knee, like soccer and basketball, and often participate year-round.

In 2004, there were about 500 A.C.L. operations at those hospitals; in 2014, there were more than 2,500, he reports.

“This is a major issue for me,” said Kocher, who does more than 150 A.C.L. reconstructions a year, mostly in adolescents. “If a 15-year-old gets arthritis in 10 years, knee replacement is not a great option at age 25.”

One of the few long-term studies was done carried out by Britt Elin Oiestad, a physical therapy researcher at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, who followed 181 people for 10 to 15 years after A.C.L. surgery. Seventy-four percent developed arthritis that could be seen on X-rays. Some of those patients had yet to feel arthritic pain; 41 percent of those studied had reported knee pain that indicated arthritis.



“It’s scary,” Oiestad said.

While knee injuries have received the most attention in research on arthritis risk, other joints are not immune, said Dr. Brett Owens, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Brown University Alpert Medical School. People who repeatedly sprain an ankle are at risk, he said. And up to 40 percent of those who dislocate a shoulder get arthritis within about 15 years, he said.

What researchers want to know is this: Why do these injuries precipitate arthritis?

Is the answer a bone bruise that injures cartilage? Chemical changes that happen as the body tries to repair the injury? An intrinsic instability of the knee?

And would surgical methods that more closely reproduce an individual’s original knee anatomy reduce the risk?

Research is not definitive but seems to support all of the hypotheses, as well as a strong hunch among investigators that there are genetic factors. Owens mentioned “A.C.L. families,” explaining, “I have operated on multiple siblings in a family.”

Doctors say they struggle with telling adolescents who just tore an A.C.L. that arthritis might follow. Owens says that he mentions arthritis but not in his initial conversations with young injured athletes.

“Most young athletes just want to focus on the problem at hand,” he said. “Yesterday in my office, I saw a 17-year-old soccer player. ‘Yes, you tore your A.C.L.’ The tears start to come. It is hard to talk to a 17-year-old about what their knee will be like in 20 years.”

Although Lalli, the former soccer player, said his arthritis diagnosis was a shock, he also said that knowing that it might happen would not have made much difference. He might have a genetic predisposition toward knee arthritis. His father took up soccer in his late 40s and had to have surgery at 50 when he tore the A.C.L. in his left knee.

Then he tore the meniscus — a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between the shinbone and the thighbone — in his right knee. He got arthritis later but thought it was because of his age, not his injuries.

Lalli’s arthritis progressed despite his receiving a second A.C.L. reconstruction that was more tailored to the anatomy of his knee. His initial operation had been done by a surgeon who did not position the new ligament in the exact place it had been before.

Lalli had the subsequent operation done by Dr. Freddie Fu, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Fu is a leader in A.C.L. operations that are more anatomically specific, and his procedure stabilized Lalli’s knee. Nonetheless, Lalli has faced years of disabling pain.

Four years ago, when his arthritis got so bad that he gave up playing soccer, Lalli asked for a knee replacement. Fu refused, telling him that artificial knees last only 10 or 15 years in younger and active people and that each knee replacement is more problematic than the one before.

A person can have only two or three knee replacements in a lifetime, Fu told Lalli, and so it was best to wait until he was 50.

Now Lalli is trying to decide whether to let his children play soccer. He has a 5-year-old and 3-year-old twins, and he said they “seem to naturally gravitate toward soccer.”

Lalli, who loves the sport, is torn and has been talking it over with his wife.

“I’m not sure what we will do,” he said.","If You Tear a Knee Ligament, Arthritis Is Likely to Follow in 10 Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/health/arthritis-risk-acl.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Casting Mr. Rowe was the result of a deliberate effort by two professional regional theaters, Syracuse Stage and its co-producer, Indiana Repertory Theater (where the show opened this fall), to audition actors both with and without autism for the role. At a time when theaters are discussing diversity, there is a heightened pressure to include performers with disabilities. “Uncommon Sense,” Tectonic Theater Project’s new Off Broadway play about people with autism and their families, has an actor on the spectrum, Andrew Duff, in its ensemble.

Robert Hupp, the artistic director of Syracuse Stage, said that seeking out actors on the spectrum “made logical and irrefutable sense” for “Curious Incident.” To him, Mr. Rowe’s performance is clear validation.

“To anyone who ever had any concerns or doubts or wondered, ‘Could an actor with autism play this role? Would an actor who falls on the spectrum be overwhelmed by this production?’ the answer is definitively no,” he said. “Not if you’re Mickey Rowe.”

Mr. Rowe, who earned a bachelor’s degree in drama from the University of Washington, found out when he was a senior there that he had autism. Legally blind, he struggles to read print smaller than 18-point type (he wears contacts onstage and glasses “in real life,” he says), and was in special education classes for his vision throughout childhood — years he spent friendless, obsessed with magic tricks and circus skills: stilt-walking, juggling, unicycling.

It strikes him as telling that he got speech and occupational therapy, too. He suspects his parents knew he had autism but didn’t want to label him, and if so, he understands. He hasn’t asked them, though; he said they don’t have that kind of relationship.

It was his girlfriend — now his wife and the mother of their two small children — who urged him to get help with issues like interpreting social cues. At the university’s Adult Autism Clinic, his diagnosis came as “a big relief, because you know your whole life that something is different,” Mr. Rowe said. “You don’t know why or what it is or if you’re stupid or what’s going on.”

Still, he didn’t tell people about his autism. So it was unsettling when, in an acting class he took around the time “Curious Incident” opened on Broadway in 2014, the teacher handed him one of Christopher’s speeches and said, “You need to do this monologue. This is you.”

“I remember thinking to myself afterwards: Does she know I’m on the spectrum?” Mr. Rowe said. “Like, do people just know?”

He is not Christopher, though, and he and Christopher occupy very different spots on the spectrum. Even so, he recognized enough pieces of himself in that monologue that he went home and listened to the novel, by Mark Haddon, that Mr. Stephens adapted into the play.

Not long afterward, struggling to get work, Mr. Rowe threw in the towel on trying to pass as neurotypical. In an essay on the theater industry website HowlRound, he wrote about being an actor with autism, noting the “tension between everything that I am and everything that might be conventional for an actor.” He hoped his disclosure would change the way people looked at him, just enough to give him a chance.

The piece raised his profile and put him on the radar of anyone searching for an actor with autism, but in practice nothing changed. Going out for roles, he still faced immediate roadblocks: the small talk, the eye contact, the instant connection an actor is supposed to make with the director.

“Just how you walk into the room and shake hands with the person when you first meet them is a huge part of the audition, and people on the spectrum aren’t very good at that,” he said.

So his résumé was comparatively slender when the Indiana/Syracuse production asked him to submit a video audition. Soon the show’s California-based director, Risa Brainin, flew to Seattle to see if he had the chops. If he didn’t, they weren’t going to compromise.

“We couldn’t,” she said. “It’s too major of a role, and too difficult of a role. What we wanted to do was give the opportunity.”

In Syracuse, where the production runs through Nov. 12, Mr. Rowe plays Christopher with an agile grace, an impish humor and a humanizing restraint that seems directly connected to his experience of autism. When the stage directions say that Christopher barks like a dog, for example, Mr. Rowe chooses to underplay it.

The attention the show has gotten has been positive for him. For one thing, Lincoln Center asked him to speak at its autism-focused Big Umbrella Festival next spring. And the ripples extend farther. Marissa Wolf, who is directing “Curious Incident” this winter at Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, said Mr. Rowe’s casting inspired her to choose an actor with Tourette’s syndrome, a condition often associated with autism spectrum disorder, to play Christopher in her production.

Mr. Rowe worries a little about being pigeonholed, because he also wants to play roles that have nothing to do with autism. At the same time, he sees characters in the canon who he thinks could be on the spectrum — like Bobby, the young misfit in David Mamet’s “American Buffalo,” and Jason, the awkward adolescent in David Lindsay-Abaire’s “Rabbit Hole.”

Eager to work with Mr. Rowe again, Mr. Hupp and Ms. Brainin have been scheming about future projects, pondering which roles — maybe something in Shakespeare? — would be a great fit for him.

What Mr. Rowe wants is a life in the American theater, probably with a stint in graduate school on the way. He can envision himself as the leader of a regional theater, and he is undaunted by the socializing that would require. Mingling may not be in his skill set, but to him, an artistic director is simply playing a role. And knowing that takes the fear away.","The World Really Is a Stage, Scripts and All, to an Actor With Autism",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/theater/actor-with-autism-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time.html

Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions — mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world’s population.

Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.

In May 2013, the Senate’s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple’s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared “tax residency” nowhere in the world.

Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is “managed and controlled” abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.

At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.

“Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

Ireland’s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country’s policies: “I do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.” Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.

But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.

At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.

Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.

“For those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby’s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. “They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”

In building Apple’s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.

Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was “a tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.”

Baker McKenzie’s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby’s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.

“Confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,” the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: “Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?”

(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, “As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.”)

Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby’s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.","After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The seal stone presents two mysteries. One is how and why it was engraved in such detail. The other is whether its battle scene, strongly evocative of those in Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” depicts an event that contributed to the oral tradition behind the works of Homer.

The seal stone’s owner, known as the Griffin Warrior after the mythical animal depicted in his grave, was buried around 1450 B.C. He lived at a critical period when the Minoan civilization of Crete was being transferred to cities of the Greek mainland.

Local chieftains, as the Griffin Warrior may have been, used precious items from Crete to advertise their membership in the Greek-speaking elite of the incipient Mycenaean civilization, the first on mainland Europe. Their descendants, a century or so later, built the great palaces at Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns, places mentioned by Homer.

Dr. Davis and Dr. Stocker believe that the seal stone, like other objects in the Griffin Warrior’s grave, was made on Crete. Work of such quality was not being produced anywhere on the Greek mainland at the time. The detail is so fine that it seems the engraver would have needed a magnifying glass, as would admirers of his work.

Yet no magnifying implements have been found on Crete from this era. Perhaps the engraver was nearsighted, the two archaeologists suggest.

Fritz Blakolmer, an expert on Aegean art at the University of Vienna, argues that the seal stone is a miniature copy of a much larger original, probably a stucco-embellished wall painting like those found at the Palace of Knossos on Crete. He said the seal must have been engraved by someone with a magnifying glass, even though none has been found, and dismissed the possibility that people of that era had sharper eyesight than today.

The seal, carved on a hard stone known as agate, shows a victorious hero slaying an adversary while a third warrior lies dead in the foreground. The seal stone is mounted so that it can worn on the wrist, and indeed the hero is wearing just such an item, as if it were a wristwatch.

The two defeated warriors seem to belong to the same group, because both are wearing patterned kilts whereas the hero sports a codpiece. The scene evidently represents some event that would have been familiar to the Minoans who made the seal stone and to the Griffin Warrior’s community.

The seal stone’s possible relevance to the Homeric epics is intriguing but elusive. Early archaeologists, such as Heinrich Schliemann, who first excavated Troy and Mycenae, believed the “Iliad” recounted historical events and were quick to see proof of this in the artifacts they found.

Later archaeologists were more doubtful, but allowed that the destruction of Troy in 1200 B.C. could have been remembered in oral poetry for 500 years until the Homeric poems were first written down, around 700 B.C.

The Griffin Warrior was buried around 1450 B.C., distancing him even further from the first written version of Homer. Still, there is some evidence that the oral tradition behind the Homeric epics traces as far back as Linear B, the first Greek writing system.

Linear B was adapted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Linear A, used by the Minoans. The oldest known Linear B inscriptions date to 1450 B.C., and the script disappeared after the collapse of Mycenaean civilization around 1200 B.C.

Some of the scansion problems in the Homeric poems “can be resolved if you restore older forms of Greek which are consistent with the dialect recorded in Linear B documents,” said Dr. Bennet of the British School at Athens.

So the oral tradition that led to the Homeric epics perhaps stretched over seven centuries.

“We’re not saying this is a representation from Homer,” Dr. Stocker said of the tableau on the seal stone, while admitting it would be “fun to believe” the hero is Achilles. Rather, the image “is part of a cycle of stories familiar to both Mycenaeans and Minoans.”

Dr. Blakolmer, too, finds it tempting to see the figures on the seal as Homeric heroes, like Hector or Nestor, but in his view the temptation must be resisted.

HOUSTON — I’m already feeling sorry for Johnnie Clay Langendorff, who is probably well on his way to a dinner invitation at the Trump White House for driving the car that chased Devin Patrick Kelley out of Sutherland Springs, with an armed sidekick literally riding shotgun. I’ve already caught him on several broadcasts, with the word “hero” running on the banner below the video of Mr. Langendorff respectfully “yes ma’aming” and “no sir-ing” the confounded reporters.

I suspect it’s only a matter of time before the N.R.A. tries to give the kid in the cowboy hat and starched denim shirt whatever award it already has or is currently cooking up for valor under fire. There will, no doubt, be references to the “long, tall Texan,” his drawl and his style. That bull skull tattoo with the horns curling under his jawline? Central casting could not have done better.

Similar accolades will no doubt be lavished on Stephen Willeford, who jumped into Mr. Langendorff’s truck and was, possibly, ready to take Mr. Kelley out while they were giving chase. Mr. Willeford had already used his weapon to take a crack at the gunman fleeing the First Baptist Church, and once he hitched a ride with Mr. Langendorff, he kept a bead on Mr. Kelley until the law finally arrived. We will never know whether Mr. Willeford would have had to fire or not, or would have killed Mr. Kelley or not, because Mr. Kelley killed himself somewhere between the church and the ditch he ran his car into.

At least, some of us will never know. President Trump seemed to have an answer: “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldn’t have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse.” And there was our state attorney general, Ken Paxton, crowing about Texas’ open carry law, which allows anyone to hang out just about anywhere with a gun on their hip. Mr. Paxton put it this way: “And so if it’s a place where somebody has the ability to carry, there’s always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people.”

So of course it stands to reason that the heroes who get that opportunity are Texans. What a boon for the pro-gun forces! I can imagine these two on Fox News now, assuming they don’t turn out to be in favor of something crazy like an assault weapons ban. But we know what will happen next: Mr. Langendorff and Mr. Willeford will have their 15 minutes of fame, and then we will move on to the next mass shooting in another state where any number of people will die because no one can be bothered to go up against the N.R.A.

“It was after cleaning, during the process of drawing and photography, that our excitement slowly rose as we gradually came to realize that we had unearthed a masterpiece,” they wrote in the journal Hesperia.

The seal stone presents two mysteries. One is how and why it was engraved in such detail. The other is whether its battle scene, strongly evocative of those in Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” depicts an event that contributed to the oral tradition behind the works of Homer.

The seal stone’s owner, known as the Griffin Warrior after the mythical animal depicted in his grave, was buried around 1450 B.C. He lived at a critical period when the Minoan civilization of Crete was being transferred to cities of the Greek mainland.

Local chieftains, as the Griffin Warrior may have been, used precious items from Crete to advertise their membership in the Greek-speaking elite of the incipient Mycenaean civilization, the first on mainland Europe. Their descendants, a century or so later, built the great palaces at Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns, places mentioned by Homer.

Dr. Davis and Dr. Stocker believe that the seal stone, like other objects in the Griffin Warrior’s grave, was made on Crete. Work of such quality was not being produced anywhere on the Greek mainland at the time. The detail is so fine that it seems the engraver would have needed a magnifying glass, as would admirers of his work.

Yet no magnifying implements have been found on Crete from this era. Perhaps the engraver was nearsighted, the two archaeologists suggest.

She saw: “Children in proper school uniforms carrying shoes, trying to decide between the lure of a coco palm adventure to one side and the delicious morning sea on the other.”

I, too, saw children, dozens of them on either side of the street one morning. Most of the children wore traditional uniforms, white shirts and blouses and plaid skirts or dark or khaki shorts or pants. They huddled together chatting and giggling, not paying attention to the dark blue sea on one side or the colorfully painted houses and buildings in the hills on the other. These children reminded me of children you would see heading to school in my native Haiti, or most other Caribbean islands, their range of black and brown skin glistening in the sun. The older ones kept their younger siblings at their side, even as they climbed into public transportation minivans and buses.

I went in search of more of those “vivid images” in Lorde’s essay and, besides the school children at Grand Anse Beach, there was Fat Woman-Who-Fries-Fish-In-The-Market. I did not see her inside the turquoise-and-white square building downtown. She was not standing near the massive fish laid out on slabs waiting to be gutted. Nor was she by the smaller ones piled into buckets out front.

The fish market smelled predictably like the sea. The buzz of the customer and buyer exchanges was a lot more subdued than I expected. Not all the vendors had customers. The market’s relative calm on a Friday afternoon reminded me how small Grenada is. The island is 120 square miles and has about 100,000 residents.

That night while pondering all this in my hotel room at the Coyaba Beach Resort, I parted the curtains and looked for a full moon to turn the beach outside “flash green.” October is perhaps the wrong time of year for this. Lorde had seen the sand turn green in April. There was no full moon, but I slept with the sliding door to the terrace open so I could hear the waves gently grazing the shore.

I AM NOT A GOOD TOURIST. I can easily evoke for myself the worse case scenario in any type of travel situation. I have immigrant guilt about taking time off. I am a bad swimmer. I am self-conscious in bathing suits, so most of my tourism is done through books. But because of my writing, I am invited to quite a few places and whenever I can I go.

I was in Grenada, which was largely unaffected by the hurricanes, to receive an honorary degree from the University of the West Indies Open Campus. Unlike U.W.I.’s brick and mortar campuses, the Open Campus is a virtual one. The 657 students in my graduating class hailed from all over the English-speaking Caribbean. They earned their degrees online. Only 139 graduates would cross the stage though.

Not all the graduates always travel to the Open Campus ceremonies, my hosts from the University of the West Indies told me. However, this year there were students who wanted to come to their graduation in Grenada but could not. Most of the graduates travel from other countries for the Open Campus ceremony, which takes place in a different location each year. Many had homes that were damaged or destroyed. Some lost loved ones along with everything they owned.

I was told the story of one graduate from Trinidad who stayed home because she had donated her plane ticket money to relief efforts in Dominica, which has U.W.I.’s most devastated campus. Some of the students from that campus are still unaccounted for.

Hurricane Maria struck Dominica, the southernmost of the Leeward Islands as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 18. Dominica’s Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, whose own roof collapsed during the storm, later told CNN: “Our agriculture sector is 100 percent destroyed. Our tourism is, I would say, about 95 percent destroyed.”

In front of the supermarket across from the Coyaba Beach Resort were blue barrels lined up to collect food and other urgently needed supplies for Dominica. At The Beach House Restaurant, just north of the airport, where I attended a pre-graduation cocktail party the night before the ceremony, the young female singer entertaining us with classic soul, as well as Caribbean covers, reminded everyone to drop something in the basket that would usually hold her tips. This time the funds would go to Dominica.

I have never been to Dominica but now I wish I had. This is not just born out of a desire to see a place “before.” Before the devastation, before the storm. I am from a place, Haiti, that constantly evokes nostalgia in the people who have seen it, lived in it, and loved it “before.”

DOMINICA GRENADA Trinidad and Tobago GRENADA Gouyave Caribbean Sea Grenville Grand Etang National Park St. George’s Grand Anse Beach Coyaba Beach Resort The Beach House Restaurant St. George’s University Maurice Bishop International Airport 4 miles

This longing for before always saddens me because it makes the present seem even worse. But I still wish I had seen Dominica before, in part because it is the birthplace of one of my favorite novelists, Jean Rhys. The places that Antoinette, Rhys’ doomed narrator in “Wide Sargasso Sea,” longs for have flaming sunsets and rivers so clear that you can see the pebbles at the bottom. They have moss-covered gardens filled with orchids, hibiscus and flamboyants, which are illuminated at night by fireflies.

This is one of the ways I have imagined Dominica, along with what I have seen in travel guides: its high mountain peaks, forts, lush rain forests, reefs, gorges, lakes and water falls.

Dominica is also home to Xuela Claudette Richardson, the narrator of Jamaica Kincaid’s novel “The Autobiography of My Mother.” At 15, Xuela was taken by her father to Roseau, the capital of Dominica. Roseau, Xuela finds — like a lot of places in the Caribbean — “had a fragile foundation, and from time to time was destroyed by forces of nature, a hurricane or water coming from the sky as if suddenly the sea were above and the heavens below.”

“THE SECOND TIME I came to Grenada,” Audre Lorde wrote in “Grenada Revisited,” “I came in mourning and fear that this land which I was learning had been savaged, invaded, its people maneuvered into saying thank you to their invaders.”

Lorde’s second visit was in late 1983, after then U.S. president Ronald Reagan had deployed Marines to the island. Reagan declared that he wanted to prevent a “Soviet-Cuban” colony from taking root in Grenada and protect American citizens on the island, many of whom were students at St. George’s University School of Medicine.

I visited St. George’s University, whose students and officials, Lorde pointed out, later denied that they were ever in danger. The school, which is no longer just a medical school, but also covers other disciplines, is an island unto itself, with its many salmon-colored buildings, massive water tanks, security personnel and buses. All over the campus are breathtaking views of True Blue Bay, the point where the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean meet.

If Reagan was so interested in seeing democracy flourish in the Caribbean, Lorde wondered, why did the U.S. government support Haiti’s Jean-Claude Duvalier and his repressive regime? She also mentioned Puerto Rico.

In 1897, she wrote, “U.S. Marines landed in Puerto Rico to fight the Spanish-American War. They never left.”

Puerto Rico was as devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria as Dominica, Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I have not been to Puerto Rico either. I have only visited it in books, particularly through the eyes of young Esmeralda Santiago in her memoir, “When I Was Puerto Rican.”

I imagined the guavas that she taught me and other readers to eat at the beginning of her book being no longer able to grow, the fields they came from deep in the countryside flattened, and the families that farmed them struggling to stay alive without food or clean water.

I watched an interview with the tireless mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto, and heard echoes of Audre Lorde in her voice.

“There is nothing that unites people more anywhere in the world than injustice,” the mayor said. “We have to get food, we have to get water or else we are being condemned to a slow death. It may be easy to try to disregard us. It may be easy because we are a U.S. territory and a colony of the United States. But we’re a people, damn it.”

The blessings of our islands are also our curse. Our geography gives us year-round sun and beautiful beaches, but more and more in the age of climate change, we are on the front line of destruction.

“We are a people” seems to be what we have been saying for generations to all our colonizers and invaders who seemed intent on destroying us. And now more than ever, Mother Nature, too.

We are a people, the Arawaks and Taínos might have said, even as they died trying to prove it. We have even inherited the word for hurricane, huracán, from them.

“Much has been terribly lost in Grenada,” Lorde wrote at the end of her 1983 visit, “but not all — not the spirit of the people.”

THE SPIRIT of the people is also captured in this poem I have been carrying with me for years before coming to Grenada. It was written by the Grenadian poet and short story writer Merle Collins.

“We speak,” she wrote in “Because the Dawn Breaks,” “for the same reason that the thunder frightens the child

that the lightning startles the tree …”

The people of the Caribbean speak, the poet wrote, because we “were not born

to be your vassals.”

After a century in which the car radically remapped American society, creativity about its own future got stuck in a cul-de-sac.
Folly or not, self-driving cars are the future that nearly every major car company thinks it has to bet on.
Industries gored by self-driving technology (Who needs motels if your car has a bed?
Indeed, it’s a set of basic human questions, far more than technology, that will really determine the future of the car.","It is a truth as visible from space, in the tendrils of our brightly lit megaroadways, as it is under a microscope, in the diesel particles that tar our lungs: America is a car country. This truth has been true for more than a hundred years now. Soon after the turn of the 20th century, the automobile became pervasive in urban centers, establishing a new, briskly perilous pace for city life; by the 1930s, as annual vehicle sales surpassed four million, urban streetcar systems had begun to go defunct, scrapped in favor of gas-burning buses; by the mid-1950s, new cars increasingly rolled off the line into a suburban way of life that the car itself had made possible. Suburbs had already swallowed a quarter of the population when, at the behest of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, Congress inaugurated the most ambitious infrastructure project in the nation’s history: a 47,000-mile Interstate highway system. Its construction would crisscross the nation and spread even more suburbia as it went, bringing a profusion of new features to the American landscape — not just countless cloverleafs and imposingly stacked overpasses but drive-ins, drive-throughs, cul-de-sacs, acres upon acres of blacktop parking.

As the car transformed the American lifestyle, so did it colonize the American imagination. Perhaps the most fascinating artifact of automotive retrofuturism dates to 1958, two years into the Interstate building boom, when Disney produced an hourlong TV program called “Magic Highway, U.S.A.” After a half-hour or so celebrating the car’s ascent, the program pivoted to envisioning its future. At a time when Eisenhower’s Interstate project — inspired, famously, by his awe at traveling Hitler’s autobahn during the Nazi overthrow — was seizing private property through eminent domain around the country, Disney imagined atomic-powered tunnel borers and imperial road-building machines as tall and wide as skyscrapers, cutting through landscapes and leaving fully constructed roadways in their wake. Dreaming further forward, the program extrapolated from the new real-world highways to envision literal high-ways of clear tubes raised far above the urban environment, magnificent air-conditioned arteries that someday would “link together all nations and help create a better understanding among the peoples of the world.”

Some of Disney’s imagined future has indeed become our present, from rear-facing cameras to automated GPS-style directions. But the program’s writers and illustrators would no doubt have been shocked to learn that in 2017, nearly 60 years into the glorious automotive future, the physical highways we drive on would be functionally identical (probably inferior, in fact, after decades of neglect and disrepair) to those outside their office windows. Perhaps the most succinct explanation for why Disney did not get its future highways is that Eisenhower got his. The realization of the Interstate System wound up spanning three and a half decades and consuming hundreds of billions of dollars in construction costs, an unparalleled, concentrated investment of financial and political capital that ensured any new transportation innovations for decades would need to be designed to exploit it. Like so many sci-fi dreamers, Disney’s writers tried to think of the perfect transportation system, but in real life, the good-enough — the version of a technology that a society actually finds, in a concrete historical moment, the money and political will to enact — often winds up being the enemy of the perfect.

More perversely still, the suburban lifestyle that the Interstates enabled also gave rise to an atomized, individualistic politics, which soon bred a revolt against the taxation and central planning that made their construction possible in the first place. Disney’s writers saw a new infrastructural grandeur around them and imagined it would spark more grandeur, but in fact the highway boom proved to be a self-negating act of imagination, like one of those “useless machines” that sends out a mechanical hand to turn itself off.

Instead, as the dismal cycle of road-building and sprawl has continued, the last half century of automotive technology has brought mostly defensive advances — innovations that add no excitement to the car but merely ameliorate one or more of its truly terrible qualities. Airbags reduced its fatality rate, while federal emissions standards beat back smog. Hybrid and electric drivetrains have allowed some consumers to pay for the pleasure of offsetting, ever so slightly, the upward trajectory of the carbon emissions that will one day render Earth uninhabitable. Looming awareness of climate change has rendered grimly absurd that other great idée fixe of automotive futurism, the flying car: The basic mathematics of raising a ton of metal into the air, even if done electrically, are disastrous in a world where the plurality of electricity will be generated with fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Sci-fi horizons thus foreclosed to them, automakers have poured much of their design energies into weird personalization features (the driver’s seat remembers who you are!) or better integration between stereos and smartphones (never miss a podcast!). After a century in which the car radically remapped American society, creativity about its own future got stuck in a cul-de-sac.

But now, the car has been steered once again toward a fantastical sci-fi destination. The dream of cars that drive themselves has been around almost as long as cars have — Americans saw a concept for some at the 1939 World’s Fair, and another, more far-fetched one in “Magic Highway, U.S.A.” — but the push to make it real began a little over a decade ago, powered by academic roboticists and funded by the U.S. military. In 2004, Darpa inaugurated its “Grand Challenge,” offering a $1 million prize to an autonomous vehicle that could navigate a 142-mile course; no team’s robot was able to finish that first year, but the following year, five did, with first prize going to Stanford’s team. Google made the dream significantly more real beginning in 2009, when it began pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the concept.

In the past five years, the headlong push toward self-driving technology has swept up not just Google’s tech rivals (chief among them Uber, with which Google has become embroiled in a bitter and costly intellectual-property lawsuit) but the world’s automakers as well. Tesla, Cadillac, Volvo, Audi and Nissan have already rolled out models with autonomous modes for highway driving, akin to cruise controls that can also steer and brake; next year, more brands and models will join their ranks. Most of the major automakers say they expect fully autonomous vehicles to be available 15 years from now, and quite a few of them are backing that prediction with enormous capital, from GM’s $1 billion acquisition of a self-driving start-up, Cruise Automation, to Ford’s equally large investment in an A.I. start-up called Argo. Folly or not, self-driving cars are the future that nearly every major car company thinks it has to bet on.

For this installment of our annual Tech and Design Issue, we’ve devoted the entire magazine, front to back, to the question of autonomous cars and the future they could usher in. That level of attention seems warranted, given how profoundly this technology could change the way we live, with first- and second- and third-order effects that boggle the mind. We’ve visited with automakers in Detroit and in Silicon Valley to take the measure of their self-driving schemes. But we’ve also indulged in some sci-fi speculation of our own, trying to imagine what would happen if this unprecedented engine of American society — the machine that, more than any other, for better or worse, has given shape to American life for a century — really does undergo this radical transformation. The consequences would touch crime and punishment, work and leisure, exercise and partying and sex. Over the next century, they may well alter the built environment as radically as the manually driven car did over the last century.

As much as possible, we’ve tried to avoid the trap of extrapolating the future solely from the technology while assuming the society that we currently have. When the automobile came to cities a century ago, the norm was that pedestrians and carriages shared the streets equally, and it would have made sense to imagine that practice would continue. But soon the automotive interests grew powerful enough to seize the streets for themselves — resulting in the literal invention of a crime, called jaywalking — and then to displace the arguably superior technology of streetcars. Likewise, self-driving cars will create new power centers, new crimes, just as they will create new counterpowers, new forms of rebellion. Die-hard drivers might not relinquish their steering wheels easily. Industries gored by self-driving technology (Who needs motels if your car has a bed? What happens to gas stations when cars can drive themselves to charging ports?) might flex political muscle to check its progress. Law enforcement might stoke fears of autonomous getaway cars or self-driving terrorism to do the same.

Indeed, it’s a set of basic human questions, far more than technology, that will really determine the future of the car. Can cars decouple from their history as a status symbol? Will millennial attitudes on car ownership entrench and deepen, to the point that car-sharing becomes a real cultural norm, or will that generation revert to the American mean as it ages? Will the push to kill the steering wheel look like a new freedom, to be met with excitement, or like a new prohibition, to be met with reactionary backlash? Will we muster the political will to push back on corporate power, as autonomous cars create new quasi-monopolistic giants? Or could autonomous cars actually arrive into a totally different economic and political order, one that they help to bring about? After all, Disney couldn’t have foreseen, in 1958, the political realities of today that would make their imagined future impossible — realities that the highway itself helped create. The political and social convulsions of the next 50 years will be the real driver of our high-tech future. It’s fun to guess at the ending of that unwritten history, but in truth we don’t entirely know yet how it will begin.",What the Car Did — And What It Might Do,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/magazine/tech-design-future-autonomous-cars-american-interstate-highway-roads-suburbs.html

JB: I wanted to write precisely about the crises and dilemmas I faced as they intersected in the moment.
I also didn’t want him to do what most people would do, what my staff wanted to do: Have Joe do less.
Having known her for a long time, I can’t believe she didn’t think: What will young women in the world think if I walk away?
Do you really think a President Biden could make a difference?","Last month, Biden sat down in the book-lined study of his home in a leafy neighborhood of Wilmington, Del., to discuss his memoir, which will be published on Nov. 14.

Philip Galanes: Why write this book? Why tear your heart open again?

Joe Biden: For my kids. Look, I have two beautiful grandchildren. I have a thousand pictures of them all around. For a year, when they were building a home, they lived here: Beau, [his wife] Hallie and the two kids. I wish they’d never moved. But after he died, the kids would come into my bed and lie on my chest: “Pop, tell me stories about Daddy.” “Tell me the one about when he fell out of the tree.” “Tell me the one about when that guy went after Daddy, and Uncle Hunt beat him up.”

PG: In planning the book, were there authors or memoirs, books about loss that spoke to you?

JB: No. I didn’t want to be like anyone else. I’m not being facetious. And I didn’t want to write a book about grief. I didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for me. I wanted to celebrate Beau’s life and the people he touched. Beau had a strict code of honor. That may sound silly, but it’s true. My Dad had an expression: “Never explain and never complain.” I never once heard Beau complain. Not once.

When his brother and sister, Hunter and Ashley, stood up to give their eulogies, I don’t know how they did it, but I’ve never been prouder of them in my life. Hunter, who’s a beautiful writer, said: “My first memory of Beau was when I was 3 years old.” They were in the hospital [following the death of their mother and baby sister in a car accident]. Hunt had a skull fracture, almost every bone in his body was broken. And Beau, just 4, in the next bed, held his hand and kept saying: “Hunt, I love you. Look at me. I love you, I love you, I love you.” At the funeral Hunt said in 42 years that “he has never stopped holding my hand.”

I want readers to know that there are people like Beau in this world, who put country first, family first, friends first.

PG: Let’s talk about the structure of the book. You keep three narrative strands running throughout the text.

JB: It was all about time: seconds, minutes, hours — not months or years. We were either going to beat Beau’s illness or not, and we had a very narrow window. My assignments at the White House were similar. They weren’t about managing relationships; they were crisis management. If Prime Minister Abadi didn’t reach a deal with the Sunnis, the government would implode. It got down to minutes and phone calls and seconds.

PG: For a famous talker, it’s a taut book.

JB: Well, there’s a difference between talking and writing. When I’m talking with someone who’s looking for something — for assurance or help, for me to take a position — I try to engage them. I draw them out by talking, by listening to what they’re saying and what they’re not saying. But in the book, I had to be disciplined to bring all those strands together. I wanted to make my points as crisply as I could.

PG: There’s a beautiful line in the book: “My story precedes me.”

JB: And it does. Look, I was on top of the world in 1972. My sister managed my Senate campaign and pulled off the most improbable upset. I’m down in Washington, hiring staff, and I get a call from a young woman who says: “Your wife and daughter have been in a terrible accident. You have to come home.” I said, “She’s dead.” And she said yes. So, I know the stages of grief, like a lot of other people. From the pain, to the sense of hopelessness, to recovery, it’s all about time.

PG: There’s an undertow on every page, a knowledge that we’re all suffering. Did that predate 1972?

JB: I used to be a very bad stutterer. Everybody thinks I know Irish poets because I’m Irish. But I know them because of my uncle, an educated bachelor who lived with us, off and on. He had a volume of Yeats. And I used to get up at night and put a flashlight on the mirror, practicing and practicing, reading aloud from those books. Everybody has a burden to carry.

PG: Maybe that’s why the strands of the book bleed together? When one of Beau’s doctor visits goes well, there’s an optimism that carries into the next section about Iraq.

JB: I wanted to write precisely about the crises and dilemmas I faced as they intersected in the moment. I wanted to show that in the ebb and flow of life, nothing is totally separable. As much as I try to compartmentalize, what you’re doing in one phase of your life washes over and affects the others.

PG: And occasionally, the crosscutting made me think you’d actually cheat death, that Beau would live.

JB: Oh! We were praying and working and believing. I’ve always been an optimist. When I had a couple of cranial aneurysms [in 1988] and the doctor’s were giving me less than even chances of living, I was still talking as if everything was going to be O.K.

PG: Several times, Beau says: Don’t look at me sad, Dad. Or: Promise me you’ll be O.K., Dad. Did he ever let you comfort him?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

JB: One night, when it was clear that the odds weren’t good, he asked me to stay after dinner at his house, about a mile from here. He said: “Dad, I know you love me more than anyone in the world. But promise me you’ll be O.K. I’ll be O.K., Dad.” He had come face to face with his mortality. He watched me go through the loss of his mother and sister. And he didn’t want me to turn inward. He didn’t want me to give up on the robustness of life.

PG: You were reluctant to confide in President Obama about Beau.

JB: It was complex. I didn’t want him to carry the burden of feeling sorry for me. Several times, when we talked about Beau, he started sobbing, and I had to console him. I didn’t want to put him through that, not with all the responsibility he had on his back. I also didn’t want him to do what most people would do, what my staff wanted to do: Have Joe do less. I had to do more. And I had my diaries. I’m able to write and express emotions fairly well. And I was completely honest with myself in those diaries.

PG: Let’s turn to the 2016 election. You write that President Obama was pretty discouraging about your running for the Democratic nomination. But in the book you also say that the race was coming to you: The badly beaten middle class, the populism, the authenticity.

JB: What people don’t realize is that Beau was essentially diagnosed with a death sentence in 2013. Virtually nobody makes it. I had an obligation to tell the president because of my duties. So, he knew what was going on. By late 2014, we were walking after lunch, and Barack said: “Joe, if I had the power of appointment, I’d appoint you president. We agree on the issues, I know your leadership skills, and I think you’d be the best president.” But he had other pressures. I felt them, too. If I were to say “I am not going to run,” in the face of all this data that’s coming in saying, you can do it. If I said that, everybody would have known there was something wrong with Beau. I would have violated my commitment to him to keep it secret. The piece that complicated it is that after he passed, it was clear that he really wanted me to run.

PG: Both sons wanted you to run.

JB: I believe Beau, looking down, understands why I didn’t run, and he accepts it. Beau, Hunt and Ashley didn’t want me stepping back. They thought that what limited talents I have that may not have been suited for winning decades earlier were exactly what the public was looking for now.

PG: There’s a scene in the book where Hillary Clinton comes to visit with you to see if you’re planning to run for president. You write that she was propelled by forces not entirely of her own making. What does that mean?

JB: I think she wanted to be president and would have been a good president. But she also had to understand how difficult her life was going to be, how she would be vilified. But Hillary is also driven by the need to empower women. Having known her for a long time, I can’t believe she didn’t think: What will young women in the world think if I walk away?

PG: We’re so dug in and divided now. Do you really think a President Biden could make a difference?

JB: The obvious answer is: I don’t know. But I have always been good at bringing people together. Trying to understand the other person’s perspective, and trying to figure out how to get to “go.” That skill was always useful, but it has a higher premium now that we don’t work together as much. And that’s why I wrote this book about Beau. I wanted people to see how honorable political life can be. He had so many chances to advance himself — he was offered my Senate seat when he came back from Iraq — but he wouldn’t take it. He wanted to earn it. Beau’s ambition was to be a man who always did his duty.","Joe Biden Talks About His New Memoir, ‘Promise Me, Dad’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/books/review/joe-biden-talks-about-new-memoir-promise-me-dad.html

“We have many things happening that we hope, we hope — in fact, I’ll go a step further — we hope to God we never have to use,” Mr. Trump said.

When pressed by a reporter, Mr. Trump declined to say whether he still thought negotiations with North Korea would be a waste of time, making an uncharacteristic effort to avoid a remark that might have inflamed tensions.

“I don’t want to say that — I just don’t want to say that,” Mr. Trump said. “You can understand.”

His visit to Seoul was the most diplomatically challenging leg of Mr. Trump’s 12-day, five-country trip through Asia, bringing him face to face with a public and a president wary of his combative approach on North Korea. To many of Mr. Moon’s progressive supporters, Mr. Trump poses as much of a threat to peace as Mr. Kim, if not more so.

“Don’t come, Trump! You talk about war whenever you open your mouth,” a large banner read during a protest near the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday. “Go away, Trump!” hundreds of labor activists and other progressives shouted in downtown Seoul, where thousands of police were deployed to keep security. “No Trump, no war!”

A short distance away, across a police blockade, hundreds of conservatives welcomed Mr. Trump with South Korean and American flags. South Korean conservatives are deeply skeptical of Mr. Moon’s approach, calling it naïve. They back Mr. Trump’s hawkish view of the North, although they, too, stop short of supporting war on the Korean Peninsula.

“We believe in Trump!” their signs read.

Mr. Trump’s visit to South Korea appeared choreographed to avoid potentially provocative moments. Unlike many previous presidents, he eschewed the traditional visit to the Demilitarized Zone separating the North and South, where past American commanders in chief have peered into the North through binoculars, projecting a menacing mien.

And while his advisers have signaled that Mr. Trump may soon return North Korea to the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, he did not address that issue on Tuesday.

Mr. Trump’s change in tone notwithstanding, his advisers have increasingly been making the case that North Korea’s ambition is to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force, and that traditional deterrence — fear of overwhelming retaliation — cannot stop the North once it has a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.

Many observers are skeptical of both assertions, especially in South Korea, which would suffer greatly if a pre-emptive strike on the North led to all-out war. They argue that the leaders of Pyongyang’s Communist regime are not planning to use nuclear weapons to attack the United States or its allies, because they know that Washington would overwhelmingly counterattack. Rather, they say, North Korea is building its nuclear weapons out of fear, hoping that the arms will protect the country from invasion — or from outside intervention, in the case of a domestic uprising — allowing the North to focus on economic development.

In addition, all of the countries around North Korea, even its old allies China and Russia, have said they would oppose war on the Korean Peninsula.

“The view that North Korea would start war to communize Korea doesn’t make sense anymore,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “North Korea knows that if it ever uses a nuclear weapon, it means self-destruction.”

South Korean officials said they hoped that Mr. Trump’s visit to this densely populated capital of 10 million people would bring home to him the consequences of a potential war. Mr. Moon supports Mr. Trump’s call for “maximum” sanctions and pressure, but says that those alone will never persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.

Mr. Moon has urged Washington to engage the North with dialogue and discuss a way out for Pyongyang. But so far, Mr. Trump has ignored such requests, even ridiculing Mr. Moon’s efforts as “appeasement.”

American officials in the region, too, were hoping the president’s trip would help Mr. Trump gain a new perspective on how Seoul and Tokyo view the threat from up close; the regional trends affecting Asia beyond North Korea, including Chinese assertiveness; and the costs and consequences of military action, according to one U.S. official.

From a dining hall at Camp Humphreys, where Mr. Trump had lunch with troops, to the Blue House, where he met with Mr. Moon, everything he saw on Tuesday could become a fiery battlefield in the event of a military exchange with North Korea.

But if the firsthand experience left an impression on Mr. Trump, he did not show it. At times, his tone was almost blithe. Before being briefed by American and South Korean military commanders, he said of the confrontation with the North, “Ultimately it will all work out. Because it always works out — has to work out.” General Vincent Brooks, the American commander, wore a grim expression as he listened to the president.

Mr. Trump also reprised his role as a chief salesman for the American defense industry. “South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Trump said. “And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.”

On the eve of a visit to China, Mr. Trump also made a pointed plea for countries around the world to use their influence to bring North Korea to heel, saying, “It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.”

But in a reminder of the challenge that Washington faces keeping even its allies on the same page, South Korea invited an 88-year-old Korean “comfort woman,” or a former sex slave for Japan’s World War II military, to Mr. Trump’s state banquet and put on the menu a dish of shrimp said to have been caught in waters near a set of disputed islets.

The sex slave issue is one of the most contentious dividing Tokyo and Seoul, and the islets — known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan — lie at the center of a bitter territorial dispute. The Japanese government protested the banquet arrangements, accusing South Korea of “moves that could negatively affect the close coordination” among the allies.

As Mr. Trump arrived in Seoul, there was renewed evidence of activity at a site in North Korea where the regime has conducted underground nuclear tests. It was not clear, however, whether the activity suggested another imminent test or merely construction on a tunnel that could be used for tests.","No War Threats From Trump, Who Tells Koreans ‘It Will All Work Out’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/asia/trump-korea-south-north.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s constructor, Natan Last, has taken the road less traveled, at least in his career.

“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —

Mr. Last’s puzzle not only uses the title of Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “THE ROAD NOT TAKEN” as a seed entry, but he shows us how to (almost) effortlessly make that detour when necessary.

Today’s Theme

Five phrases take a masterful detour as we make our way from left to right in today’s puzzle. One of things I liked about today’s theme is that the entire puzzle is solvable even if you don’t take those detours.

For example, Mr. Last’s seed entry, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is clued as “1916 Frost verse … or, diverged: Start of a saying about meaning well.” It’s a central Across entry, but once you get to the “N” in NOT, the road diverges into shaded/circled squares and becomes THE ROAD TO HELL. That’s the start to the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

Mr. Trump called the rampage a “mental health problem at the highest level” and not “a guns situation.” This is the cynical evasion devised by the National Rifle Association, which warmly endorsed candidate Trump, who now parrots the diversionary talking point that we must first control for mental illness.

In fact, President Trump signed a law in February revoking an Obama-era regulation that made it more difficult for the mentally ill to purchase guns.

Mr. Trump, who spoke favorably as a candidate of vigilante shootouts for self-defense, also suggested that if a civilian had not briefly exchanged shots with the Texas shooter after the massacre, the casualty toll “would have been much worse.” The implication was that the bloodshed in Texas, which also included more than 20 wounded, actually makes the case for more guns — that the disease of gun violence is also its cure.

This is a fantasy, not a rational argument; it doesn’t bear the slightest scrutiny. As our colleague Nicholas Kristof notes, the United States outstrips the world in both gun ownership per capita and gun deaths per capita. States with higher proportions of gun ownership also have rates of death by guns higher than the national average. Incidents in which victims kill attackers in self-defense are vanishingly few compared with gun homicides, and suicide is by far the leading cause of gun deaths.

From expanded background checks to assault weapons bans, proposals put forward by gun-safety proponents, unlike continually increasing private American arsenals, would do something to thwart mass shootings. The Texas killer was not motivated by racial hatred, as was the killer of the Charleston churchgoers, but by family grievance, underlining the lethal combination of domestic abuse and firearms. Abusers’ access to guns increases the risk of intimate partner homicide as much as fivefold, according to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. While federal law prohibits those convicted of domestic violence, as Mr. Kelley was, from buying or possessing firearms, the Air Force failed to add him to a federal database, allowing him to pass necessary background checks. The right law was on the books but enforcement was lax.

And yet so many politicians continue to promote the wares of the gun industry. Two years ago, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas tweeted “I’m embarrassed: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind California. Let’s pick up the pace Texans. @NRA.” On Monday he said the problem was out of human hands.

“We have evil that occurs in this world,” Governor Abbott declared, as if from a pulpit, equating all manner of global terrorist attacks, including the murder of eight last week by a truck driver in Manhattan.

Wolves are known to cooperate in hunting and even in raising one another’s pups, but they can seem pretty intolerant of one another when they are snapping and growling around a kill.

So researchers at the Wolf Science Center at the University of Vienna decided to compare the performance of wolves and dogs on a classic behavioral test.

To get a food treat, two animals have to pull ropes attached to different ends of a tray. The trick is that they have to pull both ropes at the same time. Chimps, parrots, rooks and elephants have all succeeded at the task.

Appleby, based in Bermuda, is one of the world’s largest offshore law firms. Its files offer a rare inside look at more than a dozen aircraft trusts structured by American financial institutions for privacy-seeking plane owners, primarily foreigners who otherwise would not be allowed to register with the F.A.A. There is a premium on American registration because it increases a plane’s resale value, the bureaucratic requirements are less costly and complex, and it is believed to draw less scrutiny as the aircraft moves around the world.

Among the plane owners seeking Appleby’s services were Shaher Abdulhak, a Yemeni businessman worth an estimated $9 billion whose investments included a Coca-Cola distributor in the Middle East; UPL, an Indian producer of industrial chemicals and pesticides; and Rashid Sardarov, a Russian oil billionaire and longtime client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose leaked records in 2015 became known as the Panama Papers.

In serving these clients, files show, Appleby dealt with the two banks that are the most prolific creators of American aircraft trusts: Wells Fargo and Bank of Utah. It is easy to see how Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and offices in 42 countries, might find a lucrative niche catering to the wealthy elite. Less obvious is how Bank of Utah, with 18 branches confined to one state, took the same path.

As it happens, a group of former Wells Fargo trust officers joined Bank of Utah about 10 years ago and created what would become a profitable part of the bank’s business. The bank collected $8.8 million in trust fees in 2016 — an increase of $1.1 million from the previous year, according to its most recent annual report.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Mr. Croasmun and Mr. Hansen took issue with the suggestion that they were exploiting a loophole to bypass restrictions on foreigners registering aircraft in the United States. By filling the role of “U.S. citizen” for registration purposes, the bank provided a valuable service for, say, multinational companies whose top executives might not be American, they said. The bank is clearly sensitive to concerns raised about the trusts. Its website carries a statement distancing itself from the planes it registers in its name, noting its only role is that of trustee.

In the case of Mr. Mikhelson, the trail leading from Russia to Utah began in September 2012, with an email to Appleby from the Moscow office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young. The firm wanted Appleby to set up a complex corporate structure for an unnamed client to purchase a Gulfstream jet, valued at roughly $65 million, and retain possession of it through a chain of companies in six countries.

From the outset, the goal was clear: “This structure,” wrote Svetlana Yakushina of Ernst & Young, “should allow registering the aircraft with the aviation authorities of the United States.”

How a Wealthy Foreigner Obtains U.S. Registration for a Private Jet The Russian oligarch Leonid Mikhelson wants to buy and register a private jet in the U.S., which requires American citizenship or residency. So a company he owns in Belize uses its company in the Cayman Islands, which uses its company in the British Virgin Islands to create a new company in Panama to buy the jet and record it in the Isle of Man for tax purposes, and to enter into a trusteeship with the Bank of Utah, which registers the jet in the U.S.

The arrangement would also permit the owner to avoid certain taxes, most notably a value-added tax of 20 percent if the jet were registered and used in the European Union. A six-page memo prepared by Ernst & Young laid out a plan to exploit a tax loophole offered by the Isle of Man, where about 1,000 privately owned aircraft are recorded on a government registry for tax purposes. Appleby and other similar firms maintain offices there.

The Isle of Man allows owners to escape the value-added tax, or VAT, through a paper-shuffling scheme, wherein the jet is held by a company based there but leased to another company elsewhere, both controlled by the same owner. The tax is technically deferred into the future, through use of a special account managed by Ernst & Young, and then canceled out by the corporate structure. Research by the investigative journalists consortium suggests that Isle of Man-registered aircraft have escaped more than $1 billion in taxes.

According to a flow chart created by Appleby’s Isle of Man office for the Mikhelson account, the ownership chain for his jet began in Panama, with a company called Golden Star Aviation, which registered on the Isle of Man and then leased the aircraft to a Cayman Islands company called SWGI Growth Fund. Both companies were controlled by Mr. Mikhelson.

Mr. Mikhelson declined to answer questions about his plane. His representative released a statement saying, “Mr. Mikhelson acts strictly within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with applicable legislation at all times.”

By June 2013, lawyers at Appleby still had not learned of Mr. Mikhelson’s role, other than being told that the Gulfstream’s owner was Russian. Once the lawyers were informed of his identity by a Swiss firm that manages Mr. Mikhelson’s finances, they conducted a background check and concluded that, as with other clients from Russia, where the political and legal environment can be unstable, working for him would be “high risk.” But they decided to proceed.

Sanctions and ‘Citizenship’

A due-diligence report by Appleby noted Mr. Mikhelson’s source of wealth — valued currently at about $18 billion — from oil and gas investments, notably through Novatek, Russia’s largest nongovernment-owned gas company. Mr. Mikhelson’s main business partner is Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Mr. Putin’s. The two businessmen are the primary investors in Sibur, a Russian gas-processing company.

Included in the report was a list of questions to determine if Mr. Mikhelson had any connections to the United States, including whether he had assets or maintained an address there. The answer to all of them was “no.” Flight records show that the plane has rarely, if ever, flown to the United States and instead makes trips within Russia or occasionally to cities in Europe and China.

Despite its lack of a connection to the United States, Mr. Mikhelson’s private jet was soon on its way to securing a registration with the F.A.A., thanks to Bank of Utah. It is not clear if the bank was ever told, or inquired, about the identity of the owner of the aircraft. Mr. Croasmun said that files indicated the owner “was Russian” but that identifying details were missing.

Whatever the case, the trust agreement for Mr. Mikhelson’s Gulfstream, filed with the F.A.A., does not name him in the document. Instead, the owner is listed as Golden Star Aviation, the Panamanian company he used to buy the plane.

Beyond loans, the team of six curators have been scouting for art from private collections. They have acquired more than 600 works, including Piet Mondrian’s 1922 “Composition With Blue, Red, Yellow and Black,” bought in 2009 for $27.9 million from Christie’s auction of the collection of Yves St. Laurent and Pierre Bergé. Another important purchase was a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and Child by Giovanni Bellini, which museum officials say demonstrates a commitment to highlighting works that reflect different religions.

“What is the Louvre Abu Dhabi? It’s a narrative of humankind from the beginning of knowledge, using art as a witness of the times,” said Jean-François Charnier, the project’s chief curator and scientific director for Agence France-Museums.

Some museum curators feared the Louvre Abu Dhabi’s buying spree could send global art prices surging. But Jean-Patrice Marandel, a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said the new museum “has not affected the market at all.”

“It does not have an image yet or a brand or a flavor,” he added.

A constant question for the new museum is how bold it will be. Ms. des Cars, who as former director of acquisitions had placed the winning bid for the Mondrian painting at an auction, insisted that cultural officials here have taken some “daring positions dealing with religion and nudity.”

Mr. Mubarak took pains in an interview to praise the beauty of a newly acquired Yemeni Torah. It will be exhibited with a sixth-century Quran and gothic Bible.

The museum commissioned a new piece by the American artist Jenny Holzer, who carved three stone walls with historic scripts in cuneiform, Arabic and French, drawing from a Sumerian “Creation Myth” and an essay on self-determination by Michel de Montaigne, the Renaissance philosopher.

“I had to have the content reviewed, but no one said no,” she said, when asked if there were any restrictions. She hopes to create an app for museum visitors to pick their own creation myths to project on the stone walls.

Expect to see a lot of Rosalie Jones today.

She’s the New York suffragist on the “I Voted” stickers being distributed at polling locations across the city.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced this week that the state would create two suffragist statues — one of Ms. Jones, and the other of Sojourner Truth — in New York.

Ms. Truth, who was born into slavery and was sold three times before escaping to freedom in 1826, was a prominent women’s rights advocate and abolitionist until she died in the late 1800s. Her statue will be erected on the Empire State Trail in Ulster County.

Ms. Jones led a two-week, 150-mile trek on foot from New York City to Albany with other “suffragist pilgrims” to hand-deliver a petition to the governor in 1912. (Women won the right to vote in New York five years later.) Her statue will be erected in Cold Spring Harbor State Park on Long Island.

Sherry had a pool. I had my period. I was 16 and had been having it for four years. (I mean once a month, not constantly). Of course, we had been planning to spend the whole day in the pool. So when I told her I wasn’t going to swim — and why — she looked at me like I was crazy. Sherry grabbed me by the hand and took me into the womb of this beautiful, white, creamy chic apartment in the desert, held up a tampon, and said: “Pammy. Are you serious?!!! You put this in. Right now. Are you kidding me? This will help you. I’m about to change your life. This is the end and the beginning.” (I do believe I’m paraphrasing here — but it’s my memory and it’s special and I am grateful to Sherry forever for it).

I was afraid to put the tampon in. In fact, I was convinced it wouldn’t go in. That I was the one woman on the planet who didn’t have the right equipment.

But it worked. We went swimming. And my life was better after that. Now, I had a new feeling. That it was kind of cool that I had a period at all. My body had an ability to work like this. To go through cycles. And do a thing that women get to do. I felt like I was a part of something bigger. In life. And I didn’t have to suffer. And I could go swimming … without leaving a trail of chum for the sharks … anytime I wanted. (Update: Now I never swim, and I think I have about four periods left.)

Addendum:

O.K. So now. I’m a mother to three girls. And here I go in the opposite direction of my own childhood experience.

“Hey, girls. Grab a mirror and explore yourself.”

“Want to have a talk about sex? Anything?”

“What kind of razors do you want? Mach3? That’s the kind Mommy uses.”

“You have a boyfriend now … so … I’m not … saying … you are sexually active … but … regardless, I made you an appointment … at the lady-parts doctor.”

All to be met with a pillow or hand held up in front of their faces followed by an, “Ew. Stop, Mom! I got this! I’ll ask my sister.”

And now I realize that if my mom had ever said anything to me about my vagina, I would have thrown her out the window. I mean, I can’t even take it if she touches my hair.

On a foggy morning exactly 10 years ago, a container ship struck one of the Bay Bridge towers, unleashing a swath of oil that would contaminate the environment. The spill, caused by the Cosco Busan, was not the largest in Bay Area history — when two tankers collided there in 1971, they spilled more than 10 times as much bunker oil — but the numbers were striking.

44,400,000

The shipping companies that owned and operated the Cosco Busan reached a $44.4 million settlement to reimburse government agencies that responded to the spill; as restitution for the lost human uses of the shoreline; and to restore damaged fish and bird habitats.

53,000

The Cosco Busan sent about 53,000 gallons of bunker oil into the bay. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon explosion released more than 160 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

6,849

An estimated 6,849 birds died from the oil spill, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Birds from 65 species, including the threatened marbled murrelet and snowy plover, were killed.

The crash left a 100-foot gash on the port side of the 926-foot ship, which was traveling at 11 knots, or 12.7 miles per hour, when it hit the bridge.

The Cosco Busan’s pilot, John J. Cota, was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. According to his lawyers, he had piloted about 4,000 ships in a 27-year career before the crash — with only one minor accident.

Behind one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent investors, Yuri Milner, was hundreds of millions of dollars in Kremlin funding. The documents show that Mr. Milner’s investment in Twitter relied on money from VTB, bank controlled by the Russian state. One of his most significant investors in Facebook relied on funding from Gazprom Investholding, another government-controlled institution. Mr. Milner is also an investor in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser.

Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures have helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation. The technique isn’t unique to Apple. “U.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes,” said Edward Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies.

A bank in Utah is in the business of helping wealthy foreigners register private planes in the United States, which requires American citizenship or residency. The offshore files shed light on how a small financial institution, the Bank of Utah, served as a stand-in for citizenship purposes to allow Russia’s richest man, Leonid Mikhelson, whose energy company is subject to sanctions, register a $65 million Gulfstream jet.

Who Are Appleby’s Clients?

The predominantly elite clients of Appleby contrast with those of Mossack Fonseca — the company whose leaked records became the Panama Papers — which appeared to be less discriminating in the business it took on. The records date back to 1950 and up to 2016.

Appleby has offices in tax havens around the world. In addition to its Bermudan headquarters, it works out of places like the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean; the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey off Britain; Mauritius and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean; and Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Americans — companies and people — dominate the list of clients. Past disclosures, such as the 2013 “Offshore Leaks” from two offshore incorporators in Singapore and the British Virgin Islands, the 2015 “Swiss Leaks” from a private Swiss bank owned by the British bank HSBC and another leak in 2016 from the Bahamas were dominated by clients not from the United States.

The documents come not only from Appleby, but also from the Singaporean company Asiaciti Trust and official business registries in places such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Lebanon and Malta.

Setting up companies offshore is generally legal, and corporations routinely do so to facilitate cross-border transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Appleby, in a public statement on Oct. 24, after inquiries from I.C.I.J., said that it was “subject to frequent regulatory checks” in “highly regulated jurisdictions.”

“Appleby has thoroughly and vigorously investigated the allegations and we are satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients,” the company said.",Paradise Papers Shine Light on Where the Elite Hide Their Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/paradise-papers.html

CVS Health said on Monday that it would begin offering next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities next year, reflecting the company’s worries about potential competition from Amazon.

CVS Health also said its retail sales declined in the third quarter of this year, a dip that the company said occurred because of the three major hurricanes that forced many stores to close.

Amazon’s possible expansion into prescription drugs has set the pharmacy industry on edge in recent months, igniting fears that the online behemoth will upend the existing business in much the same way that it has disrupted other consumer markets, from books to household supplies to groceries.

Amazon has not publicly announced its plans. But it has acquired several state-level permits to be a wholesale pharmacy distributor over the past year and recently hired a handful of executives from the drug industry.

Anxiety over such a market upheaval is said to have partly driven CVS to enter into talks with Aetna, the large health insurer, over a potential acquisition. Larry Merlo, the president and chief executive of CVS Health, did not discuss the potential deal in a call with analysts on Monday.

Appleby, based in Bermuda, is one of the world’s largest offshore law firms. Its files offer a rare inside look at more than a dozen aircraft trusts structured by American financial institutions for privacy-seeking plane owners, primarily foreigners who otherwise would not be allowed to register with the F.A.A. There is a premium on American registration because it increases a plane’s resale value, the bureaucratic requirements are less costly and complex, and it is believed to draw less scrutiny as the aircraft moves around the world.

Among the plane owners seeking Appleby’s services were Shaher Abdulhak, a Yemeni businessman worth an estimated $9 billion whose investments included a Coca-Cola distributor in the Middle East; UPL, an Indian producer of industrial chemicals and pesticides; and Rashid Sardarov, a Russian oil billionaire and longtime client of Mossack Fonseca, the law firm whose leaked records in 2015 became known as the Panama Papers.

In serving these clients, files show, Appleby dealt with the two banks that are the most prolific creators of American aircraft trusts: Wells Fargo and Bank of Utah. It is easy to see how Wells Fargo, the third-largest bank in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and offices in 42 countries, might find a lucrative niche catering to the wealthy elite. Less obvious is how Bank of Utah, with 18 branches confined to one state, took the same path.

As it happens, a group of former Wells Fargo trust officers joined Bank of Utah about 10 years ago and created what would become a profitable part of the bank’s business. The bank collected $8.8 million in trust fees in 2016 — an increase of $1.1 million from the previous year, according to its most recent annual report.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Mr. Croasmun and Mr. Hansen took issue with the suggestion that they were exploiting a loophole to bypass restrictions on foreigners registering aircraft in the United States. By filling the role of “U.S. citizen” for registration purposes, the bank provided a valuable service for, say, multinational companies whose top executives might not be American, they said. The bank is clearly sensitive to concerns raised about the trusts. Its website carries a statement distancing itself from the planes it registers in its name, noting its only role is that of trustee.

In the case of Mr. Mikhelson, the trail leading from Russia to Utah began in September 2012, with an email to Appleby from the Moscow office of the accounting firm Ernst & Young. The firm wanted Appleby to set up a complex corporate structure for an unnamed client to purchase a Gulfstream jet, valued at roughly $65 million, and retain possession of it through a chain of companies in six countries.

From the outset, the goal was clear: “This structure,” wrote Svetlana Yakushina of Ernst & Young, “should allow registering the aircraft with the aviation authorities of the United States.”

How a Wealthy Foreigner Obtains U.S. Registration for a Private Jet The Russian oligarch Leonid Mikhelson wants to buy and register a private jet in the U.S., which requires American citizenship or residency. So a company he owns in Belize uses its company in the Cayman Islands, which uses its company in the British Virgin Islands to create a new company in Panama to buy the jet and record it in the Isle of Man for tax purposes, and to enter into a trusteeship with the Bank of Utah, which registers the jet in the U.S.

The arrangement would also permit the owner to avoid certain taxes, most notably a value-added tax of 20 percent if the jet were registered and used in the European Union. A six-page memo prepared by Ernst & Young laid out a plan to exploit a tax loophole offered by the Isle of Man, where about 1,000 privately owned aircraft are recorded on a government registry for tax purposes. Appleby and other similar firms maintain offices there.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Isle of Man allows owners to escape the value-added tax, or VAT, through a paper-shuffling scheme, wherein the jet is held by a company based there but leased to another company elsewhere, both controlled by the same owner. The tax is technically deferred into the future, through use of a special account managed by Ernst & Young, and then canceled out by the corporate structure. Research by the investigative journalists consortium suggests that Isle of Man-registered aircraft have escaped more than $1 billion in taxes.

According to a flow chart created by Appleby’s Isle of Man office for the Mikhelson account, the ownership chain for his jet began in Panama, with a company called Golden Star Aviation, which registered on the Isle of Man and then leased the aircraft to a Cayman Islands company called SWGI Growth Fund. Both companies were controlled by Mr. Mikhelson.

Mr. Mikhelson declined to answer questions about his plane. His representative released a statement saying, “Mr. Mikhelson acts strictly within the boundaries of the law and in compliance with applicable legislation at all times.”

By June 2013, lawyers at Appleby still had not learned of Mr. Mikhelson’s role, other than being told that the Gulfstream’s owner was Russian. Once the lawyers were informed of his identity by a Swiss firm that manages Mr. Mikhelson’s finances, they conducted a background check and concluded that, as with other clients from Russia, where the political and legal environment can be unstable, working for him would be “high risk.” But they decided to proceed.

Sanctions and ‘Citizenship’

A due-diligence report by Appleby noted Mr. Mikhelson’s source of wealth — valued currently at about $18 billion — from oil and gas investments, notably through Novatek, Russia’s largest nongovernment-owned gas company. Mr. Mikhelson’s main business partner is Gennady Timchenko, a close friend of Mr. Putin’s. The two businessmen are the primary investors in Sibur, a Russian gas-processing company.

Included in the report was a list of questions to determine if Mr. Mikhelson had any connections to the United States, including whether he had assets or maintained an address there. The answer to all of them was “no.” Flight records show that the plane has rarely, if ever, flown to the United States and instead makes trips within Russia or occasionally to cities in Europe and China.

Despite its lack of a connection to the United States, Mr. Mikhelson’s private jet was soon on its way to securing a registration with the F.A.A., thanks to Bank of Utah. It is not clear if the bank was ever told, or inquired, about the identity of the owner of the aircraft. Mr. Croasmun said that files indicated the owner “was Russian” but that identifying details were missing.

Whatever the case, the trust agreement for Mr. Mikhelson’s Gulfstream, filed with the F.A.A., does not name him in the document. Instead, the owner is listed as Golden Star Aviation, the Panamanian company he used to buy the plane.

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

What Doesn’t: Crime, Race or Mental Health

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Mass Shootings Happen Everywhere

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the world’s weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

Photo

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 incident. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

Outsmarting Our Primitive Responses to Fear Image Credit iStock

What scares you? Terrorism? Climate change? Snakes? Germs?

Whether it makes you buy a handgun or hand sanitizer, an electric car or an electric fence, fear drives much of human behavior. And it’s not just fear of physical harm that makes us want to hide under the covers. The twin fears of intimacy and rejection, for example, shape many of our social interactions.

Scientists say fear and its companion — the fight, flight or freeze response — can save us when faced with imminent physical harm.

This served us well when we were cave dwellers, under constant threat from marauding wild animals or invading warrior tribes. But it can often get in our way in modern life.

“Change has occurred so rapidly for our species that now we are equipped with brains that are super sensitive to threat but also super capable of planning, thinking, forecasting and looking ahead,” said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. “So we essentially drive ourselves nuts worrying about things because we have too much time and don’t have many real threats on our survival, so fear gets expressed in these really strange, maladaptive ways.”

Dr. Hariri studies the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure that has been called the seat of fear (there’s one in each hemisphere of the brain). But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions , or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety , hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder , insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation . It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax , whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

Just as fear can be contagious, so can courage , caring and calm.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

The company did not say whether it was testing the driverless cars in environments considered challenging for autonomous vehicles, like bridges or tunnels, or more difficult conditions, like driving at night or in rain and snow — usually not a big concern in the dry Phoenix climate.

While the prospect of cars without emergency drivers may raise concerns among some passengers, Waymo said it had confidence in the safety of its self-driving technology. It has included backup systems like a secondary computer to take over if the main computer fails. And though the cars are driverless, they are not entirely without humans, at least for now. Waymo employees sit in the back seat of the cars, monitoring them, a company spokesman, Johnny Luu, said.

Once passengers join the tests, they will be able to contact Waymo support staff with a button inside the car. If the cars are involved in a crash, they are programmed to respond appropriately, including pulling off the road on their own.

Driverless cars are regulated by a patchwork of state laws. Arizona, like many states, has no restrictions against operating an autonomous vehicle without a person in the driver’s seat. On the other hand, California, where Waymo is headquartered, requires any self-driving car to have a safety driver sitting in the front.

Waymo, which started as a research and development project for Google in 2009, has not said much about how it plans to make money despite maintaining what many in the industry consider a technological advantage over its competitors. Waymo said its autonomous vehicles have driven more than 3.4 million miles on actual roads — with safety drivers — as well as running 10 million miles every day in a virtual simulator.

In his remarks, Mr. Krafcik said Waymo sees a ride-hailing taxi service as the first application of Waymo’s driverless car technology, though there could be other uses in logistics and public transportation.

Taking the human out of the equation will fundamentally change transportation and change how people buy cars, said Mr. Krafcik, who was an executive at Hyundai Motors before joining Google.

“Because you’re accessing vehicles rather than owning, in the future, you could choose from an entire fleet of vehicle options that are tailored to each trip you want to make,” he said. “They can be designed for specific purposes or tasks.”",Waymo’s Autonomous Cars Cut Out Human Drivers in Road Tests,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/technology/waymo-autonomous-cars.html

Your character in “Mother!” was meant to be Eve. Did you think of her that way?

[Darren Aronofsky] was very careful not to make those references to us. I was just a woman who was still, after all these years, madly in love with my husband, and who is having a lot of family difficulties. A very real, very human place. And every now and then I would give Jen a really weird look [laughs loudly], just because.

Do you have to like your characters?

I have to find a way to like them. The character I found the most difficult was [the murderous mother in] “White Oleander.” She was evil. I couldn’t find anything to relate to. I remember counting the days that I didn’t have to be in [her] skin.

Ruth [Madoff] is very heroic in her own way. She’s a survivor. I understood completely her love for her family and devotion to those children, to her husband. That was really the crux of that character. We weren’t able to tell her story because it’s the Bernie Madoff story, but I actually encouraged her one day to tell it. But I understand why she wouldn’t want to.

Photo

Are there physical qualities about characters that you find difficult?

Absolutely, I never wanted to see that cat suit again. [After the 2007 fantasy film] “Stardust,” it’s like, never prosthetics to my face. My face was completely encapsulated; it was just so claustrophobic. It was maybe the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been.

Would you have done a Catwoman movie?

Are you kidding me? In a heartbeat. I loved that part. I felt like I was just getting comfortable and getting used to the claws and the mask, just figuring out how to move in all of that. There was a little bit of talk about that, then that kind of faded away.

Does it feel natural to get back to acting after time off, or do you have to warm up those muscles?

I had been off maybe five years, and I did “I Could Never Be Your Woman” with Paul Rudd, and I really felt rusty. I was surprised because I never felt like that. So I haven’t actually taken that much time off since then. I’m enjoying [acting] now more than I ever have, actually. Maybe because I don’t watch dailies anymore. I’m not really eager to look at my films. I’ll look at them once and not usually ever again. It’s better for me because I’m very critical and scrutinizing.

Photo

Some actors believe they should withhold a little bit on screen, so that the audience wants more of them.

Maybe I should try that. I don’t feel like I withhold, but I may not know that because I’m a little withholding as a person, so my gauge might be a bit off. I feel like I’m exuding all kinds of things. My husband has such an active inner world, the writer in him, that I think a lot of times he feels like he’s communicating to me when it’s just in his head. It makes me nuts. [Laughs]

You’ve said that you’re happiest when you’re working, so how did you find balance when you weren’t?

I tinker. I’m an oil painter — usually figure and portrait. I like to build things. I get out my tools, my hammer and my electric drill. When the kids were young I built them a playhouse. I redid the front of one of my fireplaces. I got this idea, I went into Home Depot or something, like, ‘Hey, I want to redo my fireplace, can you guys tell me how to do that?’ They looked at me like, what?

When you took a pause from acting, was it also because the roles were thin?

It seemed like it was harder and harder to say yes, and the roles didn’t warrant leaving my family. I didn’t want to disrupt their routine over and over again, so I started being very picky about when I worked, where, how long I was away, so it limited my choices. It may be that I just also didn’t want to work on a subliminal level. After five years I started to really yearn for the work and even my kids were saying, ‘Mom, aren’t you going to go back to work?’ Which kind of hurt my feelings.

Around the time we started looking at colleges, I realized how it was going to hit me really hard [to have an empty nest] and that I better get something going. I really need to feel like I’m creating something and that my life has meaning. I’m not just going to start playing bridge.

Photo

Early on, you said you had the guts to act because you weren’t afraid to fail. Do you still feel that way? Some people think failure is a building block.

It is for sure. And I’m always afraid of failing. Every new part I do I’m afraid I’m going to fail. I’m afraid I’m disappointing my director and you should have gotten someone else. I said to Steve Kloves [the writer-director of “The Fabulous Baker Boys”] when I started “Murder,” I said, “I’m ruining the film.” He laughed.

Why did you think that?

It’s challenging doing a period piece like that. The character is much more extroverted than I am, and so you have to really push yourself outside your comfort zone. It just takes jumping into the deep end, but it’s hard to trust that in the beginning. And so I was at that stage and I’m acting in front of Judi Dench, and I’m thinking O.K., you cannot bomb in front of Judi Dench. This just can’t happen.

[She’s] salty but salt-of-the-earth. She exudes this warmth; she’s lovely. When I met her, I just cried.

In front of her?

Yeah, tears coming down my face. Wah. I was just completely star-struck and moved by meeting her.

Did they have to cajole you to sing?

They didn’t, but they didn’t give me a lot of time to prepare. I got an email from Ken, and he was like, ‘I have this wacky idea, how would you like to sing this song?’ I haven’t sung since “Hairspray,” my vocal cords are rusted shut. I said, ‘I’ll give it a try, but you better have a backup.’ I don’t really consider myself a singer. I consider myself an actor who can sing just good enough in movies. If I really trained, I could be much better.

Do you feel an artist should reflect society or push ideas forward — or both? Do you feel any responsibility to do that?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I do. It’s because of owning that responsibility that I’ve actually passed on a number of projects that were very hard to turn down. I certainly don’t want to be putting out any more toxicity. I wouldn’t want to do anything, for instance, that was misogynistic.

When I did Elvira for “Scarface,” that was a very misogynistic relationship and that character obviously was pathetic. She was just an armpiece for her man. But by playing that part, you actually can say more sometimes than by getting up on your soapbox. I think it’s all in the way that’s presented. But I am always aware of that. Even at that [early] point.

Did you have any trepidation coming back now? There’s a lot more social-media scrutiny.

The only trepidation was I think I took for granted how nice it was to not be under the spotlight and just having a life. I remember thinking, ‘Do I really want to step back into this?’ And I just realized that I’m not done. I have a lot more to do, and a lot more to say.

But many of those tools do not apply to today’s deals, as A.M.D.’s Chinese pact shows.

A.M.D.’s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.

The park represents Beijing’s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China’s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.

Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.

Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.

But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.

Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers. China already makes the world’s fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers. With A.M.D.’s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make China’s supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.

“We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,” an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.

Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.’s control was not involved in chip development.

Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips. Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.

“When they first announced the partnership I was shocked,” said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.

“You would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,” Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. “It should. It’s surprising it isn’t.”

New Rules for a New Era?

For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.

Called “Unrestricted Warfare,” the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.

Some American officials see in it a guide to China’s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.

“There’s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,” said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.

Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China’s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.

Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them. The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules. But the W.T.O. has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.

At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm’s business.

The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.

“Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,” said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce.

“If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,” he said, “the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China — selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.”",China’s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/made-in-china-technology-trade.html

LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company recently held preliminary talks to buy entertainment assets owned by 21st Century Fox, including the Fox movie and television studio, the FX cable network and a share of Hulu.

The talks were first reported by CNBC on Monday and confirmed by two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private information. The two companies are no longer talking, although discussions could restart.

Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment.

The talks, however preliminary, say a lot about the rapidly evolving media industry. Big players like Disney are seeking to get bigger as they follow Netflix into the streaming business and square off against technology giants like AT&T, which is in the final stages of acquiring Time Warner. Medium-size players like 21st Century Fox may be realizing — or accepting — that gaining the scale they need to compete may be out of reach at this point.

In July, Discovery Communications spent $11.9 billion to buy Scripps Media, creating a powerhouse in unscripted television. Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation’s largest owner of television stations, has been trying to win regulatory approval for its $3.9 billion purchase of Tribune Media.

Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions — mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world’s population.

Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.

In May 2013, the Senate’s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple’s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared “tax residency” nowhere in the world.

Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is “managed and controlled” abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.

At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.

“Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

Ireland’s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country’s policies: “I do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.” Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.

But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.

At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.

Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.

“For those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby’s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. “They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”

In building Apple’s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.

Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was “a tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.”

Baker McKenzie’s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby’s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.

“Confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,” the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: “Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?”

(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, “As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.”)

Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby’s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.","After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Trump’s Asia Trip

President Trump started a five-country trip to Asia over the weekend, arriving in Japan for a series of meetings and public events with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

“Trump was in Japan yesterday, and plans to also visit Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Or, as Trump calls them, ‘China.’” — JAMES CORDEN “Following the president’s trip, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will then kick off his own 13-day trip to apologize for everything Donald Trump says.” — JAMES CORDEN

“On his way to Asia, he stopped off in Hawaii. Of course that’s Obama’s home state — very popular there — so people there did not want to say to Trump, ‘Aloha.’ They wanted to say, ‘Aloha.’ Look it up.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

Jimmy Kimmel looked at the trip from one of his favorite angles: He wondered about the eating habits of Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe and other world leaders.

“For lunch yesterday, before they played golf, they served Trump a hamburger made from American beef. That’s what they said, it’s made from American beef. I always wonder why when the leaders from other countries visit, they do that. Like when the prime minister of Italy was at the White House, they served him pasta. And he’s like, ‘Oh, great, pasta again.’ Why give these people what they already get a better version of all the time? They’re not hamsters that can only eat pellets. They’re people. If you’re going to make Donald Trump a hamburger in Japan, make him a hamburger with Japanese beef. Or maybe — and I know this is crazy — maybe pull him off the children’s menu for five seconds and serve him a bowl of noodles or something.” — JIMMY KIMMEL

Stephen Colbert Reacts to the Texas Church Shooting

Stephen Colbert took a moment during his show to address the mass shooting on Sunday in Sutherland Springs, Tex. He urged viewers to channel their frustration and sadness into a passion for gun control.

“Nothing gets done to control the guns that kill 10,000 people a year around America, not just in these mass killings. And doing nothing, as I’ve said before, is unacceptable. But it’s unnatural, it’s inhuman. It just goes against our nature — we want to fix things. You want to respond to something terrible like this, not just now but at any time in human history.” — STEPHEN COLBERT

The Punchiest Punchlines (Mayoral Edition)

“Mayor Bill de Blasio has a 33-point lead. After hearing this, the New York Giants said, ‘What’s a lead?’” — CONAN O’BRIEN, on Tuesday’s New York City mayoral election “Her name is Juli Briskman, and she just got fired for flipping off Trump’s motorcade. Wait a second, if you can’t give people the finger in traffic, then what’s the point of driving? That’s how we say ‘hello’ in New York! Especially if you’re from out of town. Hey, welcome to Manhattan.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, discussing a woman who was fired from her job after making an obscene gesture at Mr. Trump’s motorcade

The Bits Worth Watching

Conan O’Brien started a week of broadcasts from Harlem on Monday. He celebrated by seeking the counsel of an uptown legend: the stylist Dapper Dan. First he tried styling himself, though — which was a mistake.

Here’s Jordan Klepper on Mr. Trump’s visit to Japan.

The win was just Detroit’s second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).
The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.","With every short pass from Brett Hundley, every drive that ended in a field goal or a punt and every lingering shot of Aaron Rodgers standing on the sideline, it seemed like the Green Bay Packers were falling farther from anything resembling contention.

The N.F.C. North is far from having been decided, but after Green Bay’s 30-17 loss at home to the Detroit Lions on Monday night, the Lions certainly seem to have the better chance of challenging the Minnesota Vikings for division supremacy. And if the Packers continue to tumble and slip out of playoff contention, they might not even feel the need to bring Rodgers back once he is eligible to return in Week 15 from the injured reserve, where he landed after breaking his collarbone on Oct. 15.

For now, the North is Minnesota’s division to lose. At 6-2 and riding a four-game winning streak, the Vikings are two games ahead of both Detroit and Green Bay. The Upshot’s Playoff Simulator gives the Vikings a 65 percent chance of winning the division. But last season showed that a hot start by the Vikings does not guarantee much, as their 5-0 start to the season was undercut by a 3-8 finish, leaving the Packers and Lions to fight for the division crown on the final day of the regular season (the Packers won out).

When breaking down the three contenders, the biggest argument for the Lions is their quarterback stability. Matthew Stafford, who has not missed a game since 2010, is a true franchise quarterback (with a salary commensurate of such a distinction) who has a knack for late-game heroics. On Monday he did not need another of his signature comebacks, as he completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and two touchdowns in his team’s blowout win.

The win was just Detroit’s second victory in Green Bay since the start of the 1992 season (a span of 27 games).

The Packers are in dire straits with Hundley, who was rarely asked to throw the ball more than five yards on Monday night, but they at least have the benefit of having a long-term plan at quarterback (hint: It’s Rodgers). The same cannot be said of the Vikings, who have a complicated quarterback controversy on their hands.

In the waning days of the campaign, Ms. Guadagno veered to the right on immigration, accusing Mr. Murphy of seeking to turn New Jersey into a “sanctuary state,” releasing a controversial TV ad about an infamous murder in Newark and declaring, inaccurately, that her opponent would allow violent criminals to stay in the country.

Other Notable Races

In the New York City suburbs, several races have turned quite vicious. In the Nassau County race for county executive, a mailer suggests one candidate would “roll out the welcome mat” for the violent street gang MS-13. In the Westchester County executive race, issues have taken a back seat to talk about a Rolex watch, unpaid parking tickets and so-called dark money from a Trump-friendly PAC.

The next district attorney in Suffolk County on Long Island will face pressing questions about how to handle the opioid epidemic and MS-13. The sitting district attorney, who had announced months ago he would not seek re-election, was charged last month with trying to derail a federal investigation into a brutal assault by the county’s former police chief.

The candidates to replace him are Ray Perini, a Republican, and Tim Sini, a Democrat.

And President Trump’s influence on local politics has been deeply felt in Greenwich, Conn., where political newcomers, many of them women, are seeking seats on the council that handles town business.

A Constitutional Convention?

And finally, a statewide proposition, Proposition 1, would force a monthslong, everything-on-the-table examination of New York State’s founding document by authorizing a constitutional convention — the first in the nation in more than a quarter-century.

The question has split some like-minded groups, such as the League of Women Voters of New York and Planned Parenthood, while uniting some conservatives and major labor groups.

Like Rachel, he reads lips. Communicating on the phone with a deaf person is often not ideal, so we used video chat or email to correspond and give creative notes. I went to London to work with James and his colleagues for a few days, and interacting in person helped our process — but I could say that about any collaboration.

“When I work with voice-over, I’m hardly ever able to work out what’s being said from the voice track alone,” James explained. “I can hear when something is being said, but not so much what is being said. So I use a combination of the audio track and the transcript with time stamps. The audio waveform, which I can see on the computer screen, helps me to sync things up. If I still can’t work it out, there’s usually a friendly producer nearby who can help me fill in the gaps.”

At one point, before we had a crucial sound cue built in, James threw in some sound cues himself, but the volume levels were really loud so he could hear them. When we watched and listened to that version together, the hearing collaborators dove for the volume. We all laughed about it and James apologized, but it taught us a lesson: James’s sound cues were the only ones we felt as well as heard. That mattered for our sound design. In the moment when Rachel’s cochlear implants are turned on, we aimed to have a sound cue that jolted us physically.

We also wanted an acoustically extraordinary setting. Since there is a detail in Rachel’s op-ed about her first experiences hearing live music after getting her implant, we asked her where those experiences happened and which ones were the most impactful. The Santa Fe Opera, near her home in New Mexico, was at the top of her list. It generously opened its doors, and the back wall of its open-air stage, so we could film Rachel there with a twilit desert backdrop.

While the animations were being developed, we landed a partnership with the technical wizards at Lytro to create our live-action scenes. Their light field technology can bring an extraordinary amount of depth and detail to a virtual reality image. The biggest VR camera we use regularly at The Times is about the size of a basketball. Lytro’s camera is the size of a sumo wrestler. It gathers about 475 times more visual information than we do for a standard VR piece. Lytro’s system also features Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF), which enables the viewer in aheadset to move around within the piece. If you are standing in front of a person, you can close the distance to them or step farther away. If you are watching an animation, you can crouch down or swivel to the side to see what the image looks like from a different angle. This freedom of movement increases the sense that you are right there with Rachel. It’s what we call “presence” — the magic of VR.

During this process, we were also working closely with Brendan Baker, a sound designer whom I knew from his work on the podcast “Love + Radio,” which is known for its innovative use of sound in storytelling. I thought of him as the mad scientist of the podcast world, which was exactly what we needed to create a sound design that could accurately represent the sounds that Rachel was hearing when she first turned on her cochlear implant. The production company Q Department came in on the back end to spatialize the sound design so the sound would adjust as you moved your head in the headset.

When Rachel got that playlist from her friends, she was trying to do something she hadn’t done before: hear music. In working on this piece, we were trying to do some things we hadn’t done before. We were trying to create a VR piece that was animated, that incorporated new 6DoF technologies and that told Rachel’s story with the depth and sensitivity it deserved. In the VR department, our jobs are the most exciting when we can use a new technology to shine a light on an important story.

Mr. Paul, 54, has long stood out in the well-to-do gated neighborhood south of Bowling Green, Ky., that he calls home. The senator grows pumpkins on his property, composts and has shown little interest for neighborhood regulations.

But the spectacle of the incident — one former doctor attacking another in broad daylight — was altogether different. Competing explanations of the origins of the drama cited stray yard clippings, newly planted saplings and unraked leaves.

“We don’t have squabbles out here,” said Jackie Douglas, a neighbor of the two men. “If you can afford to live out here, you tend to your own business.”

The two men were anything but strangers. Mr. Paul and Mr. Boucher have lived next to each other for 17 years, and at one point even worked at the same hospital. Mr. Boucher practiced for many years as an anesthesiologist and invented a rice-filled vest used for back pain. He now lives alone, neighbors said.

Matthew J. Baker, a lawyer for Mr. Boucher, called the matter “a very regrettable dispute” between neighbors over a “trivial” matter.

The incident “has absolutely nothing to do with either’s politics or political agendas,” Mr. Baker said in a statement on Monday. “It was a very regrettable dispute between two neighbors over a matter that most people would regard as trivial.”

“We sincerely hope that Senator Paul is doing well and that these two gentlemen can get back to being neighbors as quickly as possible,” Mr. Baker said.

In Kentucky and in Washington, Mr. Baker’s comment about the “trivial” nature of the dispute prompted speculation about what had gone down, and how long Mr. Paul would remain at home.

Neighbors said it was well known that the men had strongly divergent political views — Mr. Paul is a libertarian who identifies as a Republican; Mr. Boucher is a registered Democrat. But they said the dispute had more to do with long-simmering tensions over their adjacent properties than politics.

“They just couldn’t get along. I think it had very little to do with Democrat or Republican politics,” said Jim Skaggs, who developed the gated community and who lives nearby. “I think it was a neighbor-to-neighbor thing. They just both had strong opinions, and a little different ones about what property rights mean.”

Asked about long-leveled allegations that Mr. Paul had disregarded neighborhood regulations, Mr. Skaggs, who is also a former leader of the county Republican Party, said that the senator “certainly believes in stronger property rights than exist in America.”

Mr. Porter, who says he spoke with Mr. Paul on Saturday after the incident, said the senator told him he and Mr. Boucher had not talked in years. Mr. Porter said he was not familiar with any landscaping disputes between the two neighbors.

“He is still unsure why he was attacked,” Mr. Porter said. “I don’t know if he knows why he was attacked.”

Doug Stafford, a senior strategist to Mr. Paul, declined to answer questions about the dispute on Monday. He said only that it was “a pending, serious criminal matter involving state and federal authorities.”

On Sunday, Mr. Paul wrote on Twitter that the altercation was an “unfortunate event.” Initial reports described his injuries as “minor,” and a spokeswoman for Mr. Paul said the senator was “fine.”

The three Kentucky Republicans, who requested anonymity to discuss the case, said Mr. Paul had been embarrassed by the incident and was not interested in drawing attention to it.

Mr. Paul spoke on Monday with his fellow Kentucky senator, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who wished him a speedy recovery.

Mr. Boucher was charged with fourth-degree assault and released on $7,500 bond. He is set to appear in court on Thursday.

The Paradise Papers exposed the hidden financial dealings of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Queen Elizabeth and the athletic apparel company Nike, among many others. As revelations about tax-dodging airplane purchases and secret Russian ownership in tech companies came to light, Appleby declared that it takes its clients’ confidentiality seriously and billed itself as “not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act.”

In an age in which personal consumer data is routinely plundered for profit, it’s smart public relations for law firms like Appleby and the tax havens in which their clients hide their assets to present themselves as victims of a global crime epidemic. There is also genuine belief operating here. Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, the founders of the law firm whose hacked files formed the heart of the Panama Papers, described their work as safeguarding their clients’ fundamental right to privacy in their financial affairs. Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca insisted that when their customers asked them to set up hundreds of thousands of anonymous companies, trusts and foundations, it too was in the interest of privacy.

However, in the world of offshore finance, privacy long ago became a corrosive secrecy.

HOUSTON — I’m already feeling sorry for Johnnie Clay Langendorff, who is probably well on his way to a dinner invitation at the Trump White House for driving the car that chased Devin Patrick Kelley out of Sutherland Springs, with an armed sidekick literally riding shotgun. I’ve already caught him on several broadcasts, with the word “hero” running on the banner below the video of Mr. Langendorff respectfully “yes ma’aming” and “no sir-ing” the confounded reporters.

I suspect it’s only a matter of time before the N.R.A. tries to give the kid in the cowboy hat and starched denim shirt whatever award it already has or is currently cooking up for valor under fire. There will, no doubt, be references to the “long, tall Texan,” his drawl and his style. That bull skull tattoo with the horns curling under his jawline? Central casting could not have done better.

Similar accolades will no doubt be lavished on Stephen Willeford, who jumped into Mr. Langendorff’s truck and was, possibly, ready to take Mr. Kelley out while they were giving chase. Mr. Willeford had already used his weapon to take a crack at the gunman fleeing the First Baptist Church, and once he hitched a ride with Mr. Langendorff, he kept a bead on Mr. Kelley until the law finally arrived. We will never know whether Mr. Willeford would have had to fire or not, or would have killed Mr. Kelley or not, because Mr. Kelley killed himself somewhere between the church and the ditch he ran his car into.

At least, some of us will never know. President Trump seemed to have an answer: “Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldn’t have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse.” And there was our state attorney general, Ken Paxton, crowing about Texas’ open carry law, which allows anyone to hang out just about anywhere with a gun on their hip. Mr. Paxton put it this way: “And so if it’s a place where somebody has the ability to carry, there’s always the opportunity that gunman will be taken out before he has the opportunity to kill very many people.”

So of course it stands to reason that the heroes who get that opportunity are Texans. What a boon for the pro-gun forces! I can imagine these two on Fox News now, assuming they don’t turn out to be in favor of something crazy like an assault weapons ban. But we know what will happen next: Mr. Langendorff and Mr. Willeford will have their 15 minutes of fame, and then we will move on to the next mass shooting in another state where any number of people will die because no one can be bothered to go up against the N.R.A.

When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control.

A domestic violence update could be next, especially for violators in or discharged from the military. An online repository of active records maintained by the F.B.I.’s Criminal Justice Information Services shows that the Department of Defense had reported just one case of domestic violence as of Dec. 31, 2016. Although federal law lists 11 criteria that would bar someone from purchasing a gun — including being the subject of a protective order for domestic violence or conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor — all but a tiny handful of the military’s 11,000 reported cases were in one category: dishonorable discharge.

Mr. Blumenthal, long a proponent of expanding gun safety laws, said that if the records in the online repository are accurate, it would be a “major lapse.”

A 2015 Inspector General review faulted the Defense Department’s level of compliance with the Lautenberg Amendment, as the 1996 law is known, but focused on vetting current and future service members, not on how military domestic violence cases were reported to the federal database. Laura Cutilletta, the legal director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said her group had reviewed multiple military documents pertaining to compliance with the Lautenberg Amendment and had not found a procedure for reporting convictions to the F.B.I.

“Clearly, they do have a process,” she said, but “they’re only sending the dishonorable discharges.”

Experts who investigate mass shootings say a history of domestic violence is often a missed clue. One example: the June 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. The wife of Omar Mateen, the gunman, described him in an interview with The New York Times as someone who angered easily, beat her and lived his life in secret.

“We have seen over and over this pattern where in these notorious mass shootings, it is a very common thread where the person had a particular history of domestic violence,” said Billy Rosen, the deputy legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety. “A history of this particular kind of conduct may really demonstrate that someone has dangerous propensities and should not be allowed to have guns.”

Using F.B.I. data and other publicly available information, Everytown analyzed mass shootings in the United States that occurred from 2009 to 2016, defining a mass shooting as one in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter. Of 156 shootings that fit that category, 54 percent were “related to domestic or family violence,” the analysis found.

In the case of Mr. Kelley, he entered a pretrial agreement — much like a plea bargain in the civilian world — where he pleaded guilty in return for capping his maximum sentence at 18 months. He was sentenced to a year of confinement, a reduction in rank from airman first class to airman basic and was discharged for bad conduct, according to Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force at the time.

Mr. Christensen said he believed that the assault case disqualified Mr. Kelley on two separate grounds under federal law from owning a gun.

The first was pleading guilty to a crime with a maximum punishment of more than a year’s confinement; the assault on the stepson would have had a maximum of five years. The second, he said, was the Lautenberg Amendment.

“The real story is why, with these offenses, was he still able to buy a gun?” Mr. Christensen said. “He clearly should not have been able to.”

He noted that the military justice system uses different terminology than civilian criminal courts, which could explain why Mr. Kelley’s conviction was not reported. “That could be part of the problem here, our use of archaic terms that don’t translate well to the civilian world,” he said.

When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control. Lawmakers had already adopted a ban on military-style assault weapons — that law has since lapsed — and prohibited the purchase of large-capacity ammunition magazines.

But the Gun Control Act of 1968, which regulated the purchase of firearms, stipulated that only convicted felons could be prohibited from buying guns. “The question kept coming up, what about domestic violence, because its often a misdemeanor, and we knew that there was a linkage between gun violence and domestic violence,” Mr. Aborn said. “That was the birth of the whole conversation.”

But the law’s definition of who is a domestic abuser is “quite specific,” said Mr. Rosen, of the Everytown group. The measure requires, for example, that the victim and the abuser have to have been married or have had a child together, or have lived together. Thus the Lautenberg Amendment does not apply to people who are dating, which gives rise to what advocates call “the boyfriend loophole.”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has introduced legislation that would close that loophole, and would also prevent stalkers from having guns. A 2014 report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress reviewed conviction records in 20 states, and found that nearly 12,000 people across the country had been convicted of misdemeanor-level stalking, but were still permitted to own guns.

“The Lautenberg Amendment was bare bones,” said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “There are a lot of gaps in the instant criminal justice system; the data is only as good as what goes into it. So if the data is not in the system, obviously there is a giant loophole there.”","Domestic Abusers Are Barred From Gun Ownership, but Often Escape the Law",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/politics/domestic-abuse-guns-texas-air-force.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Most of us solve crossword puzzles in our SPARE TIME, but I’ve gotten mail from people who have told me that they solved under their desks during classes to make a boring lecture go faster. In another lifetime, I raced my boss to see who could finish fastest when we should have been working. So clearly, spare time is the not the same as down time. Spare time is all in the eye of the solver.

Roland Huget returns with a wide open grid that has only 60 words in it. The pinwheel design intrigued me, although I felt a bit boxed in by the long, black square “arms” that made, as he admits, the puzzle feel like four mini-crosswords. If I’m going to be boxed in, so to speak, I like to see each sector really shine, and I’m not sure this one did it for me. As always, your mileage may vary, but there are more “RE-” words in here than I like to see (RELET, REVOICE, REBOX, REAWAKENS) and each section has some gluey bits that made me feel as if the majority of the puzzle had been filled using the autofill option in a puzzle constructing software program.

Yes, I know it’s Saturday. There is some nice fill in here (I liked SEAFARERS, GO IT ALONE, SPARE TIME, LOSE A STEP). And PAPETERIE might just become the ETUI of stationery products one day. But I really like some knotty wordplay in my late week cluing, and this seemed mostly definitional. Combine that with the lack of real sparklers in the fill, and the puzzle as a whole feels vaguely disappointing. To me. You might feel otherwise, and that’s perfectly O.K.

Tricky Clues

The Tricky Clues section is generally limited to clues that involve some sort of wordplay, and there wasn’t much of it in today’s puzzle. Even so, here is a selection of clues that might have been speed bumps for some solvers.

41A: Foreign language in the clue = foreign language answer. “Un examen” is “a test” in French, so the answer would be ELEVE, or French for “student.”

36D: “It’s not the main story” is a SUBPLOT.

43D: Now we’re talking, sort of. “It can get the blood flowing” could be anything exciting, but today it’s a STENT.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle was constructed in October 2016 and accepted for publication in February of this year. It is one of a series of open grids that I constructed in the late summer and fall of 2016. This grid has the largest open square count of any I have constructed to date. The layout of the blocks was designed for that purpose. It is as close to being four independent mini-puzzles as you can get, and this fact needs to be taken into account in the cluing so that solvers can gain a foothold. This grid took longer than most to construct, and in the end required compromises, as has been my experience with many puzzles. The Scrabble average often suffers in grids like this because the friendliest letters in the open areas tend to be the ones with the lowest scores. I hope solvers enjoy this one.

He noted that the military justice system uses different terminology than civilian criminal courts, which could explain why Mr. Kelley’s conviction was not reported. “That could be part of the problem here, our use of archaic terms that don’t translate well to the civilian world,” he said.

When Congress adopted the Lautenberg Amendment in 1996, the nation was in the mood to enact gun safety laws, said Richard Aborn, a longtime advocate for gun safety and the former president of the Brady Center, which advocates gun control. Lawmakers had already adopted a ban on military-style assault weapons — that law has since lapsed — and prohibited the purchase of large-capacity ammunition magazines.

But the Gun Control Act of 1968, which regulated the purchase of firearms, stipulated that only convicted felons could be prohibited from buying guns. “The question kept coming up, what about domestic violence, because its often a misdemeanor, and we knew that there was a linkage between gun violence and domestic violence,” Mr. Aborn said. “That was the birth of the whole conversation.”

But the law’s definition of who is a domestic abuser is “quite specific,” said Mr. Rosen, of the Everytown group. The measure requires, for example, that the victim and the abuser have to have been married or have had a child together, or have lived together. Thus the Lautenberg Amendment does not apply to people who are dating, which gives rise to what advocates call “the boyfriend loophole.”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, has introduced legislation that would close that loophole, and would also prevent stalkers from having guns. A 2014 report by the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress reviewed conviction records in 20 states, and found that nearly 12,000 people across the country had been convicted of misdemeanor-level stalking, but were still permitted to own guns.

“The Lautenberg Amendment was bare bones,” said Kim Gandy, the chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “There are a lot of gaps in the instant criminal justice system; the data is only as good as what goes into it. So if the data is not in the system, obviously there is a giant loophole there.”","Domestic Abusers Are Barred From Gun Ownership, but Often Escape the Law",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/politics/domestic-abuse-guns-texas-air-force.html

“For the record, I’m black, gay and Latino,” he said.
And if one of the candidates of color does win, I don’t think it will be because of their race,” said Mr. Levine.

In many ways, the speakership race is New York politics at its unfiltered purest: a stew of ethnic and geographic alliances and grievances, a throwback to powerful party bosses cutting back-room deals and special interest lobbying, all with billions of dollars of decisions at stake.

Technically, the next speaker must simply secure a majority of the 51-member council, or 26 votes. The reality is far more complex, with party leaders in the Bronx and Queens effectively controlling 20-plus ballots. The choice of those bosses, in turn, is shaped by concentric circles of influence that include union leaders, members of Congress, the mayor and ethnic politicking.

Four years ago, Mr. de Blasio threw his weight behind Ms. Mark-Viverito, in part because she was a Latina, according to two advisers involved in the decision. This time around, the mayor has notably not weighed in yet on the contest.

“For us to try to act like race doesn’t matter would be us ignoring reality,” said Michael Blake, an African-American assemblyman from the Bronx and a vice-chair of the national Democratic Party.

Mr. Blake said he is opposed to doing “things to check boxes,” but said the ideal pick would either represent “sizable blocks of communities of color” or be a member of such a community themselves.

One box that has yet to be checked in New York is having an African-American council speaker. Ms. Mark-Viverito is a woman and the first Hispanic person to hold the post; her predecessor was the first woman and the first openly gay speaker.

The chance to make history again has led to a fascinating dynamic in which the candidates have engaged in a sometimes comical arms race to brandish their diversity qualifications.

Councilman Jumaane Williams of Brooklyn, in his closing statement at a speakership forum last week, noted his battle with Tourette’s and ADHD and, tongue-in-cheek, added, “I also have been black for most of my life.”

Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer of Queens talked about his time as a homeless youth and quipped, “I have been gay my entire life, and that’s why I should be speaker.”

Mr. Torres topped them both. “For the record, I’m black, gay and Latino,” he said. “So on identity politics alone …”

He didn’t have to finish the sentence. Everyone laughed. Then the parade of first-ness marched on.

Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan, an immigrant born in the Dominican Republic, said, “I want to be the speaker with the accent.” Mr. Cornegy, who is black, opened with the fact that he is a father of six. Mr. Johnson highlighted that he is not only gay but H.I.V. positive. (It went unmentioned on stage, but Mr. Johnson’s grandmother was Korean.)

Mr. Levine, the only straight white man of the eight, joked he was the only left-handed person on stage: “I believe that should be a qualification!”

In an interview, and in private conversations with his colleagues, Mr. Levine has emphasized that he represents a district “that is overwhelmingly Latino and African-American” in Upper Manhattan, and that he lives in a “Spanish-speaking home, and my kids learned English not until they went to school.”

“If I don’t win, I don’t think it will be because of my race. And if one of the candidates of color does win, I don’t think it will be because of their race,” said Mr. Levine. “I think it will be a much more nuanced, and even complicated, decision.”

Mr. Rodriguez said his Latino heritage was central to his candidacy. Unless a Latino is selected as speaker, he said, when Ms. Mark-Viverito departs, “there’s not going to be another voice of the second-largest community in our city” in any citywide post.

Among the other complexities is the ongoing leadership tussle in Albany.

There, the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie of the Bronx, is African-American, but the Senate Democratic leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, an African-American woman from Westchester, has been denied the post of majority leader in large part because a breakaway faction of Democrats has sided with Republicans. Race has been a dynamic in that fight.

“Let me just say, we have always had white men in power,” Letitia James, New York City’s public advocate and only black citywide official, said at a rally in Harlem for Ms. Stewart-Cousins over the summer.

That argument, made with a bit more subtlety, may not prove decisive, but it has fundamentally shaped the landscape of the speaker’s race.

Hans Fiene in The Federalist:



“For those with little understanding of and less regard for the Christian faith, there may be no greater image of prayer’s futility than Christians being gunned down mid-supplication. But for those familiar with the Bible’s promises concerning prayer and violence, nothing could be further from the truth.”

Jacob Sullum in Reason:

“The problem was not the absence of a background check but the inadequacy of the background check that was performed.”

Mr. Sullum, writing for the libertarian Reason magazine, points out that both Devin Kelley, whom the police identified as the gunman in the mass shooting in Texas, and Dylan S. Roof, who was found guilty last year of killing nine parishioners in South Carolina, slipped through a system of background checks meant to prevent them from buying firearms. The problem, he points out, is not the lack of screening, but the efficacy of the system. Read more »

Mr. Gleeson faced several challenges — he was 15 years younger and far taller than Churchill’s 5 feet 6 inches.
But like many British actors before him, Mr. Gleeson said the biggest obstacle was getting “the idea of him as a hero out of my head.”","The movie also tries to understand Churchill through his use of language, with the sound of typewriters constantly clacking in the background. “They are the most iconic speeches in the history of the English language and they were all written in 28 days, so how these speeches came to be and how he came to express the will and the sentiment of the nation is really the subject,” Mr. Wright added.

In one of the most stirring scenes, Churchill famously addresses the House of Commons, arguing that the British need to face the Nazi threat at all costs: “If we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, ‘This was their finest hour.’”

Speaking those words is a dream for actors, but the role also represents an enormous risk, Mr. Oldman said, where you could easily slip into caricature. “He’s quite often portrayed as old, grumpy, a curmudgeon. Lugubrious and grunting and shouting,” Mr. Oldman said. “That’s how I’ve seen him played and I think that contaminated my own thinking about him.”

To get at the man beneath those cigar-puffing, jowly stereotypes, enhanced by makeup, Mr. Oldman spent four months researching and preparing for the role — watching footage, reading his many works and those of biographers like Martin Gilbert and even the politician Boris Johnson. He visited Churchill’s family homes, Chartwell and Blenheim Palace, and talked to people who knew him. “I discovered a man who was not as fat as we all thought he was in 1940 and who had really an athletic tread. He skipped around and he had this sort of stoop and it was forward moving,” Mr. Oldman said, adding, “There’s a real twinkle in the eye, and he has humor. The Churchill I saw and I discovered had charm.”

Mr. Oldman also spent time in the war rooms in Westminster where those fateful decisions were made, and sat in the great man’s chair. “On the left-hand arm of the chair were these marks where he had made scratches with his nails,” the actor recalled. “And on the right-hand side were scratches from his ring that he used to wear. He was in this chair throughout the war, so you can imagine the stress and strain that he was under.”

What many people now fail to realize, he added, is “how precariously close he came to disaster” and that he was himself resistant to war. “His most powerful and beautiful words were about the horror of war.”

With “Darkest Hour,” Mr. Oldman now joins a long line of actors who have played Churchill, including Albert Finney, Richard Burton and even a satire featuring Christian Slater. Here’s a look at a few other memorable turns.

Brian Cox, ‘Churchill’ (2017)

In Jonathan Teplitzky’s recent film, Mr. Cox plays Churchill opposite Miranda Richardson as his devoted wife, Clemmie, during the 96 hours leading up to D-Day. Mr. Cox’s Churchill, one reviewer in The Telegraph wrote, was “a distant cousin of a brown bear, or a Hereford bull, snuffling and stalking through his subterranean Whitehall war rooms, champing at underlings and barking at his reflection.”

John Lithgow, ‘The Crown’ (2016)

Mr. Lithgow’s version often comes across as a grandfatherly figure to Claire Foy’s Queen Elizabeth II in this Netflix series. To get into character, he donned a fat suit, a wig and plumpers to swell his jowls. He told The Los Angeles Times, “I never would have chosen myself” for the role. “I’m so different than him. I’m so tall and so American.” Still, his portrayal won him an Emmy in 2017.

Timothy Spall, ‘The King’s Speech’ (2010)

There’s been much debate over what this movie got right and wrong about the rise of George VI — see Christopher Hitchens’s writings for withering criticism. But Mr. Spall proved a welcome addition in a cameo as Churchill. So much so that he was invited to perch atop a fake Big Ben and perform as Churchill giving Caliban’s speech from “The Tempest” at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.

Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home. Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.

I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.

There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders. A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.

There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets. One of the most frequent excuses: “I’m only going to the store (or the gym).” Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds. Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.

“A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds,” said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. “All it takes is gravity – the distance to the ground – to cause a head injury.”

Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury. “There’s often a rebellion aspect among teens,” Mr. Swart said. “They say, ‘All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe. Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.’” College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.

I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle. I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases I’ve observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.

The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the child’s (or adult’s) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures. When the straps are too loose (or, as I’ve often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.

The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head. The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.

“A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt – it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it,” Mr. Swart said.

Another excuse I’ve heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions. And that is true. You don’t even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion. A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head. What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.

If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones. His organization had three “extremely cheap” helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three “very expensive” ones ($150 and above) and, he said, “their performance level was almost identical.”

So if you’re not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said. They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.

By law, Australia will not resettle any migrants who approach the country by boat, a policy intended to discourage dangerous ocean crossings and human smuggling.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia has urged the migrants to move to the temporary accommodations in Lorengau.

“There are alternative facilities available of a very high quality, with food and all of the facilities,” Mr. Turnbull said on Tuesday.

The Australian Medical Association has called for “independent verification” of the health of the men who remain at the camp.

The detainees said that being denied water, food and electricity at the shuttered camp violated their human rights.

Mr. Boochani, the Kurdish journalist, said last week that the men were experiencing dehydration, hunger and anxiety. Another detainee said some of the men had fallen ill and were unable to get the necessary medical attention.

Among the men who had already left the camp, many said they felt guilty they were not able to stand in solidarity with those who had stayed behind.

“I feel guilt whenever I drink or eat,” said Ben Moghimi, a refugee from Iran who had been held on Manus for years, but on Tuesday was receiving medical care in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. “I tried to go back to Manus, but they won’t let me. I want to be there with them.”

On Sunday, hundreds of the men holed up in the center signed a letter addressed to the leaders of the United States, Canada and New Zealand, pleading for their help amid the standoff.

“We have no any other choices except for remaining in here,” the men wrote, urging the world leaders “to help us.”

On Sunday, during her first visit to Australia as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern renewed her country’s offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, the site of a second Australian detention center. She said New Zealand had an obligation “to make sure that we maintain our obligations to the United Nations to take refugees.”

Mr. Turnbull said Australia would not take up the offer “at this time.”

About 50 of the men have already been resettled in the United States.","Manus Island Refugees Fail to Get Power, Water and Food Restored",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/australia/manus-island-refugees.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

NEW BRAUNFELS, Tex. — He beat his wife, cracked his toddler stepson’s skull and was kicked out of the military. He drove away friends, drew attention from the police and abused his dog. Before Devin P. Kelley entered a rural Texas church with a military-style rifle, killing at least 26 people on Sunday, he led a deeply troubled life in which few in his path escaped unscathed.

In 2012, while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Mr. Kelley was charged with assault, according to Air Force records, which said he had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his first wife beginning just months into their marriage, and hit his stepson’s head with what the Air Force described as “a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.”

“He assaulted his stepson severely enough that he fractured his skull,” said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force, adding, “He pled to intentionally doing it.”

Prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with Mr. Kelley, including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wife.

He was ultimately sentenced in November that year to 12 months’ confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank. His final duty title was “prisoner.”

His first wife, Tessa Kelley, divorced him while he was confined and was awarded the couple’s only four household items of value: a television, an Xbox, a wedding ring and a revolver.

After his confinement, Mr. Kelley was forced out of the military with a bad conduct discharge. The Air Force said the conviction should have barred Mr. Kelley from owning any guns. Instead, law enforcement officials say, he bought several.

Friends from New Braunfels, Tex., where he went to high school, expressed shock in the aftermath of the shooting, remembering how Mr. Kelley was a friendly, if awkward, teenager who grew up active in his church. His senior yearbook photo shows him smiling, with untamed hair and a Hollister T-shirt. But in recent years, friends said, he grew so dark that many unfriended him on Facebook.

“I had always known there was something off about him. But he wasn’t always a ‘psychopath,’” a longtime friend, Courtney Kleiber, posted on Facebook on Sunday. “We had a lot of good times together. Over the years we all saw him change into something that he wasn’t. To be completely honest, I’m really not surprised this happened, and I don’t think anyone who knew him is very surprised either.”

Instead of straightening out after his bad conduct discharge, Mr. Kelley began a long downward slide that culminated in the shooting Sunday.

After getting out of confinement, Mr. Kelley moved into a barn at his parents’ house, which they had converted into an apartment, according to the local sheriff’s office records.

During the next two years, he was investigated twice for abusing women. The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley’s hometown New Braunfels, released records on Monday that showed he had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape in 2013.

The investigation ended without the filing of any charges — Mr. Kelley’s only skirmishes in the local courts were traffic violations.

Photo

Less than a year after the sexual assault report, deputies were summoned again after Mr. Kelley’s girlfriend at the time, Danielle Shields, reportedly sent a text message to a friend saying she was being abused. Deputies who responded told a dispatcher, according to the report, that it was a “misunderstanding and teenage drama.” Mr. Kelley married Ms. Shields two months later, local records show.

At the time of both episodes, Mr. Kelley’s appeals were still pending before military courts.

Mr. Kelley was finally discharged from the Air Force in 2014. He married Ms. Shields in April that year. Law enforcement officials described their relationship this week as “estranged.”

A few months after the wedding, the couple moved to Colorado Springs, where voter registration documents list his address as Parking Space 60 at a collection of trailers in a gravel lot called the Fountain Creek RV Park.

A woman living in a camper next door, who gave her name only as Susan, said a man of similar age and description lived in Spot 60 for a few months during that time.

“He was kind of off,” she said as she loaded blankets into one of the RV park’s washing machines.

He said hello a few times in passing but was never friendly and stayed only a few months, she said. She never heard any arguments from his trailer.

“The only thing that sticks out about him was his dog,” she said.

He had a puppy that he kept tied up in the sun all day outside his RV without water, she said. She also recalled an episode in which the police were called because he had struck the dog repeatedly in the head.

Records show Mr. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, in August 2014, pleaded guilty and was given a deferred sentence. He moved out a few weeks later, she said.

While in Colorado and Texas, Mr. Kelley purchased a number of guns at gun stores, according to law enforcement officials. On Monday, the Air Force admitted that it had failed to enter information from Mr. Kelley’s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the weapon used in the church attack.

Mr. Kelley, whose father, Michael Kelley, is a computer programmer and accountant, enlisted in the Air Force soon after graduating from New Braunfels High School in 2009. Devin Kelley served as a low-ranking airman in a logistics readiness unit. A LinkedIn account in his name says he worked in cargo and distribution before his court-martial.

The account says that after the military, Mr. Kelley briefly worked as an aide at a youth Bible school in Kingsville, Tex., “helping their minds grow and prosper.”

Friends said on Facebook that in recent years, Mr. Kelley had become vocally anti-Christian, to the point where many stopped communicating with him. His Facebook page, which has been deleted, listed that he liked a number of atheist groups.

“He was always talking about how people who believe in God were stupid and trying to preach his atheism,” one of his Facebook friends, Nina Rosa Nava, posted on the site, saying she unfriended him because of it.

Law enforcement stopped short of saying religious views may have influenced Mr. Kelley, saying Monday that the shooting may have been motivated by a “domestic situation” involving Mr. Kelley’s estranged wife and her family.

Video

Mr. Kelley never held jobs for long after the military. In June of this year, Mr. Kelley was hired as an unarmed night security guard at Schlitterbahn, a vast water park in New Braunfels. Less than six weeks later he was “terminated,” a spokeswoman for the park, Winter D. Prosapio, said Monday, adding, “He was not a good fit.”

By 2017, he had returned to a house in New Braunfels that records show was owned by his parents. The house was about an hour from the church where the shooting occurred. According to local law enforcement, Mr. Kelley’s second wife at times attended the church with members of her extended family.

The cover photo on Mr. Kelley’s Facebook page appears to show a Ruger 8515 rifle, equipped with additional aftermarket products, including a red-dot aiming sight for faster targeting and a two-stage trigger for greater accuracy.

Such rifles have been legal for civilians to own in most of the United States since the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and have become popular among many firearms owners.

Mr. Kelley seemed enamored with the weapon. He posted a photograph of it on Oct. 29 with the caption “She’s a bad bitch.”

Law enforcement officials guarded the cactus- and rock-dotted Kelley property in New Braunfels on Monday morning, when the top of the house was just barely visible atop the tree line. A wire fence ran along the roadway.

Signs on a cattle gate at the entrance read “No Trespassing” and “Beware of Dog.”

Some neighbors said they sometimes heard gunfire from the property. But in this stretch of the Texas hill country, that is hardly cause for alarm.

One neighbor, who would give his name only as Doug, said he heard shots fired at the Kelley property that would set his dogs barking.

“My dogs, they would be outside, and we would hear, ‘Bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam,’” he said.",Texas Gunman Broke Child’s Skull and Assaulted Wife in Troubled Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/devin-patrick-kelley-texas.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past.

It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date.

Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety.

But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work.

To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner.

The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger.

Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli.

Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared.

“Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,” said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. “But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.”

That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing.

“I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,” Mr. Tucker said. “But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.”

If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it.

“The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,” said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University.

Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response.

The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear.

“I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,” Mr. Ax said. “Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.”

Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Photo

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

Behind one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent investors, Yuri Milner, was hundreds of millions of dollars in Kremlin funding. The documents show that Mr. Milner’s investment in Twitter relied on money from VTB, bank controlled by the Russian state. One of his most significant investors in Facebook relied on funding from Gazprom Investholding, another government-controlled institution. Mr. Milner is also an investor in Cadre, a New York-based real estate technology company founded by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser.

Apple has come under scrutiny by Congress for shifting much of its earnings to Irish subsidiaries, avoiding income taxes. Documents from the leak show that after its chief executive, Tim Cook, said that the company didn’t just “stash money on a Caribbean island,” it found a new tax haven — an island in the English Channel. The use of complex offshore structures have helped keep much of Apple’s more than $128 billion in profit abroad free from taxation. The technique isn’t unique to Apple. “U.S. multinational firms are the global grandmasters of tax avoidance schemes,” said Edward Kleinbard, a former corporate tax adviser to such companies.

Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, invested in a shipping company whose top clients include a Russian firm controlled by an oligarch facing sanctions and President Vladimir V. Putin’s son-in-law. The ethics agreement Mr. Ross filed when taking office said he intended to retain several investment partnerships, but did not specify that they were used to hold his stake in the shipper, Navigator Holdings. The revelations of Mr. Ross’s continued investment led Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, to call for an investigation. Mr. Ross said he had done nothing wrong, but would “probably” sell his Navigator shares.

A bank in Utah is in the business of helping wealthy foreigners register private planes in the United States, which requires American citizenship or residency. The offshore files shed light on how a small financial institution, the Bank of Utah, served as a stand-in for citizenship purposes to allow Russia’s richest man, Leonid Mikhelson, whose energy company is subject to sanctions, register a $65 million Gulfstream jet.

Who Are Appleby’s Clients?

The predominantly elite clients of Appleby contrast with those of Mossack Fonseca — the company whose leaked records became the Panama Papers — which appeared to be less discriminating in the business it took on. The records date back to 1950 and up to 2016.

Appleby has offices in tax havens around the world. In addition to its Bermudan headquarters, it works out of places like the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean; the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey off Britain; Mauritius and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean; and Hong Kong and Shanghai.

Americans — companies and people — dominate the list of clients. Past disclosures, such as the 2013 “Offshore Leaks” from two offshore incorporators in Singapore and the British Virgin Islands, the 2015 “Swiss Leaks” from a private Swiss bank owned by the British bank HSBC and another leak in 2016 from the Bahamas were dominated by clients not from the United States.

The documents come not only from Appleby, but also from the Singaporean company Asiaciti Trust and official business registries in places such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Lebanon and Malta.

Setting up companies offshore is generally legal, and corporations routinely do so to facilitate cross-border transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. Appleby, in a public statement on Oct. 24, after inquiries from I.C.I.J., said that it was “subject to frequent regulatory checks” in “highly regulated jurisdictions.”

“Appleby has thoroughly and vigorously investigated the allegations and we are satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients,” the company said.",Paradise Papers Shine Light on Where the Elite Hide Their Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/world/paradise-papers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily. I also enjoyed the moment of thought I had to give to the cleverly written 10D, when I realized that CLOCKS are not seen in casinos purposely, so that gamblers will lose track of time and bet more.

On Monday night, David McCraw, The Times’s deputy general counsel, declined to say what those remedies might be. But, he said, “I think that what they owe us is an explanation of what actually happened,” adding, “We need to know much more.”

Mr. Boies did not respond to an email inquiry on Monday. But he told The New Yorker that while he oversaw the contract, he himself did not select the firm or direct its agents. And while he said he did not believe his work for Mr. Weinstein and his firm’s representation of The Times represented a conflict, “We should not have been contracting and paying investigators that we did not select and direct.”

Do you really think a President Biden could make a difference?","Last month, Biden sat down in the book-lined study of his home in a leafy neighborhood of Wilmington, Del., to discuss his memoir, which will be published on Nov. 14.

Philip Galanes: Why write this book? Why tear your heart open again?

Joe Biden: For my kids. Look, I have two beautiful grandchildren. I have a thousand pictures of them all around. For a year, when they were building a home, they lived here: Beau, [his wife] Hallie and the two kids. I wish they’d never moved. But after he died, the kids would come into my bed and lie on my chest: “Pop, tell me stories about Daddy.” “Tell me the one about when he fell out of the tree.” “Tell me the one about when that guy went after Daddy, and Uncle Hunt beat him up.”

PG: In planning the book, were there authors or memoirs, books about loss that spoke to you?

JB: No. I didn’t want to be like anyone else. I’m not being facetious. And I didn’t want to write a book about grief. I didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for me. I wanted to celebrate Beau’s life and the people he touched. Beau had a strict code of honor. That may sound silly, but it’s true. My Dad had an expression: “Never explain and never complain.” I never once heard Beau complain. Not once.

When his brother and sister, Hunter and Ashley, stood up to give their eulogies, I don’t know how they did it, but I’ve never been prouder of them in my life. Hunter, who’s a beautiful writer, said: “My first memory of Beau was when I was 3 years old.” They were in the hospital [following the death of their mother and baby sister in a car accident]. Hunt had a skull fracture, almost every bone in his body was broken. And Beau, just 4, in the next bed, held his hand and kept saying: “Hunt, I love you. Look at me. I love you, I love you, I love you.” At the funeral Hunt said in 42 years that “he has never stopped holding my hand.”

I want readers to know that there are people like Beau in this world, who put country first, family first, friends first.

PG: Let’s talk about the structure of the book. You keep three narrative strands running throughout the text.

JB: It was all about time: seconds, minutes, hours — not months or years. We were either going to beat Beau’s illness or not, and we had a very narrow window. My assignments at the White House were similar. They weren’t about managing relationships; they were crisis management. If Prime Minister Abadi didn’t reach a deal with the Sunnis, the government would implode. It got down to minutes and phone calls and seconds.

PG: For a famous talker, it’s a taut book.

JB: Well, there’s a difference between talking and writing. When I’m talking with someone who’s looking for something — for assurance or help, for me to take a position — I try to engage them. I draw them out by talking, by listening to what they’re saying and what they’re not saying. But in the book, I had to be disciplined to bring all those strands together. I wanted to make my points as crisply as I could.

PG: There’s a beautiful line in the book: “My story precedes me.”

JB: And it does. Look, I was on top of the world in 1972. My sister managed my Senate campaign and pulled off the most improbable upset. I’m down in Washington, hiring staff, and I get a call from a young woman who says: “Your wife and daughter have been in a terrible accident. You have to come home.” I said, “She’s dead.” And she said yes. So, I know the stages of grief, like a lot of other people. From the pain, to the sense of hopelessness, to recovery, it’s all about time.

PG: There’s an undertow on every page, a knowledge that we’re all suffering. Did that predate 1972?

JB: I used to be a very bad stutterer. Everybody thinks I know Irish poets because I’m Irish. But I know them because of my uncle, an educated bachelor who lived with us, off and on. He had a volume of Yeats. And I used to get up at night and put a flashlight on the mirror, practicing and practicing, reading aloud from those books. Everybody has a burden to carry.

PG: Maybe that’s why the strands of the book bleed together? When one of Beau’s doctor visits goes well, there’s an optimism that carries into the next section about Iraq.

JB: I wanted to write precisely about the crises and dilemmas I faced as they intersected in the moment. I wanted to show that in the ebb and flow of life, nothing is totally separable. As much as I try to compartmentalize, what you’re doing in one phase of your life washes over and affects the others.

PG: And occasionally, the crosscutting made me think you’d actually cheat death, that Beau would live.

Photo

JB: Oh! We were praying and working and believing. I’ve always been an optimist. When I had a couple of cranial aneurysms [in 1988] and the doctor’s were giving me less than even chances of living, I was still talking as if everything was going to be O.K.

PG: Several times, Beau says: Don’t look at me sad, Dad. Or: Promise me you’ll be O.K., Dad. Did he ever let you comfort him?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

JB: One night, when it was clear that the odds weren’t good, he asked me to stay after dinner at his house, about a mile from here. He said: “Dad, I know you love me more than anyone in the world. But promise me you’ll be O.K. I’ll be O.K., Dad.” He had come face to face with his mortality. He watched me go through the loss of his mother and sister. And he didn’t want me to turn inward. He didn’t want me to give up on the robustness of life.

PG: You were reluctant to confide in President Obama about Beau.

JB: It was complex. I didn’t want him to carry the burden of feeling sorry for me. Several times, when we talked about Beau, he started sobbing, and I had to console him. I didn’t want to put him through that, not with all the responsibility he had on his back. I also didn’t want him to do what most people would do, what my staff wanted to do: Have Joe do less. I had to do more. And I had my diaries. I’m able to write and express emotions fairly well. And I was completely honest with myself in those diaries.

PG: Let’s turn to the 2016 election. You write that President Obama was pretty discouraging about your running for the Democratic nomination. But in the book you also say that the race was coming to you: The badly beaten middle class, the populism, the authenticity.

JB: What people don’t realize is that Beau was essentially diagnosed with a death sentence in 2013. Virtually nobody makes it. I had an obligation to tell the president because of my duties. So, he knew what was going on. By late 2014, we were walking after lunch, and Barack said: “Joe, if I had the power of appointment, I’d appoint you president. We agree on the issues, I know your leadership skills, and I think you’d be the best president.” But he had other pressures. I felt them, too. If I were to say “I am not going to run,” in the face of all this data that’s coming in saying, you can do it. If I said that, everybody would have known there was something wrong with Beau. I would have violated my commitment to him to keep it secret. The piece that complicated it is that after he passed, it was clear that he really wanted me to run.

PG: Both sons wanted you to run.

JB: I believe Beau, looking down, understands why I didn’t run, and he accepts it. Beau, Hunt and Ashley didn’t want me stepping back. They thought that what limited talents I have that may not have been suited for winning decades earlier were exactly what the public was looking for now.

PG: There’s a scene in the book where Hillary Clinton comes to visit with you to see if you’re planning to run for president. You write that she was propelled by forces not entirely of her own making. What does that mean?

JB: I think she wanted to be president and would have been a good president. But she also had to understand how difficult her life was going to be, how she would be vilified. But Hillary is also driven by the need to empower women. Having known her for a long time, I can’t believe she didn’t think: What will young women in the world think if I walk away?

PG: We’re so dug in and divided now. Do you really think a President Biden could make a difference?

JB: The obvious answer is: I don’t know. But I have always been good at bringing people together. Trying to understand the other person’s perspective, and trying to figure out how to get to “go.” That skill was always useful, but it has a higher premium now that we don’t work together as much. And that’s why I wrote this book about Beau. I wanted people to see how honorable political life can be. He had so many chances to advance himself — he was offered my Senate seat when he came back from Iraq — but he wouldn’t take it. He wanted to earn it. Beau’s ambition was to be a man who always did his duty.","Joe Biden Talks About His New Memoir, ‘Promise Me, Dad’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/books/review/joe-biden-talks-about-new-memoir-promise-me-dad.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

It looked like a possibility — for a little while. The Nets won 44 games in their first season under Mr. Brown. And they had nearly finished an even better second season when it was learned that Mr. Brown had applied to coach at the University of Kansas.

Two seasons later, frustrated by his experience with Mr. Brown and the injuries that had impeded the Nets’ progress, he announced that he had sold his stake to his partners. He conceded that running a sports team was not like running a business.

“In business, you can plan adjustments and make changes quickly,” he said after a tearful four-minute farewell speech at the team’s offices. But with a sports franchise, he said, “there’s injuries, personalities, and so many judgment calls made that can affect your success that it’s debilitating.”

Still, he repurchased a small stake in the team in 1991. That year he overstepped the boundaries of his role, negotiating with Jim Valvano, the former North Carolina State coach, to replace Bill Fitch as the Nets’ coach.

The team’s chief executive, Alan L. Aufzien, repudiated Mr. Taub publicly. “He doesn’t make offers,” Mr. Aufzien said of Mr. Taub. “He advises.”

In 1996, amid rumors that the Nets were going to be sold, the ownership restructured and placed Henry Taub in charge. But Joe remained a prominent voice among the team’s owners on the salary cap and other matters of basketball policy. He also took the lead in the unsuccessful pursuit of a friend, Rick Pitino, who was then the coach at the University of Kentucky, to take over as the Nets’ coach in 1996.

“More than the other owners, he was the heart and soul of the Nets,” Michael Rowe, a former president of the team, said in an interview. “He was relentless and impatient. He supported the staff, and he didn’t mind being the face of the franchise. He was flamboyant-looking, with his amazing white hair, and it’s no secret he didn’t mind being seen walking up to his seat, in the fifth row of the arena, a little late.”

The Nets were acquired by a consortium that included the philanthropist Raymond Chambers in 1998 and have been sold a few times since. But Mr. Taub retained a stake in the team for at least a decade longer.

Mr. Tesser, his son-in-law, said that Mr. Taub was bothered by the team’s relocation to Brooklyn in 2012 under its new owner, Mikhail D. Prokhorov.

“He was devastated,” Mr. Tesser said. “He was out of the team by then; he had no control. He never enjoyed going to Brooklyn.”

Joseph Albert Taub was born in Paterson, N.J., on May 29, 1929. His father, Morris, was a junk dealer. His mother, the former Sylvia Sievitz, was a homemaker. Both were Polish immigrants.

Mr. Taub played forward on the basketball team at Eastside High School, in Paterson, and attended Rutgers University but did not graduate.

Henry Taub had already started Automatic Payrolls in 1949 to help businesses, among them dye houses in Paterson, prepare their payrolls. Joe soon joined his brother, followed by Mr. Lautenberg, who had been a salesman for Prudential Insurance. According to Mr. Tesser, Joe Taub oversaw the payrolls, Henry Taub was the strategist and Mr. Lautenberg oversaw sales.

The company, which eventually became known as Automatic Data Processing and later as ADP, went public in 1961. In its 2017 fiscal year, it had $12 billion in revenue.

Joe Taub retired in 1969 when he was 40 to devote himself to philanthropy, with a focus on causes in Paterson. He founded an after-school basketball league with his childhood neighbor Larry Doby, the Hall of Fame baseball player who was the first African-American to play in the American League.

In addition to providing an outlet for youngsters to play sports, the league offers scholarships.

“I was born in Paterson, lived in Paterson, started my business in Paterson,” Mr. Taub told The New York Post in 2013. “Did it with tremendous problems like today. One-parent households, drugs, gangs. I wanted to come up with a program where we could combine academics with sports.”

He added, “When I grew up, we were all trying to survive, and I understand what these kids are going through.”

He also owned and bred racehorses, one of whom, Sensitive Prince, finished sixth in the 1978 Kentucky Derby.

Mr. Taub is survived by his wife, the former Arlene Gorelick, who was a teacher before they married; his daughter, Michelle Tesser; his son, Marc; six grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. Another daughter, Sandra, died in 2006. His brother, Henry, died in 2011.

In 2009, before a game at the Izod Center (the former Byrne Arena), Mr. Taub talked about the difficulties of owning a team in the New Jersey Meadowlands and competing with the New York Knicks.

“New Jersey is not New York — it’s rural and you really have to market to the corporations,” he told The New York Times, reflecting on playing there. “In the beginning, we sold a lot of season tickets, but everything upstairs felt too far away, not close like Madison Square Garden.”","Joe Taub, Basketball Fan Who Became Part Owner of the Nets, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/obituaries/joe-taub-basketball-fan-who-became-part-owner-of-the-nets-dies-at-88.html

More than 1 million men and women in Texas have active licenses to carry handguns.
“I don’t blame objects for the good or the evil that people do with them,” Mr. Curry said.
Mr. Flores, 56, who runs a food stand inside the gas station, said guns were fairly common in Sutherland Springs.
“We see guys with guns and rifles all the time, but we know each other,” said Mr. Flores, who is a gun owner himself.","But for all the questions about guns swirling around the tragedy, there is one thing that was not in doubt. In a state where the modern era of mass shootings began with Charles Whitman’s 1966 rampage at the University of Texas clock tower, guns remain an inseparable part of the Texas DNA.

“I think that Texans have a history of taking care of themselves, a history of responsibility and freedom at the same time,” said Mike Sullivan, a former member of the Houston City Council who said he was considering bringing a concealed firearm to church on Sundays following the attack in Sutherland Springs. “There is no wrong place to carry a gun any more.”

Mr. Willeford, who lives near the church, emerged as a distinctly Texan hero in the tragedy. In an interview with KHBS television, he said his daughter heard gunshots and alerted him. He picked up his rifle and went to the church.

“Every time I heard a shot, I knew that probably represented a life,’’ he said in the interview. “I was scared to death, I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them. And I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.”

He added: “I just wish I could have gotten there faster. But I didn’t know, I didn’t know what was happening.’’

At a photo-op in Austin months ago, Gov. Greg Abbott fired a pistol at a gun range, and then turned to his 20-year-old daughter, who fired off some rounds with the same gun. People routinely show up at demonstrations with their bullhorns, their bottles of water and their rifles, because in Texas it is legal to carry a rifle slung over a shoulder in public. The state’s campus-carry law, which allowed licensed Texans to carry concealed handguns on college campuses, took effect on Aug. 1, 2016, the 50th anniversary of the Whitman tower attack.

More than 1 million men and women in Texas have active licenses to carry handguns. Only Florida, with 1.7 million as of May 2016, had more licensees than Texas.

One pastor in Beaumont, the Rev. James McAbee, was known for keeping a loaded .45-caliber pistol beneath the podium at his New Horizons Church. Mr. Patterson, the former state senator, often carried a gun in his boot in Austin when he served as the Texas land commissioner, and he saw no difference in carrying at a place of business or a place of worship.

“Frankly, if the church chose to prohibit lawful carry, as churches can do in Texas, I’d probably go to a more welcoming church,” said Mr. Patterson, who attends a Lutheran church in Austin.

The Rev. Stephen Curry, pastor of the La Vernia United Methodist Church, seven miles from First Baptist, said he has no doubt that some of those who gather at his church on Sundays are carrying concealed handguns. “I know they do,” Mr. Curry said. “It’s not unusual in this part of the country. Most of them are very discreet about it.”

Even being so close to the shooting on Sunday — one of the members of his church lost a relative at First Baptist — Mr. Curry said he saw the attack and guns as two separate issues.

“I don’t blame objects for the good or the evil that people do with them,” Mr. Curry said. “Objects are not the problem. The problem is the evil that lurks in the human heart. Yes, the perpetrator used a gun, but he was stopped by a man with a gun.”

Fredda Connally and her husband live about three-quarters of a mile from the church in Sutherland Springs, and have attended First Baptist off and on through the years. Her husband had not previously carried his gun to church, but probably will do so in the future because of the shooting.

“I think we’re both going to,” she said. “I didn’t want any part of it, but I feel like maybe we need to. It’s terrible.”

At the Valero gas station across from the church, Lorenzo Flores Jr. was still in shock. A family friend, Joann Ward, was killed in the attack. Mr. Flores, 56, who runs a food stand inside the gas station, said guns were fairly common in Sutherland Springs.

“We see guys with guns and rifles all the time, but we know each other,” said Mr. Flores, who is a gun owner himself. “Why should you or I not be able to protect ourselves or protect our families?”

And yet, even in a gun-friendly state like Texas, Mr. Flores said he supported more gun restrictions following the attack, to make sure that veterans like Mr. Kelley who were discharged from the military after criminal convictions do not have access to guns.

“If a man has a good mind and can pass a test and hasn’t been ejected from the military or anything, I’m all for that,” he said. “But if you’ve failed the test or you’ve failed the country by being discharged, you shouldn’t have the right to carry.”

Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said on Fox News on Sunday that churches should consider hiring “professional security, or at least arming some of the parishioners or the congregation, so that they can respond.”

The Texas Democratic Party called for Mr. Paxton to apologize. “Something is woefully wrong when elected officials wring their hands and suggest we can only stay safe by bringing arsenals to church,” Manny Garcia, the party’s deputy executive director, said in a statement. And statistics show that rather than making people safer, the states where it is easiest to get guns tend to have the most gun deaths.

Few in Texas seem persuaded.

“You can’t stop every incident,” said Homer Flores, 59, who lives in a Houston suburb and has had a handgun license for more than 20 years. “What if the ushers at that church had been carrying a firearm concealed, and this guy started opening up? He may have only gotten off a few rounds before they dropped him.’’","In Texas, Almost Anyplace Can Be a Place to Carry a Gun",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-guns-church-shooting.html

Fourth, the bill preserves high top marginal tax rates on individual income and even raises rates in some cases on the very rich. Over the past few decades when Republicans have talked about tax reform, they have generally talked about sharply cutting the top marginal rate to 25 percent or even 15 percent. But this plan keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. And then it throws in some peculiarities. As The Wall Street Journal noted, under the plan a married couple would face a 45.6 percent top rate on earnings between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.

These changes could leave the rich paying an astonishingly high percentage of their income in taxes. Scott Sumner of EconLog calculates that when you throw in state and local taxes, rich Californians would face a tax rate of 62.7 percent.

Republicans would take the revenue from these tax hikes (and much more) and they would use it to lighten the load borne by corporations.

The intellectual case for general corporate tax reform is strong. Countries across the world have been cutting corporate rates. The United States now has the highest corporate rates in the O.E.C.D. and the third-highest rates in the world. Cutting those rates would attract investment, unlock money trapped abroad and increase wages for many families. Economists vary widely in their estimates, but Larry Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates, on the high end, that a lower corporate tax rate could increase working-household income by roughly $3,500 annually.

None of this is to say that the Republican plan is worth supporting. I personally oppose it because of the way it explodes the deficits. Second, the level of largess to corporate shareholders is frankly ridiculous. It piles one corporate tax cut on top of another like piling a chocolate sundae on top of chocolate cake on top of a Toblerone bar.

This is not a column about the workability or advisability of this or that plan. This is a column about the sort of social vision that serves as a predicate for that plan.

The Republicans have a social vision. The Republican vision is that the corporate sector is more important to a healthy America than the professional and nonprofit sector. The Republican vision is that companies that thrive in the red states, like manufacturing and agriculture, are more important for the country than the industries that thrive in blue states, like finance, media, the academy and the movies.

What, by contrast, is the Democratic vision? Are Democrats going to spend the next few months defending the mortgage interest deduction and other tax breaks for their own rich?

It could be that economic policy is becoming tribal just like everything else in our politics. In that world, parties use their time in power to nakedly shift the tax code for the benefit of their own donors.

It would be nice if our tax code wasn’t red or blue but distinguished between social goods and social bads. I’d love to see a tax code that rewarded investment and discouraged consumption. That would mean cutting taxes on earnings but raising revenue through a progressive consumption tax. I’d love to see a tax code that punished pollution but encouraged social cohesion. That would mean taxing carbon but increasing tax credits for working people and families with children.

You may or may not like my vision, but it’s more elevated than the visions that are now emerging, which are a dressed-up version of the spoils system: more money for my political friends and less for my political foes.",The Clash of Social Visions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/republicans-taxes-cuts.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

WASHINGTON — A former Trump campaign adviser told Congress he had a private conversation with a Russian deputy prime minister during the 2016 presidential campaign and that at least two members of the president’s team were aware, providing more details to what is publicly known about Moscow’s access to President Trump’s circle, according to a congressional transcript released late Monday.

“I’ll send you guys a readout soon regarding some incredible insights and outreach I’ve received from a few Russian legislators and senior members of the Presidential administration here,” the former adviser, Carter Page, wrote in a July 8, 2016, email to campaign staff members after he spoke with Arkady Dvorkovich, the deputy prime minister.

The New York Times first reported the fact that Mr. Page notified campaign officials about his meetings in Moscow, but the transcript, which is over 200 pages long, discloses the names of those advisers — Tera Dahl and J.D.

Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,” the Air Force said in a statement.
The statement said Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to “conduct a complete review of the Kelley case.”The Air Force also said it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported to the federal database for firearms background checks.
Mr. Kelley made it back to his car and led the bystander and another man in a dramatic chase that ended in a crash, with Mr. Kelley dead behind the wheel.
He also said he had repeatedly hit his young stepson’s head with his hands, cracking his skull, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force.
Greg Abbott of Texas told CNN that Mr. Kelley had been rejected when he applied for a license to carry a handgun in Texas.","SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — A day after a gunman massacred parishioners in a small Texas church, the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to enter the man’s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the rifle he used to kill 26 people.

Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson — he had cracked the child’s skull — should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.

“The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,” the Air Force said in a statement.

The statement said Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to “conduct a complete review of the Kelley case.”

The Air Force also said it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported to the federal database for firearms background checks.

New details of the killings also emerged on Monday, including a possible motive. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Kelley may have been driven by anger toward his estranged wife’s family, the final chapter in a life full of domestic rage. In addition to his court-martial, in which his previous wife was the victim, he had been investigated on a rape complaint, though he was not charged and his relationship to the woman in the complaint was unclear.

The mother of Mr. Kelley’s most recent wife, Danielle, was a member of the First Baptist Church here, the target of Mr. Kelley’s rage on Sunday.

“The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a news conference on Monday. “We know that he had made threatening texts,” he added, declining to elaborate.

“This was not racially motivated. It wasn’t over religious beliefs. It was a domestic situation going on,” Mr. Martin added. Mr. Kelley’s wife and her parents were not at the church on Sunday, the authorities said. They could not be reached for interviews on Monday.

Among the victims of the massacre, the worst mass shooting in Texas history, were eight members of one family and at least a dozen children, one as young as 18 months old, officials said. One of the victims was pregnant, and officials included the child she was carrying in the death toll of 26.

Officers described finding a scene of unfathomable carnage, where mothers were found sprawled atop children they had tried to shield. Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. of Wilson County said that deputies found “blood everywhere” inside the church. “Wherever you walked in the church, there was death,” he said.

Mr. Kelley, who was dressed in all black and wore a skull-face mask, emerged from the church after he was done shooting, then was met by gunfire from a bystander outside, who hit Mr. Kelley in the leg and the torso. Mr. Kelley made it back to his car and led the bystander and another man in a dramatic chase that ended in a crash, with Mr. Kelley dead behind the wheel. He had shot himself in the head, officials said.

The shootings came a little over a month after 58 people were killed at a concert in Las Vegas, and were the latest in a string of mass killings in the United States. They led to another round of calls for more gun restrictions, though they were muted in comparison with previous tragedies, perhaps because gun-control advocates realized that a Republican-controlled Washington would not give in on gun rights.

Asked about the shooting during his trip to Asia, President Trump said Monday that the shooting was not related to regulations on gun ownership.

“I think that mental health is your problem here,” Mr. Trump said at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “This was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked during a news conference in South Korea whether he would support “extreme vetting” of gun buyers, comparable to the vetting his administration has sought to impose on visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries.

“If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,” the president replied, “and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.”

“If he didn’t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,” Mr. Trump said, reiterating an argument he has made after previous mass shootings — that more guns, not less, could be the answer.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he and his wife would visit Sutherland Springs on Wednesday.

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, criticized Mr. Trump’s response on Monday, noting that the bystander did not fire at Mr. Kelley until the carnage inside the church was over.

“Let’s be clear — nobody ‘stopped’ this shooting,” he wrote on Twitter. “26 people, including little kids, are dead in one of our country’s worst mass killings.”

Former President Barack Obama, whose own calls for more gun regulations were stymied, said on Twitter, “May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.”

The immediate question on Monday was how Mr. Kelley had been able to legally purchase his weapons. In his 2012 court-martial, Mr. Kelley admitted that he had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his wife beginning just months into their marriage. He also said he had repeatedly hit his young stepson’s head with his hands, cracking his skull, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force.

Federal law lists 11 criteria that would bar someone from buying a gun, including two that would seem to apply to Mr. Kelley: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison — assaulting his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years — and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.

The Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show. It has reported 11,000 service members to the database, but almost all of them were because of dishonorable discharges, which prohibit gun purchases. Mr. Kelley, after serving 12 months in a Navy brig in California, received a “bad conduct” discharge, which is not by itself an automatic bar to gun purchases.

Elise Hasbrook, a spokeswoman for Academy Sports + Outdoors, which owns two San Antonio shops that each sold Mr. Kelley a gun in the last two years, said “both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.” Mr. Kelley had bought two other guns since his court-martial, both in Colorado, the authorities said.



Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas told CNN that Mr. Kelley had been rejected when he applied for a license to carry a handgun in Texas. State officials did not specify why he was rejected, and a carrying license is not required to purchase a firearm from a gun shop so long as the buyer passes the federal background check.

“By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?” Mr. Abbott said.

The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley’s hometown, New Braunfels, also released records on Monday that showed Mr. Kelley had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape by force in 2013. The investigation ended without the filing of any charges.

On Monday, Sheriff Tackitt of Wilson County, where First Baptist is located, described Mr. Kelley’s horrific and methodical path through the church. After firing from outside the building, Mr. Kelley entered the church, and fired his weapon from side to side as he paced through the room, the sheriff said. Among those killed were members of three generations of the Holcombe family, including the guest preacher and his wife, and an 18-month-old girl named Noah.

“There was nothing anyone could do until he came out,” Sheriff Tackitt said.

After Mr. Kelley stepped out of the church, a man outside was waiting with his own rifle. They fired at each other, and Mr. Kelley was hit twice. He then drove off in his car.

The bystander, who identified himself Monday night as Stephen Willeford, flagged down a nearby driver, Johnnie Langendorff, and they gave chase, at speeds upward of 90 miles an hour, Mr. Langendorff said. Mr. Kelley contacted his father from his cellphone during the chase to tell him that he had been shot, according to law enforcement officials, telling his father that he “didn’t think he was going to make it.” He soon crashed and was found dead behind the wheel with three gunshot wounds, including his own shot to his head.

Sheriff Tackitt called Mr. Willeford a “hero.”

In an interview with a local television station, Mr. Willeford said his daughter had heard gunshots from the church and alerted him. He retrieved his rifle and went to the church.

Mr. Willeford grew emotional as he spoke about what he saw and heard.

“Every time I heard a shot I knew that probably represented a life,” he said. “I was scared to death, I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them. And I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.”

“I’m no hero, I am not,” he said. “I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done.”

“I just wish I could have gotten there faster,” he said.",Air Force Error Allowed Texas Gunman to Buy Weapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Learning the local language is a great way to get a sense of place, and some hotels today have programs for their guests to do just that. And these aren’t your high-school foreign language classes: Travelers can immerse themselves in the dialect of their destination in fun and engaging ways.

There’s no better way to learn a new language than in a relaxed vacation setting, according to Kristen Korey Pike, a travel adviser and owner of KK Travels Worldwide in Atlanta. “It’s a hands-on way to get to know the place you’re visiting, and it’s such a cool thing to do,” she said.

Nayara Springs and Nayara Hotel, Spa & Gardens in Costa Rica have a new Spanish immersion package for $300: Guests who sign up receive a selection of Spanish books upon check-in, along with a Spanish/English dictionary, a private bird-watching tour in Spanish, a one-hour Spanish lesson focusing on Costa Rican culture and a Spanish lunch with a resort host. In addition, the staff at the properties communicates with these guests only in Spanish.

Guests at the Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, can brush up on their Spanish or learn it anew: Those interested are given a bracelet; the resort staff knows that anyone wearing it wishes to communicate in Spanish. The property also offers a tequila tasting in Spanish. The bracelet and tequila tasting are $65 a person each.

Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.
WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment.
When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia.
On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug.","The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records — from Saudi Arabia’s government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund — stands in stark contrast to those aims. By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals — a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.

“Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,” said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.

She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.

Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.

WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which garnered a $3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.

Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.

Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including giving women the right to drive, a restriction that the kingdom says will be lifted next year.

The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.

Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.

On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.

Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, who has been criticized for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)

But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”

But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.

It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Jay Kriegel, a senior adviser at the Related Companies, a real estate firm, praised Mr. de Blasio’s emphasis on the tax proposal. Mr. Kriegel led a campaign for the New York business community to oppose a similar effort to change the tax deductibility during the Reagan administration.

The Association for a Better New York is opposed to Mr. Trump’s proposal to do away with state and local tax deductions, which have been in place since 1913, and most in attendance on Monday appeared to agree with Mr. de Blasio. But many declined afterward to be quoted on the substance of his address for fear of angering an incumbent mayor on the day before all expected him to be returned to office for another four years.

“This is a guy who has come a long way in four years. Very polished, no teleprompter,” said John H. Banks III, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. “It didn’t surprise me that he didn’t try to make news.”

Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group, agreed, but added that “it would have been better, even better, if he specifically urged the audience” — some of whom are donors to Democrats and Republicans alike — “to express their concerns to particular New York House members who are in favor or on the fence about voting against the legislation.”

By contrast, she said, the mayor’s promise during a brief question-and-answer session with the audience to “definitely address the need for reform of the city’s property tax system was quite specific and firm.”

The choice to host Mr. de Blasio for a major address less than 24 hours before polls open in New York City was not the mayor’s, according to spokeswomen for Mr. de Blasio and the association. After the group invited the mayor, it was the only date they could find that would accommodate schedules as well as the availability of the room.

Shortly after the speech, Mr. de Blasio published an essay with Business Insider, a web publication, on the Republican tax proposal theme, saying it was akin to asking “hardworking New Yorkers” to withdraw $1,000 in cash and then “find a hedge fund manager to give it to.”","As de Blasio Looks to 2nd Term, He Sees a City Threatened by Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-trump-tax-plan.html

The company’s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail.","Twenty miles east of Reno, Nev., where packs of wild mustangs roam free through the parched landscape, Tesla Gigafactory 1 sprawls near Interstate 80. It is a destination for engineers from all over the world, to which any Reno hotel clerk can give you precise, can’t-miss-it directions. The Gigafactory, whose construction began in June 2014, is not only outrageously large but also on its way to becoming the biggest manufacturing plant on earth. Now 30 percent complete, its square footage already equals about 35 Costco stores, and a small city of construction workers, machinery and storage containers has sprung up around it. Perhaps the only thing as impressive as its size is its cloak of secrecy, which seems of a piece with Tesla’s increasing tendency toward stealth, opacity and even paranoia. When I visited in September, a guard at the gate gave militaristic instructions on where to go. Turning to my Lyft driver, he said severely: “When you complete the drop-off, you are not to get out of the car. Under any circumstances. Turn around and leave. Immediately.”

To hear its executives tell it, Tesla is misunderstood because it is still perceived as a car manufacturer, when its goals are more complex and far-reaching. But at least some people have bought into these grand ambitions. This summer, Tesla’s stock-market valuation at times rose above those of Ford and General Motors, and its worth exceeded $60 billion. It did not seem to matter to investors that the company had never made an annual profit, had missed its production targets repeatedly and had become enmeshed in controversy over its self-driving “autopilot” technologies, or that Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, had conceded that the value of his company, of which he owns about 22 percent, was “higher than we have the right to deserve.” Tesla was a headlong bet on the future, a huge wager on the idea of a better world. And its secretive Gigafactory was the arsenal for a full-fledged attack on the incumbent powers of the car and fossil-fuel industries. The factory would help validate Musk and his company’s seriousness about leading humanity’s turn to greener technologies, with a vision now encompassing solar roofing tiles and battery packs for home and industry. Most crucial, it involved producing millions of Tesla cars and trucks, all of which would be sleek, electric and self-driving.

If ambitions were all it took, Tesla would be crowned the colossus of the global car industry. But rapidly accelerating new technologies have brought uncertainty as well. Automakers are encountering three destabilizing forces all at once: automation, electrification and sharing. And sizing up which companies will be the winners and losers in their wakes is in no way obvious. In terms of self-driving cars, it seems likely that long-established companies — General Motors and Ford, as well as BMW and Audi — will benefit from their substantial reserves of cash and deep manufacturing experience. Because these automakers can invest deeply in research (and spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy start-ups), they can remain competitive with companies less inherently cautious, like Tesla and Waymo, the spinoff of Google’s self-driving projects.

Tesla’s goal has always been focused on going green, rather than creating the driverless future. (Its mission is emblazoned on its factory walls: “To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”) Yet as the automobile industry settles on the consensus that self-driving cars are coming — their promise to improve safety and to help ride-sharing replace car ownership for many Americans propels their inevitability — Tesla finds itself in the midst of a contest to do both. This set of challenges should be enough for any company, especially one led by a chief executive whose time is compromised by other business commitments as a founder of a rocket company (SpaceX), a new tunneling operation (the Boring Company), a company planning a human-computer interface (Neuralink) and a nonprofit focused on the dangers of artificial intelligence (OpenAI). But Tesla has given itself a few others too. One is to essentially reinvent modern manufacturing processes at the Gigafactory. Yet another is to create the first mass-market electric car ever. In the meantime, a company that has never made much profit needs to somehow figure out how to do so — that is, to put itself in the black before financial losses and missed deadlines curdle any hope that Tesla inspires, among customers or stockholders, into skepticism.

Four hundred possible sites all over the western United States were winnowed down to this Nevada location. I hopped into a Chevy Suburban at the Gigafactory with several Tesla employees to take a look around. We drove through an expansive parking lot and up a steep hill so we could overlook the sprawling building and commotion below. The Gigafactory is often described, somewhat reductively, as a plant where Panasonic, a large tenant within the space, manufactures customized lithium-ion batteries that Tesla then installs in its products. Such an enormous plant allows for long production lines and economies of scale, which company engineers believe will help them lower significantly the price of the batteries, and thus the price of electric cars. The logic within Tesla is that only by “scaling up” — making billions of cheaper batteries for millions of cars — can it have an actual impact on our worsening pollution and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Gigafactory had to be big, Musk noted at its opening in July 2016, “because the world is big.” But the plant’s utility is actually in the sum of countless small improvements. As one Tesla executive involved in its design told me, the goal here was not only to minimize the movement of materials like lithium and cobalt but also to shorten the path of every molecule that moves through the plant. “Because the further a molecule needs to travel,” he said, “the more cost gets added into it. We actually think of it in terms of molecular distance.”

Still, the Gigafactory is considerably more than a battery factory: It’s the physical embodiment of various technological breakthroughs the company — which just manufactured its 250,000th car — is trying to bring to its cars and energy-storage systems. Tesla makes motors here for its new Model 3 car, for instance, which are then trucked to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., 240 miles away. When we went inside, after a labyrinthine walk through offices and up and down stairways, we reached a rapidly moving automated factory line, where batteries were being installed into Powerwalls and Powerpacks — the residential and industrial units that store energy collected from solar panels (or any electrical generator). Later in the month, devices like these would make their way to Puerto Rico, where Tesla rebuilt the power infrastructure for a children’s hospital, and southern Australia, where the company is involved in a vast public project to shore up the country’s electrical grid. “We think of this building as a product, because it is a product,” my guide told me as we walked alongside a production line. Every machine had been scrutinized, every inch mapped out, every efficiency contemplated. Tesla had taken the highly unusual step of setting up a separate entity to take full control of the building’s design, engineering and construction, reflecting Tesla’s D.I.Y. ethos to achieve levels of vertical ownership and quality control that its executives believe are unreachable otherwise. The company had even concocted its own Tesla blend of coffee to serve near its cafeterias. “If we cannot get exactly what we want from the world,” one executive told me, “then we have to go do it ourselves.”

Tesla’s grand plans in many respects depend on how much innovation the company can bring to the process of battery making. If the Gigafactory succeeds in reducing costs — one battery-industry analyst, Sam Jaffe, the director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, told me he thinks the company should be able to drive down the price of its cells by 30 percent — multiple dividends will accrue to Tesla. Cheaper batteries mean more than cheaper cars. They mean Tesla can put larger battery packs into cars for the same cost, increasing the vehicles’ range, power and appeal compared with the competition. At the same time, they could make its home energy-storage systems more efficient. Tesla could also gain an advantage in the race to produce autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s. The electric vehicles, or E.V.s, that Tesla wants to make autonomous have zero emissions. If self-driving cars go on rotation, say, in Uber and Lyft fleets, they could run 24-7, possibly leading to more cars on the road. “One of the concerns about automation is that it’s going to drastically increase the miles we drive,” Stephen Zoepf, the executive director at the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, told me. “So if we expect as a society that we’re going to be driving a lot more, we obviously want to mitigate the environmental impact.”

At the Gigafactory, J.B. Straubel, a Tesla founder and the company’s chief technology officer, recounted the plant’s origin story. In 2012, he did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and realized that if Tesla were to sell something on the order of 500,000 cars a year, it would require the world’s entire output of lithium-ion batteries at the time. “We realized, holy crap, this means we need a huge factory,” he said, “because there was no way to do this just by putting in an order with some cell company and have them ship a few more.” His projections were not far off. When we met in September, orders for the Model 3, which began production in midyear and has been billed as the company’s first mass-market car, were around 455,000 through July, suggesting that the demand for E.V.s is far larger than any of the traditional automakers ever imagined. In the future, Straubel told me, Tesla plans to put up many more Gigafactories around the world, “ones that are actually quite a lot bigger than this one” — and it would construct those itself too. “This isn’t just a big building that’s full of equipment,” he added. “There’s this idea here of the machine that builds the machine, and it’s really true. This place is the embodiment of that.”

The impression he wanted me to have, I think, was that Tesla, once it gets this prodigious machine humming, will become robotically unstoppable at cranking out smaller machines, a great big clean-energy perpetual-motion device. At the same time, the company’s executives, from Straubel and Musk on down, were urging potential customers not to view each Tesla product in isolation but as parts of an ecosystem. The Tesla customer could soon use Tesla solar roof tiles during the day to charge up a Tesla Powerwall unit, filled with Gigafactory-made batteries — at night the Powerwall could in turn recharge the Tesla sedan. Perhaps the customer very much liked to drive? In that case, he or she might occasionally stop at one of the hundreds of Tesla “supercharger” stations in cities or along highways. Or maybe the owner didn’t like to drive at all and preferred to be driven automatically. Tesla would soon straddle our peculiar moment, the transitional era where humans begin to take their hands off their machines. “Every car made since October of last year,” Musk promised in early August, “is capable of full autonomy, we believe.”

The day after I toured the Gigafactory, I visited Tesla’s California headquarters in Palo Alto to see Doug Field, a top executive involved with the Model 3. Its price begins at $35,000, which gets you an average range of 220 miles on a full battery charge; a model with a larger battery pack (and a range of 310 miles) begins at $44,000. Even that price is a significant step down for the company, whose other cars’ most basic configurations start at about $70,000. I had driven from Reno to Palo Alto in a rented Tesla Model S valued at about $145,000; it was a four-hour trip, not including a 40-minute stop at a Tesla recharging station in Vacaville, Calif., and with the car’s neck-breaking acceleration it seemed the drive could have taken half that time but for speed limits. As the company’s flagship vehicle, the Model S is outfitted with several large LED screens but still has the feel of a conventional luxury car. The smaller Model 3 is a different machine altogether — spry and strikingly austere. One large touch-screen in the center of the dashboard essentially controls all the car’s driving and interior settings, while also monitoring the battery charge. When I arrived in early September, the first Model 3s had just come off the assembly line, and Field, a rangy engineer who spent a good part of his career at Apple, met me in front of the offices in a metallic blue model. He slid into the passenger side and invited me to take the wheel. “I’ll give you a quick orientation,” he said, “and then we’ll drive off.”

Field quickly showed me the controls. There weren’t many except for a few dials on the steering wheel. The screen to its right served as the car’s dashboard. “This looks forward to an era of autonomy,” Field explained, “but it’s also simpler and easier to manufacture.” That meant cheaper too, which was crucial: Tesla had concluded that every dollar saved on the cost of making the car would mean 100 more families could buy it in a year. As we drove through Palo Alto, the car was nimble and responsive, with the same kind of leaping acceleration that characterizes the Model S. But it took some time to get used to checking the screen to my right for my speed and autopilot settings. Field told me his team had concluded that it would be natural and intuitive for a younger generation. “It’s interesting when you put young people in the car,” he said. “This is the way all kids navigate technology.” It’s also possible that the kids might do more navigating, or giving the car orders, than driving. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s design chief, later told me that in creating the car’s interior, he faced the question of making a car that was affordable and stylish but also relevant for a future era. There was vigorous debate within the company about what to do if the Model 3 became truly autonomous. As time went on, von Holzhausen’s group reasoned, this car would be driven less and would be driving more. Thus the decision to jettison dials and controls made sense, because the need for driver information would be reduced, and the central screen could mark routes and arrival times and double as an entertainment center. Those would be the essential tools. Or, as von Holzhausen put it, “The screen then became the hero of the vehicle.”

All of Tesla’s cars, including the Model 3, come with cameras and sensors; the sensors are small radar and ultrasonic devices situated around the car’s exterior that could enable it, presuming the right software is eventually developed, to become self-driving. Because each Tesla car maintains a cellular connection, over-the-air improvements dispensed by the company are a regular feature — tweaking acceleration or braking capabilities through uploaded instructions, for instance. Sometimes the extent to which the company can improve or alter its cars’ performance, even years after they left the factory, can be startling or unsettling, as was the case when Tesla temporarily extended the battery range for some drivers fleeing Hurricane Irma in Florida this summer. Self-driving, which Field assured me would ultimately come to pass with the right software and which Musk has repeatedly promoted to investors and customers, would allow Teslas to become something much more than they are. In the parlance of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which has quantified the capabilities a car must have to be considered self-driving, the vehicles will have nearly attained Level 5. This level denotes a safe and fully autonomous car that can operate in any place, and any conditions, without a driver.

At the moment, Teslas are at Level 2. Their cameras, sensors and software support a more modest capability known as “enhanced autopilot,” which costs an additional $5,000 in a new Model S or Model 3. In certain road and weather conditions, the cars can regulate speed and braking in traffic, steer automatically, change lanes and parallel park autonomously. By some industry rankings, these features now help make Teslas among the safest cars on the road. But following the deadly crash of a Model S driver who was using autopilot in Florida in May 2016, the company reconfigured what the cars permit. When I tried the automated steering on my Model S during the drive from Reno to Palo Alto, for instance, the car chimed frequently in distress and warned me through a dashboard notice when I took my hands off the wheel for a few seconds. I’d been informed that if this happened three times, the car would slow down, stop and rescind my autopilot privileges altogether. I didn’t push it. Clearly, the car — and Tesla, too — still needed its driver.

Whether the current fleet of Teslas can become A.V.s is not merely a technical question for the company; it may prove crucial as Tesla struggles to become a major automaker. In 2006, when Musk began to articulate his aspirations for Tesla publicly, he posted what he called his “Master Plan” on the company’s blog. He wrote that Tesla would transition from making an expensive electric sports car built in small numbers to making a luxury electric vehicle that expanded its manufacturing competence and market share before ultimately entering the electric mass market. The money from one project would be used to fund each successive project. And the larger idea was not to sell cool cars, or even fast cars, but to hasten the transition of automobiles from gas and diesel to electricity. Steve Jurvetson, an early venture investor in Tesla who now sits on its board, told me that there wasn’t much talk of a self-driving future at the start. “I don’t recall a discussion of autonomous vehicles and driving being part of the original pitch of Tesla,” he said. “It was a big-enough issue to prove that an electric drive train could be a success.” As he and Musk knew, there had not been a start-up American car company that had succeeded in nearly a century.

In the summer of 2016, Musk updated his vision for the company — “Master Plan, Part Deux.” In the decade since Part 1, the acceptance of electric vehicles had grown to the point where some traditional carmakers, in a surprising turn, were beginning to speak of an inevitable transition to an era when all models were battery-powered. Entire countries (like China) and enormous markets (like California) were also considering eventual bans on internal-combustion engines. As E.V. technology seemed ascendant, a variety of factors outside the auto industry were creating real potential for self-driving vehicles: great gains in computer-processing power, cheaper hardware sensors, better mobile connectivity, advances in artificial intelligence and enhanced mapping software. In his updated master plan, Musk stated that every Tesla would now have self-driving capabilities and that the application of “fleet learning” — a variation on machine learning — would help the company someday deliver a car that was 10 times safer in self-driving mode than when controlled by a human.

Musk also explained a new fundamental goal of the company. Tesla, he said, wanted to “enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it.” In other words, any new Tesla could in due time be part of a sharing network, able to taxi strangers around while its owner worked, slept or did whatever. Most Americans’ cars stay parked about 95 percent of the time. A Tesla would not. In the same way that Tesla’s electric drive train made the American car more efficient, the Tesla network would make the total utilization of the vehicle more efficient, too.

App-based sharing networks for cars already exist: These companies — Turo and Getaround, for instance — are different from, say, Zipcar, because they depend on peer-to-peer communications to arrange for rentals. In essence, they function like mobile Airbnbs, and in some cases have drawn the ire of users in the wake of driver crashes and insurance issues. A Tesla network would push this concept much further, involving perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of cars, all of them already connected to the internet. Yet such a business network, one Tesla executive told me, most likely wouldn’t succeed unless Tesla’s cars were fully autonomous. Any concerns about insurance and lending a car to a risky driver would disappear, he argued, if autonomous driving proves to be much safer than manual driving. Just as important, autonomy makes irrelevant the problem of getting the car to where it’s needed next — it can be sent wherever it needs to go via mobile app. What’s crucial here is that the Tesla network, if it becomes functional, can defray the cost of an electric car like the Model 3, which is billed as Tesla’s affordable car but can easily surpass $50,000 with various options. If your car is making money for you when you’re not using it, it effectively becomes a tool that uses the virtues of A.V.s to promote the market adoption of E.V.s.

Over the course of several months, I often asked people at Tesla, as well as those working on autonomous technologies elsewhere, how far away the self-driving future might be. There was no solid consensus beyond somewhere between two and five years. I tended to believe that the timeline might extend much further and would depend on how tightly we regulate such vehicles and how we agree to define autonomy. Does it mean interstate driving on a sunny day? Or driving within a dedicated area on city streets? Is it a Level 5 overnight trip through heavy rain from Boston to Washington? A driverless taxi pickup on a crowded street under partial construction — orange cones, backhoes, chaos — as a nightclub lets out? Part of the debate concerns hardware and whether the collection of sensors that automotive engineers now build into their A.V.s can collect enough data to create a fully autonomous car. These sensors generally include radar, cameras and Lidar, the expensive laser-based technology that Tesla has so far declined to use. Many other A.V. researchers consider it essential. Lidar uses light waves, rather than radio waves, to map and “read” a car’s environs.

Musk has promised that before the end of this year, a Tesla vehicle will drive itself coast to coast completely on autopilot. A number of competitors — especially Waymo and General Motors — seem to be closing in on similarly ambitious goals. But it’s worth noting that no Level 5 car has ever been publicly deployed, and it’s doubtful one even exists; the coast-to-coast trip on autopilot, Musk suggested, wouldn’t yet be an instance where a driver could, say, go to sleep at the wheel. What’s more, no Level 4 car, where the vehicle is self-driving under certain weather and geographical conditions, has been put in regular service, either. In fact, while driver-assistance tools like autopilot can greatly reduce crash rates, no company or researcher has ever demonstrated that a robotic automobile can consistently operate in the everyday world more safely than a car with a human driver.

An executive close to Musk told me that his boss believes that creating a true A.V. is a “solvable” problem, one probably less difficult than others he has encountered in various business endeavors — for instance, creating cheap, reusable rockets for SpaceX, his other major company, or pushing Tesla’s Model S to such unlikely success. This may indeed prove true. But unlike other tech innovations, the development of driverless cars cannot count on something like Moore’s Law, which has projected a doubling of computing power at regular intervals and has allowed Silicon Valley entrepreneurs a clear window into the future. Based on conversations with engineers on the A.V. front lines, the most difficult problem is rigging cars with sensors and software that can take a rich, clear, picture of every element in the surrounding environment — people, bikes, signs, obstacles — and then algorithmically choreograph the future.

This challenge is as arduous for Tesla as it is for engineers everywhere working to solve it. And yet the exigencies of Tesla’s business model add an additional layer of complexity. To reach its sustainability goals and become profitable, the company must make lots of cars that are electric and sporty and increasingly affordable; meanwhile, to prepare for the future, Tesla has to build cars that eventually won’t need us. Some of the most experienced researchers working on A.V.s believe that these are two separate and possibly irreconcilable ambitions and that it makes more sense to focus on a pure driverless car, even if it proves to be a very expensive proposition at first, rather than follow Tesla’s incrementalist policy, which would involve rolling out software on a regular basis until the driver does less and less and finally nothing at all. With the second approach, one Silicon Valley engineer said, “the market pressures that are going to be applied to those technologies mean that you’re not going to climb up the safety and reliability curve” to build a true A.V. Keeping the vehicle affordable is in constant tension with making the vehicle autonomous. Musk’s optimism alone can’t change that.

The first company to succeed at A.V. technology won’t necessarily capture the market in a way that, say, Facebook did with social media. Tesla might have time to make its current strategy work, and it could be that what matters more in the near term are the company’s advantages in batteries and electric vehicles (assuming it can manage the transition to mass-market production). Jurvetson, the early Tesla investor, told me that he thought the company with the best artificial-intelligence systems would come to dominate the auto business of the future. But he did not put a time frame on it, and he did not see it as a winner-take-all prospect. Vivek Wadhwa, a prominent tech entrepreneur and Tesla enthusiast, told me that he sees Tesla’s success prefigured in the smartphone market. “After five years, Tesla will become the Apple in the industry,” he predicted, based on the fact that it is best positioned to capitalize on the potential combination of E.V. and A.V. technologies. But Wadhwa pointed out that phones running on Google’s operating system, rather than Apple’s, are the ones that dominate the world. “Musk will be exactly where Tim Cook will be,” he said. “Tesla will be the iPhone of cars — more elegant, better designed. Maybe even safer.”

Musk declined my interview requests over the course of several months. By early November, the number of Model 3 cars coming out of the factory had fallen far short of what Musk had promised, the company’s stock price had taken a nose-dive and there appeared to be serious software and robotic glitches at the Gigafactory. Musk was said to be too busy to talk, which did not always square with his social-media postings: jokes, poems, photos of tunnels he was digging, links to stories about the dangers of artificial intelligence and, in one instance, footage of a camping excursion on the roof of the Gigafactory.

The company’s evasiveness and secrecy extended to self-driving cars, a subject it was unwilling to discuss in any detail. One Tesla engineer I spoke with, who works on autopilot systems, maintained that the company’s camera and sensory hardware will prove good enough to get his team where it wants to go, which as a near-term goal means cars with a self-driving capability that is twice as good as a human driver (rather than 10 times as good, per the second master plan). By November, Musk was telling investors that the actual goal was to get the system simply on a par with a human driver and that that might require a more powerful computer in the cars, which Tesla would swap in free if necessary. Some customers have already paid $3,000 for a Tesla “self-driving” package (on top of the $5,000 for “enhanced autopilot”), based on Musk’s assurances that the new cars have all the hardware necessary and will be autonomous once regulations and functional software are worked out.

There’s no clear indication of whether these efforts are on track, and in the past year, several engineers who ran Tesla’s autopilot unit have left the company. In early October, Scott Miller, an executive involved with General Motors’ self-driving efforts, charged publicly that Musk was “full of crap” for claiming that his cars could offer self-driving capabilities with their current hardware. His assertions echo those of some other Tesla critics I spoke with: Without Lidar, or a more expensive hardware approach, Musk’s cars may be at a significant disadvantage. Indeed, several people familiar with the company’s A.V. work viewed its self-driving approach as a perilous one, given that there is no definitive way to predict how long it could take Tesla to satisfy the promises made to customers. In the best case, if A.I. and software breakthroughs ultimately transform cars like the Model 3 into self-driving vehicles, Musk will have pulled off something that perhaps seems impossible today. In the worst case, hundreds of thousands of owners will have cars that won’t achieve the status of true A.V.s and can only hope that the sharing network of the master plan will someday become a reality.

Tesla’s setbacks, Musk noted in November, shouldn’t eclipse the fact that the company has already grown faster by some measures than Ford when it rolled out the Model T in the early 1900s. He takes a longer view of his business than Wall Street analysts. In a recent TED interview, while discussing his plans for cities on Mars, he argued that it’s a mistake to assume that technology gets better as time goes on. “It does not automatically improve,” he insisted. “It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade.” He cited the Egyptian pyramids and Roman aqueducts and how the knowledge to build them was lost for hundreds, or even thousands, of years afterward. The relevance is striking in a time when the federal government would rather subsidize the growth of the coal and fossil-fuel industries than renewable energy and electric cars.

Long before anyone saw Tesla as a legitimate player in the auto industry, Musk also appears to have understood that in taking chances that no established carmaker would, Tesla could be an innovative force to quicken our slow, plodding progress in transportation. Imagine Tesla didn’t exist, Steve Jurvetson told me. “What would the world look like? I have this sinking suspicion it wouldn’t look that different than 10 years ago. A bunch of hybrid cars. A bunch of noise about hydrogen vehicles. You know, I don’t think the world would look anything like today — where entire nations are saying, ‘We’re going to stop making gas cars.’ ”

The company’s impact, real and potential, is all the more surprising considering that Musk has staked Tesla’s success on the industrial equivalent of a shoestring, lacking the resources of established carmakers. He has used customer revenue, his own wealth, venture capital, bank and government loans, investments by other automakers and the American stock and debt markets to effectively fund a multibillion-dollar research-and-development project. In that way, he has led the industry to the start of a new era. And now his company, hindered by debilitating manufacturing bottlenecks and its extravagant promises of self-driving, is poised to find out whether, in laying the groundwork for an electric and autonomous future, he took one risk too many.",Tesla’s Dangerous Sprint Into the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/07/magazine/tech-design-future-autonomous-cars-factory-tesla-sustainability-gigafactory.html

Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh?
It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as “fresh,” surely it’d be the A.D.S.","Ben Zimmer Talks About Word of the Year

What a great idea for a theme! Given the word-nerdy kinship between neologism watchers and crossword lovers, I’m surprised it’s the first time this theme has been attempted.

The American Dialect Society has been awarding Word of the Year honors since 1990, but maybe it took this long for the stars to align just right — after all, the last two WOTY winners, SINGULAR THEY (2015) and DUMPSTER FIRE (2016), are nicely symmetrical (12 letters, with the same 8-4 enumeration).

Deb asked me to comment on each of the WOTY honorees featured in the grid. Though a couple of them are before my time — I didn’t really get active in the WOTY proceedings until 2005 (the year of “truthiness”) — I’m happy to kibitz in my capacity as Chair of the New Words Committee for the ADS.

MILLENNIUM BUG (1997): This was a very forward-looking choice at the time, given that we were still a couple of years away from the Y2K doomsday scenario foretold by software unequipped to handle the calendrical change from Dec. 31, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000. “Y2K” itself would go on to win WOTY honors for 1999, but thankfully the Cassandras were wrong and we weren’t all forced off the grid when the millennium arrived.

WMD (2002): Both “weapons of mass destruction” and its shortened form “WMD” received WOTY recognition for a year in which headlines were dominated by news of the Iraq War — and what turned out to be the shaky rationale for it. The U.S. never did find the WMDs that Saddam Hussein was thought to possess, but the abbreviation lives on (including the plural form “WMDs,” with the “-s” attached to the end like “RBIs”).

PLUTOED (2006): History hasn’t been kind to the 2006 selection. When the International Astronomical Union took away Pluto’s planetary status, it was such big news that “pluto” itself briefly became a verb — getting “plutoed” meant getting demoted or devalued as Pluto was. But the word quickly faded away, making this the most forgettable WOTY choice since 1990’s “bushlips” (a word for insincere political rhetoric, based on George H.W. Bush’s broken promise, “Read my lips, no new taxes”).

BAILOUT (2008): “Bailout” wasn’t exactly a new word in 2008 — it’s been used in the financial sense since the 1930s. But it was the prohibitive frontrunner in the WOTY race, since government bailouts were all the rage in the final months of the year, as we came to grips with the Great Recession. It beat out terms that had come to prominence in the ‘08 presidential race, like “maverick,” “lipstick on a pig,” and “hockey mom.”

APP (2010): The choice of “app” (short for “application”) reflected tech trends of the day, particularly Apple’s rollout of the App Store with the memorable slogan, “There’s an app for that.” Apple, in fact, tried to trademark the phrase “app store” after Microsoft, Amazon, and Google launched their own equivalents. A few days after the WOTY vote, the ADS press release about “app” was even quoted by Microsoft in its legal proceedings against Apple!

SINGULAR THEY (2015): The ADS picked a pronoun for the 2015 WOTY, but not just any pronoun. The selection of “they” as a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun was a long time coming — singular “they” has been in use for centuries by everyone from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Jane Austen. But in 2015 it gained momentum, thanks to recognition by style books and its growing popularity among those seeking a pronoun that could transcend the gender binary of “he” and “she.”

DUMPSTER FIRE (2016): First of all, yes, like “millennium bug” above, “dumpster fire” is technically two words. Word of the Year voting recognizes any lexical item — something that could serve as an entry in a dictionary, or, indeed, a crossword. People gripe about this every time a phrase gets WOTY recognition. It happened all over again last week when Collins Dictionary announced “fake news” as its choice for 2017. “Dumpster fire” was a popular way to describe the mess that was 2016, or particular messes like the presidential election or the Brexit vote. It looks like it has legs for 2017, too: Pawel Fludzinki was the first to memorialize it in a Times crossword back in March.

The ADS will be gathering to anoint a new Word of the Year on Jan. 5, 2018 at our annual meeting, held this time at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City (in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America). The WOTY vote is open to all, so you’re welcome to join us — or if you can’t make it, feel free to submit your nominations by email to woty@americandialect.org or on Twitter to @americandialect.

Constructor Notes

This puzzle came about as a result of a minor philosophical crisis. I’d read a blog post where the author was complaining about a puzzle that he felt “lacked fresh fill.” This complaint surprised me, because I’d personally found the puzzle in question to be quite lively. It got me wondering: what do we mean when we talk about “fresh fill”? What separates perfectly O.K., workhorse words from gnarly crosswordese? Can clever cluing turn a stale word fresh? And when does a word go from “fresh” to faddish, twee, or just plain annoying? I soon began to doubt everything I knew about cruciverbalism and, indeed, language itself. Around the same time, I read on Language Log (a blog run by an international supergroup of academic linguists) that the American Dialect Society had recently announced “DUMPSTER FIRE” as their 2016 Word of the Year. It struck me that if there were one word everyone could agree on as “fresh,” surely it’d be the A.D.S. Word of the Year. So I made a puzzle based on that idea. My initial plan was to seed the past several years’ winners anywhere I could fit them into a grid. But when I looked at the WotY list, I realized the word lengths might allow for symmetric placement. Luckily, I was able to pull it off. I’m super-duper thrilled for this to be my debut puzzle in The Times. Thanks to my friends and family (especially Cliff, Nick, and the Daves Madden and Sheppard) for their support and feedback. Thanks also to Mr. Shortz for actually accepting this thing, and editing the clues to be better and more consistent overall. My only regret is that UHF is no longer clued as “1989 ‘Weird Al’ film set at a low-budget TV station.”

Maybe this will make you feel better, Mr. Poulos. If nothing else, it will bring back the 1980s for you in a big way:

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

At the same time, I have a complex relationship with Japan because I’m Korean,” she said.","The migrants, whose story Ms. Lee tells in “Pachinko,” congregated in slums and performed mostly low-paid labor. Discrimination was rampant. The eventual liberation of their homeland at the end of World War II was a mixed blessing: No longer subjects of the Japanese emperor, Koreans lost the right to reside in Japan. Many had no homes or jobs to return to, so they stayed on anyway, prompting decades of wrangling over their legal status.

At the restaurant, a television showing K-pop videos hung next to a wall covered in white cardboard squares displaying autographs from celebrity customers — Korean food is popular in Japan, a paradoxical exemption from wider social prejudices. The waiter was a young man in his 20s. Ms. Lee cycled through English (her primary language) and Japanese (his) before settling on an imperfect middle ground of Korean.

The fictional family at the center of “Pachinko,” the Baeks, grapples with problems common to transplanted people: material hardship, unwelcoming locals, the possibilities and limits of assimilation. For them, as for real-life zainichi, ethnic biases are compounded by colonial-era abuses and resentments. The physical similarities between Koreans and Japanese make “passing” as a member of the majority a tempting possibility, but a socially and psychologically risky one.

“Koreans have suffered from the discrimination that all immigrants face, plus an added dimension that comes from their having been colonial subjects,” said Masachika Ukiba, a professor of cultural anthropology at Nagoya University who has studied the zainichi population.

“Many of today’s zainichi are fourth-generation, so they’re hardly immigrants anymore. They are essentially Japanese,” Professor Ukiba added. Outright discrimination has faded, he said, since the period depicted in “Pachinko” — the 1910s through the 1980s — but has not disappeared. Some bigotry has moved online, where trolls depict zainichi as “cockroaches” or fifth-columnists for nuclear-armed North Korea.

Ms. Lee spent nearly two decades conceiving, writing and rewriting “Pachinko.” The seed was planted in 1989, when, as a student at Yale, she attended a talk by a Protestant missionary who had spent time among the zainichi. Until then, she said, she had never heard of this branch of the Korean diaspora. Growing up in the United States, she was used to Koreans being viewed as hardworking and upwardly mobile, a model American minority. But many zainichi, she was surprised to discover, languished at the bottom rungs of Japan’s socioeconomic ladder.

“My level of research became a little neurotic,” she said. Although she was a Korean immigrant herself, she was entering a completely new world.

For ethnic Koreans in Japan, one route to economic improvement has been pachinko, a pastime derived from pinball. Played by millions of Japanese at noisy, smoke-filled halls, many of which are operated by zainichi, pachinko occupies a legal and social gray zone. The game itself is legal, but the gambling that inevitably accompanies it is not.

“Instead of banning it, Japan tolerates it but disparages the people who run it,” said Ms. Lee. She sees a parallel with Koreans’ place in Japanese society: deeply established, yet not fully accepted as legitimate members.

Ms. Lee’s family embodied the rosier American version of the Korean immigrant story.

In South Korea, her father had worked in marketing at a cosmetics company, but fears that the Korean Peninsula could erupt into another devastating war convinced him to leave. After arriving in New York in the mid-1970s, her parents operated a news kiosk in Manhattan, at Broadway and 31st Street. They soon upgraded to a wholesale costume-jewelry business, working and saving their way into the middle class and sending their three daughters to college.

“Pachinko” is a product of persistence. Ms. Lee discarded an earlier, more narrowly focused version of the novel, which she wrote in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Its original main character was Solomon Baek, an aspiring ethnic Korean investment banker who is subjected to bigotry and betrayal at a financial firm in Tokyo.

“It was boring,” she said — big on social themes but short on fully realized human characters and relationships. “I didn’t talk to enough people.”

The chance for a fresh start came in 2007, when her husband, a banker of Japanese descent, took a job in Tokyo. While there, she started looking for zainichi to interview — business people, pachinko parlor owners, bar hostesses.

“The first few were hard to get because I didn’t have introductions,” she said. “But then it was like the floodgates opened.”

Many of her subjects told love stories. Almost every Korean she spoke to, she said, had been rejected at some point because of their ethnicity. It was startling for an American: Even considering the United States’ unbridged racial divides, the zainichi seemed inescapably stamped by difference.

As she collected more stories, the novel grew in scope. It also became more feminine, she said. Ms. Lee expanded the role of Sunja, Solomon’s quietly tenacious grandmother, who leaves her Korean fishing village for Osaka as a young bride in the 1930s.

As an American, Ms. Lee was partly insulated from lingering bias in Japan against zainichi. But she still encountered casual ethnic stereotyping that surprised her. When she pointed out shoddy repair work at the apartment her family rented, an employee at the management company told her, “You Koreans are always complaining.” At the church she attended, when she argued in favor of paying the homeless volunteers who cooked curry at the church soup kitchen, a Japanese fellow congregant said it was her “Korean blood” that caused her to make a fuss.

Ms. Lee finished her novel after returning to the United States. During her recent visit to Japan, she noted that while “Pachinko” has been picked up by publishers in more than a dozen countries, including Turkey and Poland, it has not yet found one in Japan.

Japan’s own literature contains prominent works by and about zainichi, many exploring similar themes of identity and history. Yang Sok-il’s semiautobiographical “Blood and Bones,” one of a number of popular books by Korean-Japanese authors, was turned into a movie starring the actor and director Takeshi Kitano in 2004.

Ms. Lee said she hoped that publishers would not be put off by an unsparing look at Japan’s still only partly resolved history by an American outsider.

The novel by Ms. Atwood (who has a bit part as “Disapproving Woman”) is a challenge to adapt visually. It’s as internal and retrospective as “Handmaid’s” is propulsive, though both protagonists are slyly defiant. The screenwriter, Sarah Polley (who adapted a story from the Canadian author Alice Munro into the film “Away from Her”), turns it into a sinuous, layered script that is constantly aware of what is being said, to whom and why.

Mary Harron (“I Shot Andy Warhol”) directs the series dynamically. In an early sequence, Grace’s meditates on the curious phrase “celebrated murderess” over quick cuts of the crime — a body tumbling to the floor, a strip of cloth tightening around a throat.

For all that, “Alias Grace” isn’t overly brutal. It’s an exquisitely woven fabric with blood staining the corners. The violence is often in the language, as when a servant woman describes a death scene — the result of an illegal abortion — as smelling like a butcher shop.

You could almost mistake the series for a nostalgic period piece, as when a bushy-bearded Zachary Levi (“Chuck”) enters as a silver-tongued peddler, or when Grace befriends Mary (Rebecca Liddiard), a feisty, politically aware servant who fatefully attracts the interest of one of her employer’s sons. (The series follows Netflix’s roughed-up “Anne With an E,” which surfaced the dark subtext of “Anne of Green Gables,” another story of 19th-century Canadian girlhood.)

The series is conscious of class — there’s a little primer on colonial Canadian populism — and of how patriarchy pits women against women, like Nancy Montgomery (Ms. Paquin), the housekeeper and jealous lover of Grace’s employer, who terrorizes the staff below her.

Above all, “Alias Grace” is about how men abuse power over women, and how that power is always present, even when the men aren’t. It’s present in something as innocuous as a wedding quilt, which Grace likens to a battle flag. A bed may seem like a place of rest, she tells Dr. Jordan, but “there are many dangerous things that need take place on a bed.”

It’s tempting to think of this series, like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” as especially timely, with today’s revelations of sexual abuse in places of power. But to say that would suggest that there have been moments when these ideas would not be timely.

That doesn’t seem to be the message of the Year of Atwood, with “Grace” and “Handmaid” standing like beacons centuries apart. Look back on the calendar, they say, and look forward. The year changes.

Hideyoshi was known for his lavish, gaudy excess, and under his rule, tatehana, which he adored for its grandeur, had become increasingly more relaxed — libertine really — in its expressions of extravagance. (Hideyoshi once commissioned 40-foot-tall arrangements in 7-foot vases — for him, size definitely counted.) In response, Rikyu developed the wabi form of the tea ceremony, one that prioritized simplicity and slowness over polish, and along with it, advanced the humble nageire style of arrangements for the teahouse interior. Rikyu tried to refine nageire to its essence, evolving the style from an arrangement of several flowers to just one, housed in the most humble and common of containers, like a rice bowl or an earthenware jar. One day, upon hearing that morning glories were in glorious bloom in the garden of Rikyu’s teahouse, Hideyoshi made an appointment to see them. But when he arrived, they had all been cut down. He entered the teahouse and found there a composition of a single morning glory of such exquisiteness that he saw within it the beauty of the entire natural world. Hideyoshi was awed and affronted that his rival had achieved such transcendence, and later, he ordered Rikyu to commit ritual suicide.

FOR TOSHIRO KAWASE, the creative tension inherent in this duality is what creates the artistry in ikebana. Hayato Nishiyama might say the same. The florist lives and works from a small townhouse, which houses his shop, Mitate, in a quiet corner of Kyoto with his wife, Mika. When Nishiyama, bespectacled and monklike in his movements, grew interested in flower arranging while an art school student, he joined an ikebana club. He soon realized, however, that he wanted to study the plants themselves, and so became a gardener. While he has never studied formally, he has read many books on ikebana, including Kawase’s. His work follows in the nageire tradition: He uses exclusively seasonal plants that change form and color throughout the year — bulbs and wildflowers, ferns and grasses, camellias and cherry blossoms that grow in the surrounding hills — and eschews traditional porcelain or bronze vases for everyday objects that he transforms into vessels, like woven bamboo baskets, old wooden well buckets or bits of roofing tile. Traditional ikebana, like the traditional tea ceremony, has many tools — saws and wire and kenzans (spiky flower frogs that hold a plant upright) — but Nishiyama uses only a pair of scissors and works on the floor; he is inspired not just by the seasons, but by the constant change and movement within them. When we visited, it was early fall and he was making an arrangement with red-leaved rowan branches sent from a friend farther north, where autumn was already in full swing, and the last purple asters of Kyoto’s summer — a conversation between what was passing and what was to come. A work Nishiyama has posted on his Instagram feed shows three tiny flowers planted in moss, one in bud, one flowering and one beginning to fade — a tribute to how we are always living in three tenses at once, whether we recognize it or not, and a nod to both the fleetingness and constancy of nature’s cycles.

This emphasis on the brevity of life is one of the fundamental differences between ikebana and Western arrangements, but another is the particular recessiveness of the flower itself. Western arrangements prioritize full-frontal blooms, ripe and bold and staring straight at the viewer. In ikebana, there might not even be a flower in the composition, and if there is, it rarely looks you in the eye: It is more likely bent or turned to the side. Stems or leaves or branches are often emphasized over flowers, and those might very well be crooked or yellowing or covered with moss.

Highlighting overlooked forms of beauty, or revealing something ordinary in a new way, is central to Nishiyama’s vision. This is also true of Emily Thompson, who works out of a corner storefront in Manhattan’s old downtown seaport district. Well-known in the fashion world for her wild, wind-tossed bouquets, she too studied art and is a self-taught florist. Like Nishiyama, she has no formal training in ikebana, and yet her work, like his, can’t be understood without it. Thompson also forages and buys her plants from local farms, but where Nishiyama’s approach is purist, and his work gentle, Thompson’s can be voracious and bold, even aggressive. She culls anything from the natural world that can serve her: exotics, weeds, hairy seed pods, flower leis, dangling clumps of moss, even animal and vegetable matter. (Recent compositions have included a tiered topiary of asparagus spears and a bouquet of purple artichoke with phormium and geranium leaves.)

Whether she is creating a simple arrangement of just a few iris buds in a low bowl or a massive installation of dangling roots, twisted branches and an explosion of milkweed fuzz for a client like the Pool, the new restaurant in New York City, Thompson is always attempting “to build worlds made of the infinite wealth of nature.” As she explains, “I don’t follow any master except for my own powerful sense of responsibility that the flowers should be afforded their own identities.” Her compositions do reflect the seasons — there is a delicacy to her work in spring, a lushness in summer, a decay in fall and a barrenness in winter — and yet they also challenge us to re-see what an arrangement can look like. Thompson’s pieces might at first glance appear chaotic, but eventually, one begins to see the logic that informs them: A grouping of wild greenbrier with branches of white oak seems to blow to one side, as if buffeted by the wind. “My insistence on incorporating flawed materials,” she says, “showing a diseased branch, a rose in all stages or a chrysalis hanging off it, shows that this is not just a product but a living organism.”

This, too, is ikebana, practiced many centuries and miles away from when and where it began. “How can [a floral artist] not have a relationship to ikebana?” Thompson says. “Much as asymmetry is defined by symmetry; ikebana is always in the room when one works with flowers.”

Her work, like Nishiyama’s, is a reminder that like all living arts, ikebana changes and is informed by the culture and the times; what makes ikebana especially poignant and potent in this moment is its direct and personal connection to nature, its awareness of and emphasis on decay in an era in which our own ecological and environmental ruin feels more vivid than ever. A cherry blossom in bloom will soon be gone. But for this instant, it’s ours — and while it is, who among us can turn away from it?",The Rise of Modern Ikebana,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/t-magazine/ikebana-japanese-flower-art.html

About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average.
“You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,” Mr. Mazur said.
But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.
Advertisement Continue reading the main storyDemocrats, meanwhile, have been quick to seize on analyses finding middle-class tax increases.","The Times analysis looks at the direct effect of the tax changes on Americans’ incomes and does not account for changes in economic growth that Republicans say will amplify the impact of the tax cut and deliver higher wages to Americans across the income spectrum. Economic models disagree about the size of those effects, but generally agree they would be smaller in the initial years after a bill was passed since the tax cuts would take a while to filter throughout the economy.

Still, Republican leaders in Congress and the White House haven’t just argued that the bill would have broader economic advantages. Rather, they have repeatedly described it as a tax cut for middle-class families.

“This whole tax reform is designed for the middle-class family that’s working so hard, for that Main Street business that’s working so hard,” Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on MSNBC on Thursday. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, went further, telling the MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt over the weekend that “nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase” under the bill.

Few independent economists find evidence to support that claim. Analyses published since the plan was introduced last week have consistently found that some middle-class families would see their taxes go up immediately, compared with existing law. One such analysis, from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 8 percent of middle-income earners would pay more in 2018 — and 21 percent in 2027 — with upper-middle-class taxpayers more likely to see their taxes rise.

The Times analysis accounts for the differing financial situations of Americans who look relatively similar on paper. It shows significant differences in how “typical” families might fare under the Republican bill.

Consider, for example, a four-person family earning about $75,000 a year. There are nearly 150,000 such taxpayers in the United States, according to data from the Census Bureau. About two-thirds of them would benefit under the Republican tax plan, with their taxes falling by about $1,500 on average. But the other third’s taxes would go up, by nearly $700 on average, and some would pay thousands of dollars more than under current law.

The Benefit for the Middle Class Under the Republican tax proposal, 68 percent of taxpayers who earned between about $50,000 and $160,000 in a family of three would get a tax cut, but 29 percent would see their taxes rise. In about a decade, the number who got a tax cut would decrease to 53 percent. 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100 –75 –50 –25% +25% +50 +75 +100 7 % 7 % SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS SHARE OF MIDDLE- CLASS TAXPAYERS 6 6 5 5 4 4 Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2018 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2018 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100% PERCENTAGE TAX CUT PERCENTAGE TAX INCREASE 5 % 5 % Middle-class taxpayers who would get a tax cut in 2026 Middle-class taxpayers whose taxes would increase in 2026 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 –100% –75% –50% –25% +25% +50% +75% +100%

The bill is devised to allow millions of Americans to simplify their tax returns — to file, as Republican leaders put it, “on a postcard.” The plan would most likely simplify taxes for some taxpayers, who would choose to take advantage of the plan’s more generous standard deduction. But the analysis suggests that among lower- and middle-class families, the greatest benefits of the bill flow to those taxpayers who already file simple returns and do not itemize their taxes.

The millions losing out under the bill would largely be families with more complicated finances, who now generally itemize their deductions. The bill would eliminate many common and valuable tax deductions that, in some cases, would eliminate thousands of dollars in tax benefits. This would be particularly acute for taxpayers who deducted state and local income and property tax payments, interest on student loans, or the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers.

The plan could be particularly costly for Americans facing large medical bills. Nearly nine million taxpayers collectively deducted about $84 billion in medical expenses from their taxes in 2015. The House bill would eliminate that deduction.

Mark Mazur, the director of the independent Tax Policy Center, said any attempt to reform the tax system — as opposed to just a broad-based tax cut — would have winners and losers. But he noted that many of the provisions that would benefit middle-class taxpayers in the House bill were set to expire or lose value over time.

“You could create a plan that just cut taxes for middle-class people,” Mr. Mazur said. “That’s not what this is.”

The Times’s figures are based on an analysis of Census Bureau data using a tax model from the Open Source Policy Center, a Washington research organization affiliated with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. The organization’s model does not yet fully account for the tax bill’s treatment of so-called pass-through income, which is business income that is taxed at the individual rate under current law. And because the analysis is based on publicly available data, not actual tax records, it may not capture all the intricacies of Americans’ household finances.

The source of the tax increases is rooted in the structure of the Republican bill. The plan would roughly double the size of the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,200 for individuals. That could yield a substantial tax cut for many middle- and lower-income families that now take the standard deduction, or whose itemized deductions amount to less than those thresholds.

But the Republican plan would also eliminate many of the deductions now taken by millions of taxpayers.

Its elimination of the deduction for medical expenses could hit some families particularly hard because medical bills can be so large, unpredictable and unavoidable. Of the roughly 6.5 million middle-class families whose taxes would rise in 2018 under the bill, about 800,000 took advantage of the medical expense provision, deducting more than $17,000 on average from their taxes. Nearly 200,000 middle-class families owed no income tax under the current law at least in part because the medical-expense exemption offset their taxable income.

The Republican proposal would also be costly for many large families. That’s because, in addition to raising the standard deduction, the plan would eliminate the so-called personal exemption, which lets most taxpayers deduct about $4,000 for every person in their household. The plan would replace the exemption with an expanded child tax credit, but that would fill only part of the gap for many families. Fewer than 40 percent of middle-class families with at least three children would receive a tax cut under the plan, compared with nearly 80 percent of families without children.

Negotiations over the House bill are continuing, and details could change. In the Senate, Republicans such as Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah have pushed to expand the child tax credit further, a move that could mitigate many of the tax increases on middle-class families, but that would force leaders to find other sources of revenue to offset the change.

SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex. — One minute the Holcombes were a tight-knit family praying in the tiny church on Fourth Street.

The next, eight of them were gone.

Bryan and Karla Holcombe, a guest preacher and his wife, were dead.

Their son Marc Daniel Holcombe, gone. Their pregnant daughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, gone.

And four of their grandchildren — Noah, Emily, Megan and Greg — gone.

Twenty-six people were killed when Devin P. Kelley opened fire on Sunday at the First Baptist Church in this small Texas town, including the child Crystal was carrying, officials said. According to the Wilson County sheriff, Joe Tackitt Jr., as many as half of the victims were children.

And the gunman nearly wiped out the Holcombe family, leaving Joe Holcombe, 86, Bryan’s father, to mourn the loss of the generations he had raised. “We know where they are now,” he said in an interview, his voice strained by exhaustion. “All of our family members, they’re all Christian. And it won’t be long until we’re with them.”

It is a cruelty of mass shootings that they sometimes inflict double or triple blows on families, killing one brother while injuring another. But even in a nation accustomed to attacks of larger and larger proportions, the scale of the Holcombes’ loss was particularly brutal.

The Holcombes lived in homes near one another on family land in the woods around Sutherland Springs. The younger generations lived in double-wide trailers and the grandparents in a modern log cabin. “They weren’t clandestine,” said Terry Bolf, a longtime friend of the family. “Their gate was always open.” Family life centered on religion. Bryan Holcombe, who also ministered at the Wilson County jail, was a guest preacher at First Baptist in Sutherland Springs on the day he died.

The day before, his daughter-in-law Crystal was at the county 4-H competition surrounded by her children, at least one of whom won an award, said Bob Baker, a Sutherland Springs resident who attended the event. A few days before that, Noah, 18 months, was bouncing on employees’ desks at her father’s office, digging into Halloween jack-o’-lanterns full of leftover candy.

Her father, Marc Daniel Holcombe, went by Danny, and worked as a mechanic at F&W Electrical in Floresville.

At F&W on Monday, employees were red-eyed and trembling. One of the star employees was dead. Danny had just celebrated his 15-year anniversary there. He worked 10- to 12-hour days and was known in the company as “MacGyver” because he could find a fix to nearly any problem.

He took his faith seriously and liked to pull up Bible verses using an app on his phone. When he saw Jennifer Kincaid last week and spotted a fog light out on her car, he insisted he would fix it on Monday. “I think that’s hit everyone hard, to know that not only is he gone,” Ms. Kincaid said, “but his daughter is gone as well.”

Danny and his wife had tried for a baby for a long time, Ms. Kincaid added, and when she got pregnant, his wife “quit her job and devoted her life to having that baby and being a mom.”

Danny and his father, Bryan, were “clones,” said another colleague, Jay Dunn. They both had red beards and shared a quirky sense of humor. Mr. Dunn said that whenever they were patching up a machine and were not sure the fix would last, Danny would joke that “it would hold until the Rapture.”

Bryan was a local business owner who made custom canvas covers for trailers, Mr. Dunn said. Danny’s mother, Karla, was involved in the First Baptist vacation Bible school, and she ran a Bible school clinic for other churches, even lending props to them.

The family was also close to the pastor at First Baptist, Frank Pomeroy, who lost his daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, a seventh grader at Briesemeister Middle School.

The community hosted a vigil for victims on Monday, gathering to remember the Holcombes and others. But Mr. Dunn said he had not attended because “their entire family is pretty much gone.”

Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson — he had cracked the child’s skull — should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.

“The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,” the Air Force said in a statement.

The statement said Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to “conduct a complete review of the Kelley case.”

The Air Force also said it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported to the federal database for firearms background checks.

New details of the killings also emerged on Monday, including a possible motive. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Kelley may have been driven by anger toward his estranged wife’s family, the final chapter in a life full of domestic rage. In addition to his court-martial, in which his previous wife was the victim, he had been investigated on a rape complaint, though he was not charged and his relationship to the woman in the complaint was unclear.

The mother of Mr. Kelley’s most recent wife, Danielle, was a member of the First Baptist Church here, the target of Mr. Kelley’s rage on Sunday.

“The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a news conference on Monday. “We know that he had made threatening texts,” he added, declining to elaborate.

“This was not racially motivated. It wasn’t over religious beliefs. It was a domestic situation going on,” Mr. Martin added. Mr. Kelley’s wife and her parents were not at the church on Sunday, the authorities said. They could not be reached for interviews on Monday.

Among the victims of the massacre, the worst mass shooting in Texas history, were eight members of one family and at least a dozen children, one as young as 18 months old, officials said. One of the victims was pregnant, and officials included the child she was carrying in the death toll of 26.

Officers described finding a scene of unfathomable carnage, where mothers were found sprawled atop children they had tried to shield. Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. of Wilson County said that deputies found “blood everywhere” inside the church. “Wherever you walked in the church, there was death,” he said.

Mr. Kelley, who was dressed in all black and wore a skull-face mask, emerged from the church after he was done shooting, then was met by gunfire from a bystander outside, who hit Mr. Kelley in the leg and the torso. Mr. Kelley made it back to his car and led the bystander and another man in a dramatic chase that ended in a crash, with Mr. Kelley dead behind the wheel. He had shot himself in the head, officials said.

The shootings came a little over a month after 58 people were killed at a concert in Las Vegas, and were the latest in a string of mass killings in the United States. They led to another round of calls for more gun restrictions, though they were muted in comparison with previous tragedies, perhaps because gun-control advocates realized that a Republican-controlled Washington would not give in on gun rights.

Asked about the shooting during his trip to Asia, President Trump said Monday that the shooting was not related to regulations on gun ownership.

“I think that mental health is your problem here,” Mr. Trump said at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “This was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked during a news conference in South Korea whether he would support “extreme vetting” of gun buyers, comparable to the vetting his administration has sought to impose on visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries.

“If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,” the president replied, “and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.”

“If he didn’t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,” Mr. Trump said, reiterating an argument he has made after previous mass shootings — that more guns, not less, could be the answer.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he and his wife would visit Sutherland Springs on Wednesday.

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, criticized Mr. Trump’s response on Monday, noting that the bystander did not fire at Mr. Kelley until the carnage inside the church was over.

“Let’s be clear — nobody ‘stopped’ this shooting,” he wrote on Twitter. “26 people, including little kids, are dead in one of our country’s worst mass killings.”

Former President Barack Obama, whose own calls for more gun regulations were stymied, said on Twitter, “May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.”

The immediate question on Monday was how Mr. Kelley had been able to legally purchase his weapons. In his 2012 court-martial, Mr. Kelley admitted that he had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his wife beginning just months into their marriage. He also said he had repeatedly hit his young stepson’s head with his hands, cracking his skull, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force.

Federal law lists 11 criteria that would bar someone from buying a gun, including two that would seem to apply to Mr. Kelley: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison — assaulting his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years — and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.

The Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show. It has reported 11,000 service members to the database, but almost all of them were because of dishonorable discharges, which prohibit gun purchases. Mr. Kelley, after serving 12 months in a Navy brig in California, received a “bad conduct” discharge, which is not by itself an automatic bar to gun purchases.

Elise Hasbrook, a spokeswoman for Academy Sports + Outdoors, which owns two San Antonio shops that each sold Mr. Kelley a gun in the last two years, said “both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.” Mr. Kelley had bought two other guns since his court-martial, both in Colorado, the authorities said.



Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas told CNN that Mr. Kelley had been rejected when he applied for a license to carry a handgun in Texas. State officials did not specify why he was rejected, and a carrying license is not required to purchase a firearm from a gun shop so long as the buyer passes the federal background check.

“By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?” Mr. Abbott said.

The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley’s hometown, New Braunfels, also released records on Monday that showed Mr. Kelley had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape by force in 2013. The investigation ended without the filing of any charges.

On Monday, Sheriff Tackitt of Wilson County, where First Baptist is located, described Mr. Kelley’s horrific and methodical path through the church. After firing from outside the building, Mr. Kelley entered the church, and fired his weapon from side to side as he paced through the room, the sheriff said. Among those killed were members of three generations of the Holcombe family, including the guest preacher and his wife, and an 18-month-old girl named Noah.

“There was nothing anyone could do until he came out,” Sheriff Tackitt said.

After Mr. Kelley stepped out of the church, a man outside was waiting with his own rifle. They fired at each other, and Mr. Kelley was hit twice. He then drove off in his car.

The bystander, who identified himself Monday night as Stephen Willeford, flagged down a nearby driver, Johnnie Langendorff, and they gave chase, at speeds upward of 90 miles an hour, Mr. Langendorff said. Mr. Kelley contacted his father from his cellphone during the chase to tell him that he had been shot, according to law enforcement officials, telling his father that he “didn’t think he was going to make it.” He soon crashed and was found dead behind the wheel with three gunshot wounds, including his own shot to his head.

Sheriff Tackitt called Mr. Willeford a “hero.”

In an interview with a local television station, Mr. Willeford said his daughter had heard gunshots from the church and alerted him. He retrieved his rifle and went to the church.

Mr. Willeford grew emotional as he spoke about what he saw and heard.

“Every time I heard a shot I knew that probably represented a life,” he said. “I was scared to death, I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them. And I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.”

“I’m no hero, I am not,” he said. “I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done.”

“I just wish I could have gotten there faster,” he said.",Air Force Error Allowed Texas Gunman to Buy Weapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-shooting-church.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

It would be nice if our tax code wasn’t red or blue but distinguished between social goods and social bads.","This is the beginning of the full-bore Republican assault on the private universities, which are seen as the power centers of blue America — rich, money-hoarding institutions that widen inequality and house radical left-wing ideologies.

Fourth, the bill preserves high top marginal tax rates on individual income and even raises rates in some cases on the very rich. Over the past few decades when Republicans have talked about tax reform, they have generally talked about sharply cutting the top marginal rate to 25 percent or even 15 percent. But this plan keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. And then it throws in some peculiarities. As The Wall Street Journal noted, under the plan a married couple would face a 45.6 percent top rate on earnings between $1.2 million and $1.6 million.

These changes could leave the rich paying an astonishingly high percentage of their income in taxes. Scott Sumner of EconLog calculates that when you throw in state and local taxes, rich Californians would face a tax rate of 62.7 percent.

Republicans would take the revenue from these tax hikes (and much more) and they would use it to lighten the load borne by corporations.

The intellectual case for general corporate tax reform is strong. Countries across the world have been cutting corporate rates. The United States now has the highest corporate rates in the O.E.C.D. and the third-highest rates in the world. Cutting those rates would attract investment, unlock money trapped abroad and increase wages for many families. Economists vary widely in their estimates, but Larry Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates, on the high end, that a lower corporate tax rate could increase working-household income by roughly $3,500 annually.

None of this is to say that the Republican plan is worth supporting. I personally oppose it because of the way it explodes the deficits. Second, the level of largess to corporate shareholders is frankly ridiculous. It piles one corporate tax cut on top of another like piling a chocolate sundae on top of chocolate cake on top of a Toblerone bar.

This is not a column about the workability or advisability of this or that plan. This is a column about the sort of social vision that serves as a predicate for that plan.

The Republicans have a social vision. The Republican vision is that the corporate sector is more important to a healthy America than the professional and nonprofit sector. The Republican vision is that companies that thrive in the red states, like manufacturing and agriculture, are more important for the country than the industries that thrive in blue states, like finance, media, the academy and the movies.

What, by contrast, is the Democratic vision? Are Democrats going to spend the next few months defending the mortgage interest deduction and other tax breaks for their own rich?

It could be that economic policy is becoming tribal just like everything else in our politics. In that world, parties use their time in power to nakedly shift the tax code for the benefit of their own donors.

It would be nice if our tax code wasn’t red or blue but distinguished between social goods and social bads. I’d love to see a tax code that rewarded investment and discouraged consumption. That would mean cutting taxes on earnings but raising revenue through a progressive consumption tax. I’d love to see a tax code that punished pollution but encouraged social cohesion. That would mean taxing carbon but increasing tax credits for working people and families with children.

You may or may not like my vision, but it’s more elevated than the visions that are now emerging, which are a dressed-up version of the spoils system: more money for my political friends and less for my political foes.",The Clash of Social Visions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/opinion/republicans-taxes-cuts.html

On Monday night, David McCraw, The Times’s deputy general counsel, declined to say what those remedies might be. But, he said, “I think that what they owe us is an explanation of what actually happened,” adding, “We need to know much more.”

Mr. Boies did not respond to an email inquiry on Monday. But he told The New Yorker that while he oversaw the contract, he himself did not select the firm or direct its agents. And while he said he did not believe his work for Mr. Weinstein and his firm’s representation of The Times represented a conflict, “We should not have been contracting and paying investigators that we did not select and direct.”

Black Cube promotes itself as “a select group of veterans from the Israeli elite intelligence units.”

One of its agents posed as a potential Weinstein accuser to secure two meetings with Ben Wallace, a New York magazine reporter who was pursuing a Weinstein article that never came to be.

Ms. Kantor was also investigated, along with the New Yorker reporter on the Weinstein story, Ronan Farrow, by another firm Mr. Weinstein hired, PSOPS.

It would be hard, however, to fault Thailand and its Vietnam War veterans for seeing the war as a kind of national success.","By all accounts, the Thai troops fought well. From their base at Bear Cat Camp in Bien Hoa Province, they clashed with the Viet Cong in medium and small engagements along the vital National Route 15 linking the port of Vung Tau to areas surrounding Saigon. Thai newspapers of the day reported the successes in impressive ratios of enemy soldiers to Thai dead that looked like winning tallies of a sports score, such as “In 150 Fights, 100 [Thais] Are Dead, 1000 Viet Cong Are Killed.” Many veterans recalled how even Gen. William C. Westmoreland, commander of the Military Assistance Command — Vietnam, praised them.

The pride was cultural, too, a sign that their country had made it onto the world stage. Thai soldiers recall the Vietnam War as a yearlong opportunity to observe the American-style consumerism that would influence Thailand in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. The soldiers delighted in the affordable American consumer goods they encountered in the military post exchanges, or PXs. They saved up their pay to buy their first SLR cameras, televisions, refrigerators, stereo systems, champagne, Scotch and Playboy magazines.

This focus on materialism would taint their reputation. The zest with which Thai soldiers sought American goods at the PX stores caught the attention of international journalists. Reports describing the Thai soldiers’ involvement in schemes to sell PX goods to Saigon’s black market appeared in the American press, including in The New York Times. In the early 1970s, during the Senate’s Foreign Relations subcommittee hearings into the Vietnam War, it was revealed that the United States was paying the full cost of Thailand’s deployment. This revelation and the negative PX reports contributed to the Thai troops’ reputation in some histories as “America’s mercenaries.”

This wasn’t entirely off base. Thailand was a significant beneficiary of American largess during the Vietnam War years. Its military-dominated government had been a stalwart ally of the United States from the earliest days of the Cold War, and had committed its territory, people and resources to the American-led campaign against Hanoi and its allies. In return the United States poured $1.1 billion in economic and military aid into Thailand; the United States Agency for International Development gave an additional $530 million.

Thailand hosted seven air bases that launched American military aircraft daily on missions to strike strategic targets in Laos, North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The United States funded the rapid expansion of a naval base and port facilities that brought war-related supplies into the region. At the height of the war, some 50,000 American military personnel were stationed throughout Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs, many with connections to the government, built scores of new hotels, restaurants and bars to serve the waves of free-spending American G.I.s visiting on R&R. The G.I.s added $111 million to the Thai economy. At the war’s end, Thailand kept all of this military equipment and infrastructure. The Buddhist kingdom saw itself rapidly modernized thanks to the war.

The “mercenary” tag has done little to harm the soldiers’ reputation at home. Thailand’s official memorials to its Vietnam War veterans laud battlefield success, military professionalism and honor. The Thai Vietnam War Veterans Memorial in Kanchanaburi evokes the more famous World War II-era monument in Bangkok called Victory Monument. Its bas-relief images show well-armed Thai troops defeating ragtag Viet Cong guerrillas. The Royal Thai Army counts the Vietnam War as one of its proudest moments of the 20th century. The dioramas and displays in the official National Memorial Museum outside Bangkok show Thai troops killing their communist foes in arrangements that stress the successful defense of Thailand.

Less evident today is the terrible cost that Thailand paid for its involvement in the war. In addition to the 351 killed in action and the 1,351 wounded in Vietnam, Thailand sent volunteer troops to Laos in the so-called Secret War, many of whom fought and died under terrible conditions. The Vietnam War and the presence of American military personnel played a role in inciting episodes of political violence in the mid-1970s, notably the horrific massacres of student demonstrators by troops, police officers and vigilante gangs in 1973 and 1976.

Bangkok’s notorious red-light districts catering to Western sex tourists trace their origins to the R&R visits by American troops. Some of these soldiers left behind unacknowledged offspring from short-term relationships with Thai women; many of these children were raised in poverty and ostracization. But these events — and especially their connection to the war — are largely elided from Thailand’s official memorials and histories.

It would be hard, however, to fault Thailand and its Vietnam War veterans for seeing the war as a kind of national success. In the two decades after Hanoi’s capture of Saigon, a unified Vietnam endured warfare, poverty and isolation. The most common images of Vietnam in this period were those of desperate seaborne refugees — the Vietnamese boat people — who risked their lives to escape the deprivation and harassment in the postwar period.

In that same period that Vietnam suffered, Thailand saw foreign investment soar. American-built highways now linked rural areas to Bangkok and regional capitals. The rice-growing countryside added factories and processing plants in a spate of rapid industrialization. The former R&R infrastructure left over from the war became the basis of a world-famous tourist industry that has grown enormously since the mid-1970s; this year foreign tourists are expected to add nearly $50 billion to the Thai economy. For all of the downsides that Thailand found in being America’s ally in a losing effort, it can legitimately claim, as it does in its monuments, command histories and veterans’ memories, that it came out of the Vietnam War a winner.",Why Thailand Takes Pride in the Vietnam War,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/opinion/thailand-vietnam-war.html

THURSDAY PUZZLE — I will not hold a grudge against the constructor Jacob Stulberg just because he made a puzzle that was bound to make me remember how bad I am at this particular kind of theme. The reason I will not hold a grudge is because the theme itself is very clever and almost a parody of the form. And I can appreciate a good parody.

But if I were going to hold a grudge, this would be the perfect puzzle over which to do it.

Because rebuses. I just don’t see them. It’s a flaw in my brain. My best piece of advice to anyone who asks how to recognize whether there is a rebus element in their crossword is to say that if you find yourself cursing at the puzzle because none of your expected answers fit, it is more than likely that it’s a rebus theme. And even with that bit of knowledge in my brain, I still miss them.

The trick today is to make your way down to the revealer at 59A as early as possible, and hope to high heaven that you know your active volcanos. MT. EREBUS is the southernmost active volcano (You’re welcome) and if you break the name up, you might get MTE REBUS.

CVS Health said on Monday that it would begin offering next-day delivery of prescription drugs and same-day service in some big cities next year, reflecting the company’s worries about potential competition from Amazon.

CVS Health also said its retail sales declined in the third quarter of this year, a dip that the company said occurred because of the three major hurricanes that forced many stores to close.

Amazon’s possible expansion into prescription drugs has set the pharmacy industry on edge in recent months, igniting fears that the online behemoth will upend the existing business in much the same way that it has disrupted other consumer markets, from books to household supplies to groceries.

Amazon has not publicly announced its plans. But it has acquired several state-level permits to be a wholesale pharmacy distributor over the past year and recently hired a handful of executives from the drug industry.

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Among individual solvers, Japan’s Ken Endo was first, scoring 7,655 points, far ahead of Germany’s Ulrich Voigt (previous 11-time W.P.C. champion), in second place, with 6,782; and Kota Morinishi, also of Japan, in third, with 6,724. Each puzzle was worth 5 to 250 points depending on difficulty.

The luxury automaker BMW has issued two recalls involving about one million cars and sport utility vehicles that are at risk of catching fire even when they are not in use.

The first recall covers more than 672,000 cars. It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.

The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i. In these vehicles, the heater designed to keep the positive crankcase ventilation from freezing has the potential to short-circuit, causing the parts inside its valve to melt. The crankcase ventilation system helps gases escape from an internal combustion engine.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

But this nightmare year has upended assumptions about the durability of the rules, formal and informal, governing our politics. There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Jay Kaskel takes us another step closer to the most boo-tiful day of the year with a puzzle about a stereotypical witch.

First Witch: When shall we three meet again

In thunder, lightning, or in rain? Second Witch: When the hurly-burly’s done,

When the battle’s lost and won. — Macbeth, Act I, Scene 1

Today’s Theme

Four phrases are reinterpreted as things that might be in the life of a witch. For example, witches cast spells, so “Computer help for a witch?” would be SPELL CHECK. Similarly, WARTS AND ALL at 41A is “How one might be forced to accept a witch?” because a witch has at least one wart. (Practitioners of witchcraft, please do not write to me objecting to this. I know you do not have warts. We’re talking about the cartoon stereotype.)

19D: We’re talking about slang for money here. “Bill worth 100 smackers” is a C SPOT, which must be very rare, since multitudes of relationship experts have written about trying to find it.

Constructor Notes

I originally set out to create a Halloween-themed puzzle that incorporated all the familiar characters associated with Halloween: witches, ghosts, skeletons, vampires and zombies. But the theme never felt tight enough. After a while, I settled on a witch/BROOM HILDA-themed puzzle and sent it off. While Will liked the idea, he felt young solvers might not be familiar with the character. So not only did I have to replace BROOM HILDA at 58-Across, I had to do some serious re-cluing (CHARM SCHOOL, for example, was clued as “Educational institution attended by 58-Across?”) Here’s where things got tricky. One of the original theme entries was WITCH HUNT, which meant I couldn’t use the word “witch” in the clues. “Educational institution attended by a Halloween broom-rider” just didn’t do the trick. It felt too forced. In the end, I simply dropped WITCH HUNT as an answer, and thankfully Will was O.K. with the puzzle having just four main fills. As always, I can’t tell you how much of a treat it is to see one of my puzzles in The New York Times.

Thanks for dropping by, Mr. Kaskel.

Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.
In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday.
“We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you.","Even before the launching of the missile on Saturday, which was intercepted en route to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the crown prince had staged another surprise demonstration of the kingdom’s newly aggressive posture toward Iran and Lebanon. The prince hosted a visit from Saudi Arabia’s chief Lebanese client, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who stunned the region by announcing his resignation, via video from Riyadh, in protest against Iran’s undue influence in Lebanese politics.

Even some of Mr. Hariri’s rivals speculated that his Saudi sponsors had pressured him into the statement. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, said over the weekend that the Saudis had all but kidnapped Mr. Hariri. Mr. Nasrallah urged Mr. Hariri to return to Lebanon for power-sharing talks “if he is allowed to come back.”

On Monday, Saudi Arabia released a photograph of Mr. Hariri meeting with King Salman that was widely seen as an effort to contradict the theory that the prime minister was effectively a hostage.

The Saudi claims that Iran had provided the missile could not be independently verified.

Mr. Jubair, the foreign minister, said the missile had been smuggled into Yemen in parts, assembled in Yemen by operatives from Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran, and fired from Yemen by Hezbollah.

A statement from the Saudi Arabian news agency said “experts in military technology” had determined from the remains of that missile and one launched in July that both had come from Iran “for the purpose of attacking the kingdom.”

Citing allegations of Hezbollah’s role, Thamer al-Sabhan, minister of state for Persian Gulf affairs, said Monday that Saudi Arabia considered the missile attack an act of war by Lebanon as well.

“We will treat the government of Lebanon as a government declaring a war because of Hezbollah militias,” Mr. Sabhan told the Saudi-controlled Al Arabiya network. “Lebanon is kidnapped by the militias of Hezbollah and behind it is Iran.”

The top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Iran called the accusation of Iranian involvement in the missile attack “baseless.”

“These missiles were produced by the Yemenis and their military industry,” the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, told the semiofficial news agency Tasnim.

Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Saudi Arabia of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior & risky provocations,” in a statement on Twitter. Saudi Arabia “bombs Yemen to smithereens, killing 1000’s of innocents including babies, spreads cholera and famine, but of course blames Iran,” Mr. Zarif said.

American officials have previously accused Iran of arming its Yemeni allies, the Houthis. But it was unclear how Saudi experts would know how or why Iran provided the missiles.

With help from allies including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, Saudi Arabia has enforced a sea and air blockade around Yemen since it launched an attack on the Houthi forces there more than two years ago.

In Saudi Arabia, Prince Mohammed’s grip on power tightened further on Monday. American officials tracking the situation said that as many as 500 people, including at least 11 princes, had been rounded up in a wave arrests directed by Prince Mohammed in the name of a crackdown on corruption.

Some are expected to face undisclosed criminal charges while others may be pressured to testify about their roles in corruption schemes. Men were sleeping on mats on the floor of the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been transformed into a singularly luxurious prison to house the detainees.

The arrests cemented Prince Mohammed’s dominance over military, foreign, internal security, economic and social affairs inside the kingdom, freeing him to pursue an aggressive confrontation with Iran. That posture has been a hallmark of his rise over the two and a half years since his father, King Salman, 81, took the throne.

Prince Mohammed has sharply escalated a cold war with Iran, stepping up Saudi Arabia’s efforts to push back Iranian influence in the Syrian civil war, plunging the kingdom into a protracted military conflict against Iranian-allied forces in Yemen, and isolating neighboring Qatar in part for being too close to Iran.

His hawkish stance toward Iran also appears to have formed the basis for a close bond with President Trump, who visited Riyadh this year and maintained a conspicuous silence over the weekend about Prince Mohammed’s campaign of arrests. On Tuesday while traveling in Asia, he praised the arrests, saying the king and crown prince “know exactly what they are doing.”

Mr. Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently left Riyadh after his third visit this year. Prince Mohammed and Mr. Kushner stayed up talking together until the small hours of the morning at a ranch in the desert, according to an American official briefed on the trip.

Mr. Kechichian, of the King Faisal Center, said the arrests and the confrontation with Iran represented the convergence of two long-term agendas for Prince Mohammed.

“Inside he has been able to put his men into positions of influence and he has pushed aside his rivals,” Mr. Kechichian said. “And ever since President Trump’s visit to Riyadh there has been a very consistent policy with the essential coordination of the United States, and Iran is in the bull’s-eye.”

Robert Jordan, a former American ambassador to Saudi Arabia who now practices law in the region, said Prince Mohammed’s aggression was “compounded somewhat by what people would call a green light from President Trump.”

Mr. Trump has encouraged Saudi Arabia and its allies “to be more forceful against Iran, and to take more charge of their own neighborhood, and they have taken that to heart,” Mr. Jordan said. “They know America will have their back.”

Saudi Arabia also said Monday that it would “temporarily” close Yemen’s land, sea and air ports of entry in response to the missile firing, in order to tighten inspections and stop any weapons shipments. It pledged to provide for “the continuation of the entry and exit of humanitarian supplies and crews.”

However, the United Nations said that two aid flights scheduled for Monday had not been allowed to depart for Yemen.

“We’re trying to see whether we can get our normal access restored,” Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman, said at a daily briefing. “We underscored to all parties the need for regular humanitarian access.”

The United Nations considers Yemen, the Middle East’s poorest country, one of the world’s biggest humanitarian emergencies. Roughly 17 million people — 60 percent of the population — need food assistance, and seven million are at risk of famine. Nearly 900,000 Yemenis have been sickened by cholera.

Saudi Arabia accompanied its accusations against Iran with the announcement that it would pay bounties of up to $30 million for information leading to the capture of 40 Houthi leaders in Yemen.

“We fear nothing,” one leader on the list, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, said in a defiant speech on Monday in the Yemeni capital, Sana.

He called the arrests ordered by Prince Mohammed “a coup leading to the throne” and invited any dissident Saudis to take refuge in Yemen. “We tell the citizens and princes in Saudi Arabia that the Yemeni people are opening their arms to you. None will endure injustice.”

Yemen’s Houthi-controlled Defense Ministry said over the weekend that its forces had targeted Riyadh’s airport with a long-range missile. Immediately after the firing, the Saudi-led coalition hit Sana with the heaviest barrage of airstrikes in more than a year.

With the support of Iran, the Houthis overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2015, and they have controlled much of the country since.

While the Houthis have long had loose ties to Iran and have received some support, there has never been proof that they were proxies under the direct command of Tehran, as the Saudis assert, analysts say. But the Saudi intervention appears to have unintentionally brought the Houthis and Iranians closer together, Mr. Jordan, the former ambassador, noted.

The Saudi claim about Iran’s responsibility for the missile attack was difficult to evaluate in part because of the long and complicated history of illicit weapons shipments to Yemen.

South Yemeni forces acquired Soviet missiles during their civil war with what was then North Yemen before it ended in 1994, and the subsequent national government of Yemen, whose institutions are now under the control of the Houthi faction, had said as long ago as 2002 that it had bought a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea.

State Department cables published by WikiLeaks indicate that Yemen had resumed buying North Korean missiles as recently as 2009. But the Houthi alliance with Iran makes it impossible to rule out the possibility that Tehran provided or procured the missiles, even if they were manufactured in North Korea.

Analysts at IHS Jane’s say that it would be difficult for Iran to ship whole missiles to Yemen, but that the missiles could have been acquired from North Korea before the current conflict started.

Riyadh has been attacked twice before with missiles from Yemen, in February and March. The Saudi border area, including military bases in the southern city of Jizan, has also been targeted several times.","Saudi Arabia Charges Iran With ‘Act of War,’ Raising Threat of Military Clash",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-iran-missile.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.
“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said.","It seems fitting that during Walker Evans’s one-month stay in Havana in 1933 he would befriend Ernest Hemingway. The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

But my experience last week made me wonder if maybe the victims deserve a little space where we can just think about them, and the loss, before we throw ourselves into the fight.

Bret: I think we can and need to do both. We need to learn about the dead and honor the lives they led — or, in the case of the murdered children, the lives they might have led. But we shouldn’t shy away about talking about gun laws right now, or be cowed into not “politicizing” an event that has become so horribly commonplace that there’s no way not to politicize it.

How have we become a country in which one person can wipe out 26 people — 7 percent of the entire community! — because profoundly disturbed people have easy access to what amounts to a weapon of mass destruction?

Gail: You’re right. And when our president said “it’s a little bit soon” to start talking about guns, I did instinctively feel it was time to start talking about guns.

We’re definitely not going to have any disagreements here. Which brings me back to New York last week. Your column about living next to the terror attack was perfect. The one relief after a horrible event like that is the way average people come together. And people who in most circumstances wouldn’t be average — like a lot of your neighbors near the financial district — lose all their ego for a moment and just find comfort in being part of the group.

Bret: Thanks so much, Gail. That really was the striking thing: In the face of a terrorist and terrible carnage, people behaved with composure, decency and courage. I wanted to write a column that paid tribute to this, to the simple neighborliness and good citizenship of New Yorkers.

Gail: I remember right after 9/11 going down and seeing the hulk of the tower and running into Hillary Clinton, who was then one of our senators. She’s always had a not-unsurprising guarded reserve around the media, but that day she seemed to have lost all her barriers. She was just talking away about who was doing what, and what President Bush had said on the plane, and it occurred to me that she presumed that at that moment we were just two people in the community. That our normal roles had dissolved because nobody could possibly care about anything except the tragedy.

Maybe that was part of the reason I was so enraged at President Trump for instantly trying to make the story about how tough he is on ISIS. I can’t remember the last time I got so viscerally angry at a politician.

Bret: Among my 10 million or so objections to presidential candidate Trump, one of them was that he would be incapable of fulfilling the moral, emotional and symbolic role of the office. Obama and Bush both did, and I’ll never forget Clinton’s moving speech after the Oklahoma City bombing. But it’s the mark of the narcissist that he won’t, or can’t, perform the role, because ultimately the only person whose needs and feelings concern him are his own.

Gail: We are now really well aware of the difference between an egotist, which is pretty much all politicians, and a narcissist, which is somebody you just cannot have in the top job.

Bret: Speaking of rage, it also enraged me that he wasted no time turning the tragedy into a talking point about immigration. If he wants to talk immigration, he should spend a day in Stuyvesant High School, the elite magnet public school that was the endpoint of the terror attack, and note how many of the students there are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, many of them Muslim, by the way.

Gail: You’re so right. Look, this is making me angry all over again. Let’s change the subject for a moment. The Republicans have finally come up with a tax plan. What did you think?

Bret: Must it always be death or taxes?

I basically like it. It does four important things: It gives us an internationally competitive corporate tax rate and should reduce profit-shifting overseas; it simplifies the tax code.

Gail: Immediate prediction: Any simplification will become complicated before these people are through.

Sorry, go on.

Bret: It gets rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax, enacted in 1979 to hit a handful of tax-evading high-earners that now hits about five million taxpayers; and it decreases the subsidy to the real-estate industry with caps on the mortgage-interest deduction. Also, it doesn’t mess with our 401(k)’s, as some of us feared it would.

Music to your ears, too, right? I know our readers totally agree with me on this one.

Gail: Well, for starters …

As Steven Rattner wrote in The Times last week, the bill doesn’t do anything about a huge loophole known as “carried interest” that drastically reduces the tax rates for folks like hedge fund operators and, um, real estate developers.

Bret: That loophole is no different from paying the capital-gains rate on the sale of a home, but you know I’m antediluvian on this subject. Please continue.

Gail: Also, I do not understand why the party that is constantly at war with family planning changed the family exemption in a way that hurts people with a large number of children.

Bret: Here you make an excellent point. I can’t defend everything.

Gail: And the thing about eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes is just a raid on the blue states. One which I am eager to hear more about from Republican House members in places like New York, New Jersey and California.

Let me ask you — do you think this has a chance of passing?

Bret: Sixty-forty, I’d say, though with this Congress you never know. Tax cuts unite both the traditional and the Trumpian wings of the party, and Republicans know that if they can’t cut taxes they may as well not exist. Then again, all politics is local and most politicians care a lot more about their own political future than the party’s. It’ll also be interesting to see how Bob Corker votes: Don’t be surprised if he does to tax reform what McCain did to the Obamacare repeal — another reminder of the self-defeating nature of Trump’s politics of insult.

Gail: Whatever they finally come up with is going to increase the deficit mightily, which is one of Corker’s issues. I know your friend Paul Ryan would like to take care of that problem by slicing into Social Security and Medicare, and if that becomes a point of contention, it’ll keep the red-state Democrats from straying in the Senate.

Bret: We’ll see. Entitlement reform would be a good idea for the long-term health of the federal fisc, but a Republican Congress that can’t pass tax reform certainly isn’t going to change Medicare and Social Security anytime soon. I think a lot depends on the outcome of the governor’s race in Virginia, and what it says about the ideological future of the G.O.P.

Gail: Wow, Virginia. You’ve got a Republican candidate who was, until about 10 minutes ago, a super-establishment centrist. And now he’s yelling about immigrants and gang violence and people plotting to tear “our statues” down. This would, I guess, be the new Robert E. Lee wing of the party.

Bret: More like, “something old; something new,” but in any event depressing. Gillespie started the race trying to distance himself from Trump, who lost Virginia to Clinton by five points, by running an economics-themed campaign. Then Gillespie nearly lost the primary to a Trumpkin, and it all became about dead Confederate generals and bogus Latin American gang scares.

You know, the real issues.

Gail: Has anybody promised to bomb North Korea? This does sound very familiar.

Bret: If Gillespie wins, the lesson will be that any “conventional” Republican is going to have to do a convincing imitation of a Bannonite if he wants to win the primary and the general election. It will just accelerate the capitulation of the G.O.P. to the Bannonites, while Republicans with inner red lines are going to keep walking away from the party. The only silver lining I see here is that it slightly increases the chances of creating a third party.

Gail: So if you were in Virginia, would you be voting for Ralph Northam, the Democratic lieutenant governor? Or writing in “none of the above”?

Most interesting Republican news of the weekend was the new Bush book that reveals that George H. W. voted for Hillary Clinton while W. took the none-of-the-above dodge.

Can I just mention here that people who refuse to pick between the two major parties in important races are being weenies who just want to demonstrate their vast moral superiority?

Bret: Before last year’s election, my Trump-curious conservative friends kept telling me that an election is a choice and a none-of-the-above vote was a cop-out, and that’s about the only point on which we agreed. So I voted for Hillary.

I vote in New York City, thank God, so I don’t know local Virginia issues too well. But I’d probably vote for Northam. First, because he’s a former Army doctor and strikes me as smart and middle of the road. But mainly because I think that if voters don’t punish Republican candidates for becoming Bannonites, there’s nothing to stop the party from continuing to move in that direction.

Gail: Except for the Virginia saga, this year’s round of elections is pretty obscure — there are some very important state legislative races around the country, but I kinda doubt the whole world will be watching.

The other big governor’s race is a contest to see whether the people of New Jersey would like to endorse the career of Chris Christie by electing his lieutenant governor to succeed him. Christie may be the only major elected official in the country with worse public approval ratings than Trump. Not expecting much suspense on that one. Although it will give us a chance to rerun those pictures of him sunbathing on the state beach while it was closed to the public.

Anything else you’re following?

Bret: Did I mention that I also thank God that I don’t live in New Jersey?

Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman to win the New York City Marathon for 40 years. I was thrilled for her. Most of all, I was thrilled that New Yorkers have lost none of our passion for putting on a great show like the marathon despite what happened last week. The real winners were all the runners and spectators who competed and cheered in safety.

More than 1 million men and women in Texas have active licenses to carry handguns.
“I don’t blame objects for the good or the evil that people do with them,” Mr. Curry said.
Mr. Flores, 56, who runs a food stand inside the gas station, said guns were fairly common in Sutherland Springs.
“We see guys with guns and rifles all the time, but we know each other,” said Mr. Flores, who is a gun owner himself.","But for all the questions about guns swirling around the tragedy, there is one thing that was not in doubt. In a state where the modern era of mass shootings began with Charles Whitman’s 1966 rampage at the University of Texas clock tower, guns remain an inseparable part of the Texas DNA.

“I think that Texans have a history of taking care of themselves, a history of responsibility and freedom at the same time,” said Mike Sullivan, a former member of the Houston City Council who said he was considering bringing a concealed firearm to church on Sundays following the attack in Sutherland Springs. “There is no wrong place to carry a gun any more.”

Mr. Willeford, who lives near the church, emerged as a distinctly Texan hero in the tragedy. In an interview with KHBS television, he said his daughter heard gunshots and alerted him. He picked up his rifle and went to the church.

“Every time I heard a shot, I knew that probably represented a life,’’ he said in the interview. “I was scared to death, I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them. And I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.”

He added: “I just wish I could have gotten there faster. But I didn’t know, I didn’t know what was happening.’’

At a photo-op in Austin months ago, Gov. Greg Abbott fired a pistol at a gun range, and then turned to his 20-year-old daughter, who fired off some rounds with the same gun. People routinely show up at demonstrations with their bullhorns, their bottles of water and their rifles, because in Texas it is legal to carry a rifle slung over a shoulder in public. The state’s campus-carry law, which allowed licensed Texans to carry concealed handguns on college campuses, took effect on Aug. 1, 2016, the 50th anniversary of the Whitman tower attack.

More than 1 million men and women in Texas have active licenses to carry handguns. Only Florida, with 1.7 million as of May 2016, had more licensees than Texas.

One pastor in Beaumont, the Rev. James McAbee, was known for keeping a loaded .45-caliber pistol beneath the podium at his New Horizons Church. Mr. Patterson, the former state senator, often carried a gun in his boot in Austin when he served as the Texas land commissioner, and he saw no difference in carrying at a place of business or a place of worship.

“Frankly, if the church chose to prohibit lawful carry, as churches can do in Texas, I’d probably go to a more welcoming church,” said Mr. Patterson, who attends a Lutheran church in Austin.

The Rev. Stephen Curry, pastor of the La Vernia United Methodist Church, seven miles from First Baptist, said he has no doubt that some of those who gather at his church on Sundays are carrying concealed handguns. “I know they do,” Mr. Curry said. “It’s not unusual in this part of the country. Most of them are very discreet about it.”

Even being so close to the shooting on Sunday — one of the members of his church lost a relative at First Baptist — Mr. Curry said he saw the attack and guns as two separate issues.

“I don’t blame objects for the good or the evil that people do with them,” Mr. Curry said. “Objects are not the problem. The problem is the evil that lurks in the human heart. Yes, the perpetrator used a gun, but he was stopped by a man with a gun.”

Fredda Connally and her husband live about three-quarters of a mile from the church in Sutherland Springs, and have attended First Baptist off and on through the years. Her husband had not previously carried his gun to church, but probably will do so in the future because of the shooting.

“I think we’re both going to,” she said. “I didn’t want any part of it, but I feel like maybe we need to. It’s terrible.”

At the Valero gas station across from the church, Lorenzo Flores Jr. was still in shock. A family friend, Joann Ward, was killed in the attack. Mr. Flores, 56, who runs a food stand inside the gas station, said guns were fairly common in Sutherland Springs.

“We see guys with guns and rifles all the time, but we know each other,” said Mr. Flores, who is a gun owner himself. “Why should you or I not be able to protect ourselves or protect our families?”

And yet, even in a gun-friendly state like Texas, Mr. Flores said he supported more gun restrictions following the attack, to make sure that veterans like Mr. Kelley who were discharged from the military after criminal convictions do not have access to guns.

“If a man has a good mind and can pass a test and hasn’t been ejected from the military or anything, I’m all for that,” he said. “But if you’ve failed the test or you’ve failed the country by being discharged, you shouldn’t have the right to carry.”

Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said on Fox News on Sunday that churches should consider hiring “professional security, or at least arming some of the parishioners or the congregation, so that they can respond.”

The Texas Democratic Party called for Mr. Paxton to apologize. “Something is woefully wrong when elected officials wring their hands and suggest we can only stay safe by bringing arsenals to church,” Manny Garcia, the party’s deputy executive director, said in a statement. And statistics show that rather than making people safer, the states where it is easiest to get guns tend to have the most gun deaths.

Few in Texas seem persuaded.

“You can’t stop every incident,” said Homer Flores, 59, who lives in a Houston suburb and has had a handgun license for more than 20 years. “What if the ushers at that church had been carrying a firearm concealed, and this guy started opening up?

NEW BRAUNFELS, Tex. — He beat his wife, cracked his toddler stepson’s skull and was kicked out of the military. He drove away friends, drew attention from the police and abused his dog. Before Devin P. Kelley entered a rural Texas church with a military-style rifle, killing at least 26 people on Sunday, he led a deeply troubled life in which few in his path escaped unscathed.

In 2012, while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Mr. Kelley was charged with assault, according to Air Force records, which said he had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his first wife beginning just months into their marriage, and hit his stepson’s head with what the Air Force described as “a force likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm.”

“He assaulted his stepson severely enough that he fractured his skull,” said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force, adding, “He pled to intentionally doing it.”

Prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with Mr. Kelley, including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wife.

He was ultimately sentenced in November that year to 12 months’ confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank. His final duty title was “prisoner.”

His first wife, Tessa Kelley, divorced him while he was confined and was awarded the couple’s only four household items of value: a television, an Xbox, a wedding ring and a revolver.

After his confinement, Mr. Kelley was forced out of the military with a bad conduct discharge. The Air Force said the conviction should have barred Mr. Kelley from owning any guns. Instead, law enforcement officials say, he bought several.

Friends from New Braunfels, Tex., where he went to high school, expressed shock in the aftermath of the shooting, remembering how Mr. Kelley was a friendly, if awkward, teenager who grew up active in his church. His senior yearbook photo shows him smiling, with untamed hair and a Hollister T-shirt. But in recent years, friends said, he grew so dark that many unfriended him on Facebook.

“I had always known there was something off about him. But he wasn’t always a ‘psychopath,’” a longtime friend, Courtney Kleiber, posted on Facebook on Sunday. “We had a lot of good times together. Over the years we all saw him change into something that he wasn’t. To be completely honest, I’m really not surprised this happened, and I don’t think anyone who knew him is very surprised either.”

Instead of straightening out after his bad conduct discharge, Mr. Kelley began a long downward slide that culminated in the shooting Sunday.

After getting out of confinement, Mr. Kelley moved into a barn at his parents’ house, which they had converted into an apartment, according to the local sheriff’s office records.

During the next two years, he was investigated twice for abusing women. The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley’s hometown New Braunfels, released records on Monday that showed he had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape in 2013.

The investigation ended without the filing of any charges — Mr. Kelley’s only skirmishes in the local courts were traffic violations.

Less than a year after the sexual assault report, deputies were summoned again after Mr. Kelley’s girlfriend at the time, Danielle Shields, reportedly sent a text message to a friend saying she was being abused. Deputies who responded told a dispatcher, according to the report, that it was a “misunderstanding and teenage drama.” Mr. Kelley married Ms. Shields two months later, local records show.

At the time of both episodes, Mr. Kelley’s appeals were still pending before military courts.

Mr. Kelley was finally discharged from the Air Force in 2014. He married Ms. Shields in April that year. Law enforcement officials described their relationship this week as “estranged.”

A few months after the wedding, the couple moved to Colorado Springs, where voter registration documents list his address as Parking Space 60 at a collection of trailers in a gravel lot called the Fountain Creek RV Park.

A woman living in a camper next door, who gave her name only as Susan, said a man of similar age and description lived in Spot 60 for a few months during that time.

“He was kind of off,” she said as she loaded blankets into one of the RV park’s washing machines.

He said hello a few times in passing but was never friendly and stayed only a few months, she said. She never heard any arguments from his trailer.

“The only thing that sticks out about him was his dog,” she said.

He had a puppy that he kept tied up in the sun all day outside his RV without water, she said. She also recalled an episode in which the police were called because he had struck the dog repeatedly in the head.

Records show Mr. Kelley was charged with cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor, in August 2014, pleaded guilty and was given a deferred sentence. He moved out a few weeks later, she said.

While in Colorado and Texas, Mr. Kelley purchased a number of guns at gun stores, according to law enforcement officials. On Monday, the Air Force admitted that it had failed to enter information from Mr. Kelley’s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the weapon used in the church attack.

Mr. Kelley, whose father, Michael Kelley, is a computer programmer and accountant, enlisted in the Air Force soon after graduating from New Braunfels High School in 2009. Devin Kelley served as a low-ranking airman in a logistics readiness unit. A LinkedIn account in his name says he worked in cargo and distribution before his court-martial.

The account says that after the military, Mr. Kelley briefly worked as an aide at a youth Bible school in Kingsville, Tex., “helping their minds grow and prosper.”

Friends said on Facebook that in recent years, Mr. Kelley had become vocally anti-Christian, to the point where many stopped communicating with him. His Facebook page, which has been deleted, listed that he liked a number of atheist groups.

“He was always talking about how people who believe in God were stupid and trying to preach his atheism,” one of his Facebook friends, Nina Rosa Nava, posted on the site, saying she unfriended him because of it.

Law enforcement stopped short of saying religious views may have influenced Mr. Kelley, saying Monday that the shooting may have been motivated by a “domestic situation” involving Mr. Kelley’s estranged wife and her family.

Mr. Kelley never held jobs for long after the military. In June of this year, Mr. Kelley was hired as an unarmed night security guard at Schlitterbahn, a vast water park in New Braunfels. Less than six weeks later he was “terminated,” a spokeswoman for the park, Winter D. Prosapio, said Monday, adding, “He was not a good fit.”

By 2017, he had returned to a house in New Braunfels that records show was owned by his parents. The house was about an hour from the church where the shooting occurred. According to local law enforcement, Mr. Kelley’s second wife at times attended the church with members of her extended family.

The cover photo on Mr. Kelley’s Facebook page appears to show a Ruger 8515 rifle, equipped with additional aftermarket products, including a red-dot aiming sight for faster targeting and a two-stage trigger for greater accuracy.

Such rifles have been legal for civilians to own in most of the United States since the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, and have become popular among many firearms owners.

Mr. Kelley seemed enamored with the weapon. He posted a photograph of it on Oct. 29 with the caption “She’s a bad bitch.”

Law enforcement officials guarded the cactus- and rock-dotted Kelley property in New Braunfels on Monday morning, when the top of the house was just barely visible atop the tree line. A wire fence ran along the roadway.

Signs on a cattle gate at the entrance read “No Trespassing” and “Beware of Dog.”

Some neighbors said they sometimes heard gunfire from the property. But in this stretch of the Texas hill country, that is hardly cause for alarm.

One neighbor, who would give his name only as Doug, said he heard shots fired at the Kelley property that would set his dogs barking.

“My dogs, they would be outside, and we would hear, ‘Bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam, bim-bam,’” he said.",Texas Gunman Broke Child’s Skull and Assaulted Wife in Troubled Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/devin-patrick-kelley-texas.html

Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson — he had cracked the child’s skull — should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.

“The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,” the Air Force said in a statement.

The statement said Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to “conduct a complete review of the Kelley case.”

The Air Force also said it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported to the federal database for firearms background checks.

New details of the killings also emerged on Monday, including a possible motive. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Kelley may have been driven by anger toward his estranged wife’s family, the final chapter in a life full of domestic rage. In addition to his court-martial, in which his previous wife was the victim, he had been investigated on a rape complaint, though he was not charged and his relationship to the woman in the complaint was unclear.

The mother of Mr. Kelley’s most recent wife, Danielle, was a member of the First Baptist Church here, the target of Mr. Kelley’s rage on Sunday.

“The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church,” Freeman Martin, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a news conference on Monday. “We know that he had made threatening texts,” he added, declining to elaborate.

“This was not racially motivated. It wasn’t over religious beliefs. It was a domestic situation going on,” Mr. Martin added. Mr. Kelley’s wife and her parents were not at the church on Sunday, the authorities said. They could not be reached for interviews on Monday.

Among the victims of the massacre, the worst mass shooting in Texas history, were eight members of one family and at least a dozen children, one as young as 18 months old, officials said. One of the victims was pregnant, and officials included the child she was carrying in the death toll of 26.

Officers described finding a scene of unfathomable carnage, where mothers were found sprawled atop children they had tried to shield. Sheriff Joe Tackitt Jr. of Wilson County said that deputies found “blood everywhere” inside the church. “Wherever you walked in the church, there was death,” he said.

Mr. Kelley, who was dressed in all black and wore a skull-face mask, emerged from the church after he was done shooting, then was met by gunfire from a bystander outside, who hit Mr. Kelley in the leg and the torso. Mr. Kelley made it back to his car and led the bystander and another man in a dramatic chase that ended in a crash, with Mr. Kelley dead behind the wheel. He had shot himself in the head, officials said.

The shootings came a little over a month after 58 people were killed at a concert in Las Vegas, and were the latest in a string of mass killings in the United States. They led to another round of calls for more gun restrictions, though they were muted in comparison with previous tragedies, perhaps because gun-control advocates realized that a Republican-controlled Washington would not give in on gun rights.

Asked about the shooting during his trip to Asia, President Trump said Monday that the shooting was not related to regulations on gun ownership.

“I think that mental health is your problem here,” Mr. Trump said at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “This was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual.”

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked during a news conference in South Korea whether he would support “extreme vetting” of gun buyers, comparable to the vetting his administration has sought to impose on visitors from some predominantly Muslim countries.

“If you did what you’re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago,” the president replied, “and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.”

“If he didn’t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,” Mr. Trump said, reiterating an argument he has made after previous mass shootings — that more guns, not less, could be the answer.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he and his wife would visit Sutherland Springs on Wednesday.

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, criticized Mr. Trump’s response on Monday, noting that the bystander did not fire at Mr. Kelley until the carnage inside the church was over.

“Let’s be clear — nobody ‘stopped’ this shooting,” he wrote on Twitter. “26 people, including little kids, are dead in one of our country’s worst mass killings.”

Former President Barack Obama, whose own calls for more gun regulations were stymied, said on Twitter, “May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst.”

The immediate question on Monday was how Mr. Kelley had been able to legally purchase his weapons. In his 2012 court-martial, Mr. Kelley admitted that he had repeatedly struck, kicked and choked his wife beginning just months into their marriage. He also said he had repeatedly hit his young stepson’s head with his hands, cracking his skull, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who was the chief prosecutor for the Air Force.

Federal law lists 11 criteria that would bar someone from buying a gun, including two that would seem to apply to Mr. Kelley: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison — assaulting his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years — and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.

The Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show. It has reported 11,000 service members to the database, but almost all of them were because of dishonorable discharges, which prohibit gun purchases. Mr. Kelley, after serving 12 months in a Navy brig in California, received a “bad conduct” discharge, which is not by itself an automatic bar to gun purchases.

Elise Hasbrook, a spokeswoman for Academy Sports + Outdoors, which owns two San Antonio shops that each sold Mr. Kelley a gun in the last two years, said “both sales were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.” Mr. Kelley had bought two other guns since his court-martial, both in Colorado, the authorities said.



Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas told CNN that Mr. Kelley had been rejected when he applied for a license to carry a handgun in Texas. State officials did not specify why he was rejected, and a carrying license is not required to purchase a firearm from a gun shop so long as the buyer passes the federal background check.

“By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?” Mr. Abbott said.

The authorities in Comal County, which includes Mr. Kelley’s hometown, New Braunfels, also released records on Monday that showed Mr. Kelley had been the subject of an investigation for sexual assault and rape by force in 2013. The investigation ended without the filing of any charges.

On Monday, Sheriff Tackitt of Wilson County, where First Baptist is located, described Mr. Kelley’s horrific and methodical path through the church. After firing from outside the building, Mr. Kelley entered the church, and fired his weapon from side to side as he paced through the room, the sheriff said. Among those killed were members of three generations of the Holcombe family, including the guest preacher and his wife, and an 18-month-old girl named Noah.

“There was nothing anyone could do until he came out,” Sheriff Tackitt said.

After Mr. Kelley stepped out of the church, a man outside was waiting with his own rifle. They fired at each other, and Mr. Kelley was hit twice. He then drove off in his car.

The bystander, who identified himself Monday night as Stephen Willeford, flagged down a nearby driver, Johnnie Langendorff, and they gave chase, at speeds upward of 90 miles an hour, Mr. Langendorff said. Mr. Kelley contacted his father from his cellphone during the chase to tell him that he had been shot, according to law enforcement officials, telling his father that he “didn’t think he was going to make it.” He soon crashed and was found dead behind the wheel with three gunshot wounds, including his own shot to his head.

Sheriff Tackitt called Mr. Willeford a “hero.”

In an interview with a local television station, Mr. Willeford said his daughter had heard gunshots from the church and alerted him. He retrieved his rifle and went to the church.

Mr. Willeford grew emotional as he spoke about what he saw and heard.

“Every time I heard a shot I knew that probably represented a life,” he said. “I was scared to death, I was. I was scared for me and I was scared for every one of them. And I was scared for my own family that lived less than a block away.”

“I’m no hero, I am not,” he said. “I think my God, my Lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done.”

For anyone who lived through the 1980s, the television series “Miami Vice” is the pastel-shaded, music-driven, drug-saturated image of the city forever seared into memory. At the center of this action in real life was the Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, a hotel and club in the city’s Coconut Grove neighborhood. Roben Farzad, whose family immigrated to the United States from Iran after he was born, grew up in Miami during those years. His new book, “Hotel Scarface,” is a raucous history of the cocaine boom as it played out at the Mutiny. (The 1983 movie “Scarface,” also set in this period in Miami, was filmed mostly in California.) “All roads led back to the Mutiny,” an undercover police officer who worked in Miami at the time told Farzad. “The druggies, the celebs, the crooked pols, spies, the informant, cops — good and bad — were all there.” Appropriately, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, the stars of “Miami Vice,” also were known to drop by. (Thomas even lived there for a time.) Below, Farzad talks about the haunting image that got him interested in the story, the filmmakers who inspired him as he tried to recapture a time and place, and more.

When did you first get the idea to write this book?

I encountered the Mutiny as an abandoned property 23 years ago, just before I left Miami — I thought for good — to go to college up north at Princeton. I had a severe case of senioritis in high school, and I had a job selling frozen lemonade at a street fair in front of this abandoned building. It didn’t make sense. Coconut Grove is like the West Village of Miami. This was not a run-down part of town. Waterfront property gets snapped up. Back in the day, you had Richard Nixon and the Bee Gees docking their yachts in the marina there. People were staring at me from these collapsed balconies. Eddie Money was performing live across the street, singing, as if on cue, “I want to go back / And do it all over / But I can’t go back I know.”

I was really haunted. I’m not given to the supernatural, but later I kept thinking back to that tableau. I think if I didn’t get homesick, I wouldn’t have thought back to it. It became a talisman almost.

What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?

Some really smart, ambitious and strait-laced people — class salutatorians, Federal Reserve Bank analysts — morphed into cocaine dealers in no time at all. The profit motive, you couldn’t resist it. Some very worldly people got a chance to get some cocaine for a few thousand dollars and turn it into much, much more money. And even if you tell yourself, “I’ll just do three or four kilos and let it go, it’s a victimless crime” — people couldn’t do that.

WASHINGTON — Then there was one.

Syria announced during United Nations climate talks on Tuesday that it would sign the Paris agreement on climate change. The move, which comes on the heels of Nicaragua signing the accord last month, will leave the United States as the only country that has rejected the global pact.

According to several people who were in a plenary session at the climate talks in Bonn, Germany, a Syrian delegate announced that the country was poised to send its ratification of the Paris agreement to the United Nations.

“This is the very last country that actually announced, so everyone has joined and the U.S. is now so isolated,” said Safa Al Jayoussi, executive director of IndyAct, an environmental organization based in Lebanon that works with Arab countries on climate change.

A White House spokeswoman, Kelly Love, pointed reporters to a statement the administration made when Nicaragua joined the pact, noting there had been no change in the United States’ position.

I’d never read an “Odyssey” that sounded like this. It had such directness, the lines feeling not as if they were being fed into iambic pentameter because of some strategic decision but because the meter was a natural mode for its speaker. The subtle sewing through of the fittingly wavelike W-words in the first half (“wandered ... wrecked ... where ... worked”) and the stormy S-words that knit together the second half, marrying the waves to the storm in which this man will suffer, made the terse injunctions to the muse that frame this prologue to the poem (“Tell me about ...” and “Find the beginning”) seem as if they might actually answer the puzzle posed by Homer’s polytropos and Odysseus’s complicated nature.

Complicated: the brilliance of Wilson’s choice is, in part, its seeming straightforwardness. But no less than that of polytropos, the etymology of “complicated” is revealing. From the Latin verb complicare, it means “to fold together.” No, we don’t think of that root when we call someone complicated, but it’s what we mean: that they’re compound, several things folded into one, difficult to unravel, pull apart, understand.

“It feels,” I told Wilson, “with your choice of ‘complicated,’ that you planted a flag.”

“It is a flag,” she said.

“It says, ‘Guess what?’ — ”

“ ‘ — this is different.’ ”

Although translation might seem a natural step for a scholar preoccupied by the connections between antiquity and later texts, Wilson was dissuaded from pursuing it. “My colleagues told me: ‘You really shouldn’t be doing that kind of thing before tenure. Before tenure you have to write, you know, the right kind of book’ ” — the right kind being one on a subject that your discipline has yet to exhaust. Wilson did write a range of books before tenure, most on canonical texts: her study of suffering and death in literature; a monograph on Socrates. But, not heeding her colleagues’ advice, she began to translate Greek and Roman tragedies. A selection of Seneca’s plays appeared in 2010; four plays by Euripides in 2016. Both projects were outgrowths of her old desire to “spend a little bit longer” with these authors.

I asked Wilson why translation isn’t valued in the academy.

“Because there is no perception that it’s serious intellectually. It’s imagined as a subset of outreach. That you’re going to be communicating with the masses, which is less important than being innovative within your field. And even though I think translation is a way of being innovative within your field, my colleagues don’t see it that way.”

One way of talking about Wilson’s translation of the “Odyssey” is to say that it makes a sustained campaign against that species of scholarly shortsightedness: finding equivalents in English that allow the terms she is choosing to do the same work as the original words, even if the English words are not, according to a Greek lexicon, “correct.”

“What gets us to ‘complicated,’ ” Wilson said, returning to her translation of polytropos, “is both that I think it has some hint of the original ambivalence and ambiguity, such that it’s both ‘Why is he complicated?’ ‘What experiences have formed him?’ which is a very modern kind of question — and hints at ‘There might be a problem with him.’ I wanted to make it a markedly modern term in a way that ‘much turning’ obviously doesn’t feel modern or like English. I wanted it to feel like an idiomatic thing that you might say about somebody: that he is complicated.”

I asked: “What about the commentator who says, ‘It does something that more than modernizes — it subverts the fundamental strangeness of the way Odysseus is characterized.’ I’m sure some classicists are going to say it’s flat out wrong, ‘Interesting, but wrong.’ ”

“You’re quite right,” she replied. “Reviewers will say that.”

How, I asked, would she address such a complaint from someone in her field?

“I struggle with this all the time,” Wilson said. “I struggled with this because there are those classicists. I partly just want to shake them and make them see that all translations are interpretations.” Most of the criticism Wilson expects, she says, will come from “a digging in of the heels: ‘That’s not what it says in the dictionary, and therefore it can’t be right!’ And if you put down anything other than what’s said in the dictionary, then, of course, you have to add a footnote explaining why, which means that pretty much every line has to have a footnote. ...” Wilson paused. “That goes to what this translation is aiming to do in terms of an immersive reading experience and conveying a whole narrative. I don’t know what to say to those people, honestly.” Wilson laughed her buoyant laugh. “I need to have a better answer to them, because they will certainly review it, and they will certainly have a loud voice. They just seem to be coming from such a simple and fundamental misunderstanding.”

“Of what?”

“Of what any translation is doing.”

What a translation is doing — and what it should do — has been a source of vigorous debate since there were texts to translate. “I’m not a believer,” Wilson told me, “but I find that there is a sort of religious practice that goes along with translation. I’m trying to serve something.”

Early arguments about translation were over the Old Testament. One tale has it that an Egyptian king of the third-century B.C. wanted a Greek copy of the Pentateuch — the five books of Moses — for the Library of Alexandria. Some 70 Jewish elders said to be “skilled in the Scriptures and in both languages” were sent from Jerusalem. Each worked in a separate room to translate in isolation. When finished, they compared their work. The 70 translations? Identical, “in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end,” according to one account. The translation was, literally, faithful: God himself had moved their hands in unison, only one possible translation for his Word. Called “Septuagint” after its 70 translators, this Greek version became a foundational text, both for the early Christian church and for the impossible standard to which all subsequent translations are held: faithfulness. Later Bible translators failed to meet that mystical standard. The Catholic Church took 1,200 years to accept Jerome’s Latin version (“tainted with Judaism,” was the charge, as it relied on Hebrew sources). The first English Bible’s translator, John Wycliffe, was disinterred and his bones were burned for the heresy of translating into English, and his successor, William York Tyndale, was excommunicated, sentenced to death by strangulation and burned at the stake.

Although you can understand, if not condone, how murderous rage at a translator might arise if a believer supposed a sacred text to have been desecrated by a translator’s hand, it is somewhat surprising that similar vehemence can greet translations of secular canonical texts. Perhaps the most famous such expression is in Matthew Arnold’s “On Translating Homer,” his series of lectures in 1860 when he was Oxford professor of poetry. In them, he offered a takedown of existing translations of Homer and then asked “in what faithfulness exists”: “The translator of Homer should above all be penetrated by a sense of four qualities ... that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, that he is eminently noble.”

Most every Homeric translation since has been scrutinized against his quartet of qualities. Wilson is not persuaded.

“These are not good criteria,” Wilson told me. “I think he was a terrible reader of poetry. It’s not like he ever translated Homer. I think he had a good ‘classics major’ undergraduate kind of Greek, but I think it’s all to do with a particular notion of aesthetics and class, the whole ‘plainness and nobility.’ It’s about noblesse oblige and you’re going to be the kind of gentleman who’s going to have gone to Rugby and that will be the kind of language that we speak: the classy kind of language. And projecting all of that back on to the classics. This is what ‘sweetness and light’ is. It’s describing a boys’ club. I think it’s very interesting that’s still with us. Those are the four? It’s just the boys’ club.”

“I do think that gender matters,” Wilson said later, “and I’m not going to not say it’s something I’m grappling with. I’m trying to take this task and this process of responding to this text and creating this text extremely seriously, with whatever I have, linguistically, sonically, emotionally.”

At the center of each of Homer’s epics is a warrior. In the “Iliad,” it is Achilles, the greatest of the Greeks, a demigod almost invulnerable to death. Although the war is begun over a woman, Helen, stolen from her Greek husband by a Trojan, the “Iliad” is a poem about and presided over by men. Zeus is the poem’s prevailing god, and what men do, or are willing to do, in love and war and in the friendships that arise in war and its losses, are the poem’s preoccupations.

In the “Odyssey,” preoccupations shift, radically. Zeus is replaced by Athena as the dominant god of the tale; the poem begins not with Odysseus but with his wife, Penelope, who has been without him for 20 years, in a kingdom overrun by suitors for her hand, whom the conventions of hospitality ensure she cannot simply expel. The reader doesn’t even see Odysseus until the fifth of the poem’s 24 books, where we learn that he has been living on an island with Calypso, a goddess, for seven years; that, earlier, he was detained by another goddess, Circe, with whom he also shared a bed; that the Sirens, as he navigates, call to him, desiring him; that a young princess falls in love with him; that, on all sides, women are temptresses, and whereas he submits, we are to understand that Penelope, alone, assailed, remains faithful.

“In the second-wave feminist scholarship in classics,” Wilson told me, “people were very keen to try to read Penelope as, ‘Let’s find Penelope’s voice in the “Odyssey,” and let’s celebrate her, because look, here she is being the hero in an epic in ways we can somehow unpack.’ I find that’s a little simplistic. What happens to all the unelite women?”

In the episode that Wilson calls “one of the most horrible and haunting of the whole poem,” Odysseus returns home to find that his palace has been overrun by suitors for his wife’s hand. Though she has resisted them, the women in her palace have not. Odysseus, after slaying the suitors, tells his son, Telemachus, to kill the women. It is an interesting injunction from Odysseus, who himself, during his 10 years of wandering, was serially unfaithful. In Robert Fagles’s much-praised translation of the poem, Telemachus says, before he executes the palace women on his father’s command: “No clean death for the likes of them, by god!/Not from me — they showered abuse on my head, my mother’s too!/You sluts — the suitors’ whores!”

But Wilson, in her introduction, reminds us that these palace women — “maidservants” has often been put forward as a “correct” translation of the Greek δμωαι, dmoai, which Wilson calls “an entirely misleading and also not at all literal translation,” the root of the Greek meaning “to overpower, to tame, to subdue” — weren’t free. Rather, they were slaves, and if women, only barely. Young female slaves in a palace would have had little agency to resist the demands of powerful men. Where Fagles wrote “whores” and “the likes of them” — and Lattimore “the creatures” — the original Greek, Wilson explained, is just a feminine definite article meaning “female ones.” To call them “whores” and “creatures” reflects, for Wilson, “a misogynistic agenda”: their translators’ interpretation of how these females would be defined. Here is how Wilson renders their undoing:",The First Woman to Translate the ‘Odyssey’ Into English,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html

On a foggy morning exactly 10 years ago, a container ship struck one of the Bay Bridge towers, unleashing a swath of oil that would contaminate the environment. The spill, caused by the Cosco Busan, was not the largest in Bay Area history — when two tankers collided there in 1971, they spilled more than 10 times as much bunker oil — but the numbers were striking.

44,400,000

The shipping companies that owned and operated the Cosco Busan reached a $44.4 million settlement to reimburse government agencies that responded to the spill; as restitution for the lost human uses of the shoreline; and to restore damaged fish and bird habitats.

53,000

The Cosco Busan sent about 53,000 gallons of bunker oil into the bay. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon explosion released more than 160 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

6,849

An estimated 6,849 birds died from the oil spill, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Birds from 65 species, including the threatened marbled murrelet and snowy plover, were killed.

The crash left a 100-foot gash on the port side of the 926-foot ship, which was traveling at 11 knots, or 12.7 miles per hour, when it hit the bridge.

The Cosco Busan’s pilot, John J. Cota, was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. According to his lawyers, he had piloted about 4,000 ships in a 27-year career before the crash — with only one minor accident.

But too often they have been, like the young horse-mutilator in “Equus,” freaks and villains. More recently, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” featured a hero on the spectrum — a role now being played, in a regional production, by Mickey Rowe, an actor with autism. And in “Uncommon Sense,” Andrew Duff, the actor who plays Moose, has a diagnosis of autism too.

Still, it can be difficult to find ways to tell the stories of nonverbal characters like Moose and Lali authentically, when even their parents don’t know what those stories are.

Mr. Paris and Ms. Paris-Carter, a couple with a family member on the spectrum, get around that problem by packing as much variety into their narrative as a 100-minute show will allow. As members of Tectonic Theater Project, they are expert mosaicists, comfortable with the process of research and montage that produced earlier Tectonic docu-plays like “The Laramie Project.” Though fiction, “Uncommon Sense” was developed over several years of investigation with “autism families” in Northern Iowa and elsewhere.

The result can sometimes feel too programmatic. Putting across so many medical factoids and bits of real stories has the paradoxical effect of diminishing a sense of emotional truth. You can almost count the items on a worthy checklist being addressed, one by one, in the intercut vignettes: safety, sexuality, employability, the push-pull of independence. But with their exceptional and sometimes opaque traits, Moose and Lali and Dan and Jess, who are composites, never cohere as characters.

Or perhaps that’s just the perspective of a neurotypical observer — a perspective that the play implicitly asks us to question. When the sound of silverware being sorted makes Lali miserable, “Uncommon Sense” helps us understand her discomfort by having us hear an avalanche of grating metal. (The sound design is by Stephanie Robinson.) When Jess reacts painfully to the fluorescent lighting “vibration” that a classmate doesn’t even notice, she seriously asks him, “What’s wrong with you?” One person’s disability is another’s exceptional awareness.

Even so, I suspect that most audience members who don’t live with autism will have an easier time connecting to the stories of the parents, whose highest hopes for their children begin where the depths of other parents’ despair might end. Lali’s mother, afraid that she will never be more than “a thing” to her daughter, dreams of a day when the girl might somehow be able to say, as other children do, whatever is on her mind. Spoiler alert: Be careful what you wish for.

And Moose’s parents must in the course of the play contend with the likelihood that their son’s abilities may never improve. What kind of life will he have, and how much of their own lives can they sacrifice to provide it? By serving, in effect, as his brain in the world, are they preventing him from achieving whatever growth is possible? Would he be happier in an institution? What would “happier” mean?

In the context of these racking questions, many of the play’s comic devices, no doubt intended to balance the pathos, seem labored. (Dan, on a first date, licks a young woman’s feet as a cat might.) Strangely for a work about difference, the shape of the storytelling tends toward the conventional. Yet when uncomfortable scenes are allowed to develop naturally — such as those in which Jess tries to manage a flirtation with the classmate she’s tutoring — real comedy, mixed with sadness, emerges.

If “Uncommon Sense” had less of an overview in mind, it might have focused more profitably on this or any one of its other stories. As it is, under Mr. Paris’s sometimes inventive but sometimes awkward direction, on a cramped multi-platform set by John Coyne, there is too much information pressing in from all sides. Neither the eye nor the mind is comfortable anywhere.

Which, on second thought, might be the most powerfully mimetic gesture in a play overfull of them.

Here are the facts at a glance about the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., on Sunday, in which a gunman killed at least 26 parishioners. About 20 others were injured. Read the latest complete news story here.

What We Know

• The Air Force acknowledged Monday that it had failed to enter the gunman’s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the military-style rifle he used to kill 26 people on Sunday in the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex.

• The Texas Department of Public Safety, in this statement on Twitter, identified the gunman as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. The authorities said he was dressed in black and wearing a skull-face mask. He was wearing a ballistic vest and carrying tactical gear and multiple rounds of ammunition.

• His motive for the shooting was not yet clear, but the authorities said Monday that “a domestic situation” within the gunman’s family may have motivated the killings. Mr. Kelley may have been driven by anger toward his estranged wife’s family, the authorities said.

• The gunman’s in-laws had attended services at First Baptist Church in the past, according to Joe Tackitt, the sheriff of Wilson County. They were not in town at the time of the shooting, he said. A relative of his wife’s grandmother said the grandmother was at the church and had been killed.

• Mr. Kelley, who grew up 30 miles from the church in New Braunfels, had served in the Air Force but was court-martialed in 2012 on charges of assaulting his previous wife and his 2-year-old stepson. He was sentenced to 12 months’ confinement and received a “bad conduct” discharge in 2014, according to the Air Force. This profile describes what is known about his life.

Video

• Mr. Kelley purchased the rifle he used at the church and three other guns in the past four years.

• The shooting occurred during morning services at the church. Sutherland Springs, an unincorporated town of 360 people, is about 30 miles from San Antonio. Residents described it as a close-knit community where people don’t lock their doors or cars.

• The gunman exited his vehicle and began firing outside the church. He then walked to the side of the church and then inside, firing all the while, according to Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.

• After the gunman exited the church, he exchanged fire with an armed bystander, according to Sheriff Tackitt. The suspect then got in his vehicle while the bystander waved down a man in a vehicle, and the two chased after him.

• The suspect crashed his car in a neighboring county and was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, the authorities said.

• Among the dead were 23 parishioners whose bodies were found inside the church, according to this chronology of the shooting. Two more were found outside and one person died after being transported to a hospital, Gov. Greg Abbott said. He called it “the largest mass shooting in our state’s history.”

• About 20 more were taken to hospitals with injuries varying from minor to very severe.

• The victims, both those who died and those who were injured, ranged in age from an unborn child to 72, Sheriff Tackitt said. Family members and friends have begun releasing some information about the victims, which include several members of the same family. Read the latest updates here.

On a foggy morning exactly 10 years ago, a container ship struck one of the Bay Bridge towers, unleashing a swath of oil that would contaminate the environment. The spill, caused by the Cosco Busan, was not the largest in Bay Area history — when two tankers collided there in 1971, they spilled more than 10 times as much bunker oil — but the numbers were striking.

44,400,000

The shipping companies that owned and operated the Cosco Busan reached a $44.4 million settlement to reimburse government agencies that responded to the spill; as restitution for the lost human uses of the shoreline; and to restore damaged fish and bird habitats.

53,000

The Cosco Busan sent about 53,000 gallons of bunker oil into the bay. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon explosion released more than 160 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

6,849

An estimated 6,849 birds died from the oil spill, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Birds from 65 species, including the threatened marbled murrelet and snowy plover, were killed.

100

The crash left a 100-foot gash on the port side of the 926-foot ship, which was traveling at 11 knots, or 12.7 miles per hour, when it hit the bridge.

10

The Cosco Busan’s pilot, John J. Cota, was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. According to his lawyers, he had piloted about 4,000 ships in a 27-year career before the crash — with only one minor accident.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Boo! Sorry, no Halloween puzzle today. That in itself is spooky, but we’ve solved a couple of Halloween-themed puzzles already, and honestly, how much candy can you eat? Instead, today’s puzzle by Alex Eaton-Salners is a history lesson.

It’s not often that we see a 500th anniversary tribute crossword puzzle, and it happens to be done really well, so I was impressed.

Today’s Theme

History books tell us that a German monk named MARTIN LUTHER nailed a document called the “Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences,” better known as the “Ninety-Five Theses,” to the DOOR of ALL SAINTS CHURCH in WITTENBERG on October 31, 1517, although Mr. Eaton-Salners maintains that this act was actually performed on a later date.

The “Ninety-Five Theses” was a response to the Catholic Church’s practice of selling “INDULGENCES,” where Catholics could purchase absolution from sins, among other forms of corruption that he believed were happening in the church at the time. It was an invitation to debate the church’s practices as a whole, and was later considered to be a foundation for the PROTESTANT REFORMATION (interestingly, the word REFORMATION has appeared in The New York Times Crossword only once before, 50 years ago, and was related to the religious movement.)

“The struggle is always to address the function of the space while not sacrificing beauty,” said Donna Mondi, an interior designer in Chicago. “Assuming the home office is connected to the main living space, it needs to flow aesthetically and complement the overall design scheme.”

Ms. Mondi, for example, made space in a client’s living room for an office nook by placing a stylish writing desk with metallic legs and a black faux-crocodile top in a corner near the window. “This particular spot had lots of natural light, calm and peaceful colors,” she said. “And rich textures made this the perfect place to escape to.”

When your home office is “in a more formal part of the home,” she added, “the furnishings need to reflect that level of formality, so everything blends in seamlessly.”

MAKE FURNITURE DO DOUBLE-DUTY Look at the furniture you already have and consider whether you could use it for storage in your home office, suggested Ms. Kanarek, the author and work-from-home blogger. She uses an antique dresser in a spare bedroom to store her printer and office supplies, she said, and a coffee table with shelves below or storage inside could be used to store files or supplies while you work on the sofa.

“One of my clients uses her dining room as a home office during the day and stores all of her equipment and supplies in a large sideboard,” she said. “When she entertains, no one knows that along one wall is a fully functioning home office.”

DON’T SIT WITH YOUR BACK TO THE DOOR “You want your desk to feel like it has a commanding view of the room,” said Anita Rosenberg, a space consultant and practitioner of feng shui in Los Angeles. “People do the built-ins because they don’t have the space, and then they are staring up against the wall. That’s not a great place to be for 12 hours a day.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What you want to aim for is the “command position,” which enables you to see the front door without being in direct line with it, said Judith Wendell, a Manhattan-based feng shui consultant, and confers a feeling of empowerment. If the only option is to have your back to the front door, she added, place a mirror on the wall in front of you so you can see the front door in the mirror.

KEEP YOUR OFFICE OUT OF THE BEDROOM “Obviously, you don’t want to take your work to bed with you,” Ms. Wendell said. “Perhaps less obvious is that we don’t want our work to have sleepy or lazy chi.”

Another reason for separating the two, Ms. Rosenburg said: “You don’t want to go to sleep thinking about the work you have to do or be stressed out by the electronics in your bedroom.”

PUT IT IN THE CLOSET If the only space available is in your bedroom, a bureau with doors that hide your computer, books, papers and printer at night is a good workaround. “Many times we can steal a small closet and create an office nook that’s perfectly appointed,” said Ms. Mondi, the interior designer. “Built-in cabinets will make the most efficient use of space and are the best way to incorporate as much function as possible.”

Just keep in mind that you’ll need extra lighting and power for computers, printers, and chargers. And “for an unexpected touch add wall covering” to the inside of the cabinet or bureau, she said, “to give your office its own personality and make it feel less like a closet.”

Photo

HIDE IT BEHIND CABINETRY If you don’t have a spare closet, you can still conceal your workspace. “With some of our new home projects, we’re incorporating hidden offices into the kitchen,” Ms. Mondi said. “They are concealed by cabinet fronts, so it disappears into the kitchen when not in use.”

Another design trick, she said, is to add paneling and create a hidden wall of storage that essentially disappears: “It’s a great way to camouflage necessary evils.”

ACCESSORIZE Ms. Mondi also uses art, light fixtures and other decorative elements to ensure that any home office she designs isn’t “all business,” she said.

“The best office spaces tell a story of the person” they belong to, she added. “Be creative when choosing colors, materials, lighting, accessories, and you can easily turn it into your favorite room in the house.”

UPGRADE YOUR DESK “I’m a big fan of the writing desk, rather than the clunky, functional desks of the past,” Ms. Mondi said. “If you’re even the least bit tech-savvy, you won’t need much in the way of file storage. A small drawer or two gives you enough space for small accessories. What you gain is a lighter piece of furniture that is typically far more beautiful.”

OR DO AWAY WITH IT ALTOGETHER “The idea that you have to have a desk, file cabinet, bookcase and storage cabinets to work from home no longer applies, especially if your main piece of home-office equipment is a laptop,” Ms. Kanarek said. “I use a closet in a spare bedroom to store supplies and files, but most of the time I work on my porch, on the family room sofa, at a nearby coffee shop or wherever I feel inspired to work that day.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

Last year, the release of the Panama Papers caused a huge sensation across the globe, exposing a hidden world of wealth held offshore. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists brought together hundreds of reporters from around the world to examine the millions of documents that were leaked to two reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. For their work, the I.C.I.J. won the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting.

The New York Times was not part of that team. Like many reporters here, I spent a lot of time scrambling to make sense of what the I.C.I.J. had uncovered, writing follow-on stories. Breathing fumes.

This year, with the publication of the Paradise Papers — an extensive leak of documents primarily from a Bermudan law firm — we were on the inside. Working under Rebecca Corbett, The Times’s investigations editor, Mike McIntire, Jesse Drucker, Scott Shane and I joined up with close to 400 reporters around the world, spending much of this year sifting through some of the more than 13 million files.

It was exciting. But it was also unnerving.

Early on, just as the first documents were becoming searchable through the I.C.I.J.’s sophisticated in-house system, it became apparent just how much we would have to relearn journalistic habits acquired over decades of reporting.

By late February, a team of journalists from The New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC, the I.C.I.J. and other organizations were scouring documents, looking for any connections to the new Trump cabinet, one of several reporting initiatives. But the documents from Appleby — a white-shoe law firm — often led us to water but didn’t let us drink. Tidbits of evidence in the documents frequently had to be supplemented by a lot of outside reporting, some of it building on our own proprietary reporting.","Scouring the Paradise Papers, With the Help of Almost 400 New Friends",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/insider/paradise-papers-appleby-leak-icij.html

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

But this nightmare year has upended assumptions about the durability of the rules, formal and informal, governing our politics. There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness. It was astonishing when Trump installed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, a man who had previously run a white nationalist tabloid; now it feels like ages ago that he was even in the White House.

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.
“I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.
The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.
For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.","“We don’t want our students to pick a field because it pays and overlook another field because it doesn’t pay for an internship,” said Meredith Daw, executive director of career advancement at the University of Chicago.

There are 2,000 placements each year through Chicago’s Jeff Metcalf Internship Program. Employers agree to cover the salary — at least $11 an hour or the local minimum wage, whichever is higher. But when an organization can’t afford to pay — 40 percent can’t — the university provides a $4,000 grant for a 10-week stint.

Starting last year, the university’s Odyssey Scholars — low-income students like Ms. Eisenberg — have been guaranteed a paid internship for their first summer. That, Ms. Daw said, is when they are at the greatest disadvantage compared to their peers with more of the social capital — like parental connections — needed to find internships on their own. Last summer, 232 students participated.

Ms. Eisenberg interned at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she developed a machine learning model for its library. The grant helped defray airfare, her summer sublet and other expenses.

Pace University posted more than 4,000 internships last year, about 40 percent of them unpaid, and provides grants for many internships in the nonprofit sector.

“We’re not trying to proselytize with these students, but we’d like their eyes to be open to the second and third sectors in our economy,” said Rebecca Tekula, executive director of Pace’s Wilson Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The center pairs students with nonprofits in and around New York City, like Greyston Bakery, Housing Works and the Legal Aid Society. Elizabeth Pooran interned last year at Senior Planet Exploration Center in Chelsea, a community space designed to teach technology, including digital photography and the internet, to older adults to encourage them to lead independent, connected lives. And Latino U College Access, a fledgling nonprofit that works with first-generation college students, has used Pace interns for three of its five years. “I always say that my organization was built with the support and by the hands of Pace University interns,” said Shirley Acevedo Buontempo, the founder.

Students in the Wilson internship program receive $16 an hour, or $4,480 for eight weeks. Some 120 students have participated since 2009, with grants totaling about $500,000.

Macalester College, too, subsidizes internships involving social missions, like helping integrate tuberculosis services into Georgia’s health system and fighting transgender discrimination. Last year, about 50 interns took part.

“This is an opportunity to try on a career no matter what their interest or major or their economic situation is,” said Mindy Deardurff, dean of career development at the St. Paul campus. “Especially for our students who have socioeconomic need, if we can get them in and let them try out some of the things they are so passionate about, it might get them over that hump of worrying about whether they can afford it.”

Amherst College distributed $1 million this past summer, 40 percent more than it did the previous year, helping 229 students take unpaid internships with nonprofit organizations and small start-ups. The money came from alumni gifts and $200,000 from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, which supports low-income college students.

Because more than 80 percent of Amherst students go to graduate or professional school, some of the money is used to prepare them by financing research internships, study abroad and independently devised programs, said Emily C. Griffen, director of Amherst’s Loeb Center for Career Exploration and Planning.

Michael Loeb, president and chief executive of Loeb Enterprises, is an alumnus who has taken a particular interest in internships. In addition to offering paid stints at his own company, he has just started a program that matches start-ups in New York City with Amherst interns and covers their pay and living expenses.

It’s not surprising that alumni favor their alma mater.

Over the past five years, alumni and parents have donated $4 million to Colgate University, enabling it to support some 200 students each year who want to take unpaid or low-paid internships, typically with nonprofits, the creative arts or to do research. Last summer, it spent $666,000, said Michael Sciola, associate vice president of institutional advancement and career initiatives. Colgate students can also come up with their own grant proposal, and the university will help them find a host who will turn that into an internship.

“We do allow students to do a self-designed summer,” he said. For example, twin brothers received a grant to pay for travel to work on an archaeological expedition in Alaska.

Mr. Sciola concedes that the connection between “an immersive experience” and a career might be less obvious than with an internship in the financial industry. That’s why students are more likely to take less career-driven internships in their first and second years, he said, when they are still exploring.

“Our overall goal is to empower our students to explore their interests with practical immersive experiences,” he said, “without the limitation of financial barriers.”","When Internships Don’t Pay, Some Colleges Will",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/education/edlife/paid-internships-colleges-social-service.html

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Everyone have a glass of milk ready? Thanks to Herre Schouwerwou, we have a tasty snack in our puzzle today. We’re just going to have to find it.

Today’s Theme

This isn’t going to be as simple as taking your snack out of a cardboard box. It’s midweek, so you’re going to have to do a little detective work.

As it happens, our snack today is on both sides of a black square, as the revealer clues at 54- and 56A say. We are told that the lunchbox items we are looking for are ANIMAL CRACKERS, and the four that we are given are “cracked” by that black square.

Still don’t see them? Here’s one: 17A is MCGREGOR and 18A is I’LL ASK, and the two entries are separated by a single black square. If you look closely and even scratch and sniff the entries, which have been scented to smell like the aforementioned ANIMAL CRACKERS so you can easily track them down [Don’t listen to her. And for the love of all that is holy, do not scratch your screens. Or your newspapers. — Ed.], the last letters of MCGREGOR and the first letters of I’LL ASK spell out the cracked GORILLA:

MCGREGOR / I’LL ASK

Now you find the other CRACKERS, and don’t forget to drink your milk.

Tricky Clues

24D: I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that this is more of a West Coast thing, but the portmanteau of “smoke” and “haze” is SMAZE.

35D: BOATS take you from riverbank to riverbank, so they are the “Connection between banks?”

Constructor Notes

DISCLAIMER: No animals were harmed in the making of this puzzle. I don’t recall the exact inspiration for this puzzle, but I was probably hungry and noticed an animal split between two entries in another crossword. To limit the theme choices, I decided to use only animals in the current Barnum’s box (according to Wikipedia) that were five letters or longer. The other decision was where to place the revealer. I’m not a fan of center placement and that would mean changing the grid to 14 or 16 squares wide or just having ANIMAL CRACKER, which wasn’t great. You can’t eat just one! So I went with the “cracked” revealer that fortunately echoed the theme. Will liked the concept, but asked to remove some iffy fill and to replace HIPPO, which was the only shortened entry. Of two revised submissions, the one that had the longest split entries was chosen over the one that had VEGANS crossing ANIMAL. Kudos to Will and Joel for the double “parked” clues for 49- and 50-Across. Hope this satisfies your crossword snacking pleasure!

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Photo

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity.

But many of those tools do not apply to today’s deals, as A.M.D.’s Chinese pact shows.

A.M.D.’s joint venture with its Chinese partner can be found in a gleaming industrial area of the city of Chengdu called Tianfu Software Park.

The park represents Beijing’s vision of the future. Trees and sidewalks jammed with ride-sharing bikes sit beneath a vast strip of office towers, hotels and apartment complexes. Offices of China’s most innovative companies, like Huawei and Tencent, sit next to outposts of their foreign analogues, like SAP and Accenture.

Inside one of its glass towers, A.M.D. works with its Chinese partner, a company called Sugon, to produce new chips.

Under the nearly $300 million deal, A.M.D. agreed to license chip technology to a Chinese joint venture with Sugon to make chips for servers. Because A.M.D. controls that joint venture, the technology is considered to remain in American hands.

But A.M.D. struck a second partnership that the Chinese company controls. That joint venture works on applications such as integrating the chips with servers. The two ventures are on the 11th and 12th floors of the same building.

Experts say the dual partnerships could help China develop a new generation of powerful supercomputers. China already makes the world’s fastest computers, but they run on homegrown chips that cannot read commonly available software for supercomputers. With A.M.D.’s help, experts say, Sugon could develop chips that could make China’s supercomputers more versatile and adaptable and replace those from foreign firms.

“We have worked closely with and been very clear with U.S. government officials on the strategy and specifics of the technology, which is classified as permitted for export,” an A.M.D. spokesman said in an emailed statement. He added that the processors are also lower performing than other options that A.M.D. sells in America.

Executives in Chengdu said there was a firewall between the two joint ventures, and the one outside of A.M.D.’s control was not involved in chip development.

Yet in an interview with the Chinese state news media, Zhang Yunquan, a top government researcher and head of the National Supercomputing Center in Jinan, China, said that Sugon could use the work of the joint venture to make supercomputer microchips. Such a supercomputer would be crucial in designing next-generation weapons systems, according to experts.

“When they first announced the partnership I was shocked,” said Stacy Rasgon, a semiconductor analyst with Sanford Bernstein.

“You would think intellectual property and joint ventures would belong under Cfius review,” Mr. Rasgon said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals. “It should. It’s surprising it isn’t.”

New Rules for a New Era?

For some in the Trump administration, an 18-year-old book by two Chinese Air Force colonels has become required reading.

Called “Unrestricted Warfare,” the book argues that China does not need to match the United States militarily. Instead China can take advantage of the global economy and the internet to take down its main rival.

Some American officials see in it a guide to China’s plan. Some United States lawmakers are proposing to toughen American takeover laws to evaluate deals on an economic as well as a national security basis. They are also pressing for reviews of licensing agreements and joint ventures. The United States trade representative has also launched an investigation into whether Chinese companies are stealing intellectual property.

“There’s concern that U.S. firms are transacting away their competitive advantages,” said Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello, a research firm in Washington, and a former executive at the US-China Business Council.

Such changes could ripple through the tech world. Chinese investment often means more money with fewer strings attached. Some tech companies say that is good for innovation. China’s spending on science and research is also growing at a time when the United States government and others are cutting back.

Still, many American companies fear the deck is stacked against them. The United States long believed bringing China into the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trade disputes, would ensure it would follow the rules. But the W.T.O. has proved ineffective when it comes to tech issues.

At a recent dinner event in Washington, an American technology executive held up a dinner plate to illustrate the size of the China market, said a person who was there who asked not to be identified because the event was not public. Then the American executive held up a wine coaster that represented the size of his firm’s business.

The message was clear: American companies are at risk of being muscled out of the market.

“Made in China 2025 seems to reject all notions of comparative advantage and future opportunities for high-value-added manufactured exports from the rest of the world to China,” said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce.

“If Made in China 2025 achieves its goals,” he said, “the U.S. and other countries would likely become just commodity exporters to China — selling oil, gas, beef and soybeans.”",China’s Technology Ambitions Could Upset the Global Trade Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/made-in-china-technology-trade.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Luckily, my helmet was securely in place when, for reasons unknown, I fell forward over the handlebars while riding slowly uphill a few houses from home. Although I suffered a mild concussion and have no memory of the accident (I also sustained a nasty cut on my chin, badly bruised ribs and a scraped knee), my helmet prevented a serious brain or facial injury.

I will never again mount a bicycle without the helmet on my head where it belongs, not in my backpack, bike basket or, worse, at home.

There are laws requiring young cyclists to wear helmets in 21 states and Washington, D.C., and at least 200 localities, but very few cover adult riders. A common sight in my neighborhood: Fathers riding helmetless with their helmeted child on a bike seat behind them.

There are many reasons besides helmet hair that keep people from wearing helmets. One of the most frequent excuses: “I’m only going to the store (or the gym).” Yet, as with car accidents, the majority of bike accidents happen close to home, as mine did, and not necessarily in traffic or at high speeds. Even low-speed falls on a bike trail can scramble brains.

“A very low-speed fall can be just as dangerous as a fall at higher speeds,” said Randy Swart, director of the consumer-funded Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. “All it takes is gravity – the distance to the ground – to cause a head injury.”

Teenagers seem especially resistant to wearing helmets, yet with their still-developing brains they probably incur the greatest risks and have the most to lose from a head injury. “There’s often a rebellion aspect among teens,” Mr. Swart said. “They say, ‘All through childhood, my parents forced me to be safe. Now I want to make my own decisions about risk.’” College students and young adults often also think similarly, he said.

I worry too about younger children, even those whose parents insist that they wear a helmet when riding a scooter, tricycle or bicycle. I see many such riders with parents in tow in my Brooklyn neighborhood, and in at least half the cases I’ve observed, the helmet is too big or is not on correctly and likely to provide little protection in a serious fall or crash.

The most common error is positioning: If the helmet sits too far back on the child’s (or adult’s) head, it will not protect the most vulnerable part of the brain in a hard fall, especially if the skull fractures. When the straps are too loose (or, as I’ve often seen even among adults, the chin strap is not clasped), the helmet will fly off in a fall and offer no protection whatsoever.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The helmet should sit on the head straight, front to back, and not move when you shake your head. The straps extending from the helmet to the chin strap should each form a V right under the ears.

“A bike helmet is a like a seatbelt – it should feel snug, not tight, when you first put it on, but when you start riding, you should be able to forget all about it,” Mr. Swart said.

Another excuse I’ve heard, perhaps from those familiar with concussions among football players, is that helmets do not prevent concussions. And that is true. You don’t even have to actually hit your head to get a concussion. A concussion results when the gel-like brain sloshes violently or slams into the unyielding bony skull, and this can happen with almost any significant impact to the head. What the helmet can do is reduce the energy of the impact and the likelihood of a skull fracture or brain bleed.

If cost is a deterrent, Mr. Swart gleefully noted that many inexpensive helmets perform just as well as expensive ones. His organization had three “extremely cheap” helmets ($15 to $20 range) tested along with three “very expensive” ones ($150 and above) and, he said, “their performance level was almost identical.”

So if you’re not overly concerned about fashion or brand names, you can feel confident purchasing inexpensive helmets for every rider in the family at a chain or big-box store, he said. They all must meet the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

After determining a proper fit for head size and comfort within your price range, my advice is to select a helmet that is brightly colored; one of mine is red-orange and the other lime-yellow, the same as the colors of the jackets and backpacks I wear with them.

Now, don that helmet, enjoy the ride and come home safe and sound.",Buckle Up a Helmet to Save a Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/well/buckle-up-a-helmet-to-save-a-life.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Since the mid-1990s, multinationals based in the United States have increasingly shifted profits into offshore tax havens. Indeed, a tiny handful of jurisdictions — mostly Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands — now account for 63 percent of all profits that American multinational companies claim to earn overseas, according to an analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Those destinations hold far less than 1 percent of the world’s population.

Criticism of such profit shifting was largely ignored until government finances around the globe came under pressure in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when the practice led to government inquiries, tax inspector raids, media scrutiny and promises of reform.

In May 2013, the Senate’s investigative subcommittee released a 142-page report on Apple’s tax avoidance, finding that the company was attributing billions of dollars in profits each year to three Irish subsidiaries that declared “tax residency” nowhere in the world.

Under Irish law, if a company can convince Irish tax authorities that it is “managed and controlled” abroad, it can largely escape Irish income tax. By seeming to run its Irish subsidiaries from its world headquarters in California, Apple ensured that Irish tax residency was avoided.

At the same time, American law dictated that the subsidiaries were only tax residents in the United States if incorporated there. The federal government permits taxes on any income generated by foreign units to be deferred indefinitely, as long as the company says those profits stay offshore.

“Apple has sought the holy grail of tax avoidance: offshore corporations that it argues are not, for tax purposes, resident anywhere in any nation,” then-Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was the subcommittee chairman, said at the 2013 hearing.

Ireland’s finance minister at the time, Michael Noonan, at first defended his country’s policies: “I do not want to be the whipping boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the U.S. Congress.” Ireland had long pursued business-friendly tax policies, which helped lure jobs to the country, primarily for technology and pharmaceutical companies. Apple now has about 6,000 employees in Ireland, including customer service and administrative jobs.

But by October 2013, in response to growing international pressure, Mr. Noonan announced that Irish companies would have to declare tax residency somewhere in the world.

At that time, Apple had accumulated $111 billion in offshore cash, mostly in its Irish subsidiaries. Billions of dollars in new profits poured into them each year. Yet they paid almost no corporate income tax.

Company officials wanted to keep it that way. So Apple sought alternatives to the tax arrangement Ireland would soon shut down. And the officials wanted to be quiet about it.

“For those of you who are not aware Apple are extremely sensitive concerning publicity,” wrote Cameron Adderley, global head of Appleby’s corporate department, in a March 20, 2014 email to other senior partners. “They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.”

In building Apple’s new tax shelter, Appleby served as something of a general contractor. A key architect was Baker McKenzie, a huge law firm based in Chicago. The firm has a reputation for devising creative offshore structures for multinationals and defending them to tax regulators. It has also fought international proposals for tax avoidance crackdowns.

Baker McKenzie wanted to use a local Appleby office to maintain an offshore arrangement for Apple. For Appleby, Mr. Adderley said, this assignment was “a tremendous opportunity for us to shine on a global basis with Baker McKenzie.”

Baker McKenzie’s San Francisco office emailed a 14-item questionnaire in March 2014 to Appleby’s offices in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.

“Confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction,” the document requested. Baker McKenzie also asked for assurances that the local political climate would remain friendly: “Are there any developments suggesting that the law may change in an unfavourable way in the foreseeable future?”

(A Baker McKenzie spokesman said, “As a matter of general policy, we do not comment on confidential client matters.”)

Apple decided that its new offshore tax structure should use Appleby’s office in Jersey, which is one of the Channel Islands and has strong links to the British banking system. Jersey makes its own laws and is not subject to most European Union legislation, making it a popular tax haven.","After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html

Back Story

One hundred years ago today, one of the century’s most momentous uprisings hit St. Petersburg . The Russian Revolution’s eventual outcome, the Soviet Union, offered hope for some but delivered suffering for many.

Throughout the centenary year, we explored the legacy of Communism in a series of Op-Eds, “Red Century.”

Perhaps less noted is how the revolution changed culinary history. Millions of émigrés of the remains of the Russian Empire took their cuisine with them.

“As the American, wandering a foreign land, longs for ham and eggs country style, so does the Russian exile want borsch, the national Russian soup with his meal,” The Times wrote in 1935 . “And in New York he gets it.”

A Parisian cookbook from 1938 described borscht as “a Russian soup made from beef, duck, pork belly, garnished with cabbage julienne and beetroot.” (It also provided a Polish version.)

To this day, restaurants in Hong Kong serve “lor soong tong,” a soup derived from the borscht made by migrants from Russia and Eastern Europe who sought refuge in what was then a British colony.

And just last month, Ukraine sought to widen the soup’s global reach on Twitter : “@Google & @Apple, time to have a borscht emoji!”

But my experience last week made me wonder if maybe the victims deserve a little space where we can just think about them, and the loss, before we throw ourselves into the fight.

Bret: I think we can and need to do both. We need to learn about the dead and honor the lives they led — or, in the case of the murdered children, the lives they might have led. But we shouldn’t shy away about talking about gun laws right now, or be cowed into not “politicizing” an event that has become so horribly commonplace that there’s no way not to politicize it.

How have we become a country in which one person can wipe out 26 people — 7 percent of the entire community! — because profoundly disturbed people have easy access to what amounts to a weapon of mass destruction?

Gail: You’re right. And when our president said “it’s a little bit soon” to start talking about guns, I did instinctively feel it was time to start talking about guns.

We’re definitely not going to have any disagreements here. Which brings me back to New York last week. Your column about living next to the terror attack was perfect. The one relief after a horrible event like that is the way average people come together. And people who in most circumstances wouldn’t be average — like a lot of your neighbors near the financial district — lose all their ego for a moment and just find comfort in being part of the group.

Bret: Thanks so much, Gail. That really was the striking thing: In the face of a terrorist and terrible carnage, people behaved with composure, decency and courage. I wanted to write a column that paid tribute to this, to the simple neighborliness and good citizenship of New Yorkers.

Gail: I remember right after 9/11 going down and seeing the hulk of the tower and running into Hillary Clinton, who was then one of our senators. She’s always had a not-unsurprising guarded reserve around the media, but that day she seemed to have lost all her barriers. She was just talking away about who was doing what, and what President Bush had said on the plane, and it occurred to me that she presumed that at that moment we were just two people in the community. That our normal roles had dissolved because nobody could possibly care about anything except the tragedy.

Maybe that was part of the reason I was so enraged at President Trump for instantly trying to make the story about how tough he is on ISIS. I can’t remember the last time I got so viscerally angry at a politician.

Bret: Among my 10 million or so objections to presidential candidate Trump, one of them was that he would be incapable of fulfilling the moral, emotional and symbolic role of the office. Obama and Bush both did, and I’ll never forget Clinton’s moving speech after the Oklahoma City bombing. But it’s the mark of the narcissist that he won’t, or can’t, perform the role, because ultimately the only person whose needs and feelings concern him are his own.

Gail: We are now really well aware of the difference between an egotist, which is pretty much all politicians, and a narcissist, which is somebody you just cannot have in the top job.

Bret: Speaking of rage, it also enraged me that he wasted no time turning the tragedy into a talking point about immigration. If he wants to talk immigration, he should spend a day in Stuyvesant High School, the elite magnet public school that was the endpoint of the terror attack, and note how many of the students there are either immigrants or the children of immigrants, many of them Muslim, by the way.

Gail: You’re so right. Look, this is making me angry all over again. Let’s change the subject for a moment. The Republicans have finally come up with a tax plan. What did you think?

Bret: Must it always be death or taxes?

I basically like it. It does four important things: It gives us an internationally competitive corporate tax rate and should reduce profit-shifting overseas; it simplifies the tax code.

Gail: Immediate prediction: Any simplification will become complicated before these people are through.

Sorry, go on.

Bret: It gets rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax, enacted in 1979 to hit a handful of tax-evading high-earners that now hits about five million taxpayers; and it decreases the subsidy to the real-estate industry with caps on the mortgage-interest deduction. Also, it doesn’t mess with our 401(k)’s, as some of us feared it would.

Music to your ears, too, right? I know our readers totally agree with me on this one.

Gail: Well, for starters …

As Steven Rattner wrote in The Times last week, the bill doesn’t do anything about a huge loophole known as “carried interest” that drastically reduces the tax rates for folks like hedge fund operators and, um, real estate developers.

Bret: That loophole is no different from paying the capital-gains rate on the sale of a home, but you know I’m antediluvian on this subject. Please continue.

Gail: Also, I do not understand why the party that is constantly at war with family planning changed the family exemption in a way that hurts people with a large number of children.

Bret: Here you make an excellent point. I can’t defend everything.

Gail: And the thing about eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes is just a raid on the blue states. One which I am eager to hear more about from Republican House members in places like New York, New Jersey and California.

Let me ask you — do you think this has a chance of passing?

Bret: Sixty-forty, I’d say, though with this Congress you never know. Tax cuts unite both the traditional and the Trumpian wings of the party, and Republicans know that if they can’t cut taxes they may as well not exist. Then again, all politics is local and most politicians care a lot more about their own political future than the party’s. It’ll also be interesting to see how Bob Corker votes: Don’t be surprised if he does to tax reform what McCain did to the Obamacare repeal — another reminder of the self-defeating nature of Trump’s politics of insult.

Gail: Whatever they finally come up with is going to increase the deficit mightily, which is one of Corker’s issues. I know your friend Paul Ryan would like to take care of that problem by slicing into Social Security and Medicare, and if that becomes a point of contention, it’ll keep the red-state Democrats from straying in the Senate.

Bret: We’ll see. Entitlement reform would be a good idea for the long-term health of the federal fisc, but a Republican Congress that can’t pass tax reform certainly isn’t going to change Medicare and Social Security anytime soon. I think a lot depends on the outcome of the governor’s race in Virginia, and what it says about the ideological future of the G.O.P.

Gail: Wow, Virginia. You’ve got a Republican candidate who was, until about 10 minutes ago, a super-establishment centrist. And now he’s yelling about immigrants and gang violence and people plotting to tear “our statues” down. This would, I guess, be the new Robert E. Lee wing of the party.

Bret: More like, “something old; something new,” but in any event depressing. Gillespie started the race trying to distance himself from Trump, who lost Virginia to Clinton by five points, by running an economics-themed campaign. Then Gillespie nearly lost the primary to a Trumpkin, and it all became about dead Confederate generals and bogus Latin American gang scares.

You know, the real issues.

Gail: Has anybody promised to bomb North Korea? This does sound very familiar.

Bret: If Gillespie wins, the lesson will be that any “conventional” Republican is going to have to do a convincing imitation of a Bannonite if he wants to win the primary and the general election. It will just accelerate the capitulation of the G.O.P. to the Bannonites, while Republicans with inner red lines are going to keep walking away from the party. The only silver lining I see here is that it slightly increases the chances of creating a third party.

Gail: So if you were in Virginia, would you be voting for Ralph Northam, the Democratic lieutenant governor? Or writing in “none of the above”?

Most interesting Republican news of the weekend was the new Bush book that reveals that George H. W. voted for Hillary Clinton while W. took the none-of-the-above dodge.

Can I just mention here that people who refuse to pick between the two major parties in important races are being weenies who just want to demonstrate their vast moral superiority?

Bret: Before last year’s election, my Trump-curious conservative friends kept telling me that an election is a choice and a none-of-the-above vote was a cop-out, and that’s about the only point on which we agreed. So I voted for Hillary.

I vote in New York City, thank God, so I don’t know local Virginia issues too well. But I’d probably vote for Northam. First, because he’s a former Army doctor and strikes me as smart and middle of the road. But mainly because I think that if voters don’t punish Republican candidates for becoming Bannonites, there’s nothing to stop the party from continuing to move in that direction.

Gail: Except for the Virginia saga, this year’s round of elections is pretty obscure — there are some very important state legislative races around the country, but I kinda doubt the whole world will be watching.

The other big governor’s race is a contest to see whether the people of New Jersey would like to endorse the career of Chris Christie by electing his lieutenant governor to succeed him. Christie may be the only major elected official in the country with worse public approval ratings than Trump. Not expecting much suspense on that one. Although it will give us a chance to rerun those pictures of him sunbathing on the state beach while it was closed to the public.

Anything else you’re following?

Bret: Did I mention that I also thank God that I don’t live in New Jersey?

Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman to win the New York City Marathon for 40 years. I was thrilled for her. Most of all, I was thrilled that New Yorkers have lost none of our passion for putting on a great show like the marathon despite what happened last week.

Now they face an uncertain future.

People protected under the program will be given six months to leave after their current permissions expire. The temporary status for the 86,000 Hondurans and 5,000 Nicaraguans in the program expires in early January, and Monday was the deadline for the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether to renew that status. It has until Thanksgiving to decide whether to extend the protection for thousands of Haitians.

The program covers 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

The Trump administration’s decisions to rescind the temporary protection status for Nicaraguans is part of its effort to reduce both legal and illegal immigration to the United States. The administration has moved aggressively to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes and reducing the number of refugees.

Democratic members of Congress and immigration advocates called the move inhumane.

Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said that sending tens of thousands of people back to Central American nations still recovering from natural disasters or internal strife could destabilize those countries.

In a statement, Mr. Cardin said the effort was part of the “White House’s radical anti-immigration agenda,” which ignored an honest assessment of conditions in each of the countries.

A coalition of immigration groups also criticized the Trump administration for ending the protection.

“The Trump administration’s recommendation to terminate temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of people from all over the globe living in the United States is cruel and shameful,” Steven Choi, the executive director for the New York Immigration Coalition, said at a news conference on Monday in New York. “America will not be greater or safer by sending back people who’ve made their lives here.”

Belinda Osorio, 48, who arrived in 1991 in the United States from Honduras seeking work, said she was relieved the news had not been as bad as she had feared. She had read and heard that her temporary protected status would be cut off immediately.

Still, it was only a postponement of the panic that was to come.

“I don’t think six months is going to fix anything because what are we going to do after six months?” said Ms. Osorio, a housekeeper at one of the Disney World resort hotels in Orlando, Fla. “We’re not going to leave. I’m not going to leave my country. I’m not going to take my kids to a dangerous country.”

She said that she was afraid that if they were forced to return to Honduras, her 14-year-old son would be forced to join a violent gang. Her 72-year-old mother has been threatened by gang members who have demanded money from her, and Ms. Osorio said she feared she and her children, as returnees from the United States, would have it even worse.

Like many other recipients of temporary protected status, Ms. Osorio built a life here expecting that she would not be forced to return anytime soon. She had married an American citizen, another hotel employee, with whom she had two children; it was through her job that her family had medical insurance. For years, she said, she had been trying to apply for a green card based on her marriage, and she hoped she would succeed before the temporary program expired.

“At least I have hope with my husband, but there’s a lot of people, they don’t have nothing. Their only hope is T.P.S.,” she said. “It’s not fair after so many years working so hard in this country, and they just want to get rid of us just like that.”

John F. Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and now the White House chief of staff, had extended temporary protected status for Haitians in May, giving them an additional six months to stay in the country.

Salvadorans, who make up about 60 percent of those in the Temporary Protected Status program, were first granted protection in March 2001 after a series of earthquakes in the country. Their protective status will expire next year, on March 9.

The status is renewed periodically, and recipients have to keep their permits updated to avoid deportation, paying $495 each time. The Obama administration typically granted 18-month waivers.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”
