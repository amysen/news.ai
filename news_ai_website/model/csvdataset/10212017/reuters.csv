Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

More than 15,000 people have crossed the U.S.-Canadian border illegally to claim refugee status in Canada this year. Many were in the United States legally and some interviewed by Reuters said they might have stayed were it not for an immigration crackdown.

The influx, mainly at the Quebec/New York border, prompted the military to set up a temporary tent encampment in Quebec and sparked a backlash from anti-migrant groups.

Lawyers who have handled dozens of cases said that members of refugee tribunals, who evaluate requests for asylum, have grown more sympathetic toward people who have spent time in the United States and who say they now fear immigration policies under Trump.

Trump took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican’s 2016 election campaign.

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idUSKBN1CQ06R

The vote in the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee was hailed as a step forward by privacy activists but heavily criticized by industry for being too restrictive and inconsistent with a separate data protection regulation.

Under the reworked “ePrivacy” proposal, telecoms operators and internet players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the customers’ communications and ask for users’ consent before tracking them online to serve them personalized ads.

The rules aim to provide a level playing field between telecoms firms and online players such as WhatsApp, Google and Skype. Currently only telecoms companies are subject to the ePrivacy law.

MEPs strengthened the privacy protections in the original European Commission proposal by requiring web browsers to have their default settings as not allowing personalized online advertising based on browsing habits. Instead, users will be asked to opt in to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers.

Cookies are placed on web surfers’ computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.

Websites will also be forbidden from preventing users from accessing their content if they do not consent to being tracked, a measure that was criticized by online advertisers as forcing websites to offer content for free.

“News and other online services rely on data-driven, ad-funded business models to finance the creation of content,” said Townsend Feehan, CEO of IAB Europe, the industry association of online advertisers.

“Content that must be given away for nothing will ultimately end up being worth nothing.”

Thursday’s deal is not final as the Parliament will need to find a compromise with member states, who are still divided on the issue.

Additionally, MEPs from the largest center-right group in the Brussels-based legislature voted against the proposal, saying it was weighted too heavily for privacy, restricting digital innovation.

However, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the vote in the parliamentary committee.

“Consumers should not be forced to give up their privacy when they visit a website, send an email or purchase something online,” said Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one. They have given their country’s leadership one monster of a job: to reconcile what is a still globalizing world with their need for esteem and a restored sense that their country is recognizable, and that it is theirs.

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

He noted that Mugabe himself had travelled to Singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland.",Critics urge WHO to reverse 'wrong' choice of Mugabe as goodwill envoy,https://www.reuters.com/article/zimbabwe-mugabe-who/critics-urge-who-to-reverse-wrong-choice-of-mugabe-as-goodwill-envoy-idINKBN1CQ09A?il=0

China is in the midst of reforms aimed at shaking up ownership structures and injecting private capital into its bloated and debt-ridden state sector, with the ultimate aim of creating more efficient and globally competitive companies.

But leaders have repeatedly stressed that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must also continue to fulfill their “strategic” functions under the strengthened leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, raising fears that political factors will be prioritized.

Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), insisted the two aims were not contradictory, and that stronger party leadership would give SOEs an advantage.

Asked whether party-building provisions would hurt the interests of small shareholders in the listed subsidiaries of state firms, Xiao said late on Friday that the party “has always reflected the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people and does not have its own interests”.

""Consolidating Party leadership and strengthening Party construction will be a political advantage for state-owned enterprises and play an important role in improving their quality, efficiency and competitiveness,"" he added, according to a notice posted on SASAC's website (www.sasac.gov.cn).

China has sought to streamline its state sector through mergers and asset restructuring. Since SASAC was established in 2003, the number of firms under its administration has halved, from 196 to 98.

Many economists, however, say much more needs to be done, noting the government still keeps major loss-making “zombie” companies on “life support” to avoid the risk of mass layoffs and massive debt defaults which could strain the financial system.

Xiao said SOEs would continue to be exposed to competition and subject to a process of “survival of the fittest”, but debt restructuring would still be handled with caution, with the interests of employees and creditors treated with due consideration.",China's state firms to benefit from stronger Party: state asset head,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-soe-reform/chinas-state-firms-to-benefit-from-stronger-party-state-asset-head-idUSKBN1CQ06Y

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

The U.S.-North Korea situation is becoming more fraught as both sides attempt to pile on pressure, pushing prospects for talks further away.

Just two months ago, I argued that Americans needed to put North Korea’s missile tests in perspective. (“Yes, they’re worrying. But the U.S. mainland is not in imminent danger.”) Now I’m slightly less sanguine: either side could make a catastrophic miscalculation while tensions persist. Even before Trump’s decision on Iran, the prospects for negotiations were diminishing.

Paul Wallace: How money will divide Europe after Brexit

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abrahamian-northkorea-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-decision-hurts-chance-of-a-north-korea-deal-idUSKBN1CO2CY

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

À Paris, le CAC 40 a fini sur une progression de 0,08% (4,09 points) à 5.372,38 points. Le FTSE 100 à Londres et le Dax à Francfort ont clôturé quasiment inchangés. L‘indice EuroStoxx 50 a gagné 0,08%, le FTSEurofirst 300 0,18% et le Stoxx 600 0,26%.

Le CAC 40 a progressé en séance jusqu‘à 0,44% avant de céder progressivement du terrain. De même, le Dax est monté en tout début de séance à 13.063,57 points, non loin du record inscrit mercredi.

Au moment de la clôture en Europe, la tendance restait plus soutenue à Wall Street, où le Dow Jones et le Standard & Poor’s 500 ont inscrit des records, grâce entre autres au soutien des valeurs financières, dont l‘indice de référence prend 1%.

Aux Etats-Unis comme en Europe, le secteur financier profite en effet de la remontée des rendements obligataires après l‘adoption par le Sénat américain d‘une résolution sur le projet de budget, qui pourrait faciliter le vote d‘ici la fin de l‘année du projet de réforme fiscale de l‘administration Trump.

Le rendement des Treasuries à dix ans a touché un plus haut de deux semaines à 2,374% et il est bien parti pour enregistrer sa plus forte hebdomadaire en cinq semaines. Le deux ans, lui, a atteint un pic de près de neuf ans à 1,576%.

Son rebond a contribué à l‘effacement d‘une partie des gains de la Bourse de Londres en fin de séance.

Sur les marchés actions européens, la séance a aussi été animée par des publications de résultats trimestriels diversement accueillies.

Plus forte hausse du Stoxx 600, le spécialiste des équipements de réseaux Ericsson a pris 7,96% en dépit d‘une lourde perte, le groupe ayant écarté tout appel au marché pour financer sa restructuration. Dans son sillage, Nokia s‘est adjugé 3,86%.

Le constructeur suédois de poids lourds Volvo a bondi de 6,96%, le marché saluant un bénéfice d‘exploitation courant nettement supérieur aux attentes et la révision à la hausse de ses prévisions de demande.

Segundo os procuradores da operação Lava Jato responsáveis pela ação, as investigações apontaram crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro em acordos da empreiteira com a Petroquímica Suape e com a Citepe, ligadas à Petroquisa, por meio de direcionamento de projetos para a Odebrecht mediante pagamento de vantagens indevidas.

Funcionários de alto escalão da Petrobras à época receberam pagamentos entre 2008 e 2014, pelo menos, totalizando o equivalente a mais de 32,5 milhões de reais somente no exterior, sendo 17,7 milhões de reais apenas para um dos investigados, segundo os investigadores.

“De acordo com as informações apuradas, as obras em questão foram direcionadas ao grupo Odebrecht. A estatal adotou modelo contratual que beneficiava a empreiteira e restringia a concorrência”, disse o MPF em comunicado sobre a nova fase da Lava Jato, acrescentando que as investigações contaram com depoimentos e documentos fornecidos por funcionários da Odebrecht nos acordos de colaboração e leniência firmados com o MPF.

Foram expedidos pela Justiça Federal de Curitiba quatro mandados de busca e apreensão, um mandado de condução coercitiva e um mandado de prisão temporária, e ainda três intimações com a imposição de outras medidas cautelares, como parte das investigações, de acordo com a Polícia Federal.

Segundo os investigadores, o pagamento de propina era efetuado pelo chamado setor de Operações Estruturadas da Odebrecht, responsável pelo pagamento das vantagens indevidas negociadas pela empreiteira em diversas frentes e descoberto pela operação Lava Jato no ano passado.

Em dezembro de 2016, a Odebrecht assinou um acordo de leniência com a Lava Jato, em que admitiu participação em práticas empresariais impróprias e aceitou pagar multa bilionária.

A operação também teve como alvo um ex-agente de banco suíço que realizava abertura e gestão de contas para então funcionários da Petrobras no banco Société Générale, onde foram movimentados milhões, disse o MPF. Parte dos recursos está bloqueada por autoridades suíças, acrescentaram os procuradores.

Além dos mandados decorrentes das novas investigações, a PF também cumpriu nesta sexta-feira mandado de prisão preventiva de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva, já condenado pelo juiz Sergio Moro em outra ação penal da Lava Jato por ter recebido mais de 5 milhões de dólares em propina para contratação de uma empresa estrangeira para construir navios-sondas para a Petrobras.

Segundo o MPF, foi constatada a necessidade da prisão cautelar para assegurar que o ex-gerente da estatal “parasse de movimentar os recursos ocultados no exterior”, o que caracteriza a continuidade de crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e impossibilita a recuperação dos recursos.

“Com essa condenação se somam condenações de mais de 110 pessoas na Lava Jato, que já totalizam mais de 1700 anos de prisão. Então, é expressivo o montante de pena totalizado nesses três anos de operação”, disse o procurador da República Roberson Pozzobon em entrevista coletiva em Curitiba.

Procurada, a Petrobras não respondeu de imediato a um pedido de comentário da Reuters, enquanto a Odebrecht afirmou, em nota, que a “qualidade e a eficácia da colaboração da empresa vêm sendo confirmadas dia a dia”, e que a empresa continua colaborando com as investigações e está comprometida em combater e não tolerar mais qualquer forma de corrupção.

The world’s third-biggest oil importer shipped in 4.2 percent more oil last month than a year earlier and about 19 percent more than in the previous month, ship-tracking data from industry sources and Thomson Reuters Analytics showed.

“There was heavy maintenance at some refineries in July-August. All those refineries have come online, so naturally refiners will have to boost purchases to meet local demand,” said Senthil Kumaran, senior analyst at energy consultant FGE.

Maintenance turnaround at some refineries led to Indian Oil Corp deferring the shutdown of its 300,000 bpd coastal Paradip refinery to April-March. [REF/A]

During the first nine months of the year India’s oil imports rose 1.8 percent to about 4.4 million bpd, with most supplies coming from the Middle East, followed by Africa and Latin America.

Indian fuel demand typically eases in the third quarter as monsoon rains hit construction, industrial activity and reduces consumption of transport fuels. That provides refiners with an opportunity to carry out maintenance.

Capacity addition is also driving up India’s oil imports.

The country added 170,000 bpd of capacity at plants owned by Bharat Petroleum Corp and HPCL-Mittal Energy, which are gradually ramping up crude runs.

India, which imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, has emerged as a key driver for growth in global oil demand.

The South Asian nation is set to surpass China as the fastest-growing oil products market in Asia, with fuel demand growing by 6.1 percent in 2018, according to a recent report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

FGE expects India’s fuel demand to rise by about 4.5 percent this year to 4.2 million bpd and by 5.1-5.2 percent in 2018.

India is increasing refining capacity to keep pace with the expected growth in fuel demand as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to boost the manufacturing sector.

Global oil majors Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, BP, Shell and Total are vying to tap a sizeable share of the fast-growing Indian fuel markets.

OPEC expects India’s oil demand to rise by 150 percent to 10.1 million bpd by 2040 from about 4 million bpd.

India’s fuel demand is also expected to rise in the fourth quarter because new tax rules have made two-wheelers and cars cheaper, said Kumaran.[O/INDIA2]",India's oil imports hit record high in September - trade,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-oil/indias-oil-imports-hit-record-high-in-september-trade-idINKBN1CP1UY

Adidas plans to use the factory - and another due to open soon in Atlanta, Georgia, to produce small batches designed for particular markets, and ultimately for individual consumers, in contrast to mass production runs ordered months in advance.

The idea is to respond faster to fashion trends and offer more customization. After London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

“It is an opportunity for us to disrupt with brand new technologies and bring that as fast as possible to consumers,” David Drury, director of development for footwear sourcing, told Reuters.

Adidas relies on more than one million workers in factories in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam, to produce about 600 million pairs of shoes and items of clothing and accessories per year.

But it is shifting some production closer to its major markets so it can deliver new styles quicker, and counter rising wages in Asia and hefty shipping costs.

It currently takes Adidas up to 18 months to design, produce and deliver most products, but it wants to cut that to as little as 45 days.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows. Reuters was first to report the news.

Amazon, Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.","Canada's Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CN1XZ-OCAEN

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CQ0AQ-OCATP

(politi.co/2yGjMtr)

“Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,” Trump said in a tweet.

The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short “Camelot,” as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 when he died and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown that a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence that points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer.

Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof that Oswald acted in consort with anyone.

Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form.

The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that some of the more recent files could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations.

Saturday’s Washington Post said Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.","Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-jfk/trump-to-release-jfk-files-subject-to-further-information-idUKKBN1CQ0ID?il=0

Separate data from Statistics Canada on Friday showed the annual inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent in September, matching forecasts and the highest in five months.

Markets and economists focused on the retail sales report, which showed sales fell 0.3 percent, against forecasts for a 0.5 percent increase. Volumes declined 0.7 percent, the biggest decrease since March 2016.

Analysts said the figures were in line with anticipated slower economic growth in the second half of the year after a strong performance that put Canada at the top of the Group of Seven.

“The Canadian economy is notably cooling down after the remarkable run it had up until about the middle part of the year,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

“The retail sales result does fit with that pattern of somewhat more modest activity.”

The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback following the two reports. [CAD/]

The decline in sales was led by a 2.5 percent drop at food and beverage stores, as well as stores that are typically linked to home purchases and renovations.

The increase in September’s inflation rate was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey, as well as more expensive food and shelter costs.

While underlying measures of inflation firmed somewhat, economists said they were still far enough away from the central bank’s 2 percent target to allow policymakers to take their time raising rates from here.

CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rose to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

China is in the midst of reforms aimed at shaking up ownership structures and injecting private capital into its bloated and debt-ridden state sector, with the ultimate aim of creating more efficient and globally competitive companies.

But leaders have repeatedly stressed that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) must also continue to fulfill their “strategic” functions under the strengthened leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, raising fears that political factors will be prioritized.

Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), insisted the two aims were not contradictory, and that stronger party leadership would give SOEs an advantage.

Asked whether party-building provisions would hurt the interests of small shareholders in the listed subsidiaries of state firms, Xiao said late on Friday that the party “has always reflected the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people and does not have its own interests”.

""Consolidating Party leadership and strengthening Party construction will be a political advantage for state-owned enterprises and play an important role in improving their quality, efficiency and competitiveness,"" he added, according to a notice posted on SASAC's website (www.sasac.gov.cn).

China has sought to streamline its state sector through mergers and asset restructuring. Since SASAC was established in 2003, the number of firms under its administration has halved, from 196 to 98.

Many economists, however, say much more needs to be done, noting the government still keeps major loss-making “zombie” companies on “life support” to avoid the risk of mass layoffs and massive debt defaults which could strain the financial system.

Xiao said SOEs would continue to be exposed to competition and subject to a process of “survival of the fittest”, but debt restructuring would still be handled with caution, with the interests of employees and creditors treated with due consideration.",China's state firms to benefit from stronger Party: state asset head,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-soe-reform/chinas-state-firms-to-benefit-from-stronger-party-state-asset-head-idUKKBN1CQ06Y

Arndt Ellinghorst vom Investmentberater Evercore ISI erklärte, die Autokonjunktur erreiche jetzt den Höhepunkt. “Man kann von den Unternehmen nicht erwarten, dass sie die Ergebnisse endlos steigern”, sagte er. “Ich finde, die halten sich dafür alle sehr gut.” Schließlich kämpfen die Autobauer an mehreren Fronten gleichzeitig: Das durch jahrelange Abgas-Manipulationen stark beschädigte Image von Dieselautos beschleunigt den Umschwung zu Elektrofahrzeugen. Dies verschlingt ebenso wie die Entwicklung selbstfahrender, vernetzter Autos Milliarden. Und statt nur Autos zu verkaufen, müssen sich die Hersteller zu Anbietern von Mobilitätsdiensten wie Car-Sharing wandeln, mit sehr unsicheren Profitaussichten.

“UNGLÜCKLICHE UMSTÄNDE”

Bei Daimler belastete die freiwillige Nachrüstung von mehr als drei Millionen Dieselautos zusammen mit einer anderen Rückrufaktion wegen Airbags das Betriebsergebnis mit fast einer halben Milliarde Euro. Der Gewinn vor Steuern und Zinsen (Ebit) sank von Juli bis September um 14 Prozent auf 3,45 Milliarden Euro. Ohne diese “unglücklichen Umstände” sehe der Trend bei den Schwaben jedoch gut aus, erklärten die Analysten von Bernstein-Research, die der Aktie einen Anstieg um gut 15 auf 85 Euro zutrauen. Am Freitag notierte das Papier nach anfänglichen Gewinnen unverändert, allerdings bewegte sich auch der Dax insgesamt nicht von der Stelle.

Die um Sonderfaktoren bereinigte Rendite im Pkw-Geschäft der Sparte Mercedes-Benz Cars sei mit 11,1 Prozent nur geringfügig hinter dem Vorjahresstand zurückgeblieben, erklärte Branchenexperte Marc-René Tonn von der Bank Warburg. Zudem ist das Lkw-Geschäft auf Erholungskurs. Die zweitgrößte Sparte steigerte das Betriebsergebnis fast um ein Drittel auf 614 Millionen Euro, so dass Daimler die Gewinnprognose für das Gesamtjahr hier ebenfalls auf ein deutliches Plus von mehr als zehn Prozent anhob. Unter dem Strich erwirtschaftete der Weltmarktführer des Premiumsegments ein Konzernergebnis von 2,26 Milliarden Euro, 17 Prozent weniger als vor Jahresfrist. Der Umsatz legte um sechs Prozent auf 40,8 Milliarden Euro zu.

Das operativ starke Geschäft wird allerdings von Rechtsrisiken überschattet: Ähnlich wie bei VW gibt es auch gegen Daimler Vorwürfe, Dieselabgase manipuliert zu haben. Den Wolfsburger Konzern kostete das schon 25 Milliarden Euro, vor allem für hohe Bußgelder in den USA. Daimler ist zudem so wie VW im Visier der Staatsanwaltschaft, die wegen des Betrugsverdachts mit Diesel-Abgaswerten ermittelt. Frank Schwope, Autoanalyst von der NordLB warnte, hieraus könnten theoretisch noch Milliarden-Lasten entstehen.

Zusammen mit den anderen Autobauern stehen die Schwaben außerdem unter Kartellverdacht in Europa. Nach einem Bericht des “Spiegel” vom Juli sollen sie sich in den 90er Jahren in großem Stil über Märkte und Strategien abgesprochen haben. Finanzchef Bodo Uebber erklärte, Daimler habe in der Sache Kronzeugenstatus bei der EU beantragt. Im Gegenzug könnte dem Konzern eine Strafe erlassen werden. Rücklagen dafür seien nicht notwendig.

BEWEGLICHER WERDEN

Trotz dieser Probleme fühlt sich Daimler stark genug, den Konzern umzubauen. Vorstandschef Zetsche will auf diese Weise Wachstumschancen besser ausschöpfen, wie er zu Wochenbeginn angekündigt hatte. Aus bislang fünf Divisionen sollen drei eigenständige Töchter werden: Das Pkw- und das Nutzfahrzeuggeschäft sollen voneinander getrennt und neben den Finanzdiensten als eigenständige Aktiengesellschaften etabliert werden. Es wäre der größte Umbau seit der Trennung vom US-Autobauer Chrysler vor rund zehn Jahren.

Die endgültige Entscheidung wird nach eingehender Prüfung zwar erst 2019 fallen. Doch der Konzern steckt 100 Millionen Euro in die Vorbereitungsarbeiten, wie Finanzchef Uebber erklärte. Als eigenständige Einheit könnten die Sparten einfacher Überkreuzbeteiligungen mit Partnerunternehmen, etwa aus der IT-Branche eingehen. Analysten lobten den Plan. Daimler werde dadurch flexibler und beweglicher, erklärte etwa Stefan Bauknecht, Chef-Aktienanalyst der Deutsche-Bank-Tochter Deutsche Asset Management. “Allerdings wäre mehr Transparenz und Offenheit über die weitere ‘Roadmap’ nötig.”",Trotz Dieselgate und Kartellverdacht - Autobauer halten Kurs,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-daimler-idDEKBN1CP1KV

Under that scenario, either Powell or Taylor would take the reins from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in early February, and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when Stanley Fischer retired this month.

“That is something that is under consideration, but he hasn’t ruled out a number of options. He’ll have an announcement on that soon, in the coming days,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday.

Making Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising interest rates, the next Fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investors crave.

The addition of Taylor, who has backed an overhaul of the Fed and embraced a more rigid rule-oriented monetary policy, would be a feather in the cap of conservative Republicans who feel that monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen, who was named as Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and has led the central bank since February 2014.

“I think Powell might be the safer pick insofar as we know what we’re getting,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. “He’s a guy who obviously knows the Fed culture, how the (policy-setting) committee operates, so for some of those soft skills we know he would be effective.”

Powell has embraced the Yellen Fed’s monetary policy, keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wages higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lays out where interest rates ought to be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies that rates should be higher than they are now.

Yellen, speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Friday evening, mounted a strong defense of the tools the Fed has used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there was a risk of another crisis in which those “unconventional policies” may be needed again.

Yellen, who Trump has indicated could still be named to another term as Fed chair, was not asked about the Fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process.

“SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT”

Although Taylor is highly regarded within the Fed, his rule-based rate-setting position has spurred criticism that he would handcuff U.S. monetary policy.

Taylor pushed back at a meeting at the Boston Fed on Saturday, saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rules and did not want to tie the Fed’s hands or suggest that he was motivated by a distrust of policymakers.

“I think that’s completely incorrect,” he said. “I trust policymakers; (rules) are an effort to make policy better.”

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Some analysts suggest that fears that Taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the Fed, as some Republicans in Congress hope, are likely exaggerated.

“There is some scope for disappointment if people think putting Taylor in will just lead to mechanical-based policy,” Feroli said.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, speaking with reporters on Friday, seemed to agree.

“Even if you pick a rule, the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy,” she said. “But I do think being systematic, looking at the kinds of information we look at systematically over time, articulating our strategy for policy and being less discretionary is a good idea.”

At the same time, there are concerns that the combination of Powell and Taylor atop the world’s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to markets.

It is unclear whether Trump, who has criticized Yellen’s stewardship but also said on several occasions that he preferred rates to stay low, wants to dramatically alter the Fed’s direction.

Although he appears to be tilting to Powell and Taylor, in addition to Yellen the Republican president has interviewed his top economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh for the Fed chief position.","Trump considers Fed's Powell, economist Taylor to lead central bank",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-considers-feds-powell-economist-taylor-to-lead-central-bank-idINKBN1CP29G?il=0

Kennedy International Airport, soon to be ringed with people coming from Puerto Rico on one-way tickets they never would have bought if not for the hurricane.

Moving at a canter, Emily Pagan and three colleagues from various New York state government agencies carted their fold-up table halfway down the Terminal 5 arrivals hall, setting it up by the carousel against a pillar.

They had volunteered to help orient the latest batch of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans that New York officials estimate will flee from the lingering devastation wrought a month ago by Hurricane Maria.

Many are expected to stay for months - or years - and some forever, in a largely reluctant wave of migration abetted by the spare mattresses and couches of the one million Puerto Ricans who already call the New York area home.

“A lot of them are saying they came to start a new life here because they lost everything,” Pagan said on her third day of greeting arrivals from the U.S. territory, where the power grid and water supply remain in disarray.

She tried to make the makeshift help desk look nice, centering a bowl of mints and squaring off the piles of leaflets about health and job resources.

A clipboard wedged into her elbow, Pagan hurried up to anyone who looked like they were waiting for relatives from the island, flipping between English and Spanish: “Hi, I‘m Emily, and I represent the state.”

Lissette Feliciano, who had driven down from Bridgeport, Connecticut, was among those grateful for a leaflet. Then bags began thudding onto the carousel and the automatic doors slid open to admit her 10-year-old nephew, sporting an Incredible Hulk T-shirt, alongside her youngest sister, Madeline Feliciano.

The nephew, Carlos, grinned as he was nuzzled by his aunt. It was their first time leaving the island. They never expected an airplane cabin would be so cold, he said, shivering.

“I‘m so-so,” his mother said, looking daunted.

Many Puerto Rican families are divided between those who prefer the island’s warmth and those who cannot understand why one would not move to the mainland’s hustle, as Lissette did seven years ago. But the storm put those disagreements on hold.

“Four days, no running water,” Madeline said of their hometown, Isabela. She did not know when they could return.

“They’ll stay with me until we can find something for her,” said Lissette, who had already found a bilingual school for Carlos.

They headed out, with Madeline and Carlos added to the tally on Pagan’s clipboard.

People gravitated toward Pagan and her purple top bearing the logo of New York’s Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, where she normally works as a compliance officer.

Born in Puerto Rico, Pagan, 42, listened to the accounts of each new arrival that made her beautiful native island seem unfamiliar: no water, no power, no green left on the tropical trees, no sort of place where a child or grandparent could thrive.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said between flights. But she tried to put on a welcoming face, slipping lollipops to children before moving on to the next family. She was yet to meet anyone without relatives to stay with, but younger adults seemed worried about finding jobs in a place where they had never planned to live.

Pagan cooed at the green eyes of a 7-year-old boy called Jayden with a Transformers backpack. “You speak English!” she said after the boy squirmed at the compliment. “You understand everything I say!”

Jayden’s father, Joemil Ramirez, was returning to New York City, where he was raised, for only three weeks, partly for its functional telephone network. Much of that time he expected to spend making calls trying to salvage his hurricane-ravaged restaurant in Rincon. But when he returned, he would be leaving behind Jayden, who would move in with the boy’s mother, from whom Ramirez was separated.

“There’s no place for him to be, no school,” Ramirez said. “It’s a situation I wouldn’t give to my own worst enemy.”

Genoveva Mendez, 48, watched the carousel from her wheelchair. She had been undergoing physical therapy three times a week following a stroke, but Maria halted that.

“We had to force her,” said her daughter, Jessenia Lalama. Mendez had refused the offer of a ticket to New York for weeks.

“I like the island, the island’s beautiful,” Mendez said, becoming tearful at the memory of her home before the hurricane.

When the hall emptied, a lone suitcase remained on the carousel as Pagan and her colleagues carried their table back to the corner, ready to greet the next day’s flights.","Plane by plane, New York greets Puerto Ricans displaced by hurricane",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-arrivals/plane-by-plane-new-york-greets-puerto-ricans-displaced-by-hurricane-idUSKBN1CQ0CE

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee have coached witnesses, scheduled interviews without first requesting important documents, and many fail to attend witness interviews, four sources close to the investigation said.

On one occasion, three sources said, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy told Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House aide, that he was testifying voluntarily and could leave whenever he liked. After about two-and-a-half hours, one of the sources said, Kushner took the cue and left before Democrats had finished questioning him. Kushner’s lawyer and Gowdy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The panel has heard from about 10 witnesses, the sources said. But given the lack of preparation and the absence of many Republican members, hearings amount to “going through the motions” rather than a serious investigation, one source said.

Two Republican committee staffers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also criticized what they called a partisan effort to discredit rather than investigate allegations that some aides or advisers to Republican Trump’s election campaign may have colluded with Russia, which has been under U.S. sanctions for several years.

The conduct of the probe so far, those staffers and other sources said, threatens to undermine the committee’s reputation for bipartisanship under former Republican chairman Mike Rogers, who led the committee from 2011 to 2015.

Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said that while she would like to believe the panel “will come together unified in its conclusions and submit a joint report, I‘m not overly optimistic that this will be the case.”

Another committee Democrat, Representative Eric Swalwell, said, “That is our North Star, unity and consensus on what happened. Now along the way we’ve seen disruptive behavior that has I think impeded our investigation, and despite that we still are doggedly trying to find out what happened.”

Asked for comment, Jack Langer, a spokesman for Republican committee chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, said in a statement: “With this article, Reuters is acting as a loyal, obedient stenographer of the Democrats’ utterly baseless complaints.”

Langer did not respond to Reuters’ request to address specific complaints made by the Democrats.

POSSIBLE MOTIVES?

Democratic members and staffers on the committee have said nothing publicly about the Republicans’ possible motives for fear of destroying any chance to produce a bipartisan report, four sources said.

Democrats said that the Republicans appear to want to undermine the credibility of Fusion GPS, a political research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to produce a dossier on Trump while he was running for president.

Investigators are attempting to confirm or dismiss the contents of Steele’s dossier, which outlined Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s campaign and associates.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign of hacking and propaganda to undermine faith in the U.S. election, denigrate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and help Trump. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Trump disputes he and his associates colluded with Moscow, calling probes by Congress and a special counsel a “witch hunt.”

Panel chairman Nunes, a Trump ally, was forced to step aside from leading the probe in April after the House Ethics Committee said it was investigating allegations that he disclosed classified information without authorization. Democrats on the committee praise Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican who took Nunes’ place leading the investigation.

Nevertheless, Nunes is investigating Fusion GPS and Steele on his own. On Oct. 10, Nunes subpoenaed the firm’s partners, a source familiar with the matter said.

Sources familiar with the origins of the dossier said Steele received no money for his work on it from any Russian entity or person or from the FBI. It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s opponents for the party’s presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by Clinton supporters.

The House and Senate intelligence committees, created in the aftermath of U.S. spy scandals exposed in the 1970s, have long traditions of avoiding partisan feuds.

Three sources familiar with the House committee’s workings said Democrats had requested a meeting of all members to resolve differences, but the Republicans rejected the idea.

If the rift cannot be healed, the sources said, the Democrats could write their own report and seek to associate it with what is expected to be a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

Representative Adam Schiff, the House committee’s top Democrat, wrote in The Washington Post last weekend that he still hoped members could arrive at a common conclusion.

“This remains my hope - not consistency for the sake of consistency, or at the cost of incomplete work, but in the service of a public that has too often been forced to choose between competing narratives of the same events,” Schiff wrote.","Partisan feud undercuts Trump-Russia probe, U.S. Democrats charge",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-house/partisan-feud-undercuts-trump-russia-probe-u-s-democrats-charge-idUSKBN1CP2MN?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel.

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe was assigned the patents by SRC Labs LLC in August, in a deal intended to use the tribe’s sovereign status to shield them from administrative review.

SRC is also a plaintiff in the case.

Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.

The tribe, which would receive a share of any award, made a similar deal in September to hold patents for Allergan on its dry eye medicine Restasis.

SRC and Allergan made the deals to shield their patents from review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court run by the U.S. patent office that frequently revokes patents. The tribe would get revenue to address environmental damage and rising healthcare costs.

Companies sued for patent infringement in federal court often respond by asking the patent board to invalidate the asserted patents. Both Microsoft and Amazon have used this strategy to prevail in previous disputes.

A federal court in Texas separately invalidated Allergan’s Restasis patents on Monday. The company responded that it would appeal that ruling.

Allergan’s deal with the tribe has drawn criticism from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, some of whom have called it a “sham.” Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill on Oct. 5 introduced a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty.",Native American tribe holding patents sues Amazon and Microsoft,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-patents-nativeamerican/native-american-tribe-holding-patents-sues-amazon-and-microsoft-idUSKBN1CN2G1

Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee have coached witnesses, scheduled interviews without first requesting important documents, and many fail to attend witness interviews, four sources close to the investigation said.

On one occasion, three sources said, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy told Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House aide, that he was testifying voluntarily and could leave whenever he liked. After about two-and-a-half hours, one of the sources said, Kushner took the cue and left before Democrats had finished questioning him. Kushner’s lawyer and Gowdy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The panel has heard from about 10 witnesses, the sources said. But given the lack of preparation and the absence of many Republican members, hearings amount to “going through the motions” rather than a serious investigation, one source said.

Two Republican committee staffers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also criticized what they called a partisan effort to discredit rather than investigate allegations that some aides or advisers to Republican Trump’s election campaign may have colluded with Russia, which has been under U.S. sanctions for several years.

The conduct of the probe so far, those staffers and other sources said, threatens to undermine the committee’s reputation for bipartisanship under former Republican chairman Mike Rogers, who led the committee from 2011 to 2015.

Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said that while she would like to believe the panel “will come together unified in its conclusions and submit a joint report, I‘m not overly optimistic that this will be the case.”

Another committee Democrat, Representative Eric Swalwell, said, “That is our North Star, unity and consensus on what happened. Now along the way we’ve seen disruptive behavior that has I think impeded our investigation, and despite that we still are doggedly trying to find out what happened.”

Asked for comment, Jack Langer, a spokesman for Republican committee chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, said in a statement: “With this article, Reuters is acting as a loyal, obedient stenographer of the Democrats’ utterly baseless complaints.”

Langer did not respond to Reuters’ request to address specific complaints made by the Democrats.

POSSIBLE MOTIVES?

Democratic members and staffers on the committee have said nothing publicly about the Republicans’ possible motives for fear of destroying any chance to produce a bipartisan report, four sources said.

Democrats said that the Republicans appear to want to undermine the credibility of Fusion GPS, a political research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to produce a dossier on Trump while he was running for president.

Investigators are attempting to confirm or dismiss the contents of Steele’s dossier, which outlined Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s campaign and associates.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign of hacking and propaganda to undermine faith in the U.S. election, denigrate Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and help Trump. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Trump disputes he and his associates colluded with Moscow, calling probes by Congress and a special counsel a “witch hunt.”

Panel chairman Nunes, a Trump ally, was forced to step aside from leading the probe in April after the House Ethics Committee said it was investigating allegations that he disclosed classified information without authorization. Democrats on the committee praise Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican who took Nunes’ place leading the investigation.

Nevertheless, Nunes is investigating Fusion GPS and Steele on his own. On Oct. 10, Nunes subpoenaed the firm’s partners, a source familiar with the matter said.

Sources familiar with the origins of the dossier said Steele received no money for his work on it from any Russian entity or person or from the FBI. It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s opponents for the party’s presidential nomination, initially paid for research that was later picked up by Clinton supporters.

The House and Senate intelligence committees, created in the aftermath of U.S. spy scandals exposed in the 1970s, have long traditions of avoiding partisan feuds.

Three sources familiar with the House committee’s workings said Democrats had requested a meeting of all members to resolve differences, but the Republicans rejected the idea.

If the rift cannot be healed, the sources said, the Democrats could write their own report and seek to associate it with what is expected to be a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

Representative Adam Schiff, the House committee’s top Democrat, wrote in The Washington Post last weekend that he still hoped members could arrive at a common conclusion.

“This remains my hope - not consistency for the sake of consistency, or at the cost of incomplete work, but in the service of a public that has too often been forced to choose between competing narratives of the same events,” Schiff wrote.","Partisan feud undercuts Trump-Russia probe, U.S. Democrats charge",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-house/partisan-feud-undercuts-trump-russia-probe-u-s-democrats-charge-idUSKBN1CP2MN

Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget measure that will allow Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic party support.

But Republicans, who control both the Senate and House of Representatives, have yet to produce a tax reform bill as a self-imposed deadline to overhaul the U.S. tax code by the end of the year approaches. The party’s lawmakers differ widely on what cuts to make and how to pay for them.

They are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing so far to make good on their other main legislative ambition: scrapping Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama.

On major world markets, stock prices advanced on Friday, bond yields rose, and the U.S. dollar strengthened on increased hopes that Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans.

Democrats are likely to reject the Trump administration’s tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and people but will bloat the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.

FISCAL HAWK

Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, was the lone Republican to vote against the budget measure on Thursday. He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.

On Friday, Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was “all in” for the “biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!” But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan.

Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform, saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package. He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes.

“I don’t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet.

The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks.

The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs, including food assistance for the poor.

As far as spending cuts go, the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $1 billion over the next decade.

That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint.

Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986.

In the current effort, some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples, a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments.

The party’s lawmakers agree roughly on lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent but have not settled on a final number.

Trump seeks to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, which he says would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.

Asked how he would make the case that the plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS, “That’s why we’re introducing the fourth bracket, so that high-income earners do not see a big rate cut and those resources go to the middle class ... and closing loopholes and carve outs which disproportionately benefit the very high-income people.”",Trump tax cut plan gains momentum after U.S. budget vote,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taxcuts/trump-tax-cut-plan-gains-momentum-after-u-s-budget-vote-idUSKBN1CP18W

Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, has killed hundreds of people in bomb attacks and is considered one of the most dangerous militant groups in the nuclear-armed South Asian nation.

The killing of JuA chief Omar Khalid Khorasani was a major boost for Pakistan’s anti-militancy campaign and is likely to help ease tension with uneasy ally the United States days ahead of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Two JuA commanders told Reuters Afridi was nominated to take over during a meeting in Afghanistan by the group’s shura, or leadership council.

“Asad Afridi was close to Omar Khalid, who had declared him his deputy,” said one JuA commander.

A second JuA militant, who is a member of the shura, confirmed Afridi was nominated as the new chief.

Khorasani was seen as ruling the group with an iron fist.

“Our organization used to be a one-man show. All powers were in the hands of Omar Khalid Khorasani,” the second commander said.

Khorasani was killed during a series of U.S. drone attacks this week in which at least 30 people were killed on the Afghan side of the border.

His killing follows a slight thaw in relations between Islamabad and Washington, seemingly sparked by the Pakistan army last week freeing a U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children after five years in captivity. The family was held by the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban-allied militant group.

Warmer words from Washington have been in stark contrast to threats by U.S. officials that it would cut military aid and impose targeted sanctions if Pakistan did not stop providing a safe havens to the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.

Pakistan denies offering sanctuary to Afghan Taliban fighters and has asked the United States to target Pakistani Taliban militants who cross the porous border and hide in Afghanistan.

Pakistan is investing more than $500 million to fence the 2,500-km frontier.

HISTORY OF FIGHTING U.S. TROOPS

But in a sign that relations between the United States and Pakistan are still difficult, the chief of the CIA said on Thursday the U.S.-Canadian couple had been held inside Pakistan for five years, contradicting Pakistan’s assertion they were held in Afghanistan.

It is not clear if Afridi would change tack if he were to be confirmed as JuA leader, but there are concerns within the group about his power base among the ethnic Pashtun tribes who live along the Afghan border.

Afridi is from the Zakha Khel area of Pakistan’s Khyber region but Khorasani, and most JuA fighters, are from the Mohmand region to the north.

“The organization was basically formed in Mohmand and the majority of the fighters and commanders are from Mohmand therefore people would have wished someone from the same area,” said the first JuA commander.

He said Afridi did not have a religious or formal school education but had a history of fighting and had at one point fought U.S. troops in Afghanistan as part of the Taliban.

On Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed 12 people in Afghanistan’s Paktia province, according to a government official. It was the fourth day this week that drone strikes were reported on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.

“Twelve dead bodies have been pulled out of the area where the missiles struck,” Laik Khan, an Afghan government official, told Reuters.

The JuA has emerged as the most deadly Pakistani Taliban faction over the past two years. At one point, it allied itself with Islamic State before apparently re-joining the Pakistani Taliban.

The group bombed an Easter Sunday gathering at a park in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore last year, killing at least 70 people. In August 2016, it bombed a hospital in Quetta targeting the city’s most prominent lawyers, killing 74 people.

In June this year, JuA targeted the provincial police chief of the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing 13 people. The attack was also claimed by Islamic State.",Pakistan militant group finds likely replacement after U.S. drone kills leader,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-militants/pakistan-militant-group-finds-likely-replacement-after-u-s-drone-kills-leader-idINKBN1CP0T6

He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.

On Friday, Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was “all in” for the “biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!” But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan.

Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform, saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package. He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes.

“I don’t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet.

The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks.

The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs, including food assistance for the poor.

As far as spending cuts go, the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $1 billion over the next decade.

That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint.

Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986.

In the current effort, some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples, a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments.

The party’s lawmakers agree roughly on lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent but have not settled on a final number.

Trump seeks to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, which he says would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.

Asked how he would make the case that the plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS, “That’s why we’re introducing the fourth bracket, so that high-income earners do not see a big rate cut and those resources go to the middle class ... and closing loopholes and carve outs which disproportionately benefit the very high-income people.”",Trump tax cut plan gains momentum after U.S. budget vote,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taxcuts/trump-tax-cut-plan-gains-momentum-after-u-s-budget-vote-idUSKBN1CP18W?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

For all the talk of innovation, restructuring and deleveraging, the fundamentals driving the world’s second-largest economy have not changed. China still depends on investment more than consumption, manufacturing over services, and cheaper products rather than stronger brands. For better or worse, Beijing looks okay with that.

In the three months to September, China’s bureaucracy mobilised to do what it does best: produce a rosy backdrop to a big meeting. The statistical result of their efforts landed during the 19th Party Congress, the day after President Xi Jinping trotted out the usual platitudes about territorial integrity and market forces.

Those forces certainly have been cooperative. Housing investment, China’s most critical single contributor to demand, remained healthy. Combined with infrastructure spending, it propped up state-owned cement producers, steelmakers and so on. This in turn drove demand for commodities, which pushed up producer prices, benefiting all sorts of other indicators - profitability in state-owned heavy industries, for example.

The private sector isn’t complaining. Trade remains robust. Exports far outstripped imports, suggesting the government’s de-facto import substitution initiative, also known as “Made in China 2025”, is gaining traction. A rally in the yuan has deterred capital outflows without denting exports - another sign that Chinese firms are moving up the value chain.

Yet there is sparse evidence of a statistically significant move from manufacturing into services. And the country remains highly dependent on debt. It’s true the government has allowed some state-owned firms to default, and suppressed the more dangerous classes of shadow banking. But total credit creation has barely slowed, hitting $274 billion in September.

Sure, easy liquidity has stimulated sexy entrepreneurship, spawning startups that enable sharing of everything from bicycles to basketballs. But these are macroeconomic blips, and have yet to show that they can earn a return on venture capital.

It’s politically expedient to present tweaks as revolutions. There are mounting challenges as distortions endure. But China’s old model, however unbalanced, is still easier for this crew to manage than a disruptive new one.",Breakingviews - China’s leaders make peace with its old economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-leaders-make-peace-with-its-old-economy-idUSKBN1CO0B9

É a segunda vez que a assembleia de credores da Oi é adiada. Originalmente, a reunião que decidirá sobre a aceitação de um plano de recuperação preparado pela companhia estava marcada para ocorrer em 9 de outubro, mas no fim de setembro Viana aceitou pedido da Oi para adiamento.

O adiamento ocorre em meio a negociações da companhia com o governo federal em torno da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da operadora junto à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel).

Mais cedo, o presidente-executivo da Oi, Marco Schroeder, reuniu-se com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, junto com outros executivos do setor de telecomunicações como o presidente da Telefônica Brasil, Eduardo Navarro.

Após o encontro, Schroeder comentou a jornalistas que a Oi estava preparada para realizar a assembleia de credores na segunda-feira, mas que a empresa poderia aproveitar um adiamento para conseguir mais apoio para o plano de recuperação apresentado em 11 de outubro.

No plano, a Oi propôs limite de 25 por cento à conversão de títulos de dívida em ações, bem abaixo dos 88 por cento pretendidos por grandes detentores de títulos da companhia. A proposta da empresa implica em um abatimento da dívida da ordem de 73 por cento, segundo análise do Itaú BBA.

Apesar dos detentores de bônus condenarem a oferta da Oi, eles também estão tentando evitar o colapso da companhia a todo o custo, segundo disseram duas fontes com conhecimento do assunto.

Os ativos da Oi são avaliados em 40,8 bilhões de reais, segundo o auditor independente Ernest & Young. Esse valor pode cair para 17,9 bilhões ou menos do que 30 por cento do valor da dívida sob renegociação no caso de uma venda forçada da operadora, segundo o auditor.

Como classe de credores, os detentores de bônus da Oi estão em termos de prioridade atrás dos funcionários da empresa e do BNDES e por isso podem perder mais no caso de uma liquidação da operadora do que se aceitarem o plano de recuperação proposto pela Oi, disseram as fontes.

“Os peticionários vêm a juízo requerer o adiamento do conclave, alegando ser prematuro e afirmando ainda pretenderem evoluir nas negociações para construção de alternativas viáveis...tal adiamento deverá ser por apenas 15 dias, tempo que considero razoável para a conclusão das negociações”, afirmou Viana na decisão.

Também após o encontro de Meirelles com os executivos nesta sexta-feira, a Anatel decidiu antecipar das 11h para às 8h de segunda-feira uma reunião na qual poderá decidir se aceita trocar multas devidas pela Oi em obrigações de investimento pela operadora. Na quinta-feira, fonte com conhecimento do assunto afirmou à Reuters que o valor das multas a ser discutido pela Anatel na segunda-feira é de 5 bilhões de reais.

15 MESES

A Oi entrou com pedido de recuperação judicial em junho do ano passado e até agora acionistas e detentores de títulos da empresa não chegaram a um acordo sobre a reestruturação da companhia, que declarou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais devidos a 55 mil credores.

Nesta sexta-feira, a Oi divulgou que encerrou programa de acordo com credores com dívidas da empresa de até 50 mil reais. A empresa conseguiu acertar 25 mil acordos de um total de 53 mil credores que têm a receber até 50 mil reais. Segundo a operadora, o volume de dívida acertada no programa foi de 410 milhões de reais.

A data da segunda convocação da assembleia de credores foi mantida em 27 de novembro, segundo a decisão de Viana.

Na decisão, o juiz afirmou que a realização da assembleia 15 meses depois da aprovação do pedido de recuperação judicial da Oi, além do prazo máximo previsto em lei de 5 meses, está “em consonância com a realidade forense”.

“Se considerarmos a magnitude deste processo, nunca antes vista, em termos de números de credores, valor da dívida, temas inéditos e de profunda complexidade, a assembleia será realizada em tempo que considero satisfatório”, escreveu Viana em sua decisão.

O juiz disse que não pretendia adiar novamente a assembleia, mas diante dos pedidos de “credores extremamente relevantes...não vejo como não autorizar o adiamento”.

Entre os bancos que pediram a postergação da reunião estão Banco do Brasil, que aparece como credor de 3,9 bilhões de reais da Oi, e Caixa Econômica Federal, com créditos de cerca de 1,9 bilhão de reais.

Para a assembleia de segunda-feira, a Oi esperava presença de até 5 mil pessoas ao anfiteatro do pavilhão 6 do centro de convenções Riocentro, que tem capacidade para 6 mil pessoas. A equipe organizadora do evento envolvia cerca de 1.000 pessoas.",Justiça do RJ adia assembleia de credores da Oi para 6 de novembro,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CP2UB-OBRBS

“Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,” Trump said in a tweet.

The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short “Camelot,” as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 when he died and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown that a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence that points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer.

Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof that Oswald acted in consort with anyone.

Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form.

The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that some of the more recent files could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations.

Saturday’s Washington Post said Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.","Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-jfk/trump-to-release-jfk-files-subject-to-further-information-idUKKBN1CQ0ID

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

The measure is one of several being considered for refugees, the sources said.

The administration also may expand the use of intensive security checks by multiple federal agencies, called “security advisory opinions” (SAO) to apply to women from countries designated as high-risk by the U.S. government. Currently there are usually only mandatory SAOs, as they are called, for men from those countries, the sources said.

The administration is also considering expanding the categories of refugees required to be fingerprinted, the sources said.

The proposals, if implemented, could significantly slow down refugee admissions and leave refugees who thought they were headed to the United States in perilous situations abroad, say refugee advocates and former officials.

David Lapan, a spokesman from the Department of Homeland Security said he could not comment on specific proposals that are still in the review process.

A State Department official also declined to comment while the review is underway and a White House spokeswoman said they have no announcements at this time.

Republican President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions and quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries that were challenged in court.

A 120-day temporary ban on refugees, put in place to study current procedures, expires on Oct. 24.

The sources, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the plans before they are announced, said the new measures could be announced at the end of the temporary ban.

Trump has said “extreme vetting” of refugees and immigrants and visitors is needed to prevent terrorist attacks.

The administration could pause the visa issuing process for “following-to-join” spouses and children of refugees who have already made it to the United States, known as V93 cases, the sources said. In 2015, just 3 percent of the nearly 70,000 refugee arrivals were those types of beneficiaries, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Reports on the type of vetting measures being considered for our refugee resettlement program are disturbing,” said Hans Van de Weerd, the Vice President of U.S. Programs at the International Rescue Committee.

They amount “to a desertion of victims of war and heinous persecution, who have done everything asked of them as they prepare to arrive to the US,” he said.

Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States in a process that can take 18-24 months.

“When you put in additional security checks you can basically halt the system,” said Robert Carey, the former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.

“Every check is only good for a finite period of time and they expire and the whole process has to start all over again,” he said, adding that the level of scrutiny is higher for refugees than most any other visa applicant to the United States.

Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by Obama.

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel.

The Syrian military said it came under attack in Quneitra province, which sits near the Golan Heights territory that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.

“The Israeli enemy assaulted one of our military positions this morning, which led to material damages,” it said.

During Syria’s more than six-year-old conflict, Israel has returned fire across the border, including stray shells from fighting among Syrian factions.

The military statement suggested it may start escalating such retaliations. “Whether errant fire or not, any future occurrences will force the Israel Defense Forces to intensify its response,” it said.

Israel “holds the Syrian regime responsible and won’t tolerate any attempt to breach Israeli sovereignty,” it added.

In its own statement, the Syrian military warned against “such aggressive acts” and said it held Israel responsible for any consequent results.

Israel has also carried out targeted air strikes in Syria during the war, alarmed by the expanding influence of Iran, the Syrian government’s ally. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah nearly 100 times in recent years.

Iran’s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syria’s airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus this week. The general signed an agreement with his Syrian counterpart to further boost military cooperation, Iranian state news agency IRNA said on Saturday.

Rebel factions fighting the Damascus government in the multi-sided war hold swathes of Quneitra, while the army and allied militias control another part of the province.

Both warring Syrian sides accused each other of prompting the Israeli attack on Saturday.

Stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overall attracted $5.4 billion in the week ended Oct. 18, while emerging markets pulled in $2.3 billion, the most cash since March, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper research unit.

For equity ETFs, the SPDR S&P 500 and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets contributed the two largest net positive flows, attracting more than $4.6 billion and $1.4 billion in new cash respectively, Lipper said.

Invesco Ltd Global Market Strategist Kristina Hooper said economic growth was not enough to explain the stock gains. The S&P 500 has delivered more than a 16 percent return this year, including dividends, and some 350 percent since its March 2009 lows, yet U.S. gross domestic product growth has been averaging around 2 percent annually.

“This is not explosive growth, and yet we have a stock market that’s moving higher largely based on expectations of what’s going to happen,” said Hooper.

U.S. President Donald Trump is looking to overhaul the country’s corporate tax system, a move that would be seen as a positive for stocks.

“I‘m concerned in the U.S. that there’s greater vulnerability because stocks have been on a tear and a lot of it has been based on sentiment as opposed to fundamentals,” said Hooper.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

Paul Kim, director of ETF strategy at Principal Financial Group Inc, said companies were using keen maneuvers to boost profits even when sales growth was minimal. Companies were reducing their outstanding shares using buybacks, he said, pushing up profits as a percentage of a declining number of shares.

Domestic-focused stock funds pulled in $1 billion during the week, the most since August. Non-domestic equity funds attracted $4.3 billion, marking a fifth straight week of inflows.

Swings between sectors continue to generate a powerful undertow in otherwise tranquil markets. Healthcare and biotechnology sector funds posted $382 billion in outflows during the week, marking the category’s largest withdrawals since August, according to Lipper.

A bipartisan deal to stabilize Obamacare by restoring federal subsidies to health insurers picked up Republican support in the Senate on Thursday, despite Trump’s opposition, but still faces an uphill battle.

And the bullish mood on stocks did little to shake demand for bonds. Taxable-bond funds took in $4 billion for the week, according to Lipper, and the category has posted outflows just three weeks this year. Low risk money-market funds took in $5.1 billion.

But Treasury funds posted $391 million outflows, the most withdrawn since July, and high-yield outflows of $450 million marked the largest withdrawals since August, Lipper said.","U.S. fund investors regain risk appetite as Dow breaches 23,000",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-mutualfunds-lipper/u-s-fund-investors-regain-risk-appetite-as-dow-breaches-23000-idUSKBN1CO363

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/spain-will-sack-catalan-government-call-regional-election-idINKBN1CQ0AO

Tesla criticized the rating on Thursday, saying ”it’s important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how

the Model 3 was designed and engineered.”

The rating for the Model 3, which is lower priced than earlier Tesla models and aimed at giving the Silicon Valley automaker mass market appeal, was part of magazine’s annual survey of new vehicle reliability.

The survey predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

“Tesla seems to misunderstand or is conflating some of what we fundamentally do,” the magazine, sometimes called the buyer’s bible for car shoppers, said in a statement.

“Tesla appears unhappy that CR expects the new-to-market Tesla Model 3 to be of average reliability, which is generally a positive projection for any first model year of a car,” the magazine said.

Tesla launched production of the Model 3, its newest car, over the summer.

Consumer Reports said its rating was based on 2,000 consumer survey response about Tesla models. It also noted that its survey listed Tesla’s Model S sedan as the magazine’s top rated car with “above average reliability for the first time ever.”

Palo Alto, California-based Tesla said earlier this month that “production bottlenecks” had left it running behind in ramp-up plans for the Model 3, which is still short in supply with long waiting lists for deliveries.

“As with all the cars we review ... we will thoroughly test and evaluate the Model 3 with the same care and scrutiny we apply to all the cars we test just as soon as we can get one - we’re waiting patiently along with other consumers,” Consumer Reports said.",Consumer Reports says Tesla misunderstands 'positive' Model 3 rating,https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tesla-reliability/consumer-reports-says-tesla-misunderstands-positive-model-3-rating-idINKBN1CP2KC

This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

More than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on Saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely.

Somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said Hussein Moalim Mohamud Sheikh Ali, a former national security adviser to the president.

“The national security architecture is in tatters,” he told Reuters. “The Shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state.”

The increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in Somalia ahead of the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers at the end of the year. They also are a concern for other countries in the region where al Shabaab is active, such as Kenya and Uganda.

In 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in Somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research.

Initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al Shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say.

Competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four Western and one Somali security source told Reuters.

A letter from Somalia’s minister of internal security addressed to the United States, Britain and the United Nations in May complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence.

“Multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counter-terrorism efforts,” said the letter, seen by Reuters.

The pressure is building on President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who must ensure Somalia’s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000-strong AU force leaves.

His government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint U.S.-Somali raid on Bariire in August that residents say killed 10 civilians. Political disagreements threaten co-operation between Somalia’s federal and regional forces.

Last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. The interior ministry spokesman resigned this week.

Somali police did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES

Obtaining high-grade military explosives - the material that makes a bomb explode - involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else.

Making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the Sahan report and an upcoming report from a U.N. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on Somalia.

According to the U.N. report which is due to be published next month, the U.S. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, which is funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle-borne bomb incidents since 2016.

“The potential use of HME (home-made explosive) by al Shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious … allow(ing) the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its IEDs,” said the report.

Al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow Somalia’s U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed.

Mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said.

A former top al Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. Robow defected to the government in August after the U.S. government removed a $5 million bounty for his capture.

Two Mogadishu-based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to Reuters.

They said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit Mogadishu International Airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a European Union military training mission.

“One bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb,” one of the Western security contractors told Reuters. “They also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base.”

The driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said.

A larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as Kilometer Five. Panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck.

“I could see the truck speeding. I also heard few gunshots behind it. Police must have been chasing it,” said Mohamed Ali, 21, who was injured in the blast.

“As it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. What followed was the blast and smoke.”

The fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. Many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves.

The driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated.

Three security sources told Reuters he identified himself as al Shabaab.",Deadly Somalia blast reveals flaws in intelligence efforts,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CP222-OZATP

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

Clark will meet with Canadian government officials and executives from the two manufacturers, according to a spokeswoman for the ministry for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

A deal announced earlier this week gives Airbus (AIR.PA) a controlling stake in the Canadian manufacturer’s troubled C-Series jets, which are partly made in Northern Ireland.

The tie up gives Bombardier (BBDb.TO) a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N), in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, potentially threatening thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the C Series and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama, thus becoming a U.S.-made product so it can avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May wading into the debate and asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene in order save British jobs.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Doch auch das ehemalige Notenbank-Führungsmitglied Warsh gilt weiter als aussichtsreicher Bewerber. US-Präsident Donald Trump will bald entscheiden, auf wen seine Wahl für das wichtige Amt an den geldpolitischen Schalthebeln gefallen ist. Doch hat er sich offenbar noch nicht festgelegt, wie Reuters von einer mit dem Vorgang vertrauten Person erfuhr: “Ich denke, er neigt noch keinem Kandidaten zu.”

Mit dem 64-jährigen Powell würde ein Währungshüter an die Spitze der mächtigsten Notenbank der Welt rücken, der bereits seit Jahren in deren Führungsetage sitzt. “Als Chef dürfte er wohl die Politik der schrittweisen Normalisierung der Geldpolitik fortsetzen, die Amtsinhaberin Janet Yellen eingeleitet hat”, prognostizieren die Volkswirte der Großbank UniCredit. Yellen hat die Zügel nach einer jahrelange Nullzins-Phase angesichts des anhaltenden Aufschwungs in den USA stufenweise gestrafft - auf das aktuelle Leitzins-Niveau von 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent. Sie will es bis zum Jahresende weiter erhöhen, falls die Konjunkturlage es zulässt.

Der frühere Fed-Direktor Warsh gilt als Anhänger eines strafferen geldpolitischen Kurses. Der heute 47-Jährige hatte sich wegen Differenzen über die von der Notenbank im Kampf gegen die Folgen der globalen Finanzkrise eingeführten Geldschwemme 2011 aus dem Führungsgremium zurückgezogen. Warshs Vorliebe für eine eher straffe Geldpolitik dürfte bei Trump jedoch nicht gut ankommen, da er ein erklärter Anhänger niedriger Zinsen ist.

Der Präsident hatte sich zuletzt nicht in die Karten blicken lassen und gesagt, er möge alle fünf Kandidaten für den Chefposten. Darunter ist auch sein Wirtschaftsberater Gary Cohn sowie der Ökonomie-Professor John Taylor. Alle habe bereits im Weißen Haus vorgesprochen. Als letzte Kandidatin hatte er am Donnerstag Yellen empfangen, deren Amtszeit Anfang Februar 2018 abläuft. Das Treffen sei “gut gelaufen”, sagte ein Insider. Dennoch gilt eine zweite vierjährige Amtszeit für Yellen als eher unwahrscheinlich. Trump hatte sie im Wahlkampf hart attackiert, bevor er ihre Leistung später in milderem Licht darstellte.

WÜRFEL SOLLEN BIS ANFANG NOVEMBER FALLEN

Trump neige zur Ernennung Powells, berichtete die Zeitung “Politico” am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf drei Regierungsinsider, die namentlich nicht genannt wurden.

“I see no reason why we should not be able to capture 50 percent of that market,” Enders said.

Speaking at a business event in Montreal, he also said the lightweight, carbon-composite jets, which seat 110-to-130 people, would create new jobs in Canada and the United States.

Europe’s largest planemaker on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1, a move expected to reduce costs while bolstering the plane’s sales and giving Canada’s Bombardier a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing Co (BA.N) and U.S. regulators.

“I see no reason why we should not be able to capture 50 percent of that market,” Enders said. “I think we will sell thousands.”

The jets, which cost $6 billion to develop, have won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months.

On Thursday, the head of a major U.S. airplane leasing company said the Airbus deal boosted confidence in the CSeries program, but was unlikely to drive a flurry of immediate sales.

The leasing executive said potential customers were likely to remain cautious until the trade dispute is closer to being resolved and the venture with Airbus closes in late 2018.

The CSeries faces a potentially crippling 300 percent duty on sales to U.S. customers due to a complaint from Boeing that the plane was unfairly subsidized and sold below cost in a 2016 deal with Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N).

The case will be decided by U.S. trade officials early next year, but Airbus has said any CSeries jets intended for the U.S. market would be built at its production facility in Alabama, potentially allowing the planes to avoid punitive duties.

Enders said the deal between Bombardier and Airbus should be supported by the U.S. government because it would create more American jobs.

“That’s what President (Donald) Trump wants. How can he be against it?” Enders said.

Some analysts have suggested that Airbus’s 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries could reverberate throughout the aerospace industry, triggering a competitive response from other planemakers, including Boeing itself.

Commercial aerospace has four main powers dominated by Airbus and Boeing, which share the market above 150 seats.

Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and Canada’s Bombardier compete in the market between 100 and 150 seats as well as in the market for smaller regional jets.

“Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,” Trump said in a tweet.

The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short “Camelot,” as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 when he died and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown that a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence that points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer.

Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof that Oswald acted in consort with anyone.

Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form.

The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that some of the more recent files could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations.

Saturday’s Washington Post said Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.","Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-jfk/trump-to-release-jfk-files-subject-to-further-information-idUSKBN1CQ0I4?il=0

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said.
Direct rule would be temporary and could range from dismissing the regional government to a softer approach of removing heads of specific departments.

It will be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Independence supporters were due to rally in the Catalan capital Barcelona on Saturday afternoon.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insists that Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who heads the wealthy northeastern region’s government, has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, thus justifying the imposition of central government control.

In an internal explanatory memorandum obtained by Reuters, the government said its objective was to restore the law, make sure the regional institutions were neutral, and to guarantee public services and economic activity as well as preserve the civil rights of all citizens.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said.

“This situation is unsustainable... and needs to be dealt with through the activation of the powers that the Article 155 of the constitution gives to the government,” it said.

Direct rule would be temporary and could range from dismissing the regional government to a softer approach of removing heads of specific departments.

The exact measures must be agreed and voted upon in Spain’s upper house, the Senate, and Rajoy wants the broadest consensus possible.

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

The government declined to confirm this, saying only that regional elections were likely and the details would be announced on Saturday.

“UNACCEPTABLE SECESSION ATTEMPT”

Rajoy received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

“Spain needs to face up to an unacceptable secession attempt on its national territory, which it will resolve through its legitimate democratic institutions,” said the king, a ceremonial figure who had criticised Catalan leaders earlier this month.

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Spain has the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and Catalonia accounts for a fifth of it.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution. Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down a an independence referendum on Oct. 1 that the government had declared illegal drew criticism from human rights groups.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Puigdemont stopped short of making a unilateral declaration of independence following the referendum, but on Thursday he threatened to do so unless the government agreed to a dialogue. He accused Madrid of “repression”.

A data da segunda convocação da assembleia de credores foi mantida em 27 de novembro, segundo a decisão de Viana.","SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O juiz encarregado pela recuperação judicial da Oi, Fernando Viana, decidiu nesta sexta-feira adiar a assembleia de credores da companhia da próxima segunda-feira para 6 de novembro, após pedido de bancos detentores de títulos da operadora.

É a segunda vez que a assembleia de credores da Oi é adiada. Originalmente, a reunião que decidirá sobre a aceitação de um plano de recuperação preparado pela companhia estava marcada para ocorrer em 9 de outubro, mas no fim de setembro Viana aceitou pedido da Oi para adiamento.

O adiamento ocorre em meio a negociações da companhia com o governo federal em torno da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da operadora junto à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel).

Mais cedo, o presidente-executivo da Oi, Marco Schroeder, reuniu-se com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, junto com outros executivos do setor de telecomunicações como o presidente da Telefônica Brasil, Eduardo Navarro.

Após o encontro, Schroeder comentou a jornalistas que a Oi estava preparada para realizar a assembleia de credores na segunda-feira, mas que a empresa poderia aproveitar um adiamento para conseguir mais apoio para o plano de recuperação apresentado em 11 de outubro.

No plano, a Oi propôs limite de 25 por cento à conversão de títulos de dívida em ações, bem abaixo dos 88 por cento pretendidos por grandes detentores de títulos da companhia. A proposta da empresa implica em um abatimento da dívida da ordem de 73 por cento, segundo análise do Itaú BBA.

Apesar dos detentores de bônus condenarem a oferta da Oi, eles também estão tentando evitar o colapso da companhia a todo o custo, segundo disseram duas fontes com conhecimento do assunto.

Os ativos da Oi são avaliados em 40,8 bilhões de reais, segundo o auditor independente Ernest & Young. Esse valor pode cair para 17,9 bilhões ou menos do que 30 por cento do valor da dívida sob renegociação no caso de uma venda forçada da operadora, segundo o auditor.

Como classe de credores, os detentores de bônus da Oi estão em termos de prioridade atrás dos funcionários da empresa e do BNDES e por isso podem perder mais no caso de uma liquidação da operadora do que se aceitarem o plano de recuperação proposto pela Oi, disseram as fontes.

“Os peticionários vêm a juízo requerer o adiamento do conclave, alegando ser prematuro e afirmando ainda pretenderem evoluir nas negociações para construção de alternativas viáveis...tal adiamento deverá ser por apenas 15 dias, tempo que considero razoável para a conclusão das negociações”, afirmou Viana na decisão.

Também após o encontro de Meirelles com os executivos nesta sexta-feira, a Anatel decidiu antecipar das 11h para às 8h de segunda-feira uma reunião na qual poderá decidir se aceita trocar multas devidas pela Oi em obrigações de investimento pela operadora. Na quinta-feira, fonte com conhecimento do assunto afirmou à Reuters que o valor das multas a ser discutido pela Anatel na segunda-feira é de 5 bilhões de reais.

15 MESES

A Oi entrou com pedido de recuperação judicial em junho do ano passado e até agora acionistas e detentores de títulos da empresa não chegaram a um acordo sobre a reestruturação da companhia, que declarou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais devidos a 55 mil credores.

Nesta sexta-feira, a Oi divulgou que encerrou programa de acordo com credores com dívidas da empresa de até 50 mil reais. A empresa conseguiu acertar 25 mil acordos de um total de 53 mil credores que têm a receber até 50 mil reais. Segundo a operadora, o volume de dívida acertada no programa foi de 410 milhões de reais.

A data da segunda convocação da assembleia de credores foi mantida em 27 de novembro, segundo a decisão de Viana.

Na decisão, o juiz afirmou que a realização da assembleia 15 meses depois da aprovação do pedido de recuperação judicial da Oi, além do prazo máximo previsto em lei de 5 meses, está “em consonância com a realidade forense”.

“Se considerarmos a magnitude deste processo, nunca antes vista, em termos de números de credores, valor da dívida, temas inéditos e de profunda complexidade, a assembleia será realizada em tempo que considero satisfatório”, escreveu Viana em sua decisão.

O juiz disse que não pretendia adiar novamente a assembleia, mas diante dos pedidos de “credores extremamente relevantes...não vejo como não autorizar o adiamento”.

Entre os bancos que pediram a postergação da reunião estão Banco do Brasil, que aparece como credor de 3,9 bilhões de reais da Oi, e Caixa Econômica Federal, com créditos de cerca de 1,9 bilhão de reais.

Para a assembleia de segunda-feira, a Oi esperava presença de até 5 mil pessoas ao anfiteatro do pavilhão 6 do centro de convenções Riocentro, que tem capacidade para 6 mil pessoas. A equipe organizadora do evento envolvia cerca de 1.000 pessoas.",Justiça do RJ adia assembleia de credores da Oi para 6 de novembro,https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idBRKBN1CP2UB-OBRIN

Cette décision concerne l‘article autorisant des organisations syndicales ayant obtenu au moins 30% des voix aux élections professionnelles à soumettre aux salariés des accords d‘entreprise par référendum, lorsqu‘un accord n‘est pas conclu avec les organisations syndicales majoritaires.

Ce dispositif ne s‘appliquait qu‘à certains thèmes du Code du travail, comme la durée du travail, les repos et les congés. La loi prévoyait un élargissement du protocole à tous les domaines en 2019.

Dans ses ordonnances, Emmanuel Macron a souhaité accélérer le dispositif pour qu‘il soit applicable à l‘ensemble des thèmes dès le 1er mai 2018.

Le Conseil Constitutionnel avait été saisi sur cette question par Force ouvrière.

Selon les Sages, la loi ne donne la possibilité de fixer les modalités d‘organisation du référendum qu‘aux organisations signataires de l‘accord et à l‘employeur.

Cette disposition, précisent-ils, crée une “différence de traitement” entre les organisations signataires et non signataires qui “ne repose ni sur une différence de situation ni sur un motif d‘intérêt général en rapport direct avec l‘objet de la loi.”

“LA VOIE DU CONTOURNEMENT”

Cette décision ne s‘applique pas aux ordonnances car ces dernières mettent en place un nouveau cadre légal.

La CGT, qui a déposé le 17 octobre des recours auprès du Conseil d‘Etat contre la réforme d‘Emmanuel Macron, notamment au sujet de ce référendum, est confiante.

“Le référendum, c‘est la voie du contournement des organisations syndicales”, a dit à Reuters le secrétaire confédéral de la CGT, Fabrice Angéï. “On voit mal comment des mesures déclarées non constitutionnelles dans la loi El Khomri ne le seraient pas dans les ordonnances”.

La CGT a également déposé des recours, notamment contre ce qu‘elle appelle l’“inversion de la hiérarchie des normes”, soit la primauté des accords d‘entreprise sur les accords de branche dans certains domaines.

“Pour nous, on considère que ces lois qui réforment le droit du travail sont illégitimes. Ça renforce notre volonté de mener le combat”.

Le Conseil Constitutionnel a en revanche déclaré “conforme à la Constitution” une mesure de la loi El Khomri permettant de licencier un salarié si celui-ci refuse un accord d‘entreprise qui se substitue à son contrat de travail.

Cette disposition concernait les accords visant la préservation ou le développement de l’emploi et pouvait toucher à la rémunération et à la durée du temps de travail. Il n‘était toutefois pas possible de diminuer la rémunération mensuelle du salarié.

Cette mesure a été reprise dans les ordonnances et s‘élargira au thème de la mobilité professionnelle ou géographique interne à l‘entreprise. Elle ne protège toutefois pas contre une baisse de la rémunération.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada’s banking regulator, said this week it will introduce a stress test on all uninsured mortgages to test borrowers’ ability to pay back their debt if interest rates rise.

That announcement has sparked concerns that borrowers rejected by banks could turn to unscrupulous private lenders that charge sky-high rates.

“Right now, the level of activity (by unregulated lenders) is relatively low, but we’ve created an incentive for it to be higher,” Evan Siddall, chief executive of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, said in an interview with Reuters ahead of a speech in New York.

“To the extent that we continue to shrink the space, then riskier loans just move outside of our purview and we need to think about what that means,” he said.

Siddall said the CMHC was researching how much of Canada’s C$1.4 trillion mortgage market was being served by unregulated lenders and investigating whether their activity posed a systemic threat to the broader market.

“There are two factors involved - one is the level of activity and the other is the risk of contagion,” he said. “The first thing we do is just watch. We can move pretty quickly but we’re in the middle of watching right now.”

Siddall said his main concern about the country’s housing markets related to supply issues in Toronto and Vancouver, citing a number of factors including restrictions on open land around Toronto, the slow pace of regulatory approvals, and developers’ speculatively owning land without building on it.

“All those factors together are a problem,” he said, adding that Canada’s forthcoming National Housing Strategy will look to address them.

Siddall echoed comments earlier this week by Canada’s top banking regulator that sufficient action had been taken to tighten mortgage lending standards at federally regulated lenders.

Canadian authorities have introduced a range of measures over the past 18 months intended to cool housing markets, including slapping special taxes on foreign buyers in Toronto and Vancouver and adopting tougher tests on borrowers’ ability to meet repayments.

”Do I think we need further measures in the federally regulated space? No, I actually don‘t. Not for now,“ Siddall said. ”The risk in that space has gone down. We’ve done our job.

“Now we’re looking at the result of the consequence of moving that out of the federally regulated space and should we, can we do something about it,” he added.

Siddall also said the CMHC was examining if self-employed workers and new immigrants were being discriminated against as a result of the new rules.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

At least six provincial governments in Canada, including those of Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba, have said they are reviewing bail practices.

The measure is one of several being considered for refugees, the sources said.

The administration also may expand the use of intensive security checks by multiple federal agencies, called “security advisory opinions” (SAO) to apply to women from countries designated as high-risk by the U.S. government. Currently there are usually only mandatory SAOs, as they are called, for men from those countries, the sources said.

The administration is also considering expanding the categories of refugees required to be fingerprinted, the sources said.

The proposals, if implemented, could significantly slow down refugee admissions and leave refugees who thought they were headed to the United States in perilous situations abroad, say refugee advocates and former officials.

David Lapan, a spokesman from the Department of Homeland Security said he could not comment on specific proposals that are still in the review process.

A State Department official also declined to comment while the review is underway and a White House spokeswoman said they have no announcements at this time.

Republican President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions and quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries that were challenged in court.

A 120-day temporary ban on refugees, put in place to study current procedures, expires on Oct. 24.

The sources, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the plans before they are announced, said the new measures could be announced at the end of the temporary ban.

Trump has said “extreme vetting” of refugees and immigrants and visitors is needed to prevent terrorist attacks.

The administration could pause the visa issuing process for “following-to-join” spouses and children of refugees who have already made it to the United States, known as V93 cases, the sources said. In 2015, just 3 percent of the nearly 70,000 refugee arrivals were those types of beneficiaries, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Reports on the type of vetting measures being considered for our refugee resettlement program are disturbing,” said Hans Van de Weerd, the Vice President of U.S. Programs at the International Rescue Committee.

They amount “to a desertion of victims of war and heinous persecution, who have done everything asked of them as they prepare to arrive to the US,” he said.

Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States in a process that can take 18-24 months.

“When you put in additional security checks you can basically halt the system,” said Robert Carey, the former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.

“Every check is only good for a finite period of time and they expire and the whole process has to start all over again,” he said, adding that the level of scrutiny is higher for refugees than most any other visa applicant to the United States.

Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by Obama. The 2018 level has been set at 45,000, the lowest number in decades.",Trump administration considers pausing U.S. refugee family reunification program,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-refugees/trump-administration-considers-pausing-u-s-refugee-family-reunification-program-idUSKBN1CP2U4?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Déterminé à rompre avec sa surexposition militaire au Sahel, Paris s‘active sur deux fronts avec l‘objectif d‘un désengagement à long terme des 4.000 hommes de l‘opération Barkhane : le front sécuritaire avec la mise sur les rails de la force du “G5 Sahel” (Mali, Mauritanie, Burkina Faso, Niger, Tchad) et le versant politique avec l‘application des accords de paix et de réconciliation d‘Alger de 2015 au Mali.

En déplacement à Washington, où elle a rencontré le secrétaire d‘Etat à la Défense James Mattis, la ministre française des Armées a plaidé sans détour pour un appui américain, alors que Donald Trump a pris ses distances avec l‘Onu et est confronté à une controverse sur la mort de quatre soldats américains dans une embuscade au Niger le 4 octobre.

Faisant valoir “une amitié du coeur et de l‘esprit” entre les deux pays, elle a assuré que la France resterait “un allié sérieux, capable et engagé”. Non sans réciproque.

En Afrique, a-t-elle expliqué lors d‘une intervention en anglais au Centre d‘études stratégiques et internationales (CSIS), “les groupes terroristes armés sont sous pression.”

“Mais il faut faire beaucoup plus. Nous ne pouvons et ne voulons pas être la garde prétorienne de pays africains souverains. Il faut les rendre capables de vaincre le terrorisme par eux-mêmes. C‘est la vocation de la force du G5 Sahel”, a déclaré Florence Parly.

UN BUDGET QUI RESTE À BOUCLER

“Elle va entamer ses premières opérations bientôt. Elle a besoin de soutien. L‘Onu veut apporter son appui. J‘espère que chacun sera convaincu de la nécessité d‘un solide appui de l‘Onu. Je serais heureuse que vous passiez le message dans les bureaux de Washington”, a-t-elle lancé en usant de l‘expression “Beltway”, une métaphore américaine qui désigne le gouvernement fédéral.

La force du G5 Sahel, dont le coût est évalué à 423 millions d’euros, comptera à terme 5.000 hommes. Les premières opérations devraient être lancées fin octobre, selon une source diplomatique française.

La France souhaiterait que la coalition armée, dont les pays participants pourront exercer un droit de suite de 50 kilomètres au-delà de leurs frontières, soit pleinement opérationnelle en mars-avril 2018.

Seul le quart du budget a pour l‘heure été réuni, selon l‘Onu, mais la France estime que la mise en oeuvre sans délai de la “capacité initiale” de la force aura un effet d‘entraînement.

L‘Union européenne s‘est d‘ores et déjà engagée à débloquer 50 millions d‘euros, la France huit millions d‘euros d‘ici à la fin de l‘année. Une conférence des donateurs est prévue en décembre.

La force conjointe n‘est pas sous mandat de l‘Onu en raison notamment des réticences américaines quant aux obligations financières qu‘aurait impliquées un tel cadre juridique.

Alphabet said the “Project Loon” balloon project would deliver limited internet connectivity to LTE enabled phones in the hardest-hit areas of Puerto Rico.

The island’s wireless and broadband communications networks were devastated after Hurricane Maria made landfall last month.

This month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved Alphabet’s application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico using up to 30 balloons. The company said Friday it does not expect to use that many since each balloon can provide internet service to an area of roughly 5,000 square kilometers, or 1,930 square miles. Puerto Rico’s area is 3,515 square miles.

The company has a handful of balloons in the area and more are on the way, spokeswoman Libby Leahy said.

Since Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. As of Friday, 68 percent of cell sites remained out of service, the FCC said.

Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to support carriers as they restored “limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said this month he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force focused on communications problems in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Alphabet said this was “the first time we have used our new machine learning powered algorithms to keep balloons clustered over Puerto Rico, so we’re still learning how best to do this. As we get more familiar with the constantly shifting winds in this region, we hope to keep the balloons over areas where connectivity is needed for as long as possible.”

Alphabet said it will continue the project as long as it can usefully do so. “Project Loon is still an experimental technology and we’re not quite sure how well it will work.”

In 2016, Project Loon delivered service to tens of thousands of people in flood-damaged parts of Peru in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica.

While the deadly storms in August and September slammed insurers who are now on the hook for billions of dollars in damaged property, many retailers, manufacturers and banks are also feeling the pain.

Over half of S&P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results in recent weeks, including Harley-Davidson (HOG.N), Delta Airlines and Costco (COST.O), have said on conference calls with investors that the storms harmed their businesses to some degree, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis.

“We estimate the impact of the hurricanes accounted for approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of Harley-Davidson’s retail sales decline during the quarter,” the motorcycle maker’s Chief Financial Officer, John Olin, told investors on Tuesday after reporting a decline in quarterly profit per share.

The hurricanes were part of the worst Atlantic hurricane season in over a decade, destroying or damaging homes, businesses and public infrastructure, killing over 200 people and paralyzing normal economic activity.

Senior executives of least 48 S&P 500 companies have told investors on quarterly conference calls that their businesses had been negatively affected by the storms.

At least 12 companies, including U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), also said their businesses were hurt by a September earthquake that killed 369 people in Mexico, a major market for U.S. firms.

American International Group (AIG.N) has estimated pretax losses of about $1 billion each from Harvey and Irma, up to $700 million from Maria and additional catastrophe losses, including Mexico’s earthquake, of about $150 million.

Travelers Cos Inc said on Thursday it recorded $700 million in catastrophe losses from the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, although its quarterly profit fell less than Wall Street feared.

S&P 500 companies on average are expected to have increased their non-GAAP earnings per share by 4.2 percent in the third quarter, the slowest growth in a year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding insurers, which are expected to have suffered a 63.3-percent decline in quarterly profits, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.9 percent.

The lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hobbled activity at factories in September and blunted a rebound in U.S. industrial production, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday

Still, the storms have not stopped the stock market’s record advance. Up 15 percent in 2017, the benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 18 times expected earnings, a multiple not seen since 2002, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

The S&P 500 property and casualty index .SPLRCINPC on Friday hit a record high, more than recovering from a selloff that coincided with the Harvey’s destruction. Many investors believe that insurers will raise premiums to make up for losses, and that those higher premiums will become permanent.

Dover (DOV.N) Chief Executive Robert Livingston said overtime and other related expenses to get back up to speed had cost the manufacturing company as much as 2 cents per share in the quarter after Harvey forced it to close its Texas factories for four or five days.

Hand tool maker Snap-On (SNA.N) said the storms cost it about $8 million in sales in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.

“Timing of both further disruption and rebuilding are unclear,” Snap-On Chief Executive Nicholas Pinchuk told analysts on Thursday.

Waiving late fees and increasing reserves for customer credit cost PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) about 1 cent per share in the past quarter, leaving its non-GAAP EPS at 46 cents.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) on Friday said it had to suspend operations along the Gulf Coast due to the hurricanes and in Mexico because of the earthquake.

Some companies, including Constellation Brands (STZ.N), said the hurricanes had only a minor negative on their results. For others, the storms will mean new business.

With 600,000 homes in Texas and Florida in need of re-roofing, shares in building materials firms USG Corp (USG.N), Owens Corning (OC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) have jumped between 17 percent and 30 percent since just before Harvey struck Texas.

Home Depot (HD.N) has surged 9 percent since the end of August on bets that homeowners repairing damage will spend more at its stores.

“They were hurricanes of a massive size that caused significant disruption to labor forces and spending,” said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “But it’s a pendulum, early on it has an impact, but as the rebuild gets going and there’s an inventory ramp-up, I think it swings back the other way.”",Recent hurricanes take toll on quarterly earnings,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/recent-hurricanes-take-toll-on-quarterly-earnings-idUSKBN1CP2GE?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

The 2017 deficit increased to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product. The previous fiscal year deficit was $586 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3.2 percent.

The latest fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, straddled the presidencies of Barack Obama, a Democrat, and Donald Trump, a Republican.

Accounting for calendar adjustments, the 2017 fiscal year deficit was $644 billion compared with $546 billion the prior year.

Fiscal 2017 revenues increased 1 percent to $3.315 trillion, while spending rose 3 percent to $3.981 trillion.

Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has sought to overhaul the U.S. tax code with precise details currently being worked on in Congress.

The Republican tax plan currently calls for as much as $6 trillion in tax cuts, which would sharply reduce government revenues.

It has prompted criticism that it favors tax breaks for business and the wealthy and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. The administration contends tax cuts will pay for themselves by boosting economic growth.

In addition to the annual deficit, the national debt - the accumulation of past deficits and interest due to lenders to the Treasury - now exceeds $20 trillion.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said the ever-rising debt levels are unsustainable as the government pays for the medical and retirement costs of the aging Baby Boomer generation.

For September, the U.S. government recorded an $8 billion surplus, a 76 percent drop from the same month last year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury reporting a $6 billion surplus last month.

When accounting for calendar adjustments, the surplus last month was $61 billion compared with an adjusted surplus of $73 billion the prior year.

The match was a dead rubber after New Zealand beat Australia twice in the Rugby Championship but it looked anything but that as the two sides slugged it out on a surface made greasy by persistent rain.

Australia put the world champions under a lot of pressure and scored three tries to the two of their opponents before defending desperately in the final minutes as the All Blacks threatened a late winning try.

“Overwhelming sense of satisfaction,” Australia captain Michael Hooper said.

“We didn’t win any comps tonight but it goes a long way to building confidence in this team.”

Tries from wingers Reece Hodge and Marika Koroibete as well as a 12th of the season from fullback Israel Folau had given the home side a 20-13 lead with 15 minutes of the match remaining.

Waisake Naholo had crossed in the first half for the New Zealanders and his fellow winger Rieko Ioane got their second in the 71st minute only for Damian McKenzie to miss the conversion.

A 55-metre Hodge penalty two minutes from time gave the Wallabies some breathing space but they have lost so many contests to their trans-Tasman Sea rivals at the death that it was with immense relief that they greeted the final whistle.

“Two quality teams really put it in,” New Zealand captain Kieran Read said. “The conditions didn’t allow the teams to play the way they wanted but plenty of grit and fight from both sides.”

Australia came into the match with a settled side and were confident of a good showing against a New Zealand team without World Rugby Players of the Year Beauden Barrett and Brodie Retallick.

The visitors had the better of the early exchanges, though, and were pressing for the opening score when Hodge snatched Lima Sopoaga’s pass out of the air and raced 80 metres for a Wallabies try in the seventh minute.

The All Blacks were soon back on level terms, however, after going through 10 phases on the Australian line and making room for Naholo to cross untouched on the right wing.

Sopoaga slotted two penalties to put New Zealand 13-7 ahead but the Wallabies hit back just before the break when Folau cut between Naholo and flanker Liam Squire to score.

Bernard Foley missed the conversion and a penalty at the start of the second half and it was not until the 57th minute that the home side went ahead on the back of their third try.

A penalty kicked to touch was followed by a catch-and-drive and, with the referee’s hand raised to indicate another All Blacks transgression, Australia moved the ball wide for Koroibete to touch down in the corner.

The All Blacks were never going to fold and a Sonny Bill Williams offload made space for Ioane to race down the touchline for the score that set up the late drama.

But could a repeat of “Black Monday” happen today? Modern trading technology, changes to the way stock exchanges operate and in the way investor funds are managed should make a repeat of the 1987 crash unlikely. Yet cautious traders refuse to rule it out.

“We have learned a lot from the mistakes of the past in terms of the reaction or over reaction,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O‘Neil Securities in New York.

On Monday Oct. 19, 1987, following large declines on Asian and European markets the previous week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent, for the biggest-ever single day decline in percentage terms by the blue-chip benchmark.

A decline of up to 20 percent in one day is possible today, but it would likely be a more orderly process, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

“We have the ability to shut things down for a period of time and reassess and try to ascertain what is the best way to get back in business and take a calmer look at things,” he said.

In response to the 1987 crash, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandated the creation of market-wide “circuit breakers” that call a temporary halt to trading after the Dow declines 10, 20 and 30 percent. Only one market-wide halt has been triggered since then, in 1997.

The circuit breakers were adjusted in 2012, lowering the thresholds needed to trigger a trading pause, with the Dow replaced by the S&P 500 stock index as the benchmark index.

Under current rules, if the broader S&P 500 index falls more than 7.0 percent before 3:25 p.m. New York time, trading is paused for 15 minutes. If the decline continues once trading resumes, and it is still before 3:25 p.m., the market is again paused at 13 percent. If the decline happens after 3:25 p.m, trading continues. But if the decline reaches 20 percent, trading is suspended for the session, regardless of the time of day.

“The industry has come an awfully long way from ‘87,” said Larry Tabb, who heads capital markets advisory firm TABB Group.

“The regulators have done a good job at implementing rules that help the markets ensure that they stay stable at a time when there is not a reason for them not to be stable.”

Many of the current measures aimed at taming market chaos were implemented after the May 2010 “flash crash,” when the Dow Jones Industrial Average careened nearly 1,000 points, around 9.0 percent, in a matter of minutes before mostly rebounding in a similarly short period.

The SEC approved a regulation in 2012 called “Limit-Up Limit-Down,” which prevents stocks from trading outside of a specific range based on recent prices, pausing trading in the stocks in question when prices run afoul of the bands.

The U.S. regulator and exchanges were forced to readjust the bands again, and the re-opening procedures for paused stocks, after a chaotic trading session in August 2015. Then, concerns over the health of the Chinese economy led to panic-selling and a dearth of buyers, spurring a record intra-day drop in the Dow.

On that day more than 1,250 trading halts in 455 individual stocks and exchange-traded funds spawned confusion that may have compounded the problem and led to some investors getting worse prices than they otherwise would have.

“Anything is possible,” said Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions Inc in New York. “With the advent of computer technology and the speed at which that technology has transformed the market, it is very possible.”

The safeguards in place would likely prevent another 1987- style crash from taking place, but with the Dow hitting a frothy 23,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday this week and the advent of high-speed automated trading, some traders are not so sure.

“Could it happen, something similar to that?” asked Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “Yeah. How will it pan out and what will be the outcome?

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell attends a conference at the Brookings Institution in Washington August 3, 2015. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

Under that scenario, either Powell or Taylor would take the reins from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in early February, and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when Stanley Fischer retired this month.

“That is something that is under consideration, but he hasn’t ruled out a number of options. He’ll have an announcement on that soon, in the coming days,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday.

Making Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising interest rates, the next Fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investors crave.

The addition of Taylor, who has backed an overhaul of the Fed and embraced a more rigid rule-oriented monetary policy, would be a feather in the cap of conservative Republicans who feel that monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen, who was named as Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and has led the central bank since February 2014.

“I think Powell might be the safer pick insofar as we know what we’re getting,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. “He’s a guy who obviously knows the Fed culture, how the (policy-setting) committee operates, so for some of those soft skills we know he would be effective.”

Powell has embraced the Yellen Fed’s monetary policy, keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wages higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lays out where interest rates ought to be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies that rates should be higher than they are now.

Yellen, speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Friday evening, mounted a strong defense of the tools the Fed has used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there was a risk of another crisis in which those “unconventional policies” may be needed again.

Yellen, who Trump has indicated could still be named to another term as Fed chair, was not asked about the Fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process.

“SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT”

Although Taylor is highly regarded within the Fed, his rule-based rate-setting position has spurred criticism that he would handcuff U.S. monetary policy.

Taylor pushed back at a meeting at the Boston Fed on Saturday, saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rules and did not want to tie the Fed’s hands or suggest that he was motivated by a distrust of policymakers.

“I think that’s completely incorrect,” he said. “I trust policymakers; (rules) are an effort to make policy better.”

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Some analysts suggest that fears that Taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the Fed, as some Republicans in Congress hope, are likely exaggerated.

“There is some scope for disappointment if people think putting Taylor in will just lead to mechanical-based policy,” Feroli said.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, speaking with reporters on Friday, seemed to agree.

“Even if you pick a rule, the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy,” she said. “But I do think being systematic, looking at the kinds of information we look at systematically over time, articulating our strategy for policy and being less discretionary is a good idea.”

At the same time, there are concerns that the combination of Powell and Taylor atop the world’s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to markets.

It is unclear whether Trump, who has criticized Yellen’s stewardship but also said on several occasions that he preferred rates to stay low, wants to dramatically alter the Fed’s direction.

Although he appears to be tilting to Powell and Taylor, in addition to Yellen the Republican president has interviewed his top economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh for the Fed chief position.","Trump considers Fed's Powell, economist Taylor to lead central bank",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-considers-feds-powell-economist-taylor-to-lead-central-bank-idUSKBN1CP29G?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

And who does not want freedom? Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should.

This story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told. In the United States, profit-hungry entrepreneurs are considered economic heroes. Even in more social democratic Europe, few politicians or commentators publicly doubt that the profit motive is almost always the best way to get things done.

As with all good myths, there is a thin tie to reality. The Soviet Union showed that economies stagnate without private enterprise. However, communist Russia is long gone. The pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening. By that measure, the story makes no sense, for four reasons.

First, markets and governments are not enemies. Markets are created and sustained by law and they thrive in well-governed societies. Complex modern economies cannot thrive without extensive regulation, and only governments can ensure that rules actually serve the common good.

Second, free markets sometimes subvert that common good. Take the pharmaceutical industry. It certainly produces many useful products, but the search for ever higher profits has led too many companies to focus on drugs which patients have to take for many years, rather than on antibiotics, which cure quickly and usually cheaply. In the United States, the industry’s blind dedication to profits has contributed to the wild over-prescription of opioid painkillers, helping to spawn a public health crisis.

Third, the private-public split is too simple. Many important institutions are neither one nor the other. In healthcare, education, scientific research and public infrastructure, much of the work may ultimately be under government control, but the leading organisations are mostly self-perpetuating and self-governing bodies. Mostly they serve the common good fairly well.

Finally, not-for-profit organisations have advantages over market players. Taxpayers and donors can fund projects which are too risky for private investors. Organisations with a public responsibility can work on socially useful projects which will never generate a big cash profit. These attributes give the government a much wider remit than just resolving market failures.

The free market myth will not go away on its own. It needs to be replaced. One potential substitute, the old narrative of the social market or social democracy, has lost its appeal. Perhaps voters should be grateful that the mixed economy has given them the highest level of prosperity and economic security ever seen. They are not thankful. On the contrary, they are increasingly tempted by populist narratives which condemn, among other things, stultifying government bureaucracy.

It is true that many government agencies have lost their way. All institutions tend to become rigid over time, but governments have an additional problem with morale. It’s hard to be imaginative and energetic when you’re frequently told that your only job is to pick up the messes left by the generally much more competent private sector.

The free-market answer to all problems is to shrink the government, but that would only make everything worse. The modern economy is a shared project which cannot work well without a vibrant non-private sector. If that sector is tired and beaten down, it needs to be encouraged and revived. University College London (UCL), itself a pretty vibrant non-private institution, has launched a project with exactly that goal. The Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is run by economist Mariana Mazzucato. Her book “The Entrepreneurial State”, a defence of the contributions and potential of government in the modern economy, inspires the IIPP’s motto: entrepreneurial societies need entrepreneurial states.

Mazzucato has gathered an impressive selection of big names in the non-private economy on the IIPP’s advisory board, from James Galbraith, who teaches about the economic role of government at the University of Texas, to Mike Bracken, who led the successful effort to create user-friendly websites for the British government.

But the names on the board – and the chat at last week’s launch party in London – also show how much work remains to be done. Almost all the people listening enthusiastically to the narrative of the central role of the non-private sector were already well ensconced in that part of the economy.

To get past preaching to the converted, the new story has to persuade politicians. There are few signs of that happening. The private sector is even less interested. Shareholder value is still the norm and government is still generally treated as either an enemy or a tool to be manipulated in the fight for competitive advantage.

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CP0SX

“Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,” Trump said in a tweet.

The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short “Camelot,” as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 when he died and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown that a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence that points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer.

Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof that Oswald acted in consort with anyone.

Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form.

The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that some of the more recent files could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations.

Saturday’s Washington Post said Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.","Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CQ0ID

The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies.

PayPal’s split from eBay in 2015 helped the company to capture multiple tailwinds as consumers increased their shift toward more convenient payment options than cash and checks – and grew increasingly impatient with the slow pace of technological change at traditional banks. The rise of e-commerce has helped, too. The biggest benefit, however, is the growth of smartphones.

Mobile transactions are growing about 50 percent annually, and now account for more than a third of volume, according to the company. PayPal’s Venmo service has even faster velocity. It’s a payments-cum-social media service that lets people send money to each other for free and post comments about what it’s for. Venmo handled $9 billion of payments last quarter, 93 percent more than the same period last year.

Trouble is, Schulman’s outfit gets precious little financial benefit for this service. Charging merchants to take Venmo payments, a service which launched this week, should change that. The risk is that the millennials who made the person-to-person feature so successful may balk at paying stores in the same manner.

Schulman’s second challenge is to ensure PayPal’s burgeoning lending business doesn’t overheat. The company’s loan portfolio now exceeds $6 billion, but the bigger it gets, the more investors will worry about rising defaults, which could drive down PayPal’s stock multiple. He also needs to make progress on his goal of increasing average usage of PayPal from two to three times a month toward his aspirational goal of two to three times a week.

Finally, Schulman needs to renegotiate the firm’s contract with eBay that expires in 2020. That accounted for 22 percent of revenue last year. There’s a lot of mutual dependence that ought to mean the odds of a split are low. But eBay has plenty of options. That Square could lose Starbucks and Costco could ditch American Express should convince Schulman to tread carefully.

He does, though, have momentum on his side. The future is his to lose.",Breakingviews - PayPal’s future rests on striking quadruple whammy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-hldg-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-paypals-future-rests-on-striking-quadruple-whammy-idUSKBN1CO33D

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

The country of 10.6 million has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but voters have grown tired of traditional political players, giving rise to Babis and other protest groups.

As many as nine parties had a chance of winning seats in the 200-member lower house, possibly complicating coalition-building.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government along with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s centre-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

Babis has taken a tough line against further European Union integration, accepting refugees and adoption of the euro, raising the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc.

His swipes at Brussels play well with euroskeptic Czechs and although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a part in campaigning, with most parties taking a similar tough stance.

However, Babis also praises EU membership and doesn’t share the relatively illiberal ideology seen in governments in Budapest and Warsaw.

Babis has maintained his popularity despite accusations of conflicts of interest related to his food, chemical and agriculture business holdings, which were placed in a trust earlier this year.

Concerns about Babis mainly centre on his strong managerial style and vast business and media influence that would be amplified by him becoming prime minister.

He also faces police charges that he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his empire, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing, saying the charges were a plot by opponents keen to push him out of politics.

“The more people organise campaigns against him the more it helps him among others,” said ANO voter Alena Chlostova.

COALITION BUILDING

Political analysts say the current coalition may be replicated with ANO at the helm, or ANO could turn to centre-right parties. Any deal may run up against demands by potential partners that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because of the fraud charges against him.

If talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO may form a cabinet with backing from the Communists and the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SDP) party whose voter support has grown.

Coalition talks are likely to take weeks. President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart.

Zeman, by custom, asks someone to lead talks before appointing a prime minister.

He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while battling police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SDP or the Communists.

Many voters, though, remain wary of Babis and his pledges to run the state with a businessman’s touch.

“His firm belongs to him but the state does not,” Milos Ruml, a Prague pensioner, said after voting for the Social Democrats.

In a speech at the opening of the Baghdad International Exhibition, Falih praised the cooperation between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which he said had helped to boost global oil prices.

Speaking later to reporters, he said Saudi Arabia and Iraq were in agreement on the need to “fully comply” with cutbacks in crude output agreed by OPEC, Russia and several other producers to push up prices.

“The market has improved a lot but has still some way to go,” he said, adding that the compliance of the 24 nations taking part in the cutbacks deal “exceeds 100 percent”.

Falih is the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad for several decades.

The two countries began taking steps towards detente in 2015 after 25 years of troubled relations starting with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Falih visited Iraq earlier this year.

“The best example of the importance of cooperation between our two countries is the improvement and stability trend seen in the oil market,” said Falih, to applause from the audience of Iraqi ministers, senior officials and businessmen.

Saudi Arabia and Iraq are the largest and second largest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The Iraqi oil ministry said in a statement Falih and his Iraqi counterpart, Jabar al-Luaibi, agreed to cooperate in implementing decisions by oil exporting countries to curb global supply in order to lift crude prices.

OPEC, Russia and other producers have reduced production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since the start of 2017, helping to boost oil prices. The cutbacks should continue until March 2018.","Saudi Arabia says oil market improving, agrees with Iraq on compliance with cutbacks",https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-iraq-oil-opec/saudi-arabia-says-oil-market-improving-agrees-with-iraq-on-compliance-with-cutbacks-idINKBN1CQ0HW?il=0

The government has been plagued all week about questions about the finance minister, Bill Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau would be forced to resign.

The focus has been a rare stumble for Trudeau’s government, which marked two years in office this month and has mostly maneuvered its way out of political trouble partly because of Trudeau’s personal popularity and the youthful momentum of the Liberals after 10 years of Conservative rule.

“They’re politically very astute in a whole bunch of areas but in issues management and parliamentary management they seem to be ham-fisted,” said Andrew Graham, professor at the school of policy studies at Queen’s University.

With Trudeau’s strong defense of Morneau, and the finance minister likely to unveil a smaller budget deficit in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update, Liberals have a temporary chance to refocus on good news.

“Economic conditions are a bedrock of whether people feel good or bad about how politicians are performing, and the economy is doing very well for most people,” said Abacus Data pollster Bruce Anderson.

Morneau said on Thursday he will put his assets in a blind trust and divest stock in a publicly traded family business. That comes after weeks of backlash over tax reform that has become a major obstacle for Trudeau’s government.

Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau’s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.

“The opposition has changed the focus from substance to ethics, and they won’t let that go that easily,” said Genevieve Tellier, a political professor at the University of Ottawa.

But Tellier said Trudeau’s decision to fill his cabinet with political rookies - including Morneau - rather than turning to the old Liberal guard, could limit the ability of the opposition to land many ethical punches.

Moreover, Morneau is respected by markets.

“I think the prime minister would be very cautious about changing his finance minister. ... (Morneau) presents a reassuring image, he doesn’t scare the markets,” Tellier said.

Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker put it more bluntly: “They really don’t have a choice but to tough it out and hope some event will transpire to distract the hyenas.”

The expected budget improvement in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update could also give Morneau the leeway to woo voters with more spending or debt reduction.

“The way the numbers are playing out, they are in a fairly favorable fiscal position,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

Morneau spokesman Dan Lauzon said the finance minister has no plans to change his strategy, and would keep focus on fiscal stimulus matters: “He is in this for the long run, and he won’t let distractions get in the way.”",Canada's Liberals look to economy to guide them past ethics scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CP2SE-OCATP

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

While the United States and its allies, and many people in China, believe Beijing should do more to rein in Pyongyang, the acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two.

China, Pyongyang’s sole major ally, has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. China accounts for more than 90 percent of world trade with the isolated country.

Guo Yezhou, a deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party’s international department, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that its exchanges, communication and dialogue with the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea were continuing.

“China and North Korea are neighbours and the two have a traditional friendly cooperative relationship,” Guo said.

Maintaining, developing and consolidating those ties not only accord with both sides’ interests, they also have “important meaning” for regional peace and stability, he added.

Exchanges between the two parties play an important role in developing overall China-North Korea relations, Guo said.

“Our party and the Workers’ Party of Korea have traditional friendly exchanges. When and at what level these exchanges happen depend on both sides need and both sides’ convenience,” he added, without elaborating.

Guo did not directly answer a question on when the department’s head, Song Tao, last met with any North Koreans.

The department is in charge of the party’s relations with foreign political parties, and has traditionally served as a conduit for Chinese diplomacy with North Korea.

The Workers’ Party of Korea on Wednesday congratulated China on its 19th Communist Party Congress despite the increasingly frayed relationships between the allies as China tightens sanctions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme.

Though China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions with their military drills.

The report could not be verified by Reuters. Two senior Turkish economy officials told Reuters that Turkey has not received any notice from the United States about such penalties, adding that U.S. regulators would normally inform the finance ministry’s financial crimes investigation board.

Turkish authorities are expected to issue a statement to issue the address the issue soon, the senior economy officials said.

The report comes as relations between Washington and Ankara have been strained by a series of diplomatic rows, prompting both countries to cut back issuing visas to each other’s citizens.

Haberturk did not name the six banks potentially facing the fines. One bank will face a penalty in excess of $5 billion, while the rest of the fines will be lower, it said.

U.S. officials will notify the banks of their penalties in the coming days and the banks are likely to be able to negotiate down the fines, Haberturk said.

U.S. authorities have hit global banks with billions of dollars in fines over violations of sanctions with Iran and other countries in recent years.

U.S. prosecutors last month charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran’s behalf.

President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and tantamount to an attack on the Turkish Republic.

The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year.

The country of 10.6 million has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but voters have grown tired of traditional political players, giving rise to Babis and other protest groups.

As many as nine parties had a chance of winning seats in the 200-member lower house, possibly complicating coalition-building.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government along with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s centre-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

Babis has taken a tough line against further European Union integration, accepting refugees and adoption of the euro, raising the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc.

His swipes at Brussels play well with euroskeptic Czechs and although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a part in campaigning, with most parties taking a similar tough stance.

However, Babis also praises EU membership and doesn’t share the relatively illiberal ideology seen in governments in Budapest and Warsaw.

Babis has maintained his popularity despite accusations of conflicts of interest related to his food, chemical and agriculture business holdings, which were placed in a trust earlier this year.

Concerns about Babis mainly centre on his strong managerial style and vast business and media influence that would be amplified by him becoming prime minister.

He also faces police charges that he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his empire, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing, saying the charges were a plot by opponents keen to push him out of politics.

“The more people organise campaigns against him the more it helps him among others,” said ANO voter Alena Chlostova.

COALITION BUILDING

Political analysts say the current coalition may be replicated with ANO at the helm, or ANO could turn to centre-right parties. Any deal may run up against demands by potential partners that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because of the fraud charges against him.

If talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO may form a cabinet with backing from the Communists and the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SDP) party whose voter support has grown.

Coalition talks are likely to take weeks. President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart.

Zeman, by custom, asks someone to lead talks before appointing a prime minister.

He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while battling police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SDP or the Communists.

Many voters, though, remain wary of Babis and his pledges to run the state with a businessman’s touch.

“His firm belongs to him but the state does not,” Milos Ruml, a Prague pensioner, said after voting for the Social Democrats.

They are reducing screen time, blocking Facebook and restricting access. But in Advait Chandan’s “Secret Superstar”, the problem is the solution.

Handout photo from the film “Secret Superstar”.

The internet offers heroine Insiya an escape route from a stifling life. The shadow of an abusive father and the domestic violence she sees every day loom over her. What keeps her going is her love for music - and her mother Najma. For all her submissive behaviour in front of her husband, Najma is a feisty woman - she fights for her daughter to have the freedom she herself never had. She lets Insiya go out with boys, pursue her music, and buys her a laptop with an internet connection.

Insiya might live in Vadodara, not one of India’s biggest cities, but the internet is a great leveller. She records a few videos on YouTube wearing a burqa - fearing her father will find out - and in the magical ways of Bollywood, turns into an internet sensation overnight. She has millions of page views, fan pages waiting for her posts, but at home, none of that matters because her father can wreak havoc at any time.

To his credit, director Chandan doesn’t shy away from depicting domestic violence. There are scenes that are difficult to watch and the reality of domestic abuse and its effects on children are portrayed with more sensitivity and realism than usual for a Bollywood film. The bond between Najma and Insiya is also one of the film’s highlights, as is the track between Insiya and Chintan (Tirth Sharma), her classmate who harbours a very obvious crush on her.

The problem with “Secret Superstar” is that it starts out with a good idea, but the film unravels because it wants to say too many things at once. Chandan seems determined that audiences should cry at every turn. Insiya and her journey to stardom are full of contrivances. Chandan isn’t bothered about authenticity or logic - he just wants to make sure those tears are flowing.

Aamir Khan appears as Shakti Kumarr, the rather obnoxious and self-obsessed music director who turns into an unlikely saviour for Insiya, but this film is not about him. It is about Insiya, and Zaira Wasim puts in an inspired performance that rides over the several bumps in the script. She shares a wonderful chemistry with Meher Vij, who plays Najma, and the two of them are the life of “Secret Superstar”. If only the film had shown as much restraint as they do, it might have been more deserving of “superstar” status.

Trump leaves Nov. 3 on a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January and one with a major priority: Preventing the standoff with North Korea from spiraling out of control.

Xi is immersed in a Communist Party Congress expected to culminate in him consolidating his control and potentially retaining power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

Trump believes that Xi should have even more leverage to work on the North Korea problem.

“The president’s view is you have even less of an excuse now,” said one official. “He’s not going to step lightly.”

Trump wants to gain some serious cooperation from China to persuade Pyongyang to either change its mind or help deprive it of so much resources that it has no choice but to alter its behavior, the official said.

Trump has heaped praise on Xi in recent weeks in hopes of gaining Chinese cooperation and has held back from major punitive trade measures.

In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he wants to “keep things very, very low key” with Xi until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress.

“I believe he’s got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We’ll see what happens. Now with that being said, we’re prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn’t believe,” Trump said in the interview, to air on Sunday.

Trump has traded bitter insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, using his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month to dismiss Kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission for his repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. He said if threatened, the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea.

Kim in recent weeks said the United States would face an “unimaginable strike” from North Korea if provoked.

“Pensamos em fazer uma captação no mercado internacional entre o final deste ano e o início de 2018”, disse o executivo à Reuters, às margens de evento sobre o Jockey Club de São Paulo, órgão do qual é presidente do conselho.

Steinbruch disse também ver uma melhora do cenário para a negociar a venda de ativos não essenciais para a CSN. A companhia chegou a ser alvo de especulações em meses anteriores de que estaria negociando se desfazer de alguns ativos para reduzir endividamento. Mas as negociações não foram adiante, diante de preços não atrativos oferecidos por potenciais compradores.

“O cenário recente melhorou e as negociações para vendas de ativos, também”, disse Steinbruch, sem dar mais detalhes.

No balanço auditado mais recente da companhia, o do terceiro trimestre de 2016, a dívida líquida consolidada da CSN era de 25,84 bilhões de reais e alavancagem medida pela relação dívida líquida/Ebitda estava em 7,4 vezes.

“Nossa meta é reduzir essa relação para 3,5 vezes; já era para termos conseguido fazer isto neste ano, mas devemos fazer em 2018”, disse o executivo.

Para Steinbruch, o melhor ambiente econômico no Brasil e no exterior, especialmente por causa da China, também deve ajudar a CSN a elevar preços do aço, com as receitas adicionais também potencialmente ajudando a reduzir a dívida.

British consumers’ discretionary spending is under pressure from rising inflation, subdued wage growth and ongoing uncertainty in the UK economy.

“Consumer confidence is in quite a challenged place ... It is not a market for the faint-hearted at the moment,” said Paula Nickolds, the company’s managing director. “But I think we are really well-placed and believe we are outperforming.”

Speaking at a media preview tour of John Lewis’ new Oxford location, the chain’s 49th store, Nickolds said official UK retail sales data for October would look “pretty grim”. UK retail sales volumes fell 0.8 percent in September, worse than economists expected.

“We believe we’re trading about a couple of (percentage) points higher than the market,” she said.

John Lewis said on Tuesday its sales rose 2.7 percent in the 11 weeks to Oct. 14, which analysts estimated equated to a like-for-like rise of about 1.5 percent.

John Lewis typically makes more than 40 percent of its annual profit in the five weeks until Christmas. Nickolds said the company was “really well set up” for that period.

Nickolds, a John Lewis veteran and the first woman to run the 152-year-old, employee-owned chain, succeeded Andy Street as managing director in January.

“In my 25 years in retail I’ve never seen the pace of change and the level of transformation and disruption that we’re experiencing at the moment,” she said.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

For the week, the Dow climbed 2 percent, the S&P gained 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 percent.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.49 percent, its biggest daily gain in a month, with the euro EUR= down 0.69 percent to $1.1768.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

A tentativa de Trump de revisar o código fiscal norte-americano eliminou um obstáculo crítico na quinta-feira quando o Senado aprovou uma medida orçamentária que irá permitir que republicanos busquem um pacote de cortes de impostos sem apoio do Partido Democrata.

Mas os republicanos, que controlam o Senado e a Câmara dos Deputados, ainda precisam produzir um projeto de lei de reforma tributária, conforme um prazo imposto pelo próprio partido para revisar o código fiscal norte-americano até o final do ano se aproxima.

Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

“All my career has been step by step, and, you know, it was quite a good thing to play in Zhuhai, something like preparing you to be here.
I made a semi-final, then final last year, so I think it can help me,” she told reporters on Saturday.
“We’ll see how it’s gonna go, but for sure I enjoyed my previous years in Zhuhai and this year in Singapore.
”So I‘m just staying myself, staying humble at practice, keep improving, keep working out.","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - All three debutants at the WTA Finals will be hoping to continue their stellar campaigns for at least another week by making a positive impact at the season-ending elite eight-woman event in Singapore.

The trio of newcomers are Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina, who won five WTA Tour events in 2017, Latvia’s French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, and Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia, who snared back-to-back tournaments in China to seal the final berth.

Svitolina’s appearance will feel like her graduation after playing in the last two WTA Elite Trophy tournaments in Zhuhai, China -- a 12-woman event for those who did not qualify for Singapore -- where she reached the final last year.

“All my career has been step by step, and, you know, it was quite a good thing to play in Zhuhai, something like preparing you to be here. I made a semi-final, then final last year, so I think it can help me,” she told reporters on Saturday.

“We’ll see how it’s gonna go, but for sure I enjoyed my previous years in Zhuhai and this year in Singapore. It’s of course a big achievement for me. I‘m very, very happy that I did it this year.”

Ostapenko’s stunning success at Roland Garros was the first title of her professional career and after following it up with a second tournament win in Seoul last month, the 20-year-old plans to continue her big-hitting tactics in Singapore.

“The French Open was a great tournament for me. I was always aggressive player and trying to hit the ball hard if I have a chance, and I think there, especially the court and everything, it fitted me. So I had a great result,” she said.

“Of course it’s going to be interesting matches (here), but the good thing is that I played against all the players in my group, so I kind of know how they play, and I‘m going to try to show my best.”

Garcia may have been the last player to qualify for Singapore following tournament triumphs in Wuhan and Beijing but the Frenchwoman will hope to continue enjoying success with the same formula that has led to an 11-match winning run.

“I don’t feel very different on court winning 11 matches straight than not. I mean, it feels good, for sure, to have so many wins like this behind me, but I know tennis can go very fast in one way or another,” she said.

”So I‘m just staying myself, staying humble at practice, keep improving, keep working out. I know all these matches were very hard. Some were very tight, and it could change from one way to another.

“So I just keep doing what I do the best and keep working out and stay focused.”

Svitolina and Garcia have been drawn together in the Red Group and open their campaigns with respective round-robin matches against Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki and Romanian world number one Simona Halep on Monday.

Pooling resources will allow Canal+ and TIM to drive a harder bargain in the content war with bigger rivals such as Netflix and Amazon.

It will also step up the convergence between TV content and distribution that is at the heart of the strategy pursued by Vivendi, which holds a 24 percent stake in TIM, to create a southern European media empire.

“The joint venture with Canal+ will in fact allow us to seize new opportunities for growth in a market undergoing continuous evolution through a commercial offer of fiber connectivity combined with premium video content,” TIM Chief Executive Amos Genish said in a statement.

TIM will have a 60 percent stake in the joint venture, with Vivendi’s Canal+ holding the remaining 40 percent. The venture’s board will have five members, three appointed by TIM and two by Canal+, while its chief executive will be chosen from among the TIM-appointed directors.

One source close to the matter told Reuters last week that Mediaset could become part of the joint venture at a later stage, also as a way to help to settle a dispute between the Italian broadcaster and Vivendi.

Vivendi and Mediaset have been at loggerheads since July last year, when Vivendi pulled out of an 800 million euro ($942 million) contract that would have given it full control of Mediaset’s pay-TV arm Premium, saying the unit’s business plan was unrealistic.

The French group also received the strongest sign yet that Rome intends to rein in Vivendi’s growing influence over former state phone monopoly TIM, announcing this week that it wants a say in TIM’s decisions regarding assets of national interest.

TIM said on Friday that, while it shared Rome’s worries about the protection of national security and defense interests, it would examine the government’s decisions and measures it is asked to implement in greater depth.

The company plans, “irrespective of any further evaluation in legal terms, to engage in all useful discussions with a spirit of full collaboration”, it added.",Telecom Italia and Vivendi's Canal+ agree content joint venture,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecomitalia-vivendi-canal/telecom-italia-and-vivendis-canal-agree-content-joint-venture-idUSKBN1CP2GY

The ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson marked the latest setback facing women and family members who accuse J&J of not adequately warning consumers about the cancer risks of its talc-based products.

The decision followed a jury’s decision in August to hit J&J with the largest verdict to date in the litigation, awarding California resident Eva Echeverria $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages.

Nelson on Friday reversed the jury verdict and granted J&J’s request for a new trial. Nelson said the August trial was underpinned by errors and insufficient evidence on both sides, culminating in excessive damages.

Mark Robinson, who represented the woman in her lawsuit, in a statement said he would file an appeal immediately.

“We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product,” he said.

J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the verdict, adding that it will continue to defend itself in additional trials.

The judge added that there also had been misconduct of the jury during the trial.

J&J said declarations by two jurors after the trial showed that three members of the 12-person jury who voted against finding the company liable were improperly excluded from determining damages.

J&J says it faces lawsuits by 4,800 plaintiffs nationally asserting talc-related claims. Many of those cases are in California, where Echeverria’s case was the first to go to trial, and in Missouri, where J&J has faced five trials.

The Missouri litigation led to four verdicts against J&J in which juries issued verdicts totaling $307 million. The company has only won one trial.

But the Missouri cases, which have largely been brought by out-of-state plaintiffs, have faced jurisdictional questions after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in June that limited where personal injury lawsuits could be filed.

The truck detonated next to a fuel tanker on Saturday, creating a huge fireball that incinerated multi-story buildings. Around half the dead were burned beyond recognition, said authorities.

The government conducted mass burials soon after the blast, in keeping with the Muslim practice of interring the dead as quickly as possible.

Religious leader Abdi Hayi said mourners had decided to conduct a symbolic funeral six days on, as it had not been possible to give so many of the victims a proper send-off with prayers at a mosque.

Segundo os procuradores da operação Lava Jato responsáveis pela ação, as investigações apontaram crimes de corrupção e lavagem de dinheiro em acordos da empreiteira com a Petroquímica Suape e com a Citepe, ligadas à Petroquisa, por meio de direcionamento de projetos para a Odebrecht mediante pagamento de vantagens indevidas.

Funcionários de alto escalão da Petrobras à época receberam pagamentos entre 2008 e 2014, pelo menos, totalizando o equivalente a mais de 32,5 milhões de reais somente no exterior, sendo 17,7 milhões de reais apenas para um dos investigados, segundo os investigadores.

“De acordo com as informações apuradas, as obras em questão foram direcionadas ao grupo Odebrecht. A estatal adotou modelo contratual que beneficiava a empreiteira e restringia a concorrência”, disse o MPF em comunicado sobre a nova fase da Lava Jato, acrescentando que as investigações contaram com depoimentos e documentos fornecidos por funcionários da Odebrecht nos acordos de colaboração e leniência firmados com o MPF.

Foram expedidos pela Justiça Federal de Curitiba quatro mandados de busca e apreensão, um mandado de condução coercitiva e um mandado de prisão temporária, e ainda três intimações com a imposição de outras medidas cautelares, como parte das investigações, de acordo com a Polícia Federal.

Segundo os investigadores, o pagamento de propina era efetuado pelo chamado setor de Operações Estruturadas da Odebrecht, responsável pelo pagamento das vantagens indevidas negociadas pela empreiteira em diversas frentes e descoberto pela operação Lava Jato no ano passado.

Em dezembro de 2016, a Odebrecht assinou um acordo de leniência com a Lava Jato, em que admitiu participação em práticas empresariais impróprias e aceitou pagar multa bilionária.

A operação também teve como alvo um ex-agente de banco suíço que realizava abertura e gestão de contas para então funcionários da Petrobras no banco Société Générale, onde foram movimentados milhões, disse o MPF. Parte dos recursos está bloqueada por autoridades suíças, acrescentaram os procuradores.

Além dos mandados decorrentes das novas investigações, a PF também cumpriu nesta sexta-feira mandado de prisão preventiva de Luis Carlos Moreira da Silva, já condenado pelo juiz Sergio Moro em outra ação penal da Lava Jato por ter recebido mais de 5 milhões de dólares em propina para contratação de uma empresa estrangeira para construir navios-sondas para a Petrobras.

Segundo o MPF, foi constatada a necessidade da prisão cautelar para assegurar que o ex-gerente da estatal “parasse de movimentar os recursos ocultados no exterior”, o que caracteriza a continuidade de crimes de lavagem de dinheiro e impossibilita a recuperação dos recursos.

“Com essa condenação se somam condenações de mais de 110 pessoas na Lava Jato, que já totalizam mais de 1700 anos de prisão. Então, é expressivo o montante de pena totalizado nesses três anos de operação”, disse o procurador da República Roberson Pozzobon em entrevista coletiva em Curitiba.

Procurada, a Petrobras não respondeu de imediato a um pedido de comentário da Reuters, enquanto a Odebrecht afirmou, em nota, que a “qualidade e a eficácia da colaboração da empresa vêm sendo confirmadas dia a dia”, e que a empresa continua colaborando com as investigações e está comprometida em combater e não tolerar mais qualquer forma de corrupção.

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spain-will-sack-catalan-government-call-regional-election-idUSKBN1CQ0AQ

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

During their phone conversation, Putin and Erdogan talked about joint efforts within the Astana process, including the creation of “de-escalation zones” in Syria, and further coordination towards resolving the Syria situation, the Kremlin said in a statement.

The Astana talks are brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. In mid-September, the three countries agreed to post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern Syria’s Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist militants.

Putin and Erdogan also said the agreements reached between Russia and Turkey in Ankara in late September were being successfully implemented, particularly in trade and economic relations.

“Overall, the conversation was business-like and constructive, directed at strengthening bilateral cooperation and interaction on the regional agenda,” the Kremlin said.

The Russian-Turkish trade relationship has been affected by their dispute over supplies of Turkish tomatoes to Russia which Moscow is yet to fully restore. This dispute has been adding risks to Russian grain trade with Turkey.

Russia, once the largest market for Turkish tomato producers, said this week it will allow purchases of 50,000 tonnes of Turkish tomatoes from only four Turkish producers from Dec. 1.

The announcement came several days after Turkey, the second largest buyer of Russian wheat, said it had imposed a requirement for additional approval of Russian agriculture supplies by the Turkish authorities.","Kremlin says Putin, Erdogan discuss Syria in phone call",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-russia-turkey/kremlin-says-putin-erdogan-discuss-syria-in-phone-call-idUSKBN1CQ0CV?il=0

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

He noted that Mugabe himself had travelled to Singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland.",Critics urge WHO to reverse 'wrong' choice of Mugabe as goodwill envoy,https://www.reuters.com/article/zimbabwe-mugabe-who/critics-urge-who-to-reverse-wrong-choice-of-mugabe-as-goodwill-envoy-idINKBN1CQ09A

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows. Reuters was first to report the news.

Amazon, Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

Intervistato da Repubblica tv, il ministro ha ricordato di aver inviato una lettera all‘Agcom per valutare se comunque un “modello più neutrale” possa corrispondere all‘interesse nazionale.

Alla domanda se sia favorevole a uno scorporo e alla quotazione della rete Telecom, il ministro ha risposto: “Sì sì, scorporata e in Borsa, non è necessario un intervento della Cdp... Che si separassero, entrassero in Borsa, così è il mercato a dare una valutazione... anche per Vivendi secondo me sarebbe meglio”.

Vivendi è il primo azionista di Telecom con circa il 24% e il governo ha deciso di esercitare la golden power, che potrebbe portare a una multa per il gruppo francese, per la mancata notifica del controllo su Tim.

“Tim è una grande azienda. Benissimo gli investitori internazionali, ma che ci trattino come una colonia se lo possono scordare”, ha concluso il ministro.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY, which are expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies, up 1.16 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

“It’s just a reaction to the thought that just maybe there might be something coming from Congress in the way of tax reform,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.

“Everybody had kind of given up hope, and after the comments over the last 24 hours, people are like, shoot, this may actually happen.”

Housing stocks .HGX also moved higher, up 0.70 percent, after data from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September.

But gains were curbed by declines in Celgene (CELG.O), off 10.76 percent after the company said it would abandon drug trials for a Crohn’s disease treatment.

For the week, the Dow climbed 2 percent, the S&P gained 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 percent.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.49 percent, its biggest daily gain in a month, with the euro EUR= down 0.69 percent to $1.1768.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.24 percent. MSCI's world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.09 percent, just shy of a record intraday high.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Adidas plans to use the factory - and another due to open soon in Atlanta, Georgia, to produce small batches designed for particular markets, and ultimately for individual consumers, in contrast to mass production runs ordered months in advance.

The idea is to respond faster to fashion trends and offer more customization. After London it plans shoe models inspired by Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

“It is an opportunity for us to disrupt with brand new technologies and bring that as fast as possible to consumers,” David Drury, director of development for footwear sourcing, told Reuters.

Adidas relies on more than one million workers in factories in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam, to produce about 600 million pairs of shoes and items of clothing and accessories per year.

But it is shifting some production closer to its major markets so it can deliver new styles quicker, and counter rising wages in Asia and hefty shipping costs.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).
This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.
The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.
“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.","ZURICH (Reuters) - While London’s sewers can get clogged with fatbergs made up of grease and diapers, it seems Switzerland’s waste system is flecked with silver and gold.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.

On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.

It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.

Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.

Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.

“As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.

Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.

But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.

“China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.

“As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.

Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.

A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year.

Kennedy International Airport, soon to be ringed with people coming from Puerto Rico on one-way tickets they never would have bought if not for the hurricane.

Moving at a canter, Emily Pagan and three colleagues from various New York state government agencies carted their fold-up table halfway down the Terminal 5 arrivals hall, setting it up by the carousel against a pillar.

They had volunteered to help orient the latest batch of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans that New York officials estimate will flee from the lingering devastation wrought a month ago by Hurricane Maria.

Many are expected to stay for months - or years - and some forever, in a largely reluctant wave of migration abetted by the spare mattresses and couches of the one million Puerto Ricans who already call the New York area home.

“A lot of them are saying they came to start a new life here because they lost everything,” Pagan said on her third day of greeting arrivals from the U.S. territory, where the power grid and water supply remain in disarray.

She tried to make the makeshift help desk look nice, centering a bowl of mints and squaring off the piles of leaflets about health and job resources.

A clipboard wedged into her elbow, Pagan hurried up to anyone who looked like they were waiting for relatives from the island, flipping between English and Spanish: “Hi, I‘m Emily, and I represent the state.”

Lissette Feliciano, who had driven down from Bridgeport, Connecticut, was among those grateful for a leaflet. Then bags began thudding onto the carousel and the automatic doors slid open to admit her 10-year-old nephew, sporting an Incredible Hulk T-shirt, alongside her youngest sister, Madeline Feliciano.

The nephew, Carlos, grinned as he was nuzzled by his aunt. It was their first time leaving the island. They never expected an airplane cabin would be so cold, he said, shivering.

“I‘m so-so,” his mother said, looking daunted.

Many Puerto Rican families are divided between those who prefer the island’s warmth and those who cannot understand why one would not move to the mainland’s hustle, as Lissette did seven years ago. But the storm put those disagreements on hold.

“Four days, no running water,” Madeline said of their hometown, Isabela. She did not know when they could return.

“They’ll stay with me until we can find something for her,” said Lissette, who had already found a bilingual school for Carlos.

They headed out, with Madeline and Carlos added to the tally on Pagan’s clipboard.

People gravitated toward Pagan and her purple top bearing the logo of New York’s Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, where she normally works as a compliance officer.

Born in Puerto Rico, Pagan, 42, listened to the accounts of each new arrival that made her beautiful native island seem unfamiliar: no water, no power, no green left on the tropical trees, no sort of place where a child or grandparent could thrive.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said between flights. But she tried to put on a welcoming face, slipping lollipops to children before moving on to the next family. She was yet to meet anyone without relatives to stay with, but younger adults seemed worried about finding jobs in a place where they had never planned to live.

Pagan cooed at the green eyes of a 7-year-old boy called Jayden with a Transformers backpack. “You speak English!” she said after the boy squirmed at the compliment. “You understand everything I say!”

Jayden’s father, Joemil Ramirez, was returning to New York City, where he was raised, for only three weeks, partly for its functional telephone network. Much of that time he expected to spend making calls trying to salvage his hurricane-ravaged restaurant in Rincon. But when he returned, he would be leaving behind Jayden, who would move in with the boy’s mother, from whom Ramirez was separated.

“There’s no place for him to be, no school,” Ramirez said. “It’s a situation I wouldn’t give to my own worst enemy.”

Genoveva Mendez, 48, watched the carousel from her wheelchair. She had been undergoing physical therapy three times a week following a stroke, but Maria halted that.

“We had to force her,” said her daughter, Jessenia Lalama. Mendez had refused the offer of a ticket to New York for weeks.

“I like the island, the island’s beautiful,” Mendez said, becoming tearful at the memory of her home before the hurricane.

When the hall emptied, a lone suitcase remained on the carousel as Pagan and her colleagues carried their table back to the corner, ready to greet the next day’s flights.","Plane by plane, New York greets Puerto Ricans displaced by hurricane",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-arrivals/feature-plane-by-plane-new-york-greets-puerto-ricans-displaced-by-hurricane-idINKBN1CQ0CM

Rosneft agreed on Thursday to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan’s main oil pipeline, boosting its investment in the autonomous region to $3.5 billion.

Rosneft will be investing in expanding the pipeline hoping to boost its capacity by a third to 950,000 barrels per day. That is the equivalent of about 1 percent of global supply.

The pipeline usually carries 600,000 bpd but volumes dropped to just over 200,000 bpd this week after Iraqi forces took over the region of Kirkuk.

The pipeline carries crude from Kirkuk and other fields in northern Iraqi to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.

Britons have not seen their debt costs rise since July 2007, shortly before the financial crisis which pushed the world’s fifth-biggest economy into its deepest recession in decades.

READ: Bank of England's Cunliffe says no clear case for rate hike soon

Now, eight years into the recovery, the BoE is saying it is likely to raise rates “in the coming months”. Investors mostly say that means as soon as Nov. 2, after its next policy meeting.

At one level, increasing Bank Rate to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent would represent only a reversal of last year’s emergency rate cut after the shock Brexit vote.

But many British businesses are worried it might have an outsized impact on the mindset of consumers.

“When I have been around the country, businesses have been asking a lot about the Bank of England,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.

“There is nervousness about the psychological impact of the first increase.”

READ: MPs voice worry over Bank of England's lack of diversity

The messaging challenge could be all the harder after several failed attempts in recent years by Governor Mark Carney and the BoE to signal when rates were likely to rise.

The guidance was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call Carney an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014, an epithet that has stuck.

In June, sterling fell and then rose as Carney made two speeches in eight days in which he seemed to change the emphasis of his message away from being in no hurry to consider a rate hike to saying one might become necessary.

It remains unclear if the BoE will pull the trigger in November. Most economists polled by Reuters last month said the time was not right for a hike, yet they still expected the BoE to press on.

British inflation is at a five-year high of 3 percent, above the BoE’s 2 percent target. But the economy is facing deep uncertainty about Britain’s departure from the European Union and is growing at half the pace of the euro zone.

NOT THAT BIG A DEAL?

Paul Fisher, a BoE rate-setter until 2014, said raising rates once by 25 basis points was “not that big a deal”.

“The key thing is what they say alongside it,” he said. “The Bank has been out of the game ... in terms of affecting ordinary people’s lives. It might suddenly become part of their consciousness again, especially the people who pay a mortgage.”

The BoE has said repeatedly that it expects to raise rates in a “limited and gradual” way, echoing the caution among many other central banks about the fragility of their economies.

Economists say it will probably continue to send that cautious message after its first move.

Financial markets expect the BoE to make only one 25-basis point rate hike in 2018 after a first increase next month.

It remains to be seen whether British consumers, the main drivers of the economy, see it that way too.

“On the occasions when the Bank has tried to signal quite clearly that they’re making just a one-off hike, households haven’t listened to the nuanced guidance,” Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.

“They see their mortgage rates going up and they prepare for more increases in that direction.”

When the BoE last raised rates in 2007, it said it had made no judgement on its next move. But the balance of households expecting a hike over the next 12 months stood at double the historical average a month later and consumer confidence fell, Tombs said.

BoE officials, like their peers around the world, have tried increasingly to find the best way to speak to borrowers.

In contrast to the days when central banks operated in near-secrecy and did not even publicly announce rate changes, Carney gives regular media interviews to speak directly to consumers and companies whose spending drives the economy.

But things do not always go to plan.

Carney has often had to challenge the idea that the BoE’s guidance on rates represents a rock-solid promise. That nuance is often lost in media reporting, BoE officials complain.

“It’s not always fully understood,” the central bank’s chief economist Andy Haldane told reporters after speaking at an event in London earlier this month. “When the data changes and the facts change, our view needs to evolve. That doesn’t mean the view was wrong before. The facts sometimes change.”

This time, however, even economists who think the BoE would be making a mistake by raising rates in November say it looks likely to happen, even if only to avoid another communications misfire that could further complicate its messaging task.

Jean Michel Six, chief economist in Europe for ratings agency Standard & Poor‘s, said the BoE ran the risk of losing credibility if it continued to hold off.

“It’s a bit of a vicious circle. Once you go too far in the direction of saying you may very well increase rates, you have to do it. Otherwise you lose your credibility,” Six said.

“It’s a game you can only play for some time.”",Bank of England's 'unreliable boyfriend' needs to get message right,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-analysis/bank-of-englands-unreliable-boyfriend-needs-to-get-message-right-idUKKBN1CP0F8

O plano, que ainda precisa de aprovação do Senado, busca resolver a pior crise política da Espanha em quatro décadas, mas corre o risco de forte reação por parte de apoiadores da independência, que pretendem protestar nas ruas.

Ao delinear a decisão do gabinete, o primeiro-ministro Mariano Rajoy afirmou que a economia calatã, responsável por um quinto da economia nacional, já estava em estado preocupante como resultado da pressão do governo regional por independência.

“Perguntaremos ao Senado, com o objetivo de proteger o interesse geral da nação, para autorizar o governo... a demitir o presidente catalão e seu governo”, disse Rajoy em coletiva à imprensa.

É a primeira vez desde o retorno da Espanha à democracia no final dos anos 1970 que o governo central evocou o direito constitucional de tomar controle da região e governá-la diretamente de Madri.

Isso incluirá controle total da polícia da região, das finanças e dos meios de comunicação públicos. Os poderes do Parlamento regional também serão reduzidos.

Rajoy afirmou que sua intenção era de não usar tais poderes especiais por mais de seis meses e que convocaria eleições regionais assim que a situação estivesse de volta ao “normal”.

“Nosso objetivo é restaurar a lei e a coabitação normal entre cidadãos, que se deteriorou muito, continuar com a recuperação econômica, que está sob ameaça hoje na Catalunha, e comemorar eleições em uma situação de normalidade”, disse Rajoy.

As medidas precisam agora aprovação do Senado da Espanha, onde a votação está marcada para 27 de outubro.

Rajoy insistiu que o líder catalão, Carles Puigdemont, que chefia o governo da região nordeste, rompeu com a lei diversas vezes ao pressionar pela independência, inclusive com o referendo de 1º de outubro, o qual o governo declarou ilegal.

“Os governantes da Catalunha não respeitaram nem a lei sob a qual é baseada nossa democracia nem o interesse geral”, disse o governo em um memorando obtido pela Reuters. “A situação é insustentável.”

O impulso de independência levou a Espanha à pior crise política desde a tentativa falha de golpe militar em 1981, muitos anos após o fim da ditadura de Francisco Franco. Encontrou forte oposição ao redor da Espanha, dividiu a própria Catalunha e aumentou a perspectiva de prolongados protestos nas ruas.

Também levou Madri a reduzir as estimativas de crescimento econômico para a quarta maior economia da zona do euro, levando centenas de empresas a retirarem suas sedes da Catalunha.

Acacia’s majority owner, Barrick Gold, said on Thursday it had agreed with Tanzania for Acacia to hand over the money and a 16 percent stake in three of its mines and to split the “economic benefits” from those operations].

The agreement appeared to be the first step towards a resolution of a months-long stand-off that began in March, when the government banned exports of unprocessed minerals. In July, Acacia was served with a $190 billion bill for unpaid taxes, penalties and interest.

But Acacia’s executives managers said on Friday that they had not been presented with any formal proposal and were seeking more clarity on the agreement.

“... The first comment I would make is that Barrick is equally aware of our balance sheet as we are,” said Acacia’s chief financial officer, Andrew Wray, on a call with analysts.

“We don’t have the ability to make an upfront $300 million payment,” he said, adding that a Barrick and government working group would need to come up with a solution.

Acacia shares traded in London tumbled 7 percent to 198 pence by 1218 GMT, partly erasing a 16 percent gain on Thursday after the agreement was announced. The shares have fallen over 60 percent since the disputes broke out.

Tanzania’s largest gold miner, Acacia has been hurt by the country’s sweeping changes in the industry. Those range from a ban on exports of unprocessed gold and copper to laws that increase state ownership of mines, based on the government’s belief that it is not getting a fair share of Tanzania’ mineral wealth.

As a result of the March export ban, Acacia reported on Friday that its core earnings, or EBITDA, fell 60 percent to $50 million in the third quarter. The company also cut spending by 33 percent and hopes to return to cash generation in early 2018.

Net cash in the third quarter slid 88 percent to $24 million from a year ago and its cash balance at the end of September was $95 million, down nearly 70 percent from a year earlier.

In an effort to stanch the flow of cash, Acacia shut underground operations at its Bulyanhulu mine, changed the mine plan at Buzwagi mine to produce more processed ore and bought put options on its gold.

Acacia, which was not directly involved in the talks with the government, said it would need to approve the deal with Barrick.

Acacia Chief Executive Brad Gordon said it was also agreed that a Tanzanian operating company would be formed and that a working group would start work to resolve Acacia’s $190 billion tax bill, the export ban and flesh out how the $300 million would be paid.

“It is still very early in the process. There is a long way to go before any proposal is made to Acacia,” Gordon said.

Acacia said gold production for the third quarter fell to 191,203 ounces, down 8.3 percent quarter on quarter, as it had reported on Oct. 12. Full-year production was maintained at 750,000 ounces, at a cost of $880 to 920 ounces.

Jefferies analysts said in a note that EBITDA came in below its estimates and consensus expectations, but investors would “focus on gaining more clarity following yesterday’s announcements regarding a potential solution to the Tanzanian export ban”.",Acacia says can't pay $300 million upfront that deal with Tanzania calls for,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CP0R5-OZABS

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

India hold a dominant record in bilateral ODI series at home, having lost just two out of 16 played since their defeat by Australia in 2009-10.

Last year, the Kiwis forced a decider on Indian soil but the hosts recorded a convincing 190-run victory in the final Visakhapatnam ODI to claim the series 3-2.

“India’s record is very good at home. They are a very hard team to beat. We know that, at home in particular, they are the strongest team in the world,” Williamson said.

“People talk a lot about adjusting to the conditions in India, and that’s is really important. We did that fairly well last time we were here and it would nice to do that better (this time).”",Kohli hails India's new spin duo ahead of NZ ODI series,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-odi-ind-nz-kohli/kohli-hails-indias-new-spin-duo-ahead-of-nz-odi-series-idINKBN1CQ0H6

The country of 10.6 million has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but voters have grown tired of traditional political players, giving rise to Babis and other protest groups.

As many as nine parties had a chance of winning seats in the 200-member lower house, possibly complicating coalition-building.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government along with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s centre-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

Babis has taken a tough line against further European Union integration, accepting refugees and adoption of the euro, raising the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc.

His swipes at Brussels play well with euroskeptic Czechs and although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a part in campaigning, with most parties taking a similar tough stance.

However, Babis also praises EU membership and doesn’t share the relatively illiberal ideology seen in governments in Budapest and Warsaw.

Babis has maintained his popularity despite accusations of conflicts of interest related to his food, chemical and agriculture business holdings, which were placed in a trust earlier this year.

Concerns about Babis mainly centre on his strong managerial style and vast business and media influence that would be amplified by him becoming prime minister.

He also faces police charges that he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his empire, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing, saying the charges were a plot by opponents keen to push him out of politics.

“The more people organise campaigns against him the more it helps him among others,” said ANO voter Alena Chlostova.

COALITION BUILDING

Political analysts say the current coalition may be replicated with ANO at the helm, or ANO could turn to centre-right parties. Any deal may run up against demands by potential partners that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because of the fraud charges against him.

If talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO may form a cabinet with backing from the Communists and the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SDP) party whose voter support has grown.

Coalition talks are likely to take weeks. President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart.

Zeman, by custom, asks someone to lead talks before appointing a prime minister.

He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while battling police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SDP or the Communists.

Many voters, though, remain wary of Babis and his pledges to run the state with a businessman’s touch.

“His firm belongs to him but the state does not,” Milos Ruml, a Prague pensioner, said after voting for the Social Democrats.

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/spain-will-sack-catalan-government-call-regional-election-idINKBN1CQ0AO?il=0

O governo tem falado em concluir todo o processo de privatização da elétrica federal até o final do primeiro semestre de 2018.","SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O governo federal vai prever no orçamento da União de 2018 uma arrecadação de 7,7 bilhões de reais com o processo de privatização da Eletrobras, disse nesta sexta-feira o ministro interino de Minas e Energia, Paulo Pedrosa, ao participar de debate sobre a estatal na Federação das Indústrias do Estado de São Paulo (Fiesp).

O dinheiro entrará para o Tesouro com o pagamento pela Eletrobras de um bônus em troca de contratos mais vantajosos para suas hidrelétricas. A estatal deverá obter o dinheiro para o pagamento com uma oferta de ações que reduzirá a União a uma fatia minoritária na companhia.

Os recursos de privatizações devem ajudar o governo federal a tentar cumprir suas metas orçamentárias.

Pedrosa disse ainda que os planos para a privatização preveem também limites à participação de investidores na Eletrobras.

“Estamos investindo (na ideia de privatização) para trazer resultado e criar uma corporação... com uma limitação, em que nenhum acionista tenha mais de 10 por cento do bloco de controle, uma empresa com lógica privada”, disse Pedrosa.

O diretor-geral da Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel), Romeu Rufino, também presente no debate, disse que para o órgão regulador é indiferente se uma empresa como a Eletrobras tem controle estatal ou privado, mas ressaltou que ineficiências da companhia nos últimos anos têm punido os consumidores com custos mais elevados.

Ele deu como exemplos o atraso na entrega de obras devido à crise financeira enfrentada pela empresa.

“O grupo Eletrobras assumiu compromissos que não conseguiu entregar, por várias dificuldades. Tanto no segmento de transmissão quanto no de geração, convivemos com atrasos que não foram indiferentes para o setor como um todo, principalmente para o consumidor. Afetou o consumidor de forma significativa... isso não pode continuar”, disse.

Ele também defendeu a venda das distribuidoras de eletricidade da Eletrobras como uma questão essencial para a própria sobrevivência dessas empresas, que são responsáveis pelo atendimento a Estados do Norte e Nordeste e enfrentam pesados e recorrentes prejuízos.

Mas o diretor ressaltou que o modelo previsto pelo governo para viabilizar a desestatização da Eletrobras, que prevê uma mudança nos contratos de hidrelétricas antigas da companhia, poderá impactar o consumidor, uma vez que as usinas poderão vender sua produção a preços maiores.

Essas hidrelétricas hoje entregam a energia às distribuidoras por preços muito baixos, em um chamado “regime de cotas”. O processo de mudança nos contratos desses empreendimentos tem sido chamado de “descotização”.

Rufino defendeu que o governo precisa ter cuidado nesse processo para evitar uma forte elevação das tarifas.

“A descotização, isoladamente, não vai na direção da modicidade tarifária. A privatização da Eletrobras, se tem um ganho de eficiência, então ela vai nesse sentido, sim. Uma coisa compensa a outra? Não sei.”

Para o ex-diretor da Aneel Edvaldo Santana, agora presidente da Abrace, associação que representa grandes indústrias, a Eletrobras nos últimos anos passou a assumir diversos custos que depois acabaram sendo repassado aos consumidores.

“Independentemente do problema ideológico, a privatização da Eletrobras é um problema de custo. Ela se tornou uma agregadora de custos... a privatização, com a descotização, aumenta a tarifa... mas os ganhos compensam tudo isso, não precisa fazer nenhuma conta, só de acabar com esse ciclo vicioso de aumento de custos”, afirmou ele, também presente na Fiesp.

Led by Janet Yellen since 2014, the Fed is about to allow its $4.5 trillion portfolio of securities to shrink, and in late 2015 it began raising interest rates from the low levels seen after the 2008 financial crisis. A new Fed chair who argues for tightening monetary policy more aggressively is seen putting economic growth at risk, along with corporate earnings, and the long stock market rally.

A faster rise in short-term interest rates would likely flatten the yield curve, narrowing the gap between short and long term debt yields, which could crimp bank profits and strengthen the U.S. dollar, hurting exporters’ sales.

U.S. President Donald Trump has selected a pool of five candidates from which to choose the next Fed chair: current Fed Chair Janet Yellen; Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn; former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh; current Fed Governor Jerome Powell, and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

Cohn and Powell are the two most likely to follow current Fed policy, while Taylor and Warsh are seen likely to push for raising interest rates at a faster clip and to argue for a quicker run-down in the bond portfolio accumulated after the 2008 crisis.

Most important to stock investors is the continuation of the so-called “Fed put”, or the expectation of easy monetary policy as stock prices fall that first came into prominence under former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan.

For years investors in stocks have assumed the Fed granted them a put option, effectively providing insurance against a market fall, by flooding money markets with cash and buying government bonds to keep interest rates low whenever economic growth slumped or geopolitical risks rose.

Under Bernanke, the Fed helped to navigate the economy out of the 2008 financial crisis until 2014 when he was succeeded by Yellen. During that time the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX rose nearly 40 percent. Since Yellen took over from him in February 2014, the index has gained a further 45 percent.

“I think in their hearts every modern Fed chair knows that the institution’s mandate has to include stock prices,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York.

President Trump has praised the record highs in U.S. stock prices, perhaps making it less likely that he would nominate someone who would deviate markedly from current Fed policy.

Following is a summary of possible markets reactions to the nomination of each name in Trump’s shortlist (in alphabetical order):

GARY COHN

A Cohn nomination would ”be met positively,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “The perception is that he is market friendly.”

Cohn is currently director of the White House National Economic Council and is a former president of investment bank Goldman Sachs.

“If (Cohn) were to reach that position I think the market would trade the dollar lower and you’d see a steepening of 5-30s in the U.S. yield curve, because he’d be viewed as having the biggest impact on inflation expectations moving forward,” said Kay Mirza, global head of FX trading at Goldman Sachs.

JEROME POWELL

A governor on the Federal Reserve board since 2012, Powell has yet to cast a dissenting vote against the Federal Open Market Committee’s decisions on monetary policy. His appointment would remove uncertainty and would likely see Fed policy continue little changed.

“Powell would follow very close to Yellen and would be a great choice for the market,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.

Importantly, Powell is seen as unafraid of reversing the current plan to wind down the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet if the economic or market outlook changed.

JOHN TAYLOR

Famous for a formulaic approach to monetary policy, including the so-called Taylor Rule, he is seen as likely to tighten monetary policy more quickly.

“Taylor would be a negative surprise for the stock market,” said Voya’s Zemsky. “Applying rules-based policy would bring closer the risk of a recession before the economic expansion plays out entirely.”

His nomination could also boost the U.S. dollar since by his own formula the Fed Funds rate, now at 1.25 percent, should be closer to 3.0 percent.

KEVIN WARSH

“If you are looking for something disruptive, put Kevin Warsh at the top of the Fed,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

Analysts do not think investors have priced in the probability of a Fed that raises interest rates more quickly and a Warsh appointment would likely trigger a spike in Treasury yields, a rise in the dollar and a fall in stocks.

Formerly Bernanke’s right-hand man on financial markets, Warsh quit the Fed in 2011 as he disagreed with the central bank’s second round of bond-buying and is seen unlikely to pursue a policy path of extraordinary measures if faced with another crisis.

”The balance sheet reduction program is the key policy tool for next year,“ said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street. ”If (stock) markets started to come off Warsh would be less inclined to change the path.”

JANET YELLEN

Yellen has followed her predecessor’s path of data-driven and market-aware monetary policy and she has been cautious about generating strong reactions from financial markets by ensuring policy changes have been well telegraphed ahead of time.

“Yellen... would be the most obviously market-friendly situation,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. “The markets understand how she works and there’s less guesswork.”

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

The report could not be verified by Reuters. Two senior Turkish economy officials told Reuters that Turkey has not received any notice from the United States about such penalties, adding that U.S. regulators would normally inform the finance ministry’s financial crimes investigation board.

Turkish authorities are expected to issue a statement to issue the address the issue soon, the senior economy officials said.

The report comes as relations between Washington and Ankara have been strained by a series of diplomatic rows, prompting both countries to cut back issuing visas to each other’s citizens.

Haberturk did not name the six banks potentially facing the fines. One bank will face a penalty in excess of $5 billion, while the rest of the fines will be lower, it said.

U.S. officials will notify the banks of their penalties in the coming days and the banks are likely to be able to negotiate down the fines, Haberturk said.

U.S. authorities have hit global banks with billions of dollars in fines over violations of sanctions with Iran and other countries in recent years.

U.S. prosecutors last month charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran’s behalf.

President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and tantamount to an attack on the Turkish Republic.

The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. Erdogan has said U.S. authorities had “ulterior motives” in charging Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty.",Turkish banks could face big U.S. fines over Iran: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CQ0IH-OCATP

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

China considers the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, to be a dangerous separatist. The Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland.

Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China, and fewer and fewer national leaders are willing to meet him, fearing the consequences of Chinese anger, though some have tried to placate Beijing by saying they are meeting him in a personal not official capacity.

Zhang Yijiong, who heads the Communist Party’s Tibet working group, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that there could be no excuses to meeting the Dalai Lama.

“Although some people say, the Dalai is a religious figure, our government didn’t put in an appearance, it was just individual officials, this is incorrect,” said Zhang, who is also a vice minister at the United Front Work Department, which has led failed talks with the Dalai Lama’s representatives.

“Officials, in their capacity as officials, attending all foreign-related activities represent their governments. So I hope governments around the world speak and act with caution and give full consideration their friendship with China and their respect for China’s sovereignty,” he added.

China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a “peaceful liberation” and has piled pressure on foreign governments to shun the Dalai Lama, using economic means to punish those who allow him in.

China strongly denies accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, saying its rule has brought prosperity to what was a remote and backward region, and that it fully respects the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people.

China also insists that Tibet in an integral part of its territory and has been for centuries.

Zhang, who worked in Tibet from 2006-2010 as a deputy Communist Party boss, said that Tibetan Buddhism was a special religion “born in our ancient China”.

Phil Schiller, Apple’s chief marketing officer, touted the animoji feature during the iPhone X launch event on Sept. 12, calling it a “great experience” for communicating with family and friends.

Emonster chief executive Enrique Bonansea launched an animated texting app in 2014 called Animoji and registered a trademark on the product name, according to the lawsuit.

Apple had full knowledge of Emonster’s app because it is available for download on Apple’s App Store, the lawsuit said.

“Apple decided to take the name and pretend to the world that ‘Animoji’ was original to Apple,” Emonster said in the complaint.

Emonster said it is seeking unspecified money damages and a court order blocking Apple from using the term while the lawsuit is pending.

Reuters avait rapporté la semaine passée que certains membres du département concurrence du Trésor américain doutaient que cette opération, rapprochant les troisième et quatrième opérateurs télécoms mobiles américains, puisse se faire en l‘état.

T-Mobile US, filiale de Deutsche Telekom, et Sprint, contrôlé par le groupe japonais Softbank, pensent annoncer leur fusion fin octobre ou début novembre et mettre surtout l‘accent sur les avantages qu‘elle comporterait pour le consommateur américain, en particulier dans la promotion de la future technologie 5G, ont expliqué les sources.

T-Mobile et Sprint se sont refusé à tout commentaire.

“Il vaut mieux pour Sprint et T-Mobile apprendre des régulateurs quelles sont leurs préoccupations puis voir comment il est possible d‘y répondre”, dit Craig Moffett, analyste de MoffettNathanson.

L‘entité née de la fusion représenterait plus de 130 millions d‘abonnés, se classant juste derrière Verizon Communications et AT&T.

Son chiffre d‘affaires dépasserait 70 milliards de dollars (58,50 milliards d‘euros) et les analystes estiment très élevé le potentiel de réduction des coûts.

John Hodulik, analyste d‘UBS, estime que la Commission fédérale des Communications (FCC) obligera sans doute les deux opérateurs à céder certaines fréquences car la nouvelle entité aurait le plus grand nombre de fréquences de moins de 300 MHz, devant Verizon et AT&T.

Disposer d‘un large spectre de fréquences est particulièrement important pour développer la 5G, surtout face à la concurrence des services à haut débit des câblo-opérateurs.

Les actionnaires de Sprint ne bénéficieront que d‘une prime modeste, voire inexistante, dans cette fusion, ce qui veut dire que Softbank et d‘autres actionnaires de Sprint auront autour de 40% de la nouvelle structure. Deutsche Telekom et les autres actionnaires de T-Mobile US auront le reste.

In a speech at the opening of the Baghdad International Exhibition, Falih said cooperation between Iraq and Saudi Arabia contributed to “the improvement and stability we are seeing in the oil market”.

Falih is the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad for decades. The two countries began taking steps towards detente in 2015 after 25 years of troubled relations starting with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Tension remained high after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which toppled Saddam Hussein. The American occupation of Iraq empowered political parties representing Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority, close to Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran.

Iraq is seeking economic benefits from the thaw with Riyadh while Saudi Arabia hopes closer ties would help rollback Iran’s influence in the region.

“The best example of the importance of cooperation between our two countries is the improvement and stability trend seen in the oil market,” said Falih, to applause from the audience of Iraqi ministers, senior officials and businessmen.

Falih and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir held talks earlier this year in Baghdad, paving the way for visits to Saudi Arabia by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and popular Shi‘ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Saudi Arabia and Iraq are respectively the biggest and second biggest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The Iraqi oil ministry said Falih and his Iraqi counterpart, Jabar al-Luaibi, agreed to cooperate in implementing decisions by oil exporting countries to curb global supply in order to lift crude prices.

OPEC, Russia and several other producers have reduced production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since the start of 2017, helping to boost oil prices. The cutbacks should continue until March 2018.

“The market has improved a lot but has still some way to go,” Falih told reporters, adding that the compliance of the 24 nations taking part in the cutbacks deal “exceeds 100 percent”.

Falih called for increased economic cooperation between the two countries at all levels, saying Saudi Arabia is implementing measures to facilitate the flow of goods and services between the two countries.

But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain’s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks.

EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into “phase two” of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc.

Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.

“I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December.

French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of “bluffing” by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.

“A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,” he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are.

May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties.

Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.

“What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,” she told a news conference before returning to Britain.

“Now there has to be detailed work on those commitments... we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line.”

NO MOVEMENT YET

The final text from the EU-27 read: “The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.”

Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period.

Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel.

Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers’ association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed “more than a hint of progress”.

All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on.

Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks.

That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules.

But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.

“The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group.

The chair of the summit Donald Tusk said there would need to be a more positive narrative to reach a Brexit deal in December - a sentiment echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

Verlander (2-0) twirled seven shutout innings to help carry the Astros into a decisive Game 7 at home on Saturday night. He allowed five hits and issued one walk while recording eight strikeouts, extending his streak of consecutive scoreless innings in elimination games to 24.

Despite allowing a single in each of his first three innings, Verlander was largely untested until the sixth. By then he held a three-run lead, courtesy of an Astros rally in the bottom of the fifth.

After Alex Bregman and Evan Gattis sandwiched a pair of walks around a Marwin Gonzalez groundout, catcher Brian McCann delivered a ground-rule double to right field off Yankees right-hander Luis Severino. Three batters later, Jose Altuve delivered an even bigger blow, chasing Severino with a two-run single by hacking the first pitch into left for a 3-0 lead.

Altuve added a solo home run, his fourth of the postseason, leading off the eighth inning, a frame in which the slumping Houston offense finally broke through with four insurance runs.

Before the late surge, Verlander sidestepped danger in the sixth and seventh innings. He got Gary Sanchez to ground out with an excuse-me swing, stranding two baserunners in the sixth.

Running on fumes in the seventh, Verlander completed a 10-pitch battle against Aaron Hicks with a 3-2 slider that resulted in his eighth strikeout before inducing a groundout from Chase Headley, who was 2-for-2 to that point. That final out inspired a vigorous fist pump from Verlander.

For a spell, Severino (0-1) was up to the challenge of matching zeroes with Verlander. In fact, while Verlander allowed a hit in each of his first three innings, Severino kept Houston hitless until Carlos Correa lined a two-out single to right-center field in the bottom of the fourth.

Severino escaped that inning unscathed, but the Astros figured him out soon thereafter. And following their methodical rally in the fifth, they finally provided Verlander with needed run support.

Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge clubbed his fourth homer of the postseason off Astros right-hander Brad Peacock with one out in the eighth.

NOTES: Astros DH Evan Gattis got the start over Carlos Beltran in part because of how the Yankees have pitched Beltran this series. Beltran, a switch-hitter who typically starts against right-handed pitching, excels against high-velocity pitches. According to Astros manager A.J. Hinch, Beltran has seen just one fastball over his 12 plate appearances in the ALCS. ... With his second strikeout of the game, Yankees RF Aaron Judge matched the franchise record for strikeouts in one postseason with his 26th.

While the deadly storms in August and September slammed insurers who are now on the hook for billions of dollars in damaged property, many retailers, manufacturers and banks are also feeling the pain.

Over half of S&P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results in recent weeks, including Harley-Davidson (HOG.N), Delta Airlines and Costco (COST.O), have said on conference calls with investors that the storms harmed their businesses to some degree, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis.

“We estimate the impact of the hurricanes accounted for approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of Harley-Davidson’s retail sales decline during the quarter,” the motorcycle maker’s Chief Financial Officer, John Olin, told investors on Tuesday after reporting a decline in quarterly profit per share.

The hurricanes were part of the worst Atlantic hurricane season in over a decade, destroying or damaging homes, businesses and public infrastructure, killing over 200 people and paralyzing normal economic activity.

Senior executives of least 48 S&P 500 companies have told investors on quarterly conference calls that their businesses had been negatively affected by the storms.

At least 12 companies, including U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), also said their businesses were hurt by a September earthquake that killed 369 people in Mexico, a major market for U.S. firms.

American International Group (AIG.N) has estimated pretax losses of about $1 billion each from Harvey and Irma, up to $700 million from Maria and additional catastrophe losses, including Mexico’s earthquake, of about $150 million.

Travelers Cos Inc said on Thursday it recorded $700 million in catastrophe losses from the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, although its quarterly profit fell less than Wall Street feared.

S&P 500 companies on average are expected to have increased their non-GAAP earnings per share by 4.2 percent in the third quarter, the slowest growth in a year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding insurers, which are expected to have suffered a 63.3-percent decline in quarterly profits, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.9 percent.

The lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hobbled activity at factories in September and blunted a rebound in U.S. industrial production, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday

Still, the storms have not stopped the stock market’s record advance. Up 15 percent in 2017, the benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 18 times expected earnings, a multiple not seen since 2002, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

The S&P 500 property and casualty index .SPLRCINPC on Friday hit a record high, more than recovering from a selloff that coincided with the Harvey’s destruction. Many investors believe that insurers will raise premiums to make up for losses, and that those higher premiums will become permanent.

Dover (DOV.N) Chief Executive Robert Livingston said overtime and other related expenses to get back up to speed had cost the manufacturing company as much as 2 cents per share in the quarter after Harvey forced it to close its Texas factories for four or five days.

Hand tool maker Snap-On (SNA.N) said the storms cost it about $8 million in sales in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.

“Timing of both further disruption and rebuilding are unclear,” Snap-On Chief Executive Nicholas Pinchuk told analysts on Thursday.

Waiving late fees and increasing reserves for customer credit cost PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) about 1 cent per share in the past quarter, leaving its non-GAAP EPS at 46 cents.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) on Friday said it had to suspend operations along the Gulf Coast due to the hurricanes and in Mexico because of the earthquake.

Some companies, including Constellation Brands (STZ.N), said the hurricanes had only a minor negative on their results. For others, the storms will mean new business.

With 600,000 homes in Texas and Florida in need of re-roofing, shares in building materials firms USG Corp (USG.N), Owens Corning (OC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) have jumped between 17 percent and 30 percent since just before Harvey struck Texas.

Home Depot (HD.N) has surged 9 percent since the end of August on bets that homeowners repairing damage will spend more at its stores.

“They were hurricanes of a massive size that caused significant disruption to labor forces and spending,” said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “But it’s a pendulum, early on it has an impact, but as the rebuild gets going and there’s an inventory ramp-up, I think it swings back the other way.”",Recent hurricanes take toll on quarterly earnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/recent-hurricanes-take-toll-on-quarterly-earnings-idUKKBN1CP2GE

O ambiente político interno também permaneceu no radar, com dúvidas sobre qual o capital político que o governo do presidente Michel Temer terá para dar continuidade às reformas no futuro próximo.

O dólar avançou 0,43 por cento, a 3,1898 reais na venda, depois de bater 3,1962 reais na máxima do dia. O dólar futuro era negociado com alta de cerca de 0,70 por cento no final da tarde.

Na semana, a moeda norte-americana acumulou alta de 1,29 por cento frente ao real, maior impulso em cerca de dois meses.

“A aprovação do orçamento pelo Senado dos Estados Unidos é a principal notícia hoje, pois aumenta a chance de reforma tributária, o que impulsiona o dólar”, afirmou o analista-chefe da Rico Corretora, Roberto Indech.

No exterior, o dólar subia frente a uma cesta de moedas e a algumas divisas de países emergentes, como o peso mexicano, após o Senado dos Estados Unidos aprovar o esboço do orçamento para o ano fiscal de 2018 que abrirá caminho para o pacote de cortes de impostos do presidente Donald Trump.

Com isso, podem crescer as apostas dos investidores de que o impulso fiscal elevará a inflação e, assim, levar o Fed a aumentar a taxa de juros mais do que o mercados têm esperado.

Juros elevados nos Estados Unidos têm potencial para atrair à maior economia do mundo recursos hoje aplicados em outras praças financeiras, como a brasileira.

Os Treasuries norte-americanos subiam nesta sessão, com destaque para o título de 10 anos, cujos rendimentos bateram a máxima do dia de 2,392 por cento, frente a 2,321 por cento no fechamento da véspera.

“Tem expectativa de entrada de fluxo em função de captações e aberturas de capital, então isso segura o dólar a não subir muito (frente ao real)”, afirmou o diretor da corretora Wagner Investimentos, José Faria Júnior.

Os mercados também estavam atentos ao futuro do Fed, já que o mandato da atual chair, Janet Yellen, termina em fevereiro de 2018. Trump disse nesta sexta-feira que estava considerando indicar tanto o atual diretor do Fed Jerome Powell quanto o economista da Universidade de Stanford John Taylor para cargos-chave no banco central dos Estados Unidos. Mas que também gostava de Yellen.

Internamente, o cenário político continuou deixando os investidores atentos. Já estava precificada a vitória de Temer na Câmara dos Deputados na próxima semana, quando o plenário da Casa vota se barra a denúncia contra o presidente ou não.

O temor, no entanto, era sobre quanto o governo sairá desgastado desse processo e como conseguirá dar prosseguimento a importantes pautas econômicas no Congresso Nacional, em especial a reforma da Previdência.

“Quanto ao cenário político, ainda há muita cautela. Embora a absolvição de Temer já esteja precificada, não há certeza sobre a aprovação da reforma da Previdência. Se ela for aprovada em uma versão mais enxuta, não se sabe se ela causará o efeito necessário”, afirmou o operador da corretora Advanced, Alessandro Faganello.","Dólar sobe e encosta em R$3,20 com cenário externo e expectativa de juro maior nos EUA",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CP2IY-OBRTP

While the United States and its allies, and many people in China, believe Beijing should do more to rein in Pyongyang, the acceleration of North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two.

China, Pyongyang’s sole major ally, has said it will strictly enforce U.N. Security Council sanctions banning imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while cutting off oil shipments to the North. China accounts for more than 90 percent of world trade with the isolated country.

Guo Yezhou, a deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party’s international department, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that its exchanges, communication and dialogue with the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea were continuing.

“China and North Korea are neighbours and the two have a traditional friendly cooperative relationship,” Guo said.

Maintaining, developing and consolidating those ties not only accord with both sides’ interests, they also have “important meaning” for regional peace and stability, he added.

Exchanges between the two parties play an important role in developing overall China-North Korea relations, Guo said.

“Our party and the Workers’ Party of Korea have traditional friendly exchanges. When and at what level these exchanges happen depend on both sides need and both sides’ convenience,” he added, without elaborating.

Guo did not directly answer a question on when the department’s head, Song Tao, last met with any North Koreans.

The department is in charge of the party’s relations with foreign political parties, and has traditionally served as a conduit for Chinese diplomacy with North Korea.

The Workers’ Party of Korea on Wednesday congratulated China on its 19th Communist Party Congress despite the increasingly frayed relationships between the allies as China tightens sanctions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme.

Though China has been angered by North Korea’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and demanded they stop, Beijing also sees the United States and South Korea sharing responsibility for rising tensions with their military drills.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

The match was a dead rubber after New Zealand beat Australia twice in the Rugby Championship but it looked anything but that as the two sides slugged it out on a surface made greasy by persistent rain.

Australia put the world champions under a lot of pressure and scored three tries to the two of their opponents before defending desperately in the final minutes as the All Blacks threatened a late winning try.

“Overwhelming sense of satisfaction,” Australia captain Michael Hooper said.

“We didn’t win any comps tonight but it goes a long way to building confidence in this team.”

Tries from wingers Reece Hodge and Marika Koroibete as well as a 12th of the season from fullback Israel Folau had given the home side a 20-13 lead with 15 minutes of the match remaining.

Waisake Naholo had crossed in the first half for the New Zealanders and his fellow winger Rieko Ioane got their second in the 71st minute only for Damian McKenzie to miss the conversion.

A 55-metre Hodge penalty two minutes from time gave the Wallabies some breathing space but they have lost so many contests to their trans-Tasman Sea rivals at the death that it was with immense relief that they greeted the final whistle.

“Two quality teams really put it in,” New Zealand captain Kieran Read said. “The conditions didn’t allow the teams to play the way they wanted but plenty of grit and fight from both sides.”

Australia came into the match with a settled side and were confident of a good showing against a New Zealand team without World Rugby Players of the Year Beauden Barrett and Brodie Retallick.

The visitors had the better of the early exchanges, though, and were pressing for the opening score when Hodge snatched Lima Sopoaga’s pass out of the air and raced 80 metres for a Wallabies try in the seventh minute.

The All Blacks were soon back on level terms, however, after going through 10 phases on the Australian line and making room for Naholo to cross untouched on the right wing.

Sopoaga slotted two penalties to put New Zealand 13-7 ahead but the Wallabies hit back just before the break when Folau cut between Naholo and flanker Liam Squire to score.

Bernard Foley missed the conversion and a penalty at the start of the second half and it was not until the 57th minute that the home side went ahead on the back of their third try.

A penalty kicked to touch was followed by a catch-and-drive and, with the referee’s hand raised to indicate another All Blacks transgression, Australia moved the ball wide for Koroibete to touch down in the corner.

The All Blacks were never going to fold and a Sonny Bill Williams offload made space for Ioane to race down the touchline for the score that set up the late drama.

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idUSKBN1CQ06R?il=0

During their phone conversation, Putin and Erdogan talked about joint efforts within the Astana process, including the creation of “de-escalation zones” in Syria, and further coordination towards resolving the Syria situation, the Kremlin said in a statement.

The Astana talks are brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran. In mid-September, the three countries agreed to post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern Syria’s Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist militants.

Putin and Erdogan also said the agreements reached between Russia and Turkey in Ankara in late September were being successfully implemented, particularly in trade and economic relations.

“Overall, the conversation was business-like and constructive, directed at strengthening bilateral cooperation and interaction on the regional agenda,” the Kremlin said.

The Russian-Turkish trade relationship has been affected by their dispute over supplies of Turkish tomatoes to Russia which Moscow is yet to fully restore. This dispute has been adding risks to Russian grain trade with Turkey.

Russia, once the largest market for Turkish tomato producers, said this week it will allow purchases of 50,000 tonnes of Turkish tomatoes from only four Turkish producers from Dec. 1.

The announcement came several days after Turkey, the second largest buyer of Russian wheat, said it had imposed a requirement for additional approval of Russian agriculture supplies by the Turkish authorities.","Kremlin says Putin, Erdogan discuss Syria in phone call",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-russia-turkey/kremlin-says-putin-erdogan-discuss-syria-in-phone-call-idUKKBN1CQ0D3

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

Lo riferiscono a Reuters quattro fonti senior della banca centrale a Reuters, tutte vicine all‘organo decisionale della Bce. La Bce non ha invece commentato.

Entro marzo l‘Ssm, il meccanismo unico di supervisione della Bce, deve mettere a punto nuove regole sugli accantonamenti delle banche a fronte dei crediti problematici. Il tema è spinoso per le banche italiane che raccolgono oltre un quarto degli 865 miliardi di euro di crediti deteriorati della zona euro.

“C‘è il serio rischio che la proposta in arrivo dall‘Ssm sia troppo soft”, dice una delle fonti.

L‘Ssm sta lavorando su quattro scenari modellati sulle linee guida attuali per i nuovi crediti problematici, che danno alle banche sette anni di tempo per la copertura su quelli garantiti e due anni per quelli non garantiti.

Secondo uno di questi scenari le banche dovranno cominciare a effettuare gli accantonamenti immediatamente, anche se gradualmente. Uno scenario più generoso invece fermerebbe l‘orologio di uno o due anni, dando tempo alle banche fino al 2021 o al 2026 per raggiungere l‘obiettivo.

Ora tutto è in discussione. “Anche lo scenario più generoso potrebbe apparire troppo severo”, spiega la fonte. “È tutto in divenire”.

Le linee guida della Bce saranno influenzate anche dalla proposta di legge che la Commissione Ue sta preparando in parallelo e che potrebbe riguardare anche misure per gli accantonamenti, aggiungono le fonti. Questo per evitare rischi di contrasti con Bruxelles dopo che il presidente del Parlamento Ue Antonio Tajani ha apertamente messo in discussione l‘autorità della Bce sulla materia agitando lo spettro di una disputa tra le due istituzioni.

Nello scenario più estremo, riferito da una delle fonti, in cui l‘Ssm probabilmente resta sulle sue posizioni, i supervisori pubblicheranno dei criteri che poi potrebbero essere differentemente applicati nei diversi paesi e per le diverse categorie di istituti.

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report. Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply.

ICOs, a hot financial trend with well over $2 billion raised this year, fall somewhere on the spectrum between crowd-funding and issuing non-voting shares. Participants contribute existing digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. Some may simply want to bankroll the project in question, but most hope to grab a slug of whatever new online coinage is on offer – in the Tezos case, “tezzies” – and to see it appreciate, as ether has done nearly 40-fold this year alone.

The creators of Tezos, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, got the fund-raising formula right. However, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised. Now they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation. They have accused him of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.”

The Breitmans stand to collect a portion of the proceeds – now in theory worth roughly double their original value – as Tezos project milestones trigger the foundation’s purchase of their company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions. Yet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.

Meanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns. Project details can be very sketchy and it’s not always clear what contributors are entitled to receive. Kathleen Breitman likens the Tezos fundraising to making a donation and receiving a tote bag in return, but people interviewed by Reuters seem more like investors who are expecting returns.

The backstory is intriguing. The Breitmans met at a crypto-anarchist lunch. He, the son of a French playwright and actor, went on to work at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while she later toiled at Ray Dalio’s secretive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. An early backer was Silicon Valley doyen Tim Draper.

Halep became the first Romanian to reach the summit of the women’s rankings when she beat French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the semi-finals of the China Open in Beijing, a feat she feels is the high point of her career to date.

“The dream came true. Is just the best feeling that I ever had in my tennis career so far,” the 26-year-old told reporters in Singapore on Saturday.

“It’s nice. I‘m just enjoying the moment. I cannot describe in words what I feel, but it’s a good feeling. I‘m happy when I‘m going to the courts now,” added Halep, who has won 15 WTA tournaments since her breakthrough year in 2013.

Halep is planning a major celebration of her ascent to the top of the rankings at the end of the season but the Romanian remains aware that six of the other seven women at the WTA Finals could usurp her as world number one.

“Well, the day that I won the match against Ostapenko, that was the best day, by far, best feeling. But when I went home, I had all the friends, family close to me, and it was -- I had some good dinners with them,” she added.

”We celebrated a little bit. But I haven’t done a big party. So I‘m waiting to finish here to go to the holiday and then I will have a big party.

”I think for everyone here, the most important thing is to finish the year as number one, but it is not going to be easy. Here everyone is going to play the best tennis, and every match is going to be like a final, as I said many times.

“So I‘m not thinking about that. I play better when I‘m not thinking about the ranking. I‘m just going to give my best, to try to be focused on what I have to play in each match, and we will see at the end who is going to be number one.”

After the win over Ostapenko, Halep was beaten in the Beijing final by Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia and the Romanian will have a little bit of revenge in mind when the duo open Red Group round-robin play with a showdown on Monday.

“She played really well in China and she deserved to win that title,” Halep added of Garcia.

“And of course after all the results that she did this year, she deserves to be here. I can say that I‘m excited to meet her again. Maybe I can take the revenge.”

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/spain-will-sack-catalan-government-call-regional-election-idUKKBN1CP0SX?il=0

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

Asian funds GIC of Singapore and CIC of China made all the running.

According to Thomson Reuters data, SWFs participated in deals worth just $14.1 billion, down from a revised $28.3 billion April-June, even though the number of deals rose to 38 from 31 quarter-on-quarter.

The second quarter’s total, however, was swollen by China Investment Corp’s (CIC) whopping $13.7 billion acquisition of warehouse firm Logicor, Europe’s biggest ever private equity real estate deal.

In a continuation of the previous quarter’s trend, CIC and GIC remained the most acquisitive funds, with CIC involved in 14 deals and GIC 10.

“The sovereign funds that are active are those that are generating current account trade surpluses,” said Michael Power, a strategist at Investec Asset Management.

In contrast, the oil-backed funds have been less acquisitive in recent quarters, reflecting the constraints imposed by persistent low oil prices.

Markus Massi, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, said another reason for the dominance of the Asian funds was that they had specialist teams looking for deals.

FILE PHOTO: People pass the skyline of Singapore October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su - File Photo

“The Asians are actively going out and scouting. If you’re a private equity company and you want to close a deal, it’s easier to go to someone who already has the knowledge and capability on the other side.”

GIC participated in the top three deals, the largest being a $6.4 billion offer for Danish payments processor Nets by newly-formed company Evergood 5. The deal was backed by a consortium that included GIC, led by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman.

The second largest was the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hong Kong-based insurer MassMutual Asia by another investor group that included GIC.

The rise in the number of consortium deals has gone hand-in-hand with ballooning deal sizes. “There is so much firepower available at the moment, you can go hunting for larger assets,” said Massi.

GIC also led a $220 million funding round for Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform Dianrong.

Power said the barriers to entry for most financial services were falling so sovereign funds needed to protect their portfolios by diversifying into the new players.

“It’s the tech-driven disruptors that are starting to redefine what financial services means,” he said.

Eight of CIC’s investments were in healthcare, a hotly-sought after area, and two in real estate. This followed last quarter’s Logicor buy and CIC’s involvement in the consortium that bought InterPark, the largest owner-operator of parking infrastructure in the United States.

This time GIC clinched the biggest real estate deal, taking a stake in the property rental unit of India’s DLF.","Sovereign funds' corporate deals halve in third quarter, Asians stay active",https://www.reuters.com/article/emerging-swf-investment/sovereign-funds-corporate-deals-halve-in-third-quarter-asians-stay-active-idINKBN1CP17P

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.",Commentary: How money will divide Europe after Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-brexit-commentary/commentary-how-money-will-divide-europe-after-brexit-idUSKBN1CM2BN

Le Sénat américain a adopté à une voix près une résolution budgétaire qui va accélérer l‘examen parlementaire de la réforme de la fiscalité voulue par Donald Trump et pourrait permettre sa promulgation d‘ici la fin de l‘année.

“C‘est vraiment une élément positif, qui a joué sur le sentiment général”, a dit Terry Sandven (U.S. Bank Wealth Management). “Toute décision législative qui met la croissance économique en avant sera à l‘évidence un plus non seulement pour le sentiment mais sans doute aussi pour les bénéfices des entreprises”.

Certains investisseurs disent en outre qu‘il n‘y a pas lieu de s‘inquiéter de cette progression de Wall Street depuis quelques semaines.

“C‘est une avancée saine car elle a été lente et régulière et la volatilité a été exceptionnellement faible”, a dit Hank Smith (Haverford Trust).

L‘indice Dow Jones a gagné 165,59 points (0,71%) à 23.328,63 points vendredi. Le S&P-500 a pris 13,11 points (0,51%) à 2.575,21 points. Le Nasdaq Composite a avancé de 23,99 points (0,36%) à 6.629,05 points.

Les trois indices ont inscrit des records de clôture et le Dow a dépassé cette semaine la barre des 23.000 points.

Sur l‘ensemble de la semaine, le Dow a gagné 2%, le S&P-500 0,86% - c‘est sa sixième semaine de gains consécutive - et le Nasdaq 0,35%.

Au plan sectoriel, ce sont les financières qui enregistrent le plus gros gain (+1,16%), suivies des industrielles (+1,07%).

L‘indice des petites capitalisations Russell 2000 a gagné 0,5%, les PME devant elles aussi en principe profiter de la réforme fiscale.

La “saison” des résultat trimestriels bat son plein et 183 sociétés du Standard & Poor’s doivent publier leurs comptes la semaine prochaine. Pour l‘instant plus de 70% des 88 sociétés qui ont annoncé leurs résultats ont battu le consensus.

Des poids lourds de la cote ont également rendu publics leurs chiffres ce vendredi, mais certains ont déçu ou ont modérément satisfait l‘investisseur.

Procter & Gamble a déçu Wall Street avec son chiffre d‘affaires, une semaine après avoir remporté une bataille contre l‘investisseur activiste Nelson Peltz qui souhaitait entrer dans son conseil d‘administration afin d‘y imposer d‘importants changements.

L‘action a cédé 3,65%.

General Electric a annoncé un bénéfice pour le troisième trimestre en forte baisse et largement inférieur au consensus, ce qui a pesé sur son action qui s‘est néanmoins retournée à la hausse dans l‘après-midi pour finir sur un gain de 1,06%.

Les deux premiers groupes parapétroliers mondiaux Schlumberger et Baker Hughes ont annoncé vendredi s‘attendre à ralentissement de l‘activité en Amérique du Nord et à une fin d‘année difficile en raison de la volatilité persistante des cours du baril de pétrole.

Schlumberger a cédé 2,09% mais Baker Hughes a gagné 0,33%.

Honeywell a annoncé une hausse de 8,7% de son bénéfice au troisième trimestre, tiré par son activité dans l‘industrie aérospatiale, et a relevé sa prévision de chiffre d‘affaires annuel.

L‘action a progressé de 1,2%.

Le volume a été de 6,2 milliards de titres échangés contre une moyenne de 5,9 milliards sur les 20 dernières séances, selon des données de Thomson Reuters.

HAUSSE DU DOLLAR ET DES RENDEMENTS OBLIGATAIRES

La perspective de voir la réforme fiscale se matérialiser a également profité au dollar qui a inscrit un pic de trois mois de 113,56 yens et de cinq mois à 0,9858 franc suisse.

Les cambistes disent que le billet vert a été également soutenu par les diverses déclarations de responsables de la Réserve fédérale cette semaine, dont la présidente Janet Yellen, qui vont dans le sens d‘une nouvelle hausse des taux américains cette année.

Le dollar a brièvement baissé lorsque Donald Trump a déclaré dans une interview diffusée vendredi par Fox Business qu‘il envisageait de confier des fonctions élevées au sein de la Fed à l‘actuel gouverneur de la Réserve fédérale Jerome Powell et à l‘économiste John Taylor, professeur à l‘université de Stanford.

Mais le président américain n‘a pas fermé la porte à une éventuelle reconduction de Janet Yellen, Fed dont le mandat arrive à échéance en février prochain.

Le fait que Janet Yellen ait été conviée à déjeuner à la Maison Blanche par le conseiller économique Gary Cohn a également fait fléchir le dollar brièvement.

L‘initiative du Sénat a eu pour effet de faire monter les rendements obligataires, de par ses effets inflationnistes induits qui nourrissent les hypothèses de futures hausses des taux, et l‘emprunt à deux ans a vu le sien atteindre un pic de près de neuf ans de 1,580%.

Une réforme fiscale se traduirait aussi par plus d‘emprunt pour financer les baisses d‘impôt, craint-on sur le marché obligataire.

Les cours du pétrole ont terminé en hausse vendredi sur le Nymex, au terme d‘une séance en dents de scie durant laquelle ils ont le plus souvent été pris entre la pression exercée par une faible demande américaine et le soutien apporté par une forte baisse des exportations irakiennes en raison des tensions dans la région du Kurdistan.

Dans ce contexte, l‘or a cédé 0,7% à 1.280,65 dollars l‘once et le future a laisse 0,6% à 1.282,30 dollars l‘once.","Wall Street en hausse, espère en la réforme fiscale",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1CP2M3-OFRBS

(politi.co/2yGjMtr)

“Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,” Trump said in a tweet.

The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short “Camelot,” as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 when he died and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown that a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence that points to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer.

Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof that Oswald acted in consort with anyone.

Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form.

The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that some of the more recent files could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations.

Saturday’s Washington Post said Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.","Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-jfk/trump-to-release-jfk-files-subject-to-further-information-idUSKBN1CQ0I4

The partnership is part of a trend by tech companies to connect with the U.S. Midwest following last November’s surprise election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. Trump was carried largely by rural states that embraced his criticisms of globalization and admonishments of Silicon Valley for what he described as an overreliance on immigrant workers.

For Microsoft, the outreach efforts serve as a way to connect with folks across the United States, said Brad Smith, the tech company’s chief legal officer.

“We are probably not going to find the technology breakthrough for the future of farming in downtown San Francisco,“ Smith told Reuters. ”We’re much more likely to find it in Green Bay, Wisconsin.”

Through the partnership, known as TitletownTech, the Packers and Microsoft will each contribute $5 million to invest in startups from around Wisconsin. This is part of a larger initiative by Microsoft called TechSpark to form similar partnerships in North Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.

Microsoft in July also committed itself to use television broadcast spectrum to bring broadband internet to 2 million rural Americans within five years.

“For communities like ours in the manufacturing belt, this is going to get us to where we need to be in order to be competitive well into the future,” Ed Policy, Green Bay Packers general counsel, said in an interview on Wednesday.

TechSpark is a long-term strategy Microsoft hopes will yield new customers, new employees and benefit more Americans, Smith said.

The origins of what became TechSpark occurred the day after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win, when Smith wrote a blog post saying Microsoft needed to “promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward.”

Microsoft is not alone in its outreach efforts to the American heartland.

So far in 2017, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has traveled to U.S. states he had not previously visited. Similarly, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook in April spoke to his alma mater Auburn University in Alabama, and the iPhone maker has said it will invest $1.3 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, to build a new data center and an additional $1 billion to expand its data center in Reno, Nevada.

Apple in May also announced a $1 billion fund for U.S. manufacturing programs. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in September announced plans to open a second headquarters away from Seattle, promising to bring $5 billion in investments to the chosen community.

”The 2016 presidential election was a wake-up call for many Americans, especially those in the ‘bubble’ of coastal cities,” said Jessica Alter, co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a nonprofit formed to promote tech worker participation in progressive and moderate political campaigns in local U.S. elections.

“For big companies like Microsoft and Facebook that means connecting with people outside of their headquarter cities,” Alter said on Wednesday.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

“Wir werden ausländischen Banken mehr Raum geben”, kündigte der Chef der Bankenaufsicht Guo Shuqing, auf dem Parteinkongress an. Der Marktanteil ausländischer Banken in der Volksrepublik habe sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren auf 1,2 Prozent halbiert. “Das ist kein Vorteil für den Wettbewerb und Strukturverbesserungen”, sagte Guo. Er signalisierte zudem, die Regeln für den Abbau fauler Kredite zu verschärfen. Finanzrisiken müssten ebenso eingedämmt werden wie ein Anstieg versteckter Schulden. Die Verschuldung, die etwa 258 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes ausmacht, gilt als eines der größten Konjunkturrisiken. Die Rating-Agentur S&P stufte erst im September die Kreditwürdigkeit des Landes herab, da “eine längere Phase des starken Kreditwachstums die ökonomischen und finanziellen Risiken Chinas erhöht hat”.

Die Zentralbank ist sich des Problems bewusst. Ihr Chef Zhou Xiaochuan warnte am Rande des Kongresses vor einem “Minsky Moment”. Er spielte damit auf eine nach dem amerikanischen Ökonom Hyman Minsky benannte Theorie an, wonach trotz boomender Wirtschaft eine plötzliche Krise auftreten kann. “Wir sollten uns darauf konzentrieren, dramatischen Anpassungen vorzubeugen”, sagte Zhou mit Blick auf die hohe Verschuldung der Unternehmen und steigender Verbraucherkredite.

Die Regierung geht bereits gegen eine drohende Immobilienpreisblase vor, was derzeit den Aufschwung leicht dämpft. Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt stieg im dritten Quartal um 6,8 Prozent zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Im ersten Halbjahr hatte es noch zu 6,9 Prozent gereicht. Trotz des etwas verlangsamten Tempos dürfte das von der Regierung vorgegebene Ziel von rund 6,5 Prozent für das Gesamtjahr übertroffen werden. Die Konjunktur sei stabil, sagte der Sprecher des Statistikamtes Xing Zhihong. 2016 hatte es mit 6,7 Prozent das kleinste Plus seit 26 Jahren gegeben. Dieser Wert dürfte in diesem Jahr übertroffen werden, erwarten Experten nach den ersten drei Quartalen.

Bremsspuren hinterließ in den Sommermonaten der Bausektor. Die Zahl der Neubauten nahm nicht mehr so stark zu, während der Verkauf von Bestandsimmobilien im September sogar erstmals seit mehr als zweieinhalb Jahren sank. “Der Immobilienboom hat zweifellos seinen Höhepunkt überschritten”, sagte Analystin Rosealea Yao vom Beratungsunternehmen Gavekal Dragonomics. Um Überhitzungen vorzubeugen, hat die Regierung beispielsweise die Vergabe risikoreicher Kredite erschwert.

Gestützt wird der Aufschwung vom Außenhandel und der Industrie, die von der besseren Weltkonjunktur profitiert. Die Firmen stellten im September 6,6 Prozent mehr her als vor Jahresfrist. Das ist mehr als Experten für möglich gehalten hatten. Sie bereiten sich damit auch auf den Winter vor, in dem die Regierung immer wieder im Kampf gegen die Luftverschmutzung Fabriken stilllegt. Der Einzelhandel schaffte im September ein überraschend kräftiges Umsatzplus von 10,3 Prozent.

“Derzeit braucht man sich um das chinesische Wachstum nicht zu sorgen”, sagte der Chefvolkswirt der VP Bank, Thomas Gitzel. “Auch in den kommenden Quartalen dürfte die Volkswirtschaft in ähnlicher Größenordnung zulegen, dafür wird alleine schon die Regierung sorgen.” Präsident Xi Jinping kündigte auf dem Parteikongress eine Öffnung des Dienstleistungssektors sowie eine Reform des Devisen- und Finanzsystems an. Bis 2035 solle China eines der innovativsten Länder der Welt werden, das seine Umweltprobleme grundlegend gelöst habe.

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.

On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.

It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.

Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.

Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.

“As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.

Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.

But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.

“China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.

“As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.

Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.

A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year.

No one was injured in the shooting incident, which occurred on Thursday near the campus in Gainesville where hundreds of people protested Richard Spencer’s speech amid a heavy police presence and a preemptive state of emergency declaration by the governor.

Gainesville police said Tyler Tenbrink, 28, and William and Colton Fears, 30 and 28, respectively, stopped their car near the campus to argue with a group of protesters.

After threatening the protesters and making Nazi salutes, Tenbrink fired a single shot at them as the Fears brothers yelled “kill them” and “shoot them,” police said.

The shot hit a nearby building, and the suspects fled in their car, police said. One of the protesters reported the car’s license plate number to police, and trio were arrested a few hours later.

At least two of the men are linked to “extremist groups,” police said, without specifying which two. The Fears brothers were each being held under a $1 million bond.

Tenbrink, who faces additional charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, was being held under a $3 million bond, police said.

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.

On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.

It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.

Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.

Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.

“As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.

Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.

But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.

“China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.

“As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.

Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.

A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year. Bitcoins and ether, another digital currency, are used to purchase tokens for ICOs.","Bitcoin soars to record high above $6,000",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CP2K1-OCATC

O plano, que ainda precisa de aprovação do Senado, busca resolver a pior crise política da Espanha em quatro décadas, mas corre o risco de forte reação por parte de apoiadores da independência, que pretendem protestar nas ruas.

Ao delinear a decisão do gabinete, o primeiro-ministro Mariano Rajoy afirmou que a economia calatã, responsável por um quinto da economia nacional, já estava em estado preocupante como resultado da pressão do governo regional por independência.

“Perguntaremos ao Senado, com o objetivo de proteger o interesse geral da nação, para autorizar o governo... a demitir o presidente catalão e seu governo”, disse Rajoy em coletiva à imprensa.

É a primeira vez desde o retorno da Espanha à democracia no final dos anos 1970 que o governo central evocou o direito constitucional de tomar controle da região e governá-la diretamente de Madri.

Isso incluirá controle total da polícia da região, das finanças e dos meios de comunicação públicos. Os poderes do Parlamento regional também serão reduzidos.

Rajoy afirmou que sua intenção era de não usar tais poderes especiais por mais de seis meses e que convocaria eleições regionais assim que a situação estivesse de volta ao “normal”.

“Nosso objetivo é restaurar a lei e a coabitação normal entre cidadãos, que se deteriorou muito, continuar com a recuperação econômica, que está sob ameaça hoje na Catalunha, e comemorar eleições em uma situação de normalidade”, disse Rajoy.

As medidas precisam agora aprovação do Senado da Espanha, onde a votação está marcada para 27 de outubro.

Rajoy insistiu que o líder catalão, Carles Puigdemont, que chefia o governo da região nordeste, rompeu com a lei diversas vezes ao pressionar pela independência, inclusive com o referendo de 1º de outubro, o qual o governo declarou ilegal.

“Os governantes da Catalunha não respeitaram nem a lei sob a qual é baseada nossa democracia nem o interesse geral”, disse o governo em um memorando obtido pela Reuters. “A situação é insustentável.”

O impulso de independência levou a Espanha à pior crise política desde a tentativa falha de golpe militar em 1981, muitos anos após o fim da ditadura de Francisco Franco.

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

LaBeouf at the time put out a statement on Twitter saying he was “deeply ashamed” of his behavior and that his actions “warrant a very sincere apology to the arresting officers, and I am grateful for their restraint.”

“My outright disrespect for authority is problematic to say the least, and completely destructive to say the worst. It is a new low. A low I hope is a bottom. I have been struggling with addiction publicly for far too long, and I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety and hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes,” he said on Twitter.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Trump’s fellow Republicans who control Congress will need at least some Democratic support to pass critical legislation in the coming months to avert a government shutdown and prevent an unprecedented U.S. debt default.

“I’ve been here with every president since Jerry Ford,” said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 and is its longest-serving member.

“I’ve always been willing to negotiate with anybody because they always keep their word. If you have a president who doesn’t keep his word, it makes it more difficult,” Leahy said when asked about Trump’s interactions with Congress.

Trump initially backed the bipartisan deal announced on Tuesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for shoring up insurance marketplaces established under Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies to private insurers that Trump has scrapped. A day later, Trump disowned it.

Going forward, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said that while more collaboration with Trump is possible, “I think we have to know that we can’t count on him.”

Trump enraged Republicans in September with his collaboration with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Trump cut a short-term spending deal with them, blindsiding Republican leaders, and then discussed with them the outlines of a plan to revive protections for young adult immigrants dubbed “Dreamers” brought into the United States illegally as children.

On both healthcare and Dreamers, Trump has shown that while he relishes deal-making, he is quick to row back in the face of a conservative backlash. The president also has sent signals over the past few weeks that he is wavering on working with Democrats to help the Dreamers, making demands that could be a deal-breaker.

Republicans have worked seven years to get rid of Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, and many of them vehemently opposed the Alexander-Murray deal. It remains unclear whether it will ever come to a vote in the Senate or House.

Because spending legislation requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate and there are 52 Republican senators, it cannot pass without at least eight Democrats backing it. Because hard-line House conservatives often oppose spending bills, Democratic support is expected to be needed there as well.

A Dec. 8 deadline is looming for passing the spending measure needed to prevent a shutdown. Democrats could demand a steep price for their support, potentially an Obamacare fix and action to help the Dreamers.

Under a budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday night, Republicans need only a simple majority to pass Trump’s proposed major tax cuts, though he has urged Democrats to support the overhaul.

‘ZIGGING AND ZAGGING’

Schumer, who Trump earlier in the year called the Democrats’ “head clown” before their thaw last month, this week vented his frustration about the president, saying he “keeps zigging and zagging so it’s impossible to govern.”

“This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says ‘jump,’ he says ‘how high?'” Schumer told reporters on Wednesday.

Schumer and Pelosi dined at the White House with Trump last month, and left feeling as if they had a deal on a proposal to help continue protections for the Dreamers that the president has moved to end effective in March.

Within a day, Trump began distancing himself from that deal, with the White House later floating a series of hard-line immigration “principles,” including money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border fiercely opposed by Democrats, that have thrown the entire effort into doubt.

Pelosi and Schumer argue their deal with Trump is still salvageable, as the president himself has not called it off.

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged that the principles “don’t help” the effort. But Hammill said that would not stop Pelosi, a former House speaker first elected to the chamber in 1987, from engaging Trump in the future.

“It was always a case-by-case thing. It was never ‘the switch was on’” full-time, Hammill said.

There will be plenty of cases to come in the weeks ahead, giving Trump an opportunity to improve his relations with Democrats if that is what he wants, Hammill said.

As Congress and the White House approach the December deadline for settling fiscal affairs, Hammill said Trump can use that opportunity to stabilize Obamacare and shield Dreamers from deportation.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker also expects annual revenue growth of 5 to 10 percent for the next few years, and capital expenditure slightly above $10 billion, executives said at an earnings briefing on Thursday.

TSMC earlier reported a 7.1 percent fall in third-quarter profit, a slightly milder decline than analysts estimated. Revenue rose 1.5 percent, marginally beating the firm’s forecast.

“Even though demand was slightly dampened by supply chain inventory reduction, our customers’ third-quarter growth was largely healthy,” said co-Chief Executive Officer Mark Liu.

The results come soon after TSMC named Liu as successor in June to retiring Chairman Morris Chang - widely regarded as the father of Taiwan’s chip industry - leaving C.C. Wei as sole CEO. They also come days before TSMC celebrates its 30th anniversary and about a week before iPhone X pre-orders begin.

Demand for increasingly capable smartphones as well as for servers for cloud computing has seen chipmakers’ share prices surge this year, with TSMC jumping 68 percent. Overall global chip market growth this year will likely be 16 percent, TSMC said.

But competition is set to increase. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world’s biggest memory chip maker, plans to triple its share of the contract chipmaking market within five years. There is also the threat from mainland China which is fostering a domestic chip industry.

“In terms of a lot of fabs (fabrication plants) in mainland China, we don’t like it but we are very competitive. We’ll continue to compete of course and maintain our market share,” Wei said at the earnings briefing.

Profit was T$89.93 billion ($2.98 billion) in July-September versus the T$88.19 billion average of 21 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue was $8.32 billion and operating margin was 38.9 percent.

TSMC forecast October-December revenue at $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with an operating margin of 37 to 39 percent.

During the quarter, on Nov. 3, Apple will begin shipping the iPhone X which is widely expected to carry TSMC-made chips. The device follows the recently launched iPhone 8 whose sales are reportedly slower than those of predecessors.

Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.

Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.

By comparison, in the final year of Barack Obama's Democratic administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 67 percent of that group and men accounted for 47 percent - closer to what the U.S. population looks like. Non-Hispanic whites account for 61 percent and men make up 49 percent, according to 2016 census data. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xOf1ip)

“This administration so far has not in any direct sense prioritized diversity,” said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan group that tracks federal hiring, when presented with Reuters’ findings.

Out of the Trump administration’s 24 top cabinet-level positions, 17 are filled by white men.

Asked to comment on the mid-level personnel data, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last week’s nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

“He will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in his administration,” Walters said. She declined to discuss Trump’s views on the ethnicity of political appointees.

One day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet’s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.

“People (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,” he told reporters.

The mid-level political positions, known as “Schedule C” and “non-career SES” posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September.

U.S. President Donald Trump is surrounded by his cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (L-R), Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson, Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Tom Price, as he signs an executive order entitled ""Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch"" in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2017.

How many more of those jobs have been filled since and whether their demographics has changed will be known at the end of the year, when third quarter numbers are expected.

CRITICAL LINK

The positions include office managers, aides, policy experts and schedulers who are hired by top appointees, such as cabinet secretaries and their deputies. The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.

In recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration. The OPM does not publish data on the more senior positions.

The personnel office has published data sorted by gender that goes back to 1998 and by ethnicity since 2006, allowing comparisons with only two past administrations.

Some political analysts say the profile of the new group of mid-level officials largely reflects a lower share of minorities among Republican voters and the fact that the Republican party has weaker ties to organizations that promote diversity and gender equality.

“It’s just a smaller set of folks who organize around those things and are connected to the Republican party,” said David Lewis, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential appointments.

In fact, this administration’s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white.

However, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America’s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush.

In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.

Among Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center.

Women also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008. In 1998-2000, the final years of Bill Clinton’s presidency captured in the OPM data, that share averaged 51 percent.",White and male: broader bureaucracy mirrors Trump cabinet's profile,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-diversity/white-and-male-broader-bureaucracy-mirrors-trump-cabinets-profile-idUSKBN1CP1D1

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.

On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.

It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.

Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.

Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.

“As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.

Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.

But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.

“China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.

“As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.

Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.

At a dinner attended by island residents Aug. 2, the activists from RepublicEn headed by former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis laid out the stakes: The sea level is rising, and some scientists estimate that within decades the island, already suffering severe erosion, will need to be abandoned.

The people of Tangier Island were used to this kind of message. Former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent Democratic climate activist, had given the same speech to islanders three days earlier. They were also used to rejecting it.

“We’ll talk to everybody,” said James Eskridge, mayor of the mainly Republican island community. “But they’re not going to change many minds here.” Residents, he said, do not believe in climate change: they want a new sea wall to prevent erosion, not a lecture about saving the world with solar panels.

Tangier Island’s steadfast rejection of climate change reflects the rigidity of American opinions about global warming, often defined along political party lines.

Reuters/Ipsos polling shows more than a third of Americans, mainly Republicans, reject the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity. Less than a third of Americans believe global warming poses an imminent threat to the United States. These views barely budged after a series of devastating hurricanes this summer.

That rift in opinion has proven to be a headwind for U.S. lawmakers seeking broad solutions to stem climate change, like imposing a cost on carbon emissions or encouraging cleaner renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuels.

And while conservatives have long been skeptical about climate change, doubters have a powerful new ally: U.S. President Donald Trump. He has called climate change a hoax and has started withdrawing the United States from a global pact to combat it, citing what he calls the huge economic cost.

Eskridge told Reuters Trump called him in June after seeing a report about severe erosion problems on the island, telling him not to worry about sea level rise.

“I believe man plays a part in it but not to the extent that others have been talking about - that’s what me and Donald Trump were talking about,” Eskridge said.

“WE‘RE LOOKING TO STAY”

An Army Corps of Engineers study in 2015 showed Tangier has lost two thirds of its mass since 1850 because of erosion, a process scientists say is being exacerbated by climate change. Journalists and politicians now view the island as a symbol of the climate crisis.

Tangier residents are happy with the attention but believe their problem is simpler. A sea wall built on one side of the island in the late 1980s has prevented the land behind it from eroding, they say, so another sea wall is the answer.

“We’re not looking to have our light bills cheaper, we’re looking to stay here,” said Deborah Pruitt, 57, who works at the island’s museum, where printouts of news reports about the island are displayed on a wall.

Conservative climate activists like Rob Sisson of ConservAmerica and Mitch Hescox of the Evangelical Environmental Network said the rejection of climate change by Tangier residents is not surprising: their groups often have trouble convincing fellow Republicans global warming is a real issue. Often, they say, people object to the idea that humans could possibly change the climate even if they wanted to.

Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, one of a handful of Republicans to publicly declare a belief in climate change, said she has a strategy for getting fellow Republicans to think of solutions: “I’ve found that the best way ... is to not dwell on the causes,” she said in an email.",Residents of shrinking U.S. island reject 'climate victim' label,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climatechange-tangier/residents-of-shrinking-u-s-island-reject-climate-victim-label-idUSKBN1CP20U

More than 500,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled across the border to Bangladesh following a counter-insurgency offensive by Myanmar’s army in the wake of militant attacks on security forces.

U.N. officials have described Myanmar’s strategy as “ethnic cleansing”. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States held Myanmar’s military leadership responsible for its harsh crackdown.

Guo Yezhou, a deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party’s international department, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that China condenmed the attacks in Rakhine and understands and supports Myanmar’s efforts to protect peace and stability there.

China and Myanmar have a deep, long-standing friendship, and China believes Myanmar can handle its problems on its own, he added.

Asked why China’s approach to the Rohingya crisis was different from Western nations, Guo said that China’s principle was not to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

“Based on experience, you can see recently the consequences when one country interferes in another. We won’t do it,” he said, without offering any examples of when interventions go wrong.

China does not want instability in Myanmar as it inevitably will be affected as they share a long land border, Guo said.

“We condemn violent and terrorist acts,” he added.

Guo’s department has been at the forefront of building relations with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who visited China in 2015 at the Communist Party’s invitation, rather than the Chinese government‘s.

In a speech at the opening of the Baghdad International Exhibition, Falih said cooperation between Iraq and Saudi Arabia contributed to “the improvement and stability we are seeing in the oil market”.

Falih is the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad for decades. The two countries began taking steps towards detente in 2015 after 25 years of troubled relations starting with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Tension remained high after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which toppled Saddam Hussein. The American occupation of Iraq empowered political parties representing Iraq’s Shi‘ite majority, close to Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran.

Iraq is seeking economic benefits from the thaw with Riyadh while Saudi Arabia hopes closer ties would help rollback Iran’s influence in the region.

“The best example of the importance of cooperation between our two countries is the improvement and stability trend seen in the oil market,” said Falih, to applause from the audience of Iraqi ministers, senior officials and businessmen.

Falih and Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir held talks earlier this year in Baghdad, paving the way for visits to Saudi Arabia by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and popular Shi‘ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Saudi Arabia and Iraq are respectively the biggest and second biggest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The Iraqi oil ministry said Falih and his Iraqi counterpart, Jabar al-Luaibi, agreed to cooperate in implementing decisions by oil exporting countries to curb global supply in order to lift crude prices.

OPEC, Russia and several other producers have reduced production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since the start of 2017, helping to boost oil prices. The cutbacks should continue until March 2018.

“The market has improved a lot but has still some way to go,” Falih told reporters, adding that the compliance of the 24 nations taking part in the cutbacks deal “exceeds 100 percent”.

Falih called for increased economic cooperation between the two countries at all levels, saying Saudi Arabia is implementing measures to facilitate the flow of goods and services between the two countries.

A Saudi commercial airplane, operated by Flynas, arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday for the first time in 27 years.

In August, the two countries said they planned to open the Arar land border crossing for trade for the first time since 1990.","Saudi oil minister makes high profile visit to Iraq, calls for oil supply cooperation",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-saudi/saudi-oil-minister-makes-high-profile-visit-to-iraq-calls-for-oil-supply-cooperation-idUKKBN1CQ0IP?il=0

The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel.

The Syrian military said it came under attack in Quneitra province, which sits near the Golan Heights territory that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.

“The Israeli enemy assaulted one of our military positions this morning, which led to material damages,” it said.

During Syria’s more than six-year-old conflict, Israel has returned fire across the border, including stray shells from fighting among Syrian factions.

The military statement suggested it may start escalating such retaliations. “Whether errant fire or not, any future occurrences will force the Israel Defense Forces to intensify its response,” it said.

Israel “holds the Syrian regime responsible and won’t tolerate any attempt to breach Israeli sovereignty,” it added.

In its own statement, the Syrian military warned against “such aggressive acts” and said it held Israel responsible for any consequent results.

Israel has also carried out targeted air strikes in Syria during the war, alarmed by the expanding influence of Iran, the Syrian government’s ally. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah nearly 100 times in recent years.

Iran’s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syria’s airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus this week. The general signed an agreement with his Syrian counterpart to further boost military cooperation, Iranian state news agency IRNA said on Saturday.

Rebel factions fighting the Damascus government in the multi-sided war hold swathes of Quneitra, while the army and allied militias control another part of the province.

Both warring Syrian sides accused each other of prompting the Israeli attack on Saturday.

The army said militants in nearby territory fired mortar rounds into the Golan Heights.

The Wimbledon champion starts her campaign on Sunday against Latvia’s French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko, the pair taking to the Singapore Indoor Stadium court after a White Group opener between Czech Karolina Pliskova and American Venus Williams.

“Honestly, I had no preference about who I played,” the 24-year-old told reporters of the draw on Saturday.

”Lately I have been playing with the big hitters and I felt a little bit better than maybe in the past, because every aggressive player is complicated to face.

“But I have improved that side of my game, and, yeah, it’s good that I‘m going to play with them again.”

Muguruza made a stunning debut in Singapore two years ago, winning all three pool matches before losing a tight semi-final to an inspired Agnieszka Radwanska, but was below-par last year when she failed to progress out of the group stage.

The Spaniard, who was named WTA Player of the Year on Friday, believes her preparation for this year’s tournament has been far better than in the past and knowing that she had qualified relatively early was also beneficial to her cause.

“This year is completely different because for the previous years in Singapore I qualified in the last tournaments, but this year, I felt like I knew in the American swing that I had already qualified,” she added.

”I feel prepared and ready as I regard this as one of the most prestigious tournaments.

“I had a big rest after Beijing (where she retired in the first round of the China Open at the start of the month), because also I was a little bit sick. I took my time and trained for the final push of the year.”

Muguruza also ticked off a “childhood dream” when she topped the world rankings in September and with four other players reaching number one at some point this season, the Spaniard believes the women’s game is more competitive than ever.

“It’s way different than before. I feel like, you know, every week, depends who is playing well, can be in the top,” she said.

“You know, it gives us a lot of options and variety. You know, just more, like, dramatic for the fans and for us too to see that every week everything can change.”

Once Asia’s biggest commodities trading house, Noble is slashing jobs and selling assets as it slims drastically to cut debt after a crisis-wracked two years.

The Singapore-listed company is focusing on its core Asian coal trading business. In July it agreed to sell its North American gas and power business to Mercuria.

Hong Kong-based Noble flagged earlier this month that it expects to sell its capital-intensive oil liquids business by the end of December, pushing back the timeline by a few months.

One of the sources said an announcement of Vitol’s deal with Noble could come as early as Monday.

Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research accused it of overstating its assets by billions of dollars - allegations that Noble rejected. That pain was exacerbated by a commodities downturn at the time.

The upheaval has also led to rating agency downgrades, fund raising and management changes, while Noble’s market value has plummeted to less than $400 million from $6 billion in February 2015. Its stock is down about 80 percent this year.

Noble reported a net loss of $1.75 billion for April-June, citing a tough market.

Shares in the company were halted earlier on Friday, pending the “announcement of a major transaction”, Noble said.

The sources declined to be identified because Vitol’s purchase of the Noble unit has not been made public. Details of the transaction were unavailable.

Vitol and an external spokeswoman for Noble declined to comment.

Noble is a big player in the global physical oil market, trading crude and refined products. But its operations shrank this year due to higher prices and liquidity constraints.

The company has blending and wholesale capabilities in North America and the Caribbean, alongside long-term storage leases globally.

Noble has also said North American lenders to the company have extended the deadline for a $2 billion credit facility by three months to Jan. 15.",Exclusive: Vitol set to acquire Noble Group's oil liquids business - sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-noble-group-restructuring-exclusive/exclusive-vitol-set-to-acquire-noble-groups-oil-liquids-business-sources-idUSKBN1CP0DM

Emonster said it is seeking unspecified money damages and a court order blocking Apple from using the term while the lawsuit is pending.

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

Tania Karas: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Yellen’s remarks offered a contrast between her legacy as Fed chair with the policy views of others who President Donald Trump is considering for her position when her term expires in February. Yellen told the National Economists Club, “We must keep our unconventional policy tools ready to be deployed again.”

Reaching the near-zero lower bound would force the Fed to turn to other means to stimulate the economy. Following the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, the Fed used both a spoken commitment to lower rates and $3.5 trillion in asset purchases to pull rates lower than they would have been otherwise, boosting consumption and growth.

Those asset holdings are now on the decline, the Fed’s policy rate is being increased, and the economy in general is doing well, Yellen said. But she cautioned that the world may not return to its old normal, and “future policymakers” may need to use emergency steps similar to those used in the past decade.

Persistent low inflation has caught the Fed by surprise and is “of great concern,” Yellen said. She and other Fed officials are also convinced that the “neutral” rate, which neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity, is much lower than in the past, likely limiting how far the Fed can go during this rate increase cycle.

As President Donald Trump mulls a switch at the Fed, Trump is considering several possible replacements for Yellen.

One of the possible nominees Trump has interviewed, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, was critical of Fed asset purchases at the time, and argued that Fed has stayed too deeply involved in asset markets. Another, Stanford Economist John Taylor, advocates use of an interest rate rule that would have recommended higher rates through the downturn and recovery. Once rates reach the lower bound, moreover, Taylor’s rule-based approach would likely have to give way to judgment about what steps to take.

Yellen is also being considered for reappointment, but made clear she feels the central bank needs to keep its options open for the future.

“The bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might have to be used again,” Yellen said, advising that “future policymakers” may face challenges not unlike those of the past ten years.",Fed's Yellen defends past policies as Trump mulls top Fed pick,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-yellen/feds-yellen-defends-past-policies-as-trump-mulls-top-fed-pick-idINKBN1CP2UG

1/ TAPER TIME

After weeks of speculation, the European Central Bank is set to sketch out plans on Thursday to scale back its 2.3 trillion euro stimulus scheme, probably from the start of next year.

Economists polled by Reuters expect Mario Draghi and co will cut their monthly purchases of mainly government bonds to 40 billion euros from 60 billion although the reduction could be larger.

The bigger haggling point is whether to keep the plan open ended by putting a nine or six months time frame on the reduction rather than a potential date at when it ends altogether. There have also been hints at altering the ECB's forward guidance to make clear a rate rise remains some time away.

It’s a scenario that should cheer bond investors -- they’ve already pushed euro zone bond yields to 5-week lows in anticipation of what would effectively be a prolonged tapering. The euro has backed off recent 2-1/2 year highs and regional stock markets are trading near four-month peaks.

A divergence in rate views in the U.S. and Europe meanwhile have pushed the gap between short-dated bond yields in the U.S. and Germany to around 229 basis points, the widest in 17 years.

2/ FAANGTASTIC

The high-flying “FAANG” stocks -- Facebook Inc (FB.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) , Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) -- have risen strongly since mid-July. The exception is Amazon.com, known as the 800-pound gorilla of the group.

While revenue growth remains stellar, Amazon has been in big spending mode, which is weighing on profits. In August, Whole Foods shareholders and federal regulators approved Amazon’s $13.7 billion acquisition of the organic grocer.

Amazon shares, which have posted total returns of about 32 percent so far this year versus Netflix’s 58 percent, could surprise on the upside next week as it announces its third quarterly report on Oct. 26 and against the backdrop of how Amazon stock has underperformed over the past three months.

Indeed, Netflix reported a strong third quarter, beating analyst expectations in terms of revenue and subscriber growth. The company reported $2.99 billion in revenue and 5.3 million new subscribers, a record for third quarter growth.

3/ ABENOMICS LIVES ANOTHER DAY?

Japan goes to the polls for a snap election on Sunday, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling bloc expected to win around a two-thirds majority. A victory of that scale would likely provide Abe with a strong endorsement to stay on, which would make him Japan's longest-serving post-war prime minister.

The yen has weakened in the run-up to the election, hitting a more-than-three-month low against the dollar on Friday JPY=. That's helped the Nikkei stock index, which recorded its longest run of daily gains in over half a century, after a 14-day winning streak.

Those share-price gains signal that markets have become less worried about domestic political risks and that Abe’s gamble to take advantage of a weak opposition may pay off.

If Abe does wins a convincing victory, the yen is likely to strengthen modestly, analysts say, which could in turn weigh on the Nikkei. But a continuation of Abenomics means a continuation of ultra-loose monetary policy, spelling downward pressure on Japanese bond yields and the yen and further fuel for stocks.

4/ MINSKY MOMENT

China's central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan gave an unprecedented warning on the 30th anniversary of the Black Monday Wall Street crash: the world's second largest economy must avoid the risk of a ""Minsky moment.""

This refers to a sudden collapse in asset prices after long periods of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures. The comment drew attention to China's debt pile, which is at levels that preceded crises elsewhere, at a time when Chinese leaders, meeting at a twice-a-decade Communist party congress, are obsessed with stability.

But while China has accumulated record amounts of debt, its stock markets are well below 2015 peaks and the property sector is cooling, as Thursday's third-quarter growth data showed. Zhou did not say the risk was imminent, noting leverage will continue to rise. Policymakers will be relieved the warning came from Zhou, who is set to retire soon, and not from the market itself.

5/ WHAT NEXT FOR MACRI-NOMICS?

On Sunday, Argentines head to the polls for midterm legislative elections that could determine the future of market-friendly President Mauricio Macri's reform agenda. The vote will give a sense of the fallout out from Macri's unpopular subsidy cuts and other fiscal tightening measures.

But what’s really at play is whether his political nemesis and populist predecessor Cristina Fernandez can get enough support to pose a serious challenge in the 2019 presidential election, when Macri is expected to run for a second term.

Investors, eyeing the country’s vast oil and mineral wealth, want Macri’s coalition to block any chance of Fernandez with her growth-at-all-costs policies returning to the presidency in Latin America’s No. 3 economy.",Take Five - World markets themes for the week ahead,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-markets-themes/take-five-world-markets-themes-for-the-week-ahead-idUKKBN1CP1W3

The $200 billion telecom firm reported a rise in wireless subscribers on Thursday. But the gap is narrowing. Cable rivals Comcast and Charter are also offering mobile services, AT&T is trying to become a media company and Sprint and T-Mobile may yet merge. A heavy debt load hobbles Verizon’s ability to quickly change lanes.

Verizon said it had a net addition of more than 600,000 wireless customers, including those for tablets and other devices, who pay a monthly bill in the third quarter. Earnings were flat at $3.7 billion, but $10 billion in cost savings targeted by Chief Executive Lowell McAdam over the next four years should help the bottom line.

Looming over Verizon is the chance that Sprint and T-Mobile US may finally combine. The third and fourth carriers in the United States argue that a tie-up would better position them to compete against Verizon and its peer AT&T. Adding to the pressure, both Comcast and Charter Communications are launching their own mobile initiatives. Sure, Comcast is using Verizon’s backbone for cellular but it would be unwise to underestimate the ability of Brian Roberts’ company to turn foe.

The options for Verizon to buy its way out of trouble are limited. Three years ago the telecom firm closed a $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45 percent stake of the venture Verizon Wireless from Vodafone. The amount of debt on the balance sheet - $117 billion as of the end of September – gives it limited flexibility.

There is a possibility of a bid for satellite distributor Dish, which has an enterprise value of about $40 billion, but AT&T sounds a cautious note about how big deals can pan out. The second-largest mobile carrier warned earlier it lost 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the third quarter because of competition and weather. AT&T bought satellite firm DirecTV in 2015 for $67 billion and is preparing to close on its $109 billion deal for Time Warner.

McAdam may yet choose to copy AT&T’s media strategy and go beyond the $9 billion or so he spent on AOL and Yahoo, though paying a premium may be a stretch. Verizon has boasted of raising its dividend for 11 years in a row.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

“In meiner Sammlung der Koalitionen fehlt mir diese Jamaika-Koalition noch”, sagte der CSU-Chef. Und auch wenn dies scherzhaft gemeint war: Die erste, noch getrennte Runde von CDU/CSU mit FDP und dann den Grünen hat das Tor für eine Jamaika-Koalition zumindest so weit aufgestoßen, dass es den Beteiligten schwer fallen dürfte, nicht mehr hindurchzugehen. Daran ändert auch die Tatsache nichts, dass alle vier Parteien schon aus taktischen Gründen öffentlich betonen, die Auseinandersetzung über schwierige Sachthemen stehe noch bevor. Inhaltliche Stolpersteine gibt es tatsächlich genug. Aber mit dem Mittwoch ist nach Ansicht von Politikern mehrerer Parteien der Erfolgsdruck erheblich gewachsen.

NÖTIGE LOCKERUNGSÜBUNG ERZEUGEN BINDUNG

Der vielleicht wichtigste Grund sind die atmosphärischen Lockerungsübungen, nicht nur am Mittwoch, sondern auch in den Tagen zuvor. Im Bundestag wird zwar schon immer hinter den Kulissen auch über Parteigrenzen hinweg gesprochen. Aber die Intensität, mit der man sich bilateral zwischen CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen um Kontakte bemüht, hat erheblich zugenommen. Bisheriger Höhepunkt war der Besuch von Seehofer in der Grünen-Parteizentrale am Dienstag - ein fast schon historischer Moment angesichts der jahrelangen gegenseitigen Animositäten. Der CSU-Chef wiederholte diese Geste als atmosphärischer “Eisbrecher” dann noch mit einem Besuch bei der FDP.

Und am Mittwoch wurden gezielt Bilder lächelnder Politiker auf dem Balkon der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft für die wartenden Fotografen und Kameraleute produziert. Mal winkte CDU-Chefin und Kanzlerin Angela Merkel im Kreis von Grünen-Politikern vom Balkon, mal FDP-Chef Christian Lindner zusammen mit CSU-Vertretern und der Kanzlerin. “Je harmonischer man sich aber nach außen zeigt, desto schwerer ist später zu vermitteln, warum keine Einigung möglich war”, heißt es in Jamaika-Kreisen. Ohnehin passt das Lächeln der Akteure genau zur Erwartung der Wähler. Laut ZDF-Politbarometer erwarten 80 Prozent der Grünen-, 75 Prozent der FDP- und 68 Prozent der Unions-Anhänger die Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition. Denen müsste man das Scheitern der Gespräche erklären.

Ein wenig ähnelte die Stimmung dem ersten Besuch des französischen Präsident Emmanuel Macron in Berlin Mitte Mai, als Merkel ein Hermann-Hesse-Zitat nutzte, um das zukünftige Verhältnis zu beschreiben: “Allem Anfang wohnt ein Zauber inne.”

DER WUNSCH ZU REGIEREN

In den vergangenen Tagen wurde zudem deutlich, wie sehr alle vier Parteien bereits in Kategorien des Regierens denken. Zwar betonte FDP-Chef Lindner am Donnerstag erneut, die Chancen auf eine Jamaika-Koalition stünden “Fifty-Fifty”. Aber gleichzeitig lässt sich Lindner in Interviews ständig über Ministeriumszuschnitte oder die Besetzung des Finanzministeriums aus. In der Union wird dazu vermerkt, dass so nur jemand argumentiere, der bereits an eine eigene Regierungsbeteiligung denke. FDP-Vize Wolfgang Kubicki betont jedenfalls, dass er sich für ministrabel hält und durchaus fähig, das Bundesfinanzministerium zu übernehmen.

Den Grünen-Realos wird ohnehin unterstellt, unbedingt regieren zu wollen - dementsprechend optimistisch äußerte sich etwa Geschäftsführer Michael Kellner am Mittwoch, der nach dem Treffen mit der Union ein “gutes Gespräch” erlebt haben wollte. Und Partei-Chef Cem Özdemir wird nachgesagt, er sei am Amt des Außenministers interessiert, was dieser bislang nicht dementiert hat.

CSU-Chef Seehofer lässt sich - trotz aller noch bestehenden inhaltlichen Differenzen - die Bereitschaft der CSU zu Regierungsbildung ablesen. “Es gab keine Verspannungen”, sagte er. Und Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier (CDU) folgerte nach den ersten Sondierungsrunden, er sehe bei allen Beteiligten den Willen, dass “dieses Experiment” ein Erfolg werde.

GEMEINSAME ANGST VOR DER AFD

Dazu kommt eine gemeinsame Angst, die allen vier Parteien letztlich den Ausstieg aus den Jamaika-Gesprächen versperrt. Denn auch wenn die FDP anfangs alles andere als glücklich wirkte, dass der sofortige Rückzug der SPD in die Opposition nur eine Jamaika-Lösung möglich macht: Die Hoffnung, dass die Sozialdemokraten bei einem Scheitern der Gespräche als zweite Option zur Verfügung stünden, sind auch in der CSU gen Null gesunken. Scheitern die Sondierungen, dann wären wohl nur noch Neuwahlen möglich.

Aber die wollten eigentlich alle vier Parteien verhindern, heißt es in Unionskreisen. Denn wie ein Elefant stand am Mittwoch die AfD im Raum in der Parlamentarischen Gesellschaft.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

The U.S. Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the post-crisis bank resolution regime, as some Republicans urge. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched.

What’s known as orderly liquidation authority was established to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp the power to resolve bank holding companies, systemically important non-banks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The FDIC would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks.

Some congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate OLA and replace it with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Donald Trump in April to order Treasury to review the OLA, and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method.

The U.S. debate ignores the global nature of big banks and the role international regulators play. The FDIC-supported method would resolve a firm at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division - including overseas units - to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to U.S. regulators and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank.

Overseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without OLA, U.S. banks’ overseas subsidiaries could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ringfencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority.

A number of suspected militants were also killed and security forces are combing the area, a statement by the Interior Ministry said.

Egypt is facing an Islamist insurgency concentrated in the Sinai peninsula from two main groups, including an Islamic State affiliate, that has killed hundreds of security forces since 2013.

Islamist militants have launched several major attacks, most recently targeting churches in Cairo and other cities with the loss of dozens of lives.

The security sources said authorities were following a lead to a hideout deep in the desert thought to house eight suspected members of Hasm, a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and police since last year.

A convoy of four SUVs and one interior ministry vehicle was ambushed from higher ground by militants firing rocket-propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices, a senior source in the Giza Security Office said.

The number of dead was expected to rise, two security sources said.

Two security sources said eight security personnel were injured in the clashes, while another source said that four of the injured were police and four others suspected militants.

Egypt accuses Hasm of being the militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.

The Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule.

The militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas, including Egypt’s Christian Copts.

“There is not much to gain from backing Barcelona and a lot to lose from angering Madrid,” said a senior EU diplomat at the EU summit.","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders sought to minimize Spain’s crisis with Catalonia on Thursday and avoid encouraging separatists across the bloc, describing Barcelona’s secession bid as a domestic issue and declining a mediation role.

Leaders did not hold a discussion of Catalonia’s bid to break away from Spain and judged they had nothing to gain by angering Madrid, diplomats said.

“It is not on our agenda,” European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters during the EU summit. “All of us have our own emotions, opinions, assessments but formally speaking there is no space for an EU intervention.”

The approach contrasted with EU strategies on almost every other major issue over the past decade, including Greece’s financial crash and mass migration flows from Syria. On countless occasions, EU leaders have used late-night summits to press for a common decision or joint policy statement.

“It’s an internal Spanish matter,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters, a position echoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who held a private meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on the sidelines of the summit.

“He (Macron) has complete confidence in Rajoy to resolve the situation,” a French diplomat told Reuters.

Spain’s government is set to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region’s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks.

Rajoy kept a low profile at the summit while his fellow leaders held news conferences on Thursday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped there were solutions “on the grounds of the Spanish constitution.”

Despite some disquiet over the way Rajoy handled a Catalan independence referendum on Oct. 1, which Madrid said was illegal and sent in police to disrupt voting, countries fear making any remarks that could embolden separatists at home.

From Scotland to Flanders and Lombardy, the 2007-09 financial crisis, unemployment and migration have allowed separatists, anti-EU and populist parties to feed off discontent with political elites and reopen regional divisions.

As Britain negotiates its exit from the EU, few leaders want to wade into another highly complex negotiation bringing new economic uncertainty and legal disruption.

Smaller EU countries such as Slovenia that emerged as sovereign states after the end of the Cold War are equally uncomfortable about inspiring secessionists across the bloc. They rely on Spain, a large euro zone economy, for investment.

Even in Western Balkan countries aspiring to join the European Union, there is a reluctance to fuel calls for regional autonomy at home. Spain is one of five EU countries that has yet to recognize Kosovo’s independence.

Trump leaves Nov. 3 on a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January and one with a major priority: Preventing the standoff with North Korea from spiraling out of control.

Xi is immersed in a Communist Party Congress expected to culminate in him consolidating his control and potentially retaining power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

Trump believes that Xi should have even more leverage to work on the North Korea problem.

“The president’s view is you have even less of an excuse now,” said one official. “He’s not going to step lightly.”

Trump wants to gain some serious cooperation from China to persuade Pyongyang to either change its mind or help deprive it of so much resources that it has no choice but to alter its behavior, the official said.

Trump has heaped praise on Xi in recent weeks in hopes of gaining Chinese cooperation and has held back from major punitive trade measures.

In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he wants to “keep things very, very low key” with Xi until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress.

“I believe he’s got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We’ll see what happens. Now with that being said, we’re prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn’t believe,” Trump said in the interview, to air on Sunday.

Trump has traded bitter insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, using his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month to dismiss Kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission for his repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. He said if threatened, the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea.

Kim in recent weeks said the United States would face an “unimaginable strike” from North Korea if provoked.

Lo riferiscono alcune fonti vicine al dossier.

La società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.

SpringerNature è una joint venture controllata al 53% dall‘editore tedesco Holtzbrinck e per il resto dall‘operatore di private equity BC Partners.

E’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici. All‘epoca la società venne valutata più di 5 miliardi di euro incluso il debito.

BC Partners non ha voluto commentare, mentre Holtzbrinck non è stata raggiungibile per un commento nell‘immediato.

Secondo una delle fonti, Holtzbrinck potrebbe voler tenere la maggioranza dopo la quotazione.

SpringerNature, che pubblica circa 3.000 riviste scientifiche e circa 12.000 nuovi libri ogni anno, dovrebbe realizzare l‘anno prossimo un Ebitda di 480 milioni di euro e potrebbe essere valutata, secondo una fonte, fino a 6,5-7 miliardi incluso il debito per 3 miliardi.

Una simile valutazione corrisponde a 15-16 volte l‘Ebitda escludendo gli investimenti, ha aggiunto la fonte. Nel 2015 BC Partners ha detto che puntava a una quotazione del business entro due o tre anni.

* El último lugar que ocupa el campeón defensor Chivas de Guadalajara es resultado de la relajación que tuvieron muchos jugadores tras obtener el título del torneo Clausura en mayo, reconoció el viernes el defensor Edwin Hernández.

“Hubo una relajación y es cuando los equipos empiezan a caer, y cuando te estás ahogando es cuando quieres respirar. En este momento somos conscientes de lo que estamos fallando y vamos a pelear con todo dentro de la cancha”, dijo Hernández.

El “Rebaño Sagrado” ocupa el último lugar en la tabla general con 9 puntos y acumula seis derrotas en 13 juegos, por lo que su pase a la liguilla para pelear el título ya no depende de ellos, pues debe ganar los cuatro partidos que restan en el torneo y esperar otros resultados.

A la liguilla acceden los clubes que ocupan los primeros ocho lugares al final de las 17 jornadas de la temporada regular.

“Me molesta que estemos en último lugar, pero sé que tarde o temprano se volverán a dar los resultados. Tenemos mucho por dar para ganar más títulos”, agregó Hernández.

Guadalajara visitará el domingo a Veracruz en el cierre de la decimocuarta jornada.

* El uruguayo Martín Cauteruccio, delantero del Cruz Azul, descartó estar desesperado por la escasez de goles que registra en el torneo.

“Debes ponerte los zapatos de fútbol y meterte a la cancha para darte cuenta de que realmente hacer goles no es fácil. No me desespera, sé que hago bien las cosas dentro de la cancha”, dijo Cauteruccio.

El delantero que llegó en enero a la “Máquina Celeste” solo registra dos goles en 13 partidos. Ambas anotaciones las realizó el 17 de octubre cuando su equipo venció como visitante a Querétaro por 2-1.

“Hay veces que tienes el arco más abierto y cada pelota que pateas entra, pero la realidad es que nunca hay que bajar los brazos y tienes que seguir intentando”, agregó Cauteruccio.

Cruz Azul visitará el sábado a Lobos BUAP.

* El colombiano nacionalizado mexicano Carlos Darwin Quintero y Oribe Peralta, titulares indiscutibles en el América, irán al banco de suplentes en el próximo compromiso del club para darles un poco de descanso y evitar alguna lesión, adelantó el director técnico Miguel Herrera.

“Es más una situación de descanso, a Oribe y a Darwin los tendremos ahí. Tienes que rotar para que esos jugadores tengan la posibilidad de descanso y de recuperación porque no quieres cargar de peso a nadie o buscarle una lesión a algún jugador”, dijo Herrera.

Peralta es el goleador del equipo con seis tantos, mientras que Quintero registra dos anotaciones.

“Estamos concentrados en lo que viene, sabemos que no hemos conseguido nada todavía. Tenemos los puntos para pensar que se puede clasificar, pero todavía no lo conseguimos matemáticamente”, agregó.

Syrian troops regained control of al-Qaraytan “after eliminating terrorist Daesh groups that had infiltrated it,” state TV said using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

Earlier this month, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Islamic State fighters had seized the town from government forces, part of a counter-attack by the jihadists who have come under intense pressure in eastern Syria.

The Observatory said on Saturday that some militants had surrendered and others had withdrawn from the town after heavy fighting. The only Islamic State presence in Homs was in a patch of desert in the east of the province, the Britain-based war monitor said.

The town of al-Qaraytan lies some 100 km (60 miles) from the ancient city of Palmyra, and nearly 300 km (190 miles) from Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the Syrian government’s offensive against Islamic State.

With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the Syrian army has taken swathes of land from Islamic State in central Syria, including in Homs province. After months of steady gains across the central desert, the army and its allies marched eastwards into Deir al-Zor.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY, which are expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies, up 1.16 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

“It’s just a reaction to the thought that just maybe there might be something coming from Congress in the way of tax reform,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.

“Everybody had kind of given up hope, and after the comments over the last 24 hours, people are like, shoot, this may actually happen.”

Housing stocks .HGX also moved higher, up 0.70 percent, after data from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September.

But gains were curbed by declines in Celgene (CELG.O), off 10.76 percent after the company said it would abandon drug trials for a Crohn’s disease treatment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 165.59 points, or 0.71 percent, to 23,328.63, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.1 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,575.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.99 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,629.05.

For the week, the Dow climbed 2 percent, the S&P gained 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 percent.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.49 percent, its biggest daily gain in a month, with the euro EUR= down 0.69 percent to $1.1768.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Kathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company.
“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June.
The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.
“I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.","ZUG, Switzerland/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just three months ago, a tech project called Tezos raised $232 million online in a wildly successful “initial coin offering,” in which new digital currency is parceled out to buyers. At the time, it was the most money ever raised from the public in the white-hot cryptocurrency sector.

Photo illustration shows detail of Tezos website, October 10, 2017. Picture taken October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

But the venture is now in danger of falling apart because of a battle for control playing out behind the scenes, Reuters has learned.

The acrimonious dispute pits Tezos’ two young founders – Arthur and Kathleen Breitman – against Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the coin offering and promote and develop the Tezos computer network.

Under Swiss law, the foundation is supposed to be independent. It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation.

An attorney for the Breitmans sent a 46-page letter on Sunday to the two other members of the foundation’s three-person board, calling for Gevers’ prompt removal and seeking to give the couple a “substantial role” in a new structure that would limit the foundation’s responsibilities. The document accuses Gevers of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.” According to Gevers, the two board members later suggested via email that he step aside for a month while they investigate.

Gevers told Reuters he is not stepping down. “As Arthur has done to others before me,” Gevers said, “this is attempted character assassination. It’s a long laundry list of misleading statements and outright lies.” He said the other two board members “are attempting an illegal coup.”

The Breitmans have been trying to control the foundation as if it were their own private entity, Gevers said, by bypassing the foundation’s legal structure and interfering with management and operations. This has resulted in costly delays in developing and launching the Tezos network and new currency, he said.

“They’re unnecessarily putting the project at risk,” he said.

In a written statement sent to Reuters, the Breitmans reiterated their accusations against Gevers and said they acted “in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.” They said their priority “remains the successful launch of the Tezos network.”

Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake: The Tezos digital coins, called “Tezzies,” are already priced at a hefty premium in futures trading even though they don’t yet exist. The launching of the Tezos network, which will trigger the coins’ release, has been delayed. Until the network launches – and no date is set – contributors to the fundraiser will receive nothing.

Under the terms of the Tezos coin offering, there’s no guarantee participants will ever receive a single Tez. Participants agreed to accept the risk that the project “may be abandoned.” Despite the feud, Gevers said he remains committed to resolving the feud so that “this project succeeds.”

The tale of how two young entrepreneurs raised a fortune for a project barely out of the starting blocks is reported here in detail for the first time. It highlights the risks inherent in the current frenzy for ICOs, in which tech startups issue new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.

Reuters reported last month that cryptocurrency exchanges – where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored – have become magnets for fraud and deception. More than 980,000 bitcoins – the most popular virtual currency – have been stolen since 2011. Today they would be worth about $5 billion.

Similar large sums are pouring into initial coin offerings. From January through September, ICOs generated $2.2 billion, more than three times the amount invested in similar startups by traditional venture capital firms, according to Novum Insights, a data provider.

ICOs can be a way for technology projects to raise money online to finance the development of new, open-source computer networks that aren’t necessarily looking to make a profit. Contributors receive new digital coins, or tokens, which they typically need to “pay” to access the new networks.

But the recent flurry of ICOs raising millions of dollars has attracted some dubious business propositions and outright scams, as well as speculators looking to trade the coins for swift gains. Authorities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Singapore and other nations have begun scrutinizing the sector closely for potentially tougher regulation.

“Most ICOs are bought by people looking to ‘flip’ their tokens to a greater fool for a quick profit,” said Alistair Milne, a co-founder of the London-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, which so far has avoided ICOs. More than “90 percent will fall to have a near-zero value in time,” he predicted.

The new cryptocurrencies function through a technology called blockchain, essentially a public ledger maintained by a network of computers. Blockchain applications are being tested by financial services firms, food suppliers, retailers and other businesses as a way to make record-keeping simpler and cheaper. Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Several entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain industry said the Tezos technology has potential because it would be easier to upgrade and may be more secure than other blockchains.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM

The son of Jean-Claude Deret, a French playwright and actor, Arthur Breitman studied applied mathematics, computer science and physics in France, before moving to the United States and studying financial mathematics at New York University. He went on to work for the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

He is still listed as a co-organizer and “dear leader” for the New York Anarcho-Capitalist Meetup in New York, which describes its philosophy as “a type of radical libertarianism that favors the abundant wealth production, rapid technological development, and high standards of living produced by capitalism.” Its website adds, “We are also fairly lazy about fighting the state.”

It was at a crypto-anarchist lunch in 2010 that Breitman first met Kathleen McCaffrey, an American college student from New Jersey. She is described on a political blog called The Politicizer as a libertarian Republican who first became interested in politics after listening to the provocative radio personality Rush Limbaugh at the age of five. She married Breitman in 2013.

Kathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company. In a July post on the conservative website legalinsurrection.com, she said she “didn’t get along” at the hedge fund but had “a great time” at R3.

Bridgewater didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Arthur Breitman, 35, was an early fan of bitcoin, which first appeared around 2009. But he came to believe there were flaws in the blockchains behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, finding them hard to upgrade and not secure. He tried to come up with something better.

In the summer of 2014, while working at Morgan Stanley in quantitative finance, Breitman released two papers online that presented his concept for a new type of blockchain. He called it Tezos, a name his wife has said he coined after creating an algorithm that searched for the names of unclaimed websites pronounceable in English.

The papers were published under a pseudonym, “L. M Goodman,” but emails and messages from Arthur Breitman reviewed by Reuters make it clear he was the author.

In an email Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project at the time. He expressed worry that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, messages show.

Reuters reviewed a copy of a “Tezos Business Plan” from early 2015, which listed Breitman as chief executive. The plan projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion. The budget called for paying Breitman $212,180 in salary by year three. In August 2015, Breitman, who was still working at Morgan Stanley, set up a company in Delaware called Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, or DLS, to develop Tezos. He listed himself as chief executive.

The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is “reasonable expectation of compensation.” According to FINRA records, Breitman was registered and did not report any “other business activities.” Morgan Stanley and FINRA declined to comment.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June. “It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.” She added: “We had some meetings with like C-suite executives at banks ... but honestly nothing serious.”

“A TERRIBLE SALESMAN”

In 2015, Arthur Breitman was pitching “Tezos Inc.” in the hope of creating a consortium of four to five banks to adopt the technology and fund the operation. The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.

By then, blockchain was beginning to pique the interest of large financial institutions for its potential to help cut costs of cumbersome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities trades. Tezos’ 37-page business plan called it “an Internet for financial transactions” and said the technology could be used to automate the over-the-counter derivatives trading market.

But Breitman failed to attract backers. He told Reuters in June that he blamed his fundraising failures on the decision to develop the technology first, rather than just selling “a dream” as other blockchain startups were doing.

“I guess I was a terrible salesman as well,” he said.

“I can speak to that,” his wife said.

In April 2016, Arthur left Morgan Stanley, and by that September, the Breitmans had started working on a new strategy for Tezos – to conduct an online fundraiser to distribute digital tokens, whose holders would maintain the Tezos blockchain. But the couple needed funds to keep the project going.

Over the next six months, they received $612,000 from 10 early backers, including several cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to the Tezos.com website.

To conduct the ICO, the Breitmans chose a complex structure. Earlier this year, they helped to create a foundation based in Zug, Switzerland – dubbed “Crypto Valley” because of its many blockchain startups – that is seeking not-for-profit status, emails show. The idea, according to documents on the Tezos website, was that the foundation would raise money via the ICO, then acquire DLS, the Breitman-controlled company that has been developing Tezos.

Working through a Swiss foundation, the Breitmans thought, would provide regulatory oversight but not too much. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June that she and her husband opted to use a foundation based in Zug because Switzerland has “a regulatory authority that had a sufficient amount of oversight but not like anything too crazy.”

Georg von Schnurbein, co-author of a book on Swiss foundation governance, expressed surprise over cryptocurrency ventures like Tezos setting up not-for-profit foundations in Switzerland. “For me, the public interest is not clear,” he said. While not illegal, he said, creating a foundation with the aim of allowing inventors to profit from a sale conflicted with its status as a not-for-profit, which is supposed to benefit the public. He said federal regulators eventually might prohibit it.

“The issue that there is some kind of for-profit entity and there are transfers right at the beginning is something that is working at the moment, but won’t be sustainable,” he said.

“EXAGGERATED, TO SAY THE LEAST”

As work continued for the ICO, which was originally scheduled to be held in May, the project started running out of cash, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters. She spoke with Tim Draper, the well-known founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm DFJ and a staunch bitcoin supporter. He invested $1.5 million through his firm, Draper Associates, which included taking a minority stake in DLS, the company that controls the Tezos source code.

The Breitmans had also hired Strange Brew Strategies, a U.S. communications company, to promote their project, and Reuters wrote a news story on May 5 about Draper’s involvement.

In pitching the story to Reuters, John O‘Brien, a principal of Strange Brew, had made claims about Tezos’ progress. He wrote: “The applications of Tezos, ranging from derivatives settlement to micro-insurance, are real and recognized by industry giants. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, LexiFi, etc. have adopted Tezos in their development environments and labs.”

On Oct. 3, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm Ernst & Young told Reuters: “The statement is not correct. EY has not adopted Tezos.” A spokesman for Deloitte said Tezos’ code is “one of many technologies we’re considering” with blockchain, but it’s “still early stage and we haven’t used the technology for a client project.”

Jean-Marc Eber, CEO of the French software company LexiFi, said, “The sentence, as stated, isn’t accurate and unfortunately exaggerated, to say the least.” While there had been “informal contacts,” he said, “at this stage, LexiFi has not adopted Tezos’ technology in its development environment or labs.”

Strange Brew declined to answer questions about the statement.

INVESTMENT OR DONATION?

The Tezos fundraiser began on July 1. The Breitmans had wide-ranging expectations about how much they might raise. A document on Tezos.com suggested that if they received more than $20 million, they might use it to “negotiate with a small nation-state” to adopt Tezzies, or acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets to promote the technology. In June, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that about a year ago, when the price of bitcoin was lower, “we were like, ‘Hey, we would be lucky if we get 20 million.'”

When it ended after 13 days, the project received about 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers, worth about $232 million at the time. The hoard is now worth about twice that.

Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said.

The fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”

If deemed a donation, and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of financial regulators in the United States. In the U.S., investments in assets such as company shares and other securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been studying ICOs, and in July issued an investor bulletin that warned: “Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.”

Part of the SEC’s assessment is to examine the reasonable expectations of participants in the ICO. Some participants in the Tezos fundraiser told Reuters they viewed the coins at least partly as an investment.

Kevin Zhou, co-founder of the cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital, said he invested about five bitcoins in Tezos, which he considers overall one of the better ICOs.

“For me and for a lot of people this is an investment. We are looking for a return,” Zhou said. “I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.

Draper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”

“TOTAL MENSCH”

At the moment, the Tezos Foundation holds all of the fundraising proceeds, while the Breitmans, through their Delaware company, control much of Tezos’ intellectual property. The plan is for the foundation to acquire the Breitmans’ company and release the technology under a free software license, according a “Transparency Memo” on the Tezos website.

Gevers, who founded the Tezos Foundation, said it has a contract that stipulates the Breitmans will either sell the Delaware company to the foundation “within a reasonable point of time” or, if they don‘t, “the foundation can take it.” He declined to provide a copy of the contract.

When the foundation will acquire the Breitmans’ company remains unclear. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June, “Essentially, you know, they’re going to buy out the company in like July or so, I guess.”

The Breitmans stand to receive millions of dollars if the deal goes through. According to the “Transparency Memo,” the new blockchain “must launch and operate successfully” for three months, then DLS’s shareholders – the Breitmans and Draper – are entitled to receive 8.5 percent of the fundraiser proceeds in cash. That amount, according to Gevers, is about $19.7 million. The shareholders also are slated to receive another 10 percent of the Tezzies issued, with the coin distribution spread out over four years. Those coins currently are worth about $140 million in futures trading.

Prior to the fundraiser, Kathleen Breitman effused about Gevers, 52, a Zug-based South African entrepreneur who has never before run a foundation. During an “Ask Me Anything” session in May on an online chat channel, she posted: “He’s awesome. Total mensch and very philosophically committed to our project.”

Relations later soured. The Breitmans objected to people the foundation suggested it wanted to hire, Gevers said. Another sticking point: The couple’s company hasn’t relinquished control over the foundation’s own website, www.tezos.ch.

“They control the foundation’s domains, websites and email servers, so the foundation has no control or confidentiality in its own communications,” Gevers said.

The Breitmans officially have no role at the Tezos Foundation. The letter from their lawyer this week proposed the creation of two foundation subsidiaries – Tezos AG and Tezos France SA – to develop and support Tezos, with the Breitmans serving as chief executive and chief technology officer of Tezos AG. The couple also would be given “observer status” on the foundation board. The foundation would then “limit” its activities to supervising and supporting the subsidiaries, “rather than conducting any direct operations.”

According to von Schnurbein, under Swiss law “the foundation is completely independent and the foundation board is completely independent.” Gevers said the foundation wants the couple to continue playing a leading advisory role. “They are both very competent people and obviously they started this whole thing. And it would be stupid to exclude them.”

But he added: “You can rest assured as long as I have anything to do with this, the foundation will be independent.”

Gevers said he has filed a complaint with Swiss regulators about the request he received via email this week from the foundation’s two other board members that he step down from the board for a month. A spokesman for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the agency that supervises foundations, told Reuters that asking a board member to step aside must be done at a board meeting, not via email. The two board members who emailed Gevers didn’t respond to a request for comment.

As for the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies raised in the ICO, Gevers said the foundation has slowly begun selling the virtual currencies – lately about $10.2 million worth a week – and plans to invest the proceeds in a diverse portfolio. The funds are intended to be used to run the foundation, ensure Tezos works and help to develop products using the technology.

So where are all the bitcoins and ethers raised in the ICO stored? That, Gevers said, was confidential.

“These are not held in any one place,” he said, “but secured through high-security” digital wallets “that no single party has control over.”",Special Report: Backroom battle imperils $230 million cryptocurrency venture,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-funding-tezos-specialreport/special-report-backroom-battle-imperils-230-million-cryptocurrency-venture-idUSKBN1CN35K

“We’ll have more detailed discussions as the deal progresses but there was great optimism that work generally for Belfast would increase,” said Clark in an interview at Bombardier’s plant in Montreal.

Airbus’ (AIR.PA) investment this week in the Montreal-based plane and train maker’s CSeries jets is expected to reduce costs and increase sales of the narrow-body jets.

It gives Bombardier a possible way out of a trade dispute with Boeing Co (BA.N) in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose 300 percent import duties, threatening thousands of jobs in Canada, the United States and Northern Ireland.

Clark said he would expect work to increase at the Belfast plant because of the growth in sales.

Bombardier makes the CSeries CS100 and CS300 carbon wings at a plant in Belfast.

Under the deal, Airbus would take a 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries and add an assembly line for the plane in Alabama. Thus it would be a U.S.-made product and avoid anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.

Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, which is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four nations and remains mired in political sensitivities after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.

Speaking at a conference in New York, Powell said the U.S. central bank would early next year launch a study analyzing payment security vulnerabilities and also planned to create new working groups focused on reducing the industry costs associated with securing payments.

“Rapidly changing technology is providing a historic opportunity to transform our daily lives, including the way we pay. Fintech firms and banks are embracing this change, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient payments,” said Powell.

“It is essential, however, that this innovation not come at the cost of a safe and secure payment system that retains the confidence of its end users.”

The Fed does not have complete authority over the U.S. payment system, but it has led industry efforts to make it faster and easier to use. The central bank also leads the 160-member Secure Payments Task Force.

Powell’s comments underline growing concerns among financial market participants and regulators about the risks cyber thieves pose to the financial system following a series of recent incidents.

Last year, SWIFT, the global financial messaging system, disclosed it had suffered hacking attacks on its member banks including the high-profile $81 million heist at Bangladesh Bank.

Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers sparked outrage in recent weeks by cancelling about 20,000 flights after admitting it did not have enough standby pilots to operate its schedule without significant delays.

It responded by promising pilots significant improvements in pay and conditions, exceeding rates paid by rivals, with negotiations to take place with each of its 86 bases individually.

Pilots at London’s Stansted Airport rejected the Ryanair offer by a margin of 60 percent to 40 percent at Friday evening’s vote, the Irish airline said.

“Ryanair will continue to engage with the London Stansted ERC (Employee Relations Council) to understand how it can address their remaining concerns, especially as it will be recruiting new pilots in Stansted from November at these higher pay rates,” it said in a statement.

Two Ryanair pilots with knowledge of the vote told Reuters that the turnout was above 90 percent.

The deal included a pay increase for all grades of pilots of about 20 percent and improvements in conditions, two separate sources told Reuters.

Ryanair said in its statement that it would lift captain salaries to 20 percent more than those offered by rival Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL).

‘PRODUCTIVITY BONUS’

A significant portion of the increase is by way of a “productivity bonus” of between 500 euros and 1,000 euros a month on condition that pilots make themselves available to work three extra days in November and three in December, according to a copy of the letter to pilots that was seen by Reuters.

The bonus also requires pilots to deal directly with the company through the ERC at Stansted. Ryanair does not recognise unions and instead agrees conditions with pilots through ERCs.

A number of pilots who have been organising on social media in recent weeks to use the pilot shortage to press for better conditions have demanded a new independent and pan-European representative body.

Ryanair has rejected criticism of its ERC system. A 2007 Irish Supreme Court ruling rejected arguments by pilots that the ERC system did not constitute genuine collective bargaining.

Organisers pushing for pan-European unionisation have told pilots that more than 30 bases have rejected the deal so far, a number of pilots have told Reuters.

A Ryanair spokesman said that figures was untrue and that more than 10 other bases had agreed new pay deals, with the majority of bases yet to vote. He would not provide a breakdown of how many had accepted or rejected deals so far.

“Based on what we have been hearing from Ryanair pilots, this is not a surprise,” said British Airline Pilots’ Association General Secretary Brian Strutton.

Halep became the first Romanian to reach the summit of the women’s rankings when she beat French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the semi-finals of the China Open in Beijing, a feat she feels is the high point of her career to date.

“The dream came true. Is just the best feeling that I ever had in my tennis career so far,” the 26-year-old told reporters in Singapore on Saturday.

“It’s nice. I‘m just enjoying the moment. I cannot describe in words what I feel, but it’s a good feeling. I‘m happy when I‘m going to the courts now,” added Halep, who has won 15 WTA tournaments since her breakthrough year in 2013.

Halep is planning a major celebration of her ascent to the top of the rankings at the end of the season but the Romanian remains aware that six of the other seven women at the WTA Finals could usurp her as world number one.

“Well, the day that I won the match against Ostapenko, that was the best day, by far, best feeling. But when I went home, I had all the friends, family close to me, and it was -- I had some good dinners with them,” she added.

”We celebrated a little bit. But I haven’t done a big party. So I‘m waiting to finish here to go to the holiday and then I will have a big party.

”I think for everyone here, the most important thing is to finish the year as number one, but it is not going to be easy. Here everyone is going to play the best tennis, and every match is going to be like a final, as I said many times.

“So I‘m not thinking about that. I play better when I‘m not thinking about the ranking. I‘m just going to give my best, to try to be focused on what I have to play in each match, and we will see at the end who is going to be number one.”

After the win over Ostapenko, Halep was beaten in the Beijing final by Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia and the Romanian will have a little bit of revenge in mind when the duo open Red Group round-robin play with a showdown on Monday.

“She played really well in China and she deserved to win that title,” Halep added of Garcia.

“And of course after all the results that she did this year, she deserves to be here. I can say that I‘m excited to meet her again. Maybe I can take the revenge.”

The original virtual currency has gained over 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class. Bitcoin though is very volatile - posting gains and losses as high as 26 percent and 16 percent respectively on any given day.

On Friday, bitcoin hit a record peak $6,000.10 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform, and was last at $5,964.24, up 4.7 percent on the day.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that can either be held as an investment, or used as a foundation for future applications through the blockchain, its underlying technology. The blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions.

It is more scarce though than most people realize. The number of bitcoins in existence is not expected to exceed 21 million.

Analysts said it was a combination of factors that drove Friday’s surge in price.

Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare in London said hopes that China will soften its regulatory stance on crypto-currencies helped bitcoin’s cause.

“As China ... fears fade, the price is unlocked and driven by demand and buyers entering the markets,” said Hayter.

Over the summer, China has banned the practice of raising capital through the sale of tokens to the public in what is known as initial coin offerings. It has also ordered the shutdown of digital currency exchanges.

But many in the market believe the Chinese ban is temporary.

“China would not want to be left out of the digital currency market nor the development of blockchain applications in general,” said Jason English, vice president of Protocol Marketing, at Sweetbridge, a global alliance in Zug, Switzerland that aims to use blockchain to create a liquid supply chain.

“As much as 60 percent of the world’s bitcoin mining is happening in China, and therefore, many of the large ... investments in ICO projects have also been coming from crypto-currency holders in China, whether directly or indirectly,” English added.

Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City, Ventures in Redwood City, California, also believes investors have been going back into bitcoin given the still uncertain global regulatory environment on crypto-currencies.

A big part of bitcoin’s recent surge was the ICO craze, which exploded this year.

Under that scenario, either Powell or Taylor would take the reins from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in early February, and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when Stanley Fischer retired this month.

“That is something that is under consideration, but he hasn’t ruled out a number of options. He’ll have an announcement on that soon, in the coming days,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday.

Making Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising interest rates, the next Fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investors crave.

The addition of Taylor, who has backed an overhaul of the Fed and embraced a more rigid rule-oriented monetary policy, would be a feather in the cap of conservative Republicans who feel that monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen, who was named as Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and has led the central bank since February 2014.

“I think Powell might be the safer pick insofar as we know what we’re getting,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. “He’s a guy who obviously knows the Fed culture, how the (policy-setting) committee operates, so for some of those soft skills we know he would be effective.”

Powell has embraced the Yellen Fed’s monetary policy, keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wages higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lays out where interest rates ought to be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies that rates should be higher than they are now.

Yellen, speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Friday evening, mounted a strong defense of the tools the Fed has used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there was a risk of another crisis in which those “unconventional policies” may be needed again.

Yellen, who Trump has indicated could still be named to another term as Fed chair, was not asked about the Fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process.

“SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT”

Although Taylor is highly regarded within the Fed, his rule-based rate-setting position has spurred criticism that he would handcuff U.S. monetary policy.

Taylor pushed back at a meeting at the Boston Fed on Saturday, saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rules and did not want to tie the Fed’s hands or suggest that he was motivated by a distrust of policymakers.

“I think that’s completely incorrect,” he said. “I trust policymakers; (rules) are an effort to make policy better.”

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Some analysts suggest that fears that Taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the Fed, as some Republicans in Congress hope, are likely exaggerated.

“There is some scope for disappointment if people think putting Taylor in will just lead to mechanical-based policy,” Feroli said.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, speaking with reporters on Friday, seemed to agree.

“Even if you pick a rule, the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy,” she said. “But I do think being systematic, looking at the kinds of information we look at systematically over time, articulating our strategy for policy and being less discretionary is a good idea.”

At the same time, there are concerns that the combination of Powell and Taylor atop the world’s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to markets.

It is unclear whether Trump, who has criticized Yellen’s stewardship but also said on several occasions that he preferred rates to stay low, wants to dramatically alter the Fed’s direction.

Although he appears to be tilting to Powell and Taylor, in addition to Yellen the Republican president has interviewed his top economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh for the Fed chief position.","Trump considers Fed's Powell, economist Taylor to lead central bank",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-considers-feds-powell-economist-taylor-to-lead-central-bank-idUSKBN1CP29G

La Commission a dit en juillet enquêter sur une collusion entre constructeurs allemands après que le magazine Der Spiegel a rapporté que Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen et ses filiales Audi et Porsche s‘étaient entendus pour fixer les prix dans le diesel et autres technologies depuis des décennies.

“Le groupe BMW souhaite clarifier la distinction entre les violations présumées du droit antitrust d‘une part et les manipulations illicites du traitement des gaz d‘échappement d‘autre part”, a indiqué le constructeur. “Le groupe BMW ne fait pas l‘objet d‘accusation sur ce dernier point.”

He’s made so many “Golmaal” films that it is impossible to tell them apart. So you stop bothering with numbers, because you know it is going to run with the same formula all over again and engineered towards making that elusive thing Bollywood likes to call a “commercial blockbuster”.

Handout photo

Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Kunal Khemu, Shreyas Talpade and Tusshar Kapoor reprise their roles from the earlier films. The women, of course, are dispensable and easily replaced. This time, the setting is an orphanage in the hill town of Ooty. Gopal (Devgn), an orphan with anger issues and an irrational fear of ghosts, decides to leave town with friend Laxman (Talpade) after an altercation with three other orphans. Many years later, all of them meet at the last rites of the founder of the orphanage, and discover that all is not well.

An evil builder is out to destroy the orphanage, a spirit seems to haunt the house where the men are staying, and the mysterious Damini (Parineeti Chopra) seems to have a secret that only puzzles people in the film. Audiences can see it coming a mile away.

But for all its predictability, “Golmaal Again” is funny. The first half of the film is full of good slapstick comedy, combined with an inspired running joke on Nana Patekar. Warsi and Kemmu display excellent comic timing, while Johnny Lever brings his dependable comedic genius to the screen to deliver some truly rollicking moments. Tabu as the benevolent librarian who guides the men on their mission is understated and efficient.

But it is too good to last. As the second half rolls in, things get sluggish, the jokes get rarer and the mission to save the orphanage seems to be taking a tad too long. Shetty’s story doesn’t have the emotional heft or enough jokes to entertain us for 151 minutes – the film’s runtime.

Trump leaves Nov. 3 on a trip that will take him to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be his first tour of Asia since taking power in January and one with a major priority: Preventing the standoff with North Korea from spiraling out of control.

Xi is immersed in a Communist Party Congress expected to culminate in him consolidating his control and potentially retaining power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

Trump believes that Xi should have even more leverage to work on the North Korea problem.

“The president’s view is you have even less of an excuse now,” said one official. “He’s not going to step lightly.”

Trump wants to gain some serious cooperation from China to persuade Pyongyang to either change its mind or help deprive it of so much resources that it has no choice but to alter its behavior, the official said.

Trump has heaped praise on Xi in recent weeks in hopes of gaining Chinese cooperation and has held back from major punitive trade measures.

In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo, Trump said he wants to “keep things very, very low key” with Xi until the Chinese leader emerges from the party congress.

“I believe he’s got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We’ll see what happens. Now with that being said, we’re prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn’t believe,” Trump said in the interview, to air on Sunday.

Trump has traded bitter insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, using his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month to dismiss Kim as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission for his repeated nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. He said if threatened, the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea.

Zhou is quiet, even by his profession’s standards, and usually grants interviews only when he needs to calm markets. Yet on Oct. 9, Caijin magazine published a rare interview in which the central banker made a strikingly direct call for a more open capital account. At a panel on Sunday in Washington, D.C., he stressed the need to tackle the country’s $18 trillion in corporate debt. And on Thursday, he talked at length about leverage and financial risks on the sidelines of the Communist Party Congress.

The 69-year-old governor is expected to step down soon and would no doubt like to burnish his legacy as a reformer who has worked to liberalize China’s markets and open them up to foreign investors. His most tangible accomplishment came last year when the International Monetary Fund included the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies, the Special Drawing Right.

His warning might also be an effort to buy some reputational insurance – a case of “I told you so” if a mounting debt burden causes the economy to shudder. In context, his recent speeches are even-handed. But Zhou has been at this game for 15 years. He must know that merely using the term Minsky moment, or saying the country can never have an open economy with a tightly controlled currency, will resound all the more during the most sensitive time of China’s political calendar.

Top officials are in Beijing for the Communist Party Congress, a once-in-five-years gathering where they will likely discuss Zhou’s successor as well as the remit and personnel of bureaucracies overseeing the financial system. The governor’s remarks all but ensure that the case for reform will be top of mind during these closed-door discussions, and might even tip the balance toward someone in his mold succeeding him as governor.

A convoy of four SUVs and one interior ministry vehicle was ambushed from higher ground by militants firing rocket-propelled grenades and detonating explosive devices, one senior security source said.

Militants are mostly fighting in remote northern Sinai where the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014.

Led by Janet Yellen since 2014, the Fed is about to allow its $4.5 trillion portfolio of securities to shrink, and in late 2015 it began raising interest rates from the low levels seen after the 2008 financial crisis. A new Fed chair who argues for tightening monetary policy more aggressively is seen putting economic growth at risk, along with corporate earnings, and the long stock market rally.

A faster rise in short-term interest rates would likely flatten the yield curve, narrowing the gap between short and long term debt yields, which could crimp bank profits and strengthen the U.S. dollar, hurting exporters’ sales.

U.S. President Donald Trump has selected a pool of five candidates from which to choose the next Fed chair: current Fed Chair Janet Yellen; Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn; former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh; current Fed Governor Jerome Powell, and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

Cohn and Powell are the two most likely to follow current Fed policy, while Taylor and Warsh are seen likely to push for raising interest rates at a faster clip and to argue for a quicker run-down in the bond portfolio accumulated after the 2008 crisis.

Most important to stock investors is the continuation of the so-called “Fed put”, or the expectation of easy monetary policy as stock prices fall that first came into prominence under former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan.

For years investors in stocks have assumed the Fed granted them a put option, effectively providing insurance against a market fall, by flooding money markets with cash and buying government bonds to keep interest rates low whenever economic growth slumped or geopolitical risks rose.

Under Bernanke, the Fed helped to navigate the economy out of the 2008 financial crisis until 2014 when he was succeeded by Yellen. During that time the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX rose nearly 40 percent. Since Yellen took over from him in February 2014, the index has gained a further 45 percent.

“I think in their hearts every modern Fed chair knows that the institution’s mandate has to include stock prices,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York.

President Trump has praised the record highs in U.S. stock prices, perhaps making it less likely that he would nominate someone who would deviate markedly from current Fed policy.

Following is a summary of possible markets reactions to the nomination of each name in Trump’s shortlist (in alphabetical order):

GARY COHN

A Cohn nomination would ”be met positively,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “The perception is that he is market friendly.”

Cohn is currently director of the White House National Economic Council and is a former president of investment bank Goldman Sachs.

“If (Cohn) were to reach that position I think the market would trade the dollar lower and you’d see a steepening of 5-30s in the U.S. yield curve, because he’d be viewed as having the biggest impact on inflation expectations moving forward,” said Kay Mirza, global head of FX trading at Goldman Sachs.

JEROME POWELL

A governor on the Federal Reserve board since 2012, Powell has yet to cast a dissenting vote against the Federal Open Market Committee’s decisions on monetary policy. His appointment would remove uncertainty and would likely see Fed policy continue little changed.

“Powell would follow very close to Yellen and would be a great choice for the market,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.

Importantly, Powell is seen as unafraid of reversing the current plan to wind down the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet if the economic or market outlook changed.

JOHN TAYLOR

Famous for a formulaic approach to monetary policy, including the so-called Taylor Rule, he is seen as likely to tighten monetary policy more quickly.

“Taylor would be a negative surprise for the stock market,” said Voya’s Zemsky. “Applying rules-based policy would bring closer the risk of a recession before the economic expansion plays out entirely.”

His nomination could also boost the U.S. dollar since by his own formula the Fed Funds rate, now at 1.25 percent, should be closer to 3.0 percent.

KEVIN WARSH

“If you are looking for something disruptive, put Kevin Warsh at the top of the Fed,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

Analysts do not think investors have priced in the probability of a Fed that raises interest rates more quickly and a Warsh appointment would likely trigger a spike in Treasury yields, a rise in the dollar and a fall in stocks.

Formerly Bernanke’s right-hand man on financial markets, Warsh quit the Fed in 2011 as he disagreed with the central bank’s second round of bond-buying and is seen unlikely to pursue a policy path of extraordinary measures if faced with another crisis.

”The balance sheet reduction program is the key policy tool for next year,“ said Lee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street. ”If (stock) markets started to come off Warsh would be less inclined to change the path.”

JANET YELLEN

Yellen has followed her predecessor’s path of data-driven and market-aware monetary policy and she has been cautious about generating strong reactions from financial markets by ensuring policy changes have been well telegraphed ahead of time.

“Yellen... would be the most obviously market-friendly situation,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. “The markets understand how she works and there’s less guesswork.”

The first New Zealand grand prix driver for 33 years otherwise sounded pretty happy with his day’s work, despite collecting a 25-place grid penalty before he had even stepped into the car at the U.S. Grand Prix.

Hartley completed 69 laps, more than a race distance, and went through the pre-set program with barely a hiccup in the Toro Rosso. At the end of the afternoon he was 17th.

He appeared completely unfazed when talking to reporters afterwards.

For a man who had not driven a Formula One car since 2010, another era altogether, and whose last single seater outing was in 2012, it all stacked up to an impressive and memorable experience.

“I‘m 27, I‘m not a young rookie,” he said by way of explanation for the laid-back approach.

”It was a pretty positive first day. I tried to not over-think it, I just tried to go out and see how I felt in the first session.

“I kept it (the car) on track, made good progression through the day, did a lot of practice starts, pitstop practice which was something quite new to me ... and it’s only taking two and a half seconds.”

A Le Mans 24 Hours winner with Porsche and also a world endurance champion, Hartley is no stranger to high performance racing but he recognized he still had a lot to learn, particularly through the quick corners, and to improve on before Sunday’s race.

Whatever his grid position after qualifying, the New Zealander will be starting at the back due to an engine switch he inherited as a result of being a late replacement for absent Frenchman Pierre Gasly.

Hartley cannot change that but there is unlikely to be any repeat of the helmet problem.

“We had some issues with the helmet lifting up and trying to choke me,” he said. “I guess they designed the car around a certain helmet and I’ve turned up with a different one. So we’re getting on top of that.”

The team added a small windshield and there will be continuing tweaks with the drivers’ seat but otherwise Hartley felt at home.

“I feel positive I can do the drive come Sunday,” he said.

“The feedback I got so far from everyone was positive. They were really happy with the long run and how I managed the tires at the end, which is a big part of the job.”",Motor racing: Relaxed Hartley avoids full throttle on F1 debut,https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-usa-hartley/relaxed-hartley-avoids-full-throttle-on-f1-debut-idINKBN1CQ012

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Trump’s fellow Republicans who control Congress will need at least some Democratic support to pass critical legislation in the coming months to avert a government shutdown and prevent an unprecedented U.S. debt default.

“I’ve been here with every president since Jerry Ford,” said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 and is its longest-serving member.

“I’ve always been willing to negotiate with anybody because they always keep their word. If you have a president who doesn’t keep his word, it makes it more difficult,” Leahy said when asked about Trump’s interactions with Congress.

Trump initially backed the bipartisan deal announced on Tuesday by Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for shoring up insurance marketplaces established under Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies to private insurers that Trump has scrapped. A day later, Trump disowned it.

Going forward, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said that while more collaboration with Trump is possible, “I think we have to know that we can’t count on him.”

Trump enraged Republicans in September with his collaboration with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and top House of Representatives Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Trump cut a short-term spending deal with them, blindsiding Republican leaders, and then discussed with them the outlines of a plan to revive protections for young adult immigrants dubbed “Dreamers” brought into the United States illegally as children.

On both healthcare and Dreamers, Trump has shown that while he relishes deal-making, he is quick to row back in the face of a conservative backlash. The president also has sent signals over the past few weeks that he is wavering on working with Democrats to help the Dreamers, making demands that could be a deal-breaker.

Republicans have worked seven years to get rid of Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, and many of them vehemently opposed the Alexander-Murray deal. It remains unclear whether it will ever come to a vote in the Senate or House.

Because spending legislation requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate and there are 52 Republican senators, it cannot pass without at least eight Democrats backing it. Because hard-line House conservatives often oppose spending bills, Democratic support is expected to be needed there as well.

A Dec. 8 deadline is looming for passing the spending measure needed to prevent a shutdown. Democrats could demand a steep price for their support, potentially an Obamacare fix and action to help the Dreamers.

Under a budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday night, Republicans need only a simple majority to pass Trump’s proposed major tax cuts, though he has urged Democrats to support the overhaul.

‘ZIGGING AND ZAGGING’

Schumer, who Trump earlier in the year called the Democrats’ “head clown” before their thaw last month, this week vented his frustration about the president, saying he “keeps zigging and zagging so it’s impossible to govern.”

“This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says ‘jump,’ he says ‘how high?'” Schumer told reporters on Wednesday.

Schumer and Pelosi dined at the White House with Trump last month, and left feeling as if they had a deal on a proposal to help continue protections for the Dreamers that the president has moved to end effective in March.

Within a day, Trump began distancing himself from that deal, with the White House later floating a series of hard-line immigration “principles,” including money for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border fiercely opposed by Democrats, that have thrown the entire effort into doubt.

Pelosi and Schumer argue their deal with Trump is still salvageable, as the president himself has not called it off.

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill acknowledged that the principles “don’t help” the effort. But Hammill said that would not stop Pelosi, a former House speaker first elected to the chamber in 1987, from engaging Trump in the future.

“It was always a case-by-case thing. It was never ‘the switch was on’” full-time, Hammill said.

There will be plenty of cases to come in the weeks ahead, giving Trump an opportunity to improve his relations with Democrats if that is what he wants, Hammill said.

As Congress and the White House approach the December deadline for settling fiscal affairs, Hammill said Trump can use that opportunity to stabilize Obamacare and shield Dreamers from deportation.

“If he’s unable to do that, we’re unable to work with him on his priorities,” including taxes, Hammill said.",Trump's Obamacare shift complicates ability to work with Democrats,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-democrats/trumps-obamacare-shift-complicates-ability-to-work-with-democrats-idUSKBN1CP2DS?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Halep became the first Romanian to reach the summit of the women’s rankings when she beat French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the semi-finals of the China Open in Beijing, a feat she feels is the high point of her career to date.

“The dream came true. Is just the best feeling that I ever had in my tennis career so far,” the 26-year-old told reporters in Singapore on Saturday.

“It’s nice. I‘m just enjoying the moment. I cannot describe in words what I feel, but it’s a good feeling. I‘m happy when I‘m going to the courts now,” added Halep, who has won 15 WTA tournaments since her breakthrough year in 2013.

Halep is planning a major celebration of her ascent to the top of the rankings at the end of the season but the Romanian remains aware that six of the other seven women at the WTA Finals could usurp her as world number one.

“Well, the day that I won the match against Ostapenko, that was the best day, by far, best feeling. But when I went home, I had all the friends, family close to me, and it was -- I had some good dinners with them,” she added.

”We celebrated a little bit. But I haven’t done a big party. So I‘m waiting to finish here to go to the holiday and then I will have a big party.

”I think for everyone here, the most important thing is to finish the year as number one, but it is not going to be easy. Here everyone is going to play the best tennis, and every match is going to be like a final, as I said many times.

“So I‘m not thinking about that. I play better when I‘m not thinking about the ranking. I‘m just going to give my best, to try to be focused on what I have to play in each match, and we will see at the end who is going to be number one.”

After the win over Ostapenko, Halep was beaten in the Beijing final by Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia and the Romanian will have a little bit of revenge in mind when the duo open Red Group round-robin play with a showdown on Monday.

“She played really well in China and she deserved to win that title,” Halep added of Garcia.

In a speech at the opening of the Baghdad International Exhibition, Falih praised the cooperation between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which he said had helped to boost global oil prices.

Speaking later to reporters, he said Saudi Arabia and Iraq were in agreement on the need to “fully comply” with cutbacks in crude output agreed by OPEC, Russia and several other producers to push up prices.

“The market has improved a lot but has still some way to go,” he said, adding that the compliance of the 24 nations taking part in the cutbacks deal “exceeds 100 percent”.

Falih is the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad for several decades.

The two countries began taking steps towards detente in 2015 after 25 years of troubled relations starting with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Falih visited Iraq earlier this year.

“The best example of the importance of cooperation between our two countries is the improvement and stability trend seen in the oil market,” said Falih, to applause from the audience of Iraqi ministers, senior officials and businessmen.

Saudi Arabia and Iraq are the largest and second largest producers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The report could not be verified by Reuters. Two senior Turkish economy officials told Reuters that Turkey has not received any notice from the United States about such penalties, adding that U.S. regulators would normally inform the finance ministry’s financial crimes investigation board.

Turkish authorities are expected to issue a statement to issue the address the issue soon, the senior economy officials said.

The report comes as relations between Washington and Ankara have been strained by a series of diplomatic rows, prompting both countries to cut back issuing visas to each other’s citizens.

Haberturk did not name the six banks potentially facing the fines. One bank will face a penalty in excess of $5 billion, while the rest of the fines will be lower, it said.

U.S. officials will notify the banks of their penalties in the coming days and the banks are likely to be able to negotiate down the fines, Haberturk said.

U.S. authorities have hit global banks with billions of dollars in fines over violations of sanctions with Iran and other countries in recent years.

U.S. prosecutors last month charged a former Turkish economy minister and the ex-head of a state-owned bank with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran’s behalf.

President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed the charges as politically motivated, and tantamount to an attack on the Turkish Republic.

The charges stem from the case against Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was arrested in the United States over sanctions evasion last year. Erdogan has said U.S. authorities had “ulterior motives” in charging Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty.",Turkish banks could face big U.S. fines over Iran: report,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-turkey-banks/turkish-banks-could-face-big-u-s-fines-over-iran-report-idUKKBN1CQ0I6?il=0

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idINKBN1CQ072?il=0

The Spanish government is holding a special cabinet meeting to deal with the crisis after Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont wrote Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy a letter threatening a formal declaration of independence.

Bartomeu previously said the club members would be able to help decide Barcelona’s future but speaking at the annual general meeting, the president was clear about his preferred option.

“You can be sure that this board will always act in the club’s defence,” said Bartomeu.

”We will never put the club nor its presence in any competition at risk. That’s why, to all the socios (members), I say that we want to continue playing in La Liga and, as of today, our participation [in La Liga] is guaranteed.

“It’s mutually beneficial for La Liga and Barcelona for that link to continue.”

Bartomeu reiterated the club’s call for “dialogue, respect and sport”, a phrase which they displayed on a giant banner before their Champions League victory over Olympiakos on Wednesday.

The president expressed his disapproval at the arrest of two leaders of the Catalan independence movement, Catalan National Assembly (ANC) head Jordi Sanchez and independence group Omnium’s leader Jordi Cuixart.

”We know that Barca is ‘more than a club’ and must be a space for harmony and respect,“ added Bartomeu. ”There must be respect for everyone, minorities and majorities, to think what they things, all institutions and people.

“For that reasons, it’s unacceptable that in this century there are people in prison for their political ideas.”

The club also confirmed their predicted forecast of a record revenue of 897 million euros ($1 billion) for the 2017-18 season and said they were making good progress in negotiations to find a sponsor for Camp Nou, which they are planning to rebuild.

“The renovation of Camp Nou is essential to achieve new income for the club,” explained Bartomeu.

“In that regard, negotiations to find a company to sponsor the stadium are going well.”

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

The government has been plagued all week about questions about the finance minister, Bill Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell. Some have questioned whether Morneau would be forced to resign.

The focus has been a rare stumble for Trudeau’s government, which marked two years in office this month and has mostly maneuvered its way out of political trouble partly because of Trudeau’s personal popularity and the youthful momentum of the Liberals after 10 years of Conservative rule.

“They’re politically very astute in a whole bunch of areas but in issues management and parliamentary management they seem to be ham-fisted,” said Andrew Graham, professor at the school of policy studies at Queen’s University.

With Trudeau’s strong defense of Morneau, and the finance minister likely to unveil a smaller budget deficit in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update, Liberals have a temporary chance to refocus on good news.

“Economic conditions are a bedrock of whether people feel good or bad about how politicians are performing, and the economy is doing very well for most people,” said Abacus Data pollster Bruce Anderson.

Morneau said on Thursday he will put his assets in a blind trust and divest stock in a publicly traded family business. That comes after weeks of backlash over tax reform that has become a major obstacle for Trudeau’s government.

Opposition parties from both the political left and right have seized on the ethics scandal, trying to tie Trudeau’s team to what they say is an entitled Liberal Party that has previously faced corruption charges.

“The opposition has changed the focus from substance to ethics, and they won’t let that go that easily,” said Genevieve Tellier, a political professor at the University of Ottawa.

But Tellier said Trudeau’s decision to fill his cabinet with political rookies - including Morneau - rather than turning to the old Liberal guard, could limit the ability of the opposition to land many ethical punches.

Moreover, Morneau is respected by markets.

“I think the prime minister would be very cautious about changing his finance minister. ... (Morneau) presents a reassuring image, he doesn’t scare the markets,” Tellier said.

Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker put it more bluntly: “They really don’t have a choice but to tough it out and hope some event will transpire to distract the hyenas.”

The expected budget improvement in Tuesday’s fall fiscal update could also give Morneau the leeway to woo voters with more spending or debt reduction.

“The way the numbers are playing out, they are in a fairly favorable fiscal position,” said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.

Morneau spokesman Dan Lauzon said the finance minister has no plans to change his strategy, and would keep focus on fiscal stimulus matters: “He is in this for the long run, and he won’t let distractions get in the way.”",Canada's Liberals look to economy to guide them past ethics scandal,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CP2SE-OCADN

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

The Coalition for the American Dream intends to ask Congress to pass bipartisan legislation this year that would allow these immigrants, often referred to as “Dreamers,” to continue working in the United States, the documents said.

Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Intel Corp, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], IBM Corp, Marriott International Inc and other top U.S. companies are listed as members, one of the documents shows. Reuters was first to report the news.

Amazon, Intel, Uber and Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] confirmed their membership, but the other companies did not immediately comment. It is possible that plans to launch the group could change.

“We’re pleased to join with other organizations in urging Congress to pass legislation to protect Dreamers,” Intel spokesman Will Moss said in a statement.

Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber, said, “Uber joined the Coalition for the American Dream because we stand with the Dreamers. We’ve also held town halls, provided legal support and launched an online Dreamer Resource Center for any of our drivers.”

The push for this legislation comes after President Donald Trump’s September decision to allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to expire in March. That program, established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allows approximately 900,000 illegal immigrants to obtain work permits.

Some 800 companies signed a letter to Congressional leaders after Trump’s decision, calling for legislation protecting Dreamers. That effort was spearheaded by a pro-immigration reform group Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg co-founded in 2013 called FWD.us.

Many of the companies that endorsed that letter are named as joining the new coalition. The group has planned to take out ads in news publications, though this is subject to change, according to an email last week seen by Reuters.

“Dreamers are part of our society, defend our country, and support our economy,” said one of the coalition documents, which is being shared by the group to recruit additional companies.

A signup form for the group said 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies employ DACA recipients.

Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He has left the fate of DACA up to Congress.

Action may come in December, when Congress must pass a spending bill to keep the U.S. government open. Democrats have considered insisting on help for the Dreamers as their price for providing votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown.

“No politician wants to go home for the holidays and read stories about how this is going to be DACA recipients’ last holidays in the U.S.,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, in an interview on Thursday. He declined to comment on the new coalition.

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idUKKBN1CQ06R

Underlying measures of inflation watched by the Bank of Canada also firmed, with CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, rising to 1.5 percent.

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, held at 1.8 percent after the previous month was revised higher, while CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, was unchanged at 1.5 percent.

The Bank of Canada, which is largely expected to hold interest rates at 1 percent next week after two back-to-back increases, has an inflation target of 2 percent.

Overall, prices were up in six of the eight major components of the consumer price index, led by a 3.8 percent annual increase in transportation costs. That was driven by higher gasoline prices amid supply disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey.

“It is Congress’ responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iran’s reckless behavior,” Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters.

“Immediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran’s missile proliferation,” they said.

President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord.

That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or

“snap back,” sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement.

However, many of Trump’s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so.

Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions.

In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA.

Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trump’s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact.

Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iran’s ballistic missile program.

It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate.

The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shi‘ite militia’s allies in Lebanon’s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier.

Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY, which are expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies, up 1.16 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P sectors.

“It’s just a reaction to the thought that just maybe there might be something coming from Congress in the way of tax reform,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.

“Everybody had kind of given up hope, and after the comments over the last 24 hours, people are like, shoot, this may actually happen.”

Housing stocks .HGX also moved higher, up 0.70 percent, after data from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September.

The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.49 percent, its biggest daily gain in a month, with the euro EUR= down 0.69 percent to $1.1768.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

European shares rebounded from their worst day in two months, also helped by well-received earnings reports for Volvo and Ericsson and high German producer-price inflation numbers.

The Senate budget resolution also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher, with two-year yields reaching a near nine-year high, as investors reduced bond holdings on worries about more inflation and federal borrowing.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid.
The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idINKBN1CQ06R?il=0

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

Government agencies and energy firms previously declined to identify any of the victims in the attacks described in June’s confidential report.","U.S. warns public about attacks on energy, industrial firms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-energy/u-s-warns-public-about-attacks-on-energy-industrial-firms-idUSKBN1CQ0IN

Left-arm wrist spinner Yadav and right-arm leg break bowler Chahal have established themselves as India’s first-choice attacking combination, keeping veterans Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja out for the third consecutive limited-overs series.

Yadav and Chahal combined to pick up 13 wickets in India’s recent 4-1 ODI series victory over Australia.

“We need to find our best bowling combination before we reach the World Cup (in 2019) stage,” Kohli told reporters on Saturday.

”We always had in mind to bring wrist spinners into play. We honestly did not think of playing the two together but they are so good together, it is tempting to play them in every game.

“Ashwin and Jadeja have played limited-overs cricket for last six-seven years regularly. These youngsters have stepped up and it creates a strong pool for us before the World Cup.”

New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson believes his side face an uphill task to beat India in their own backyard.

India hold a dominant record in bilateral ODI series at home, having lost just two out of 16 played since their defeat by Australia in 2009-10.

Last year, the Kiwis forced a decider on Indian soil but the hosts recorded a convincing 190-run victory in the final Visakhapatnam ODI to claim the series 3-2.

“India’s record is very good at home. They are a very hard team to beat. We know that, at home in particular, they are the strongest team in the world,” Williamson said.

“People talk a lot about adjusting to the conditions in India, and that’s is really important.

The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel.

The Syrian military said it came under attack in Quneitra province, which sits near the Golan Heights territory that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.

“The Israeli enemy assaulted one of our military positions this morning, which led to material damages,” it said.

During Syria’s more than six-year-old conflict, Israel has returned fire across the border, including stray shells from fighting among Syrian factions.

The military statement suggested it may start escalating such retaliations. “Whether errant fire or not, any future occurrences will force the Israel Defense Forces to intensify its response,” it said.

Israel “holds the Syrian regime responsible and won’t tolerate any attempt to breach Israeli sovereignty,” it added.

In its own statement, the Syrian military warned against “such aggressive acts” and said it held Israel responsible for any consequent results.

Israel has also carried out targeted air strikes in Syria during the war, alarmed by the expanding influence of Iran, the Syrian government’s ally. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah nearly 100 times in recent years.

Iran’s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syria’s airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus this week. The general signed an agreement with his Syrian counterpart to further boost military cooperation, Iranian state news agency IRNA said on Saturday.

Rebel factions fighting the Damascus government in the multi-sided war hold swathes of Quneitra, while the army and allied militias control another part of the province.

Both warring Syrian sides accused each other of prompting the Israeli attack on Saturday.

The army said militants in nearby territory fired mortar rounds into the Golan Heights.

Phil Schiller, Apple’s chief marketing officer, touted the animoji feature during the iPhone X launch event on Sept. 12, calling it a “great experience” for communicating with family and friends.

Emonster chief executive Enrique Bonansea launched an animated texting app in 2014 called Animoji and registered a trademark on the product name, according to the lawsuit.

Apple had full knowledge of Emonster’s app because it is available for download on Apple’s App Store, the lawsuit said.

“Apple decided to take the name and pretend to the world that ‘Animoji’ was original to Apple,” Emonster said in the complaint.

Emonster said it is seeking unspecified money damages and a court order blocking Apple from using the term while the lawsuit is pending.

The LAPD robbery and homicide division interviewed a potential sexual assault victim, spokesman Kevin Maiberger told Reuters. No further information was given on who made the allegations or where the alleged incident occurred.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.

The move follows allegations reported earlier this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The New York Police Department said last week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

The Los Angeles Times newspaper said Thursday that the allegation made to the LAPD came from an unnamed well-known Italian model and actress, who told police detectives that Weinstein raped her in a room at a Beverly Hills hotel after a film event in February 2013.

FILE PHOTO: Solar electric panels are shown installed on the roof of the Hanover Olympic building, the first building to offer individual solar-powered net-zero apartments in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Top independent installer Sunrun Inc (RUN.O) and smaller rivals, many of which are part of an aggressive industry lobbying effort opposed to new tariffs on panels, are warning homeowners considering going solar to sign up before tariffs cause prices to rise.

On its web site, Sunrun warns visitors that panel prices could double in 2018, raising the cost of an average installation by $3,000.

“With the uncertainty of the upcoming tariffs on solar panels, there’s no better time to go solar with Sunrun,” the company’s web site says.

Smaller, local installers and solar advocates from California to Massachusetts are also raising the prospect of higher prices at sales consultations, in blog posts and at community events like farmer’s markets.

“We are really urging people not to wait until 2018,” said Craig Forman, who leads a pro-solar community group in Newton, Massachusetts, that refers interested residents to two local solar contractors.

The marketing strategy comes at a time when the U.S. residential solar industry is in a slump. The new approach, however, has not reversed a slowdown in sales.

There are signs the threat of higher prices may be helping the sales of some installers in the short term. In the third quarter, the number of new U.S. solar permits issued fell 11 percent from the previous year, though that was an improvement from the 24 percent and 16 percent drops in the first and second quarters, according to OhmHome, an online resource for consumers interested in going solar.

In California, the No. 1 solar market, residential solar permits fell 20 percent in the third quarter from the previous year. That was an improvement from the 30 percent decline year to date.

In April, U.S. solar panel maker Suniva filed a petition seeking relief from what it says are a glut of imported panels that have depressed prices and made it difficult for American producers to compete. Last month, the International Trade Commission found imports had harmed domestic manufacturers, setting the stage for Trump to consider imposing tariffs or other relief to protect the sector.

Solar installers, including the industry’s primary trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, oppose the petition on grounds that it would drive up the price of solar.

The residential solar industry is widely expected to be able to withstand the shock of higher prices better than the utility-scale sector because panels make up a far smaller portion of rooftop systems’ total cost - about 3 percent, according to Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of online solar marketplace EnergySage.

Nevertheless, any uptick in prices would pose an additional challenge to rooftop installers experiencing a far more sluggish market than just a couple of years ago, when installations were routinely doubling annually. For sales processes that can take up to a year from when a homeowner first inquires about going solar, the trade case is giving potential customers a palpable reason to act now.

“Installers are looking for any reason to get back in touch with the customer and a sense of urgency that will make their sales process be shorter,” Aggarwal said.

Not all installers are talking about the trade case. Tesla, for instance, said it is awaiting the final outcome of the case before alerting potential customers.

Gigawatt Inc, a Placentia, California-based company that installs systems under the name GoGreenSolar.com, has seen a “spike” in sales since it began talking to customers about the trade case, according to CEO Deep Patel.

“In the consumers’ mind prices are going to go down.

Under that scenario, either Powell or Taylor would take the reins from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in early February, and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when Stanley Fischer retired this month.

“That is something that is under consideration, but he hasn’t ruled out a number of options. He’ll have an announcement on that soon, in the coming days,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday.

Making Powell, a soft-spoken centrist who has supported Yellen’s gradual approach to raising interest rates, the next Fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investors crave.

The addition of Taylor, who has backed an overhaul of the Fed and embraced a more rigid rule-oriented monetary policy, would be a feather in the cap of conservative Republicans who feel that monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen, who was named as Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and has led the central bank since February 2014.

“I think Powell might be the safer pick insofar as we know what we’re getting,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. “He’s a guy who obviously knows the Fed culture, how the (policy-setting) committee operates, so for some of those soft skills we know he would be effective.”

Powell has embraced the Yellen Fed’s monetary policy, keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wages higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation.

Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lays out where interest rates ought to be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies that rates should be higher than they are now.

Yellen, speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Friday evening, mounted a strong defense of the tools the Fed has used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there was a risk of another crisis in which those “unconventional policies” may be needed again.

Yellen, who Trump has indicated could still be named to another term as Fed chair, was not asked about the Fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process.

“SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT”

Although Taylor is highly regarded within the Fed, his rule-based rate-setting position has spurred criticism that he would handcuff U.S. monetary policy.

Taylor pushed back at a meeting at the Boston Fed on Saturday, saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rules and did not want to tie the Fed’s hands or suggest that he was motivated by a distrust of policymakers.

“I think that’s completely incorrect,” he said. “I trust policymakers; (rules) are an effort to make policy better.”

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen speaks during a news conference after a two-day Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) policy meeting, in Washington, U.S., September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo

Some analysts suggest that fears that Taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the Fed, as some Republicans in Congress hope, are likely exaggerated.

“There is some scope for disappointment if people think putting Taylor in will just lead to mechanical-based policy,” Feroli said.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, speaking with reporters on Friday, seemed to agree.

“Even if you pick a rule, the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy,” she said. “But I do think being systematic, looking at the kinds of information we look at systematically over time, articulating our strategy for policy and being less discretionary is a good idea.”

At the same time, there are concerns that the combination of Powell and Taylor atop the world’s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to markets.

It is unclear whether Trump, who has criticized Yellen’s stewardship but also said on several occasions that he preferred rates to stay low, wants to dramatically alter the Fed’s direction.

Although he appears to be tilting to Powell and Taylor, in addition to Yellen the Republican president has interviewed his top economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh for the Fed chief position.","Trump considers Fed's Powell, economist Taylor to lead central bank",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-considers-feds-powell-economist-taylor-to-lead-central-bank-idUSKBN1CP29G?il=0

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idUKKBN1CQ070

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Representatives for LaBeouf did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

The actor, best known for playing Sam Witwicky in the “Transformers” franchise, was arrested in the lobby of his hotel in downtown Savannah in July after he became unruly.

Videos released by police from bodycam footage showed the actor hurling expletive-filled barbs at officers as he questioned the reason for his arrest. He was booked into the Chatham County Jail and released a few hours later.

LaBeouf at the time put out a statement on Twitter saying he was “deeply ashamed” of his behavior and that his actions “warrant a very sincere apology to the arresting officers, and I am grateful for their restraint.”

“My outright disrespect for authority is problematic to say the least, and completely destructive to say the worst. It is a new low. A low I hope is a bottom. I have been struggling with addiction publicly for far too long, and I am actively taking steps toward securing my sobriety and hope I can be forgiven for my mistakes,” he said on Twitter.

The actor, who broke out as a child star on the Disney Channel, has had numerous brushes with the law in recent years. In January, he was arrested after a scuffle outside a New York museum where he was chanting: ”He will not divide us,” during a live-streamed protest against President Donald Trump.

In 2014, he was arrested in New York after disturbing a performance of the musical “Cabaret” on Broadway, which led to him pleading guilty to a disorderly conduct violation and receiving outpatient care for addiction.

L‘Assemblée avait déjà adopté dans la nuit de jeudi à vendredi une autre mesure controversée du projet de budget 2018, l‘instauration du prélèvement forfaitaire unique (PFU) sur les revenus du capital.

La suppression de l‘ISF a été votée par les groupes de La République en marche (LREM), du MoDem et des Constructifs. Le groupe Les Républicains (LR) a majoritairement voté pour, après avoir réclamé en vain que l‘ISF, dont il salue la disparition, ne soit pas remplacé par l‘IFI.

Les groupes de gauche - La France insoumise (LFI), Gauche démocrate et républicaine (GDR, PC) et Nouvelle gauche (ex-PS) - ont voté contre après avoir défendu sans succès des amendements visant à maintenir l‘ISF.

Sur 98 votants, il y a eu 77 votes pour et 19 contre.

“Un totem idéologique vieux de 35 ans est tombé”, s‘est félicité Bruno Le Maire, le ministre de l‘Economie et des Finances.

L‘IFI et le PFU, ou “flat tax”, sont deux des engagements électoraux d‘Emmanuel Macron et s‘inscrivent dans une volonté de favoriser une réorientation de l‘épargne vers le financement des entreprises.

Ces deux dispositions ont cristallisé les critiques de l‘opposition - qui dénonce un “budget pour les riches” - mais aussi suscité des réserves au sein même de la majorité présidentielle.

Des accusations rejetées par le gouvernement, qui insiste en retour sur les gains de pouvoir d‘achat permis par la suppression des cotisations sociales salariales (assurances chômage et santé) et les revalorisations des minima sociaux prévues dans le projet de loi de financement de la sécurité sociale (PLFSS).

Pour atténuer l‘effet de la suppression de l‘ISF, la commission des Finances de l‘Assemblée a également adopté des amendements alourdissant la fiscalité sur les signes extérieurs de richesse, avec une hausse des droits sur les yachts de luxe, de la taxe forfaitaire sur la cession des objets et métaux précieux ainsi que la création d‘une taxe additionnelle sur les immatriculations de voitures de sport et de luxe (hors véhicules de collection).

Face aux critiques croissantes, le gouvernement a accéléré le tempo et avancé à jeudi le début de la discussion des articles concernant la suppression de l‘ISF et la mise en place du PFU, qui auraient normalement dû être examinés plus tard dans la discussion.

L‘IFI, applicable aux seuls patrimoines immobiliers, ne devrait rapporter que 900 millions d‘euros par an, soit 3,2 milliards de moins que l‘ISF, qui était acquitté par plus de 340.000 contribuables.

Les députés devraient achever samedi, voire lundi, l‘examen de la partie recettes du PLF 2018, qui sera soumise à un vote solennel le mardi 24 octobre.

Les députés examineront dans la foulée le projet de loi de financement de la Sécurité sociale (PLFSS) pour 2018, un vote solennel étant prévu le 31 octobre avant que ne commence l‘examen de la seconde partie du PLF, celle des dépenses.

The Mercedes-Benz parent has problems aplenty, which bumper third-quarter sales do little to change. A plan to carve out its car and truck units might help lift its valuation if that eventually led to a separate listing. But at the current pace of progress, investors have no reason to give the company much credit.

Friday’s third-quarter results were a reminder of the rocky ride that Daimler faces in the short term. One-off costs such as diesel-emissions fixes meant third-quarter operating profit fell by 14 percent from a year earlier to 3.5 billion euros. That was despite record sales of almost 600,000 Mercedes-Benz and smart automobiles. But the real challenges for auto groups like the Mercedes maker are far bigger and include a margin-sapping shift to electric vehicles and potentially declining car ownership from the growth of ride-hailing apps.

There’s no fighting these trends, but Daimler could do shareholders a favour by spinning off its trucks and buses arms, which merit a higher valuation than the conglomerate’s lowly multiple of 7.7 times forward earnings. First, the division faces less fierce competition than the cars business. Second, online shopping has created a boom in logistics and delivery vehicles. Daimler trucks and buses together brought in more than 37 billion euros of revenue last year, but barely show up in the German group’s share price because of a huge conglomerate discount. Spinning them off could boost the group’s value by more than 30 billion euros, Evercore ISI analysts estimate.

For example, the company on Monday announced its plan to split into three parts – trucks and buses, cars and vans, and financial services.

(Reuters) - Speaking as a folksy physician running for Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam vowed in a recent campaign ad to fight Donald Trump on cuts to education funding, environmental protections and health care access.

But Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.

The balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.

He is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

The Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.

After denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.

“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.

Most polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.

A recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.

Distain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.

Yet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.

“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.

The Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.

Northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.

“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.

The strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

She said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.

“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.

Gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.

Vice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.

Democratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.

She admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed via email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.

The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.

The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.

U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.

Homeland Security and FBI representatives could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.

Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks, said the report describes activities from two or three groups that have stolen user credentials and spied on organizations in the United States and other nations, but not launched destructive attacks.

“This is very aggressive activity,” said Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos.

He said the report appears to describe groups working in the interests of the Russian government, though he declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, he said.

The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but he added that it is still troubling: “We don’t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”

The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.

Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.

The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day.

In outlining the cabinet’s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional government’s push for independence.

“We will ask the Senate, with the aim of protecting the general interest of the nation, to authorize the government... to sack the Catalan president and his government,” Rajoy told a news conference.

It is the first time since Spain’s return to democracy in the late 1970s that the central government has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid.

Direct rule will include full control of the region’s police, finances and public media. It will also curb the powers of the regional parliament.

Rajoy said he did not intend to use those special powers for more than six months and he would call a regional election as soon as the situation was back to normal.

“Our objective is to restore the law and a normal cohabitation among citizens, which has deteriorated a lot, continue with the economic recovery, which is under threat today in Catalonia, and celebrate elections in a situation of normality,” Rajoy said.

The measures must now be approved by Spain’s upper house, the Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Oct. 27.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who was meeting with his government, will deliver an address at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), his office said. He is due to join the protests in Barcelona.

Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, but on Thursday he threatened to press ahead with a more formal one unless the government agreed to a dialogue.

The Catalan parliament is expected to decide on Monday whether it will hold a plenary session next week to proclaim formally the republic of Catalonia.

Catalan media have said Puigdemont could decide to dissolve the regional parliament himself right after independence is proclaimed and call elections before the Spanish senate makes direct rule effective.

Under Catalan laws, those elections would take place within two months.

UNSUSTAINABLE

The independence push has brought on Spain’s worst political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981 several years after the end of the Franco dictatorship. It has met with strong opposition across the rest of Spain, divided Catalonia itself, and raised the prospect of prolonged street protests

It has also led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and prompted hundreds of firms to move their headquarters from Catalonia. Rajoy on Saturday urged firms to stay in the region.

Madrid has insisted that Puigdemont has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, including with a referendum on Oct. 1 that was declared illegal.

“The rulers of Catalonia have respected neither the law on which is based our democracy nor the general interest,” the government said in a memorandum obtained by Reuters. “This situation is unsustainable.”

The main opposition Socialists said on Friday they would back special measures and had agreed on the holding of regional elections in January.

Rajoy also received the backing of the head of state, King Felipe, on Friday, who said at a public ceremony that “Catalonia is and will remain an essential part” of Spain.

Regional authorities said about 90 percent of those who cast ballots voted for independence. But only 43 percent of voters participated and opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Pro-independence groups have mustered more than one million people onto the streets in protest at Madrid’s refusal to negotiate a solution.

Heavy-handed police tactics to shut down the Oct. 1 independence referendum drew criticism from human rights groups and secessionists have accused Madrid of “repression” and of taking “political prisoners” after two senior independence campaigners were jailed on charges of sedition.

Hacking group Anonymous on Saturday joined a campaign called “Free Catalonia” and took down the website of Spain’s constitutional court.

Spain’s national security department had said on Friday it was expecting such an attack to take place, though nobody was available on Saturday to confirm it.","Spain will sack Catalan government, call regional election",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-government-meets-to-impose-direct-rule-in-rebel-catalonia-idUSKBN1CQ0AQ

Andrej Babis’s ANO party held a narrowing double-digit lead going into the vote, which started Friday and ends at 2 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Saturday.

The Central European country has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but voters have grown tired of traditional political players, giving rise to Babis and other protest parties.

As many as nine parties had a chance of winning seats in the 200-member lower house, possibly complicating coalition-building for the victor.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government along with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s centre-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

Final polls gave ANO about 25-27 percent support, at least twice that of the Social Democrats in second place.

Babis has taken a tough line against further EU integration, accepting refugees and adoption of the euro, raising the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc.

However, he also praises EU membership and doesn’t share the illiberal ideology seen in right-wing governments in Budapest and Warsaw.

Concerns about Babis mainly centre on his strong managerial style and vast business influence that would be amplified by him becoming prime minister.

Babis has maintained his popularity despite accusations of conflicts of interest related to his food, chemical and agriculture business holdings, which were placed in a trust earlier this year.

He also faces police charges that he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his empire, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing, saying the charges were a plot by opponents keen to push him out of politics.

“The more people organise campaigns against him the more it helps him among others,” said ANO voter Alena Chlostova.

Political analysts expect the current coalition to remain with ANO at the helm, or an ANO tie-up with centre-right parties. Any deal may run up against demands by potential partners that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because of the fraud charges against him.

If talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO may form a cabinet with backing from the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy party whose support ticked up in final pre-election polls.

But many voters are wary of Babis and his pledges to run the state with a businessman’s touch.

“His idea that you can run the state like a business is out of place. His firm belongs to him but the state does not,” Milos Ruml, a Prague pensioner, said after voting for the Social Democrats.

ANO has won support from both right and left with pledges to boost investment in shoddy roads, turf out corrupt politicians and reject any EU-wide schemes to resettle migrants from the Middle East and Africa.

Babis’s swipes at Brussels play well with eurosceptic Czechs and although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a part in campaigning, with most parties taking a similar tough stance.

The anti-immigrant mood mirrors similar trends in neighbouring countries. Parties opposed to immigration did well in Germany’s election in September and in Austria’s last week.

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

It would be the first group to break quarter a century of dominance by two mainstream center-right and center-left parties, highlighting a shifting political landscape in Europe where an influx of refugees have given rise to protest groups.

At 7.2 percent, the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka were on course for their worst result since the country peacefully split with Slovakia in 1993.

The Czech economy has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union in the past four years, but the Social Democrats - who led a government with ANO and another partner - have not been able to capitalize.

Instead, ANO and other anti-establishment groups took advantage of voters’ disgust with politics as usual by promising to week out corruption, fight deeper European Union integration and stop the country from accepting quotas for taking in refugees imposed by Brussels.

Babis himself has promised to bring a businessman’s touch to government, resonating with voters.

Result projections, modeled on actual voting results with 58.6 percent of voting stations reporting, showed the center-right Civic Democrats to be the second strongest party, with 11.4 percent of the vote. Eight parties in all would win seats.

The Social Democrats or the Civic Democrats have led every Czech cabinet since Czechoslovakia split, apart from caretaker administrations.

EUROSCEPTICS

Babis has taken a tough line against further EU integration, accepting refugees and adoption of the euro, raising the prospect he may join Hungary and Poland on a collision course with the bloc.

His swipes at Brussels play well with eurosceptic Czechs. However, Babis also praises EU membership and doesn’t share the relatively illiberal ideology seen in governments in Budapest and Warsaw.

Babis has maintained his popularity despite accusations of conflicts of interest related to his food, chemical and agriculture business holdings, which were placed in a trust earlier this year.

Concerns about Babis mainly center on his strong managerial style and vast business and media influence that would be amplified by him becoming prime minister.

He also faces police charges that he illegally received a 2 million euro EU subsidy when he ran his empire, before entering politics. He has denied wrongdoing, saying the charges were a plot by opponents keen to push him out of politics.

“The more people organize campaigns against him the more it helps him among others,” said ANO voter Alena Chlostova.

Coalition talks are likely to take weeks.

If talks with mainstream parties fail, there is also the possibility ANO may form a cabinet with backing from the Communists and the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SDP) party.

Czech President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart. By custom, he asks someone to lead talks before appointing a prime minister.

He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while battling police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SDP or the Communists.

The British government said Mugabe’s appointment was “surprising and disappointing” and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO’s global work.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday.

The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country’s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister.

In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as “a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all”.

The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO’s first African director-general, added: “Today I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.”

But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was “shocked and deeply concerned” to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe’s “long track record of human rights violations”.

Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was “deeply disappointing and wrong” and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.

“Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,” Farrar said. “Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,” he said.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency’s work.

“Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,” he said by e-mail.

Human rights activists also criticised the move.

Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as “sickening”.

“The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa — and its health system — into a basket-case,” he said.

The Spanish government is holding a special cabinet meeting to deal with the crisis after Catalonia’s president Carles Puigdemont wrote Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy a letter threatening a formal declaration of independence.

Bartomeu previously said the club members would be able to help decide Barcelona’s future but speaking at the annual general meeting, the president was clear about his preferred option.

“You can be sure that this board will always act in the club’s defence,” said Bartomeu.

”We will never put the club nor its presence in any competition at risk. That’s why, to all the socios (members), I say that we want to continue playing in La Liga and, as of today, our participation [in La Liga] is guaranteed.

“It’s mutually beneficial for La Liga and Barcelona for that link to continue.”

Bartomeu reiterated the club’s call for “dialogue, respect and sport”, a phrase which they displayed on a giant banner before their Champions League victory over Olympiakos on Wednesday.

The president expressed his disapproval at the arrest of two leaders of the Catalan independence movement, Catalan National Assembly (ANC) head Jordi Sanchez and independence group Omnium’s leader Jordi Cuixart.

”We know that Barca is ‘more than a club’ and must be a space for harmony and respect,“ added Bartomeu. ”There must be respect for everyone, minorities and majorities, to think what they things, all institutions and people.

“For that reasons, it’s unacceptable that in this century there are people in prison for their political ideas.”

The club also confirmed their predicted forecast of a record revenue of 897 million euros ($1 billion) for the 2017-18 season and said they were making good progress in negotiations to find a sponsor for Camp Nou, which they are planning to rebuild.

“The renovation of Camp Nou is essential to achieve new income for the club,” explained Bartomeu.

“In that regard, negotiations to find a company to sponsor the stadium are going well.”

More than 500,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled across the border to Bangladesh following a counter-insurgency offensive by Myanmar’s army in the wake of militant attacks on security forces.

U.N. officials have described Myanmar’s strategy as “ethnic cleansing”. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States held Myanmar’s military leadership responsible for its harsh crackdown.

Guo Yezhou, a deputy head of the Chinese Communist Party’s international department, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that China condemned the attacks in Rakhine and understands and supports Myanmar’s efforts to protect peace and stability there.

China and Myanmar have a deep, long-standing friendship, and China believes Myanmar can handle its problems on its own, he added.

Asked why China’s approach to the Rohingya crisis was different from Western nations, Guo said that China’s principle was not to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

“Based on experience, you can see recently the consequences when one country interferes in another. We won’t do it,” he said, without offering any examples of when interventions go wrong.

China does not want instability in Myanmar as it inevitably will be affected as they share a long land border, Guo said.

“We condemn violent and terrorist acts,” he added.

Guo’s department has been at the forefront of building relations with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who visited China in 2015 at the Communist Party’s invitation, rather than the Chinese government‘s.

Department head Song Tao also visited Myanmar in August and met Suu Kyi.

Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar in large numbers since late August when Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape.

The European Union and the United States have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leadership.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.","Image of the United States has plunged under Trump, survey shows",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-image-survey/image-of-the-united-states-has-plunged-under-trump-survey-shows-idUSKBN19I00F

Na conversa, da qual participaram também os ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, e da Secretaria de Governo, Antonio Imbassahy, Temer afirmou que se transição e idade mínima forem aprovados pelo Congresso, “já estaria de bom tamanho”.

Padilha acrescentou, então, a necessidade do corte de privilégios aos servidores, afirmando que esses três itens preservariam 75 por cento da reforma planejada pelo governo.

O presidente ainda admitiu, na entrevista, que não sabe se o governo terá condições de levar adiante a reforma, mesmo limitada, ainda em 2017, como pretendia.

“O ideal é que isso seja aprovado neste ano. Agora, eu faço mais uma ressalva aqui, para tirar qualquer pretensão. Temos de consultar as bancadas novamente, como foi feito na primeira vez. Na primeira vez estava tudo ajustado para aprovar, não fosse uma certa irresponsabilidade denunciativa”, disse Temer, fazendo referência à primeira denúncia apresentada contra ele pelo ex-procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, em junho.

“Então, vamos fazer uma nova avaliação e verificar se é possível ou não. E tentar aprovar este ano”, acrescentou.

O presidente disse ainda que poderá enviar o pacote de medidas de ajuste fiscal, com que a equipe econômica conta para fechar o orçamento, por projeto de lei, e não por medida provisória. Entre os temas estão a suspensão do reajuste dos servidores, a elevação da contribuição previdenciária dos servidores de 11 por cento para 14 por cento e a equiparação do modelo de tributação dos fundos fechados de investimento com o dos fundos abertos.

“Se acontecer o que aconteceu agora com o projeto referente ao Banco Central (sobre acordos de leniência), aprovado praticamente em um ou dois dias, pode ser via projeto de lei”, afirmou Temer. “Se isso acontecer, posso até mandar o projeto de lei. Se houver dificuldade, aí sou obrigado a me utilizar da medida provisória”.

Temer disse ainda “não ser improvável” que edite uma MP prorrogando mais uma vez a adesão ao Refis. Segundo o presidente, vai haver vetos no projeto, mas esses ainda não estão definidos. O governo tem até 3 de novembro para sancionar o projeto, mas a adesão é apenas até o final deste mês.

TRABALHO ESCRAVO

Temer ainda confirmou informações publicadas na quinta-feira pela Reuters de que estuda modificações sugeridas pela procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, na portaria que alterou a definição de trabalho escravo, mas que a norma não deve ser suspensa.

“A portaria é do ministro do Trabalho. Mas ainda hoje ele falou comigo e já esteve duas vezes com a dra. Raquel Dodge”, disse. “Ele esteve duas vezes com ela e recebeu sugestões que ela fez. Ele está examinando as sugestões. É muito provável que incorpore várias”.

As modificações, segundo o presidente, seriam feitas através de uma nova portaria.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

So it said on Friday it was launching a programme of start-up collaborations in Paris as it ramps up digital investments and seeks out new beauty products like its “smart” hairbrushes.

L‘Oreal makes an ever greater slice of sales online and has rolled out services and items for tech-savvy consumers, such as a phone app for virtual make-up tests.

The French group said it was looking to develop more inventions at a site for start-up companies in Paris, where 10 to 12 firms will work on projects with L‘Oreal every year.

“The world of beauty has already become very digitalised ... this will allow us go even further than what we do today,” L‘Oreal Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said, at a reconverted 1920s railway depot in Paris that now houses a start-up campus.

Known as “Station F” and launched by billionaire businessman Xavier Niel, it will now have a L‘Oreal workshop.

Agon did not say how much L‘Oreal had invested so far in start-up ventures and online development, but said the group’s budget for all things digital was growing fast.

L‘Oreal now spends 35 percent of its media budget on digital campaigns and had recruited 1,700 people to work in this area, he said. Five years ago staffing in this section was closer to 150.

L‘Oreal derives about 7 percent of its revenues - which totalled 13.4 billion euros (£12 billion) in the first half of the year - from online sales, up from just over 5 percent in 2015. It has not disclosed online growth targets.

The company has already invested in London’s Founders Factory, a so-called start-up incubator, last year, and it has its own innovation programme in San Francisco.

Products developed there include an electronic UV skin patch that measures exposure to the sun.

Aside from seeking new technology, such as developments in artificial intelligence or voice recognition software, L‘Oreal will also work with start-ups developing new beauty products, be it creams or make-up, the company said.

L‘Oreal’s push comes as Paris seeks to overtake London as a leading European tech centre for investors and inventors, in a “start-up nation” championed by France’s pro-business President Emmanuel Macron.

“It is Congress’ responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iran’s reckless behavior,” Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters.

“Immediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iran’s missile proliferation,” they said.

President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord.

That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or

“snap back,” sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement.

However, many of Trump’s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so.

Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions.

In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA.

Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trump’s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact.

Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iran’s ballistic missile program.

It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate.

The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shi‘ite militia’s allies in Lebanon’s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

“It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.

Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.

Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.

Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.

“It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.

Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”

A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.

Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.

“I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.

“Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.

In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.

On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.

Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.

The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.

MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE

If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.

Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.

Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.

Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.

“The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.

Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.

“It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada’s banking regulator, said this week it will introduce a stress test on all uninsured mortgages to test borrowers’ ability to pay back their debt if interest rates rise.

That announcement has sparked concerns that borrowers rejected by banks could turn to unscrupulous private lenders that charge sky-high rates.

“Right now, the level of activity (by unregulated lenders) is relatively low, but we’ve created an incentive for it to be higher,” Evan Siddall, chief executive of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, said in an interview with Reuters ahead of a speech in New York.

“To the extent that we continue to shrink the space, then riskier loans just move outside of our purview and we need to think about what that means,” he said.

Siddall said the CMHC was researching how much of Canada’s C$1.4 trillion mortgage market was being served by unregulated lenders and investigating whether their activity posed a systemic threat to the broader market.

“There are two factors involved - one is the level of activity and the other is the risk of contagion,” he said. “The first thing we do is just watch. We can move pretty quickly but we’re in the middle of watching right now.”

Siddall said his main concern about the country’s housing markets related to supply issues in Toronto and Vancouver, citing a number of factors including restrictions on open land around Toronto, the slow pace of regulatory approvals, and developers’ speculatively owning land without building on it.

“All those factors together are a problem,” he said, adding that Canada’s forthcoming National Housing Strategy will look to address them.

Siddall echoed comments earlier this week by Canada’s top banking regulator that sufficient action had been taken to tighten mortgage lending standards at federally regulated lenders.

Canadian authorities have introduced a range of measures over the past 18 months intended to cool housing markets, including slapping special taxes on foreign buyers in Toronto and Vancouver and adopting tougher tests on borrowers’ ability to meet repayments.

”Do I think we need further measures in the federally regulated space? No, I actually don‘t. Not for now,“ Siddall said. ”The risk in that space has gone down. We’ve done our job.

“Now we’re looking at the result of the consequence of moving that out of the federally regulated space and should we, can we do something about it,” he added.

Siddall also said the CMHC was examining if self-employed workers and new immigrants were being discriminated against as a result of the new rules.

Some NFL players have sat or taken a knee during renditions of the song the past two seasons to protest racial inequality in the United States but NBA players have stood in accordance with league rules.

The protests have raised the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who says the players are being disrespectful to the country and the military.

In an online post, the 22-year-old Brooklyn native said she was uneasy about singing the song to begin with and said she probably would not be asked to do so again.

Die Republikaner stellten in der von ihnen kontrollierten Kongresskammer in der Nacht zum Freitag die Weichen für eine vereinfachte Abstimmung über eines der zentralen Prestigevorhaben Trumps. Sie nahmen einen Haushaltsentwurf an, der neben einer billionenschweren Extra-Belastung des Staatsetats ein Instrument beinhaltet, das es ihnen ermöglichen würde, auch ohne Unterstützung der oppositionellen Demokraten die Steuerpläne durch die Kammer zu bringen. Trump sprach auf Twitter vom “ersten Schritt” hin zu “massiven Steuererleichterungen für das amerikanische Volk”. Die Finanzmärkte reagierten positiv. Sowohl in Asien als auch in Europa verbuchten die Börsen Gewinne. Scharfe Kritik kam dagegen von der Opposition.

Der Senat stimmte mit 51 zu 49 dafür, grünes Licht für eine zusätzliche Belastung des Bundeshaushalts um bis zu 1,5 Billionen Dollar binnen zehn Jahren zu geben. So sollen die von der Regierung versprochenen Steuersenkungen für Unternehmen und Privatpersonen im Volumen von bis zu sechs Billionen Dollar mitfinanziert werden können. Der Entwurf sieht außerdem eine Art Schlichtungsverfahren vor, das die Chancen erhöhen würde, Trumps Steuerreform durch den Senat zu bekommen. Denn bei der Abstimmung über die Steuergesetzgebung würde dann bereits eine einfach Mehrheit reichen. Normalerweise wären dafür mindestens 60 der 100 Stimmen im Senat nötig. Die Republikaner verfügen aber nur über 52 Stimmen - und bei Demokraten stoßen die Steuerpläne in ihrer jetzigen Form auf wenig Gegenliebe. Nach ihrer Auffassung profitieren in erster Linie Konzerne und Superreiche von den Erleichterungen. Für Teile der Mittelschicht würden die Steuern sogar steigen, und das Staatsdefizit würde ebenfalls höher ausfallen, sagte Senator Ron Wyden, der Spitzenvertreter der Demokraten im Finanzausschuss der Kammer.

TRUMP NACH OBAMACARE-DEBAKEL UNTER ERFOLGSDRUCK

Bevor allerdings überhaupt über eine komplette Steuerreform abgestimmt werden kann, muss der Entwurf des Senats mit dem bereits verabschiedeten Gegenstück der anderen Kongresskammer, dem Repräsentantenhaus, in Einklang gebracht werden. Dessen Version fällt in mehreren Punkten anders aus. So streben die Abgeordneten ein Nullsummen-Spiel an, bei dem der Haushalt nicht zusätzlich belastet würde. Steuersenkungen sollen begleitet werden von erheblichen Ausgabekürzungen im sozialen Bereich, etwa bei der Hilfe für Arme.

Trump und seine Partei stehen erheblich unter Druck, endlich eines der zentralen Wahlversprechen von 2016 umzusetzen, nachdem sie mit dem Versuch, die Gesundheitsreform von Trumps Vorgänger Barack Obama zu kippen, gescheitert sind. Der Präsident feierte denn auch das Abstimmungsergebnis im Senat als “großartige News”. Der Mehrheitsführer der Republikaner im Senat, Mitch McConnell, sagte, mit diesem Etat-Entwurf sei man auf dem Weg, Familien und Einzelpersonen zu entlasten. Der parteipolitisch unabhängige Senator Bernie Sanders, der sich im vergangenen Jahr um die Präsidentschaftskandidatur der Demokraten beworben hatte, sagte dagegen, der Haushaltsentwurf sei erschreckend. In Zeiten, in denen die Einkommen massiv ungleich verteilt seien, liefere dieser Haushalt 1,9 Billionen Dollar Steuererleichterungen für das reichste Prozent der Bevölkerung.

An den Börsen ließ die Bewegung bei dem Steuervorhaben Hoffnungen auf einen US-Wirtschaftsboom aufflammen. Analyst Neil Wilson vom Brokerhaus ETX Capital sprach von einem großen Schritt in Richtung Steuersenkungen.

The ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson marked the latest setback facing women and family members who accuse J&J of not adequately warning consumers about the cancer risks of its talc-based products.

The decision followed a jury’s decision in August to hit J&J with the largest verdict to date in the litigation, awarding California resident Eva Echeverria $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages.

Nelson on Friday reversed the jury verdict and granted J&J’s request for a new trial. Nelson said the August trial was underpinned by errors and insufficient evidence on both sides, culminating in excessive damages.

Mark Robinson, who represented the woman in her lawsuit, in a statement said he would file an appeal immediately.

“We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product,” he said.

J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the verdict, adding that it will continue to defend itself in additional trials.

The judge added that there also had been misconduct of the jury during the trial.

J&J said declarations by two jurors after the trial showed that three members of the 12-person jury who voted against finding the company liable were improperly excluded from determining damages.

J&J says it faces lawsuits by 4,800 plaintiffs nationally asserting talc-related claims. Many of those cases are in California, where Echeverria’s case was the first to go to trial, and in Missouri, where J&J has faced five trials.

The Missouri litigation led to four verdicts against J&J in which juries issued verdicts totaling $307 million. The company has only won one trial.

But the Missouri cases, which have largely been brought by out-of-state plaintiffs, have faced jurisdictional questions after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in June that limited where personal injury lawsuits could be filed.

The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday.

The maker of pot-noodles blamed factors beyond its control for a weak third quarter, which saw sales excluding disposals and acquisitions rise by 2.6 percent, well short of analysts’ expectations of 3.9 percent. The hot summer meant people ate less ice cream, while hurricanes disrupted spending and shipping.

Yet the figures also reflect longer-term challenges. Growth in developed economies is slow, and health-conscious customers are changing their habits, meaning consumer goods companies cannot rely on old brands. One example: Halo Top, a family-owned healthy ice cream brand, grabbed share in North America. Unilever reckons just half its products took a bigger slice of their respective markets, down from around 60 percent in previous years.

Polman is making the right calls. He is selling dying brands, like margarine, buying new ones, and finding fresh ways of distributing products, like direct-to-consumer subscription services. And while the outlook in Europe and North America is dull, emerging economies are growing quickly. Unilever is also pushing up margins: analysts expect the company to convert 20 percent of sales into operating profit by 2020.

Still, Polman can’t rest easy. Unilever will need a strong fourth quarter if it is to meet its target for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent this year. More disappointments could revive takeover interest. Investors might look more favourably on Kraft Heinz’s near-30 percent operating margin if Unilever’s growth remains little better than average. Activist investors who are taking on ever-bigger targets such as Procter & Gamble, might also see the company as a candidate for deeper cost cutting and more radical surgery.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

China has forced 28 cities in smog-prone northern regions to reduce emissions of airborne particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from October to March 2017, with some cities expected to cut steel production by as much as 50 percent.

But officials with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said the world’s second-largest economy will remain on track.

“We expect to achieve the full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent,” He Lifeng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a briefing on the sidelines of China’s Communist Party Congress.

Most economists believe China’s actual growth should easily beat the target. The economy grew 6.8 percent in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9 percent in the first half. Last year’s growth rate of 6.7 percent was a 26-year low.

China’s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.

But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25 percentage points in the next six months.

Industrial growth slowed to 6.3 percent in the third quarter, from 6.6 percent in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.

Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.

China’s steel output dropped 3.7 percent in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing’s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.

However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.

“Measures to fight pollution don’t have a big impact on economic growth,” he said. “Measures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.”

The government has been pushing a restructuring program designed to “upgrade” its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.

China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400 million tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.

Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.",China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war: state planner,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy/china-still-on-track-to-hit-growth-target-despite-winter-smog-war-state-planner-idINKBN1CQ072

But Northam said he will work with the Republican president when it is in the state’s interest.

The balancing act puts Northam, a moderate lieutenant governor with a low-key campaign style, on the front lines of his party’s search for a strategy to exploit Trump’s unpopularity in politically divided states such as Virginia.

He is running against Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

The Nov. 7 general election in the competitive southern state is seen as a bellwether for next year’s midterm elections, when voters will decide whether Republicans should continue to control the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments.

After denouncing Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” during the primary campaign, Northam has since dialed back the vitriol. His emphasis on workforce education and policy matters heeds criticism that Democrats lost the White House because voters did not hear what the party stood for.

“The Northam strategy is talk Trump, but don’t just talk Trump,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, noting that Northam seeks to broaden his appeal to uncommitted voters.

Most polls show Northam narrowly ahead in a contest Democrats consider a must-win. Virginia is one of only 15 governors’ mansions still held by the party, and its current governor cannot run for re-election due to term limits.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama returned to the campaign trail this week for the first time since leaving office to stump for candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, the two states with gubernatorial elections this year. Without naming Trump, he called on voters to send a message by backing candidates like Northam.

A recent poll showed nearly one in three likely Virginia voters were factoring Trump into their decision in the governor’s race, according to a survey from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Northam’s supporters overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump.

Distain for the Republican president is why Niel Manson, a 72-year-old retired engineer living near the capital city of Richmond, became a Democrat nine months ago.

Yet the former independent called Northam wise to make his campaign about more than merely reacting to Trump.

“There is no benefit in getting in a discussion with Trump, because he changes his mind every 24 hours,” Manson said.

The Northam campaign said it has intentionally focused on policies when talking about Trump, seeking to draw parallels to Gillespie.

Northam starts another recent ad highlighting differences between the gubernatorial candidates on climate change.

“Now Ed’s going right along with Donald Trump as he tries to roll back our clean air and water protections,” the Democrat says from a picnic table at a waterfront park.

The strategy works to connect the president to a Republican candidate who is not always in lock step with him, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes gubernatorial races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

She said campaigns gearing up for next year’s midterms will learn from Virginia whether such messaging sways independents, or motivates Democrats to turn out in greater numbers than typical for non-presidential years.

“This is our first real election to see how these arguments about Trump really do impact Republican candidates,” Duffy said.

Gillespie’s campaign declined to comment about Trump’s impact on the race. The president endorsed Gillespie but has not campaigned with him.

Vice President Mike Pence headlined a recent rally for the candidate in southwest Virginia’s heavily Republican coal country.

Democratic voter Erin Siraguse, 34, said she based her support for Northam on issues such as his efforts to address affordable housing for teachers around her home in Fairfax County in northern Virginia.

She admires how Northam has handled the president’s shadow over this year’s most competitive state race.

É a segunda vez que a assembleia de credores da Oi é adiada.
Nesta sexta-feira, a Oi divulgou que encerrou programa de acordo com credores com dívidas da empresa de até 50 mil reais.
A empresa conseguiu acertar 25 mil acordos de um total de 53 mil credores que têm a receber até 50 mil reais.
A data da segunda convocação da assembleia de credores foi mantida em 27 de novembro, segundo a decisão de Viana.","SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O juiz encarregado pela recuperação judicial da Oi, Fernando Viana, decidiu nesta sexta-feira adiar a assembleia de credores da companhia da próxima segunda-feira para 6 de novembro, após pedido de bancos detentores de títulos da operadora.

É a segunda vez que a assembleia de credores da Oi é adiada. Originalmente, a reunião que decidirá sobre a aceitação de um plano de recuperação preparado pela companhia estava marcada para ocorrer em 9 de outubro, mas no fim de setembro Viana aceitou pedido da Oi para adiamento.

O adiamento ocorre em meio a negociações da companhia com o governo federal em torno da dívida de mais de 10 bilhões de reais da operadora junto à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel).

Mais cedo, o presidente-executivo da Oi, Marco Schroeder, reuniu-se com o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, junto com outros executivos do setor de telecomunicações como o presidente da Telefônica Brasil, Eduardo Navarro.

Após o encontro, Schroeder comentou a jornalistas que a Oi estava preparada para realizar a assembleia de credores na segunda-feira, mas que a empresa poderia aproveitar um adiamento para conseguir mais apoio para o plano de recuperação apresentado em 11 de outubro.

No plano, a Oi propôs limite de 25 por cento à conversão de títulos de dívida em ações, bem abaixo dos 88 por cento pretendidos por grandes detentores de títulos da companhia. A proposta da empresa implica em um abatimento da dívida da ordem de 73 por cento, segundo análise do Itaú BBA.

Apesar dos detentores de bônus condenarem a oferta da Oi, eles também estão tentando evitar o colapso da companhia a todo o custo, segundo disseram duas fontes com conhecimento do assunto.

Os ativos da Oi são avaliados em 40,8 bilhões de reais, segundo o auditor independente Ernest & Young. Esse valor pode cair para 17,9 bilhões ou menos do que 30 por cento do valor da dívida sob renegociação no caso de uma venda forçada da operadora, segundo o auditor.

Como classe de credores, os detentores de bônus da Oi estão em termos de prioridade atrás dos funcionários da empresa e do BNDES e por isso podem perder mais no caso de uma liquidação da operadora do que se aceitarem o plano de recuperação proposto pela Oi, disseram as fontes.

“Os peticionários vêm a juízo requerer o adiamento do conclave, alegando ser prematuro e afirmando ainda pretenderem evoluir nas negociações para construção de alternativas viáveis...tal adiamento deverá ser por apenas 15 dias, tempo que considero razoável para a conclusão das negociações”, afirmou Viana na decisão.

Também após o encontro de Meirelles com os executivos nesta sexta-feira, a Anatel decidiu antecipar das 11h para às 8h de segunda-feira uma reunião na qual poderá decidir se aceita trocar multas devidas pela Oi em obrigações de investimento pela operadora. Na quinta-feira, fonte com conhecimento do assunto afirmou à Reuters que o valor das multas a ser discutido pela Anatel na segunda-feira é de 5 bilhões de reais.

15 MESES

A Oi entrou com pedido de recuperação judicial em junho do ano passado e até agora acionistas e detentores de títulos da empresa não chegaram a um acordo sobre a reestruturação da companhia, que declarou dívidas de mais de 65 bilhões de reais devidos a 55 mil credores.

Nesta sexta-feira, a Oi divulgou que encerrou programa de acordo com credores com dívidas da empresa de até 50 mil reais. A empresa conseguiu acertar 25 mil acordos de um total de 53 mil credores que têm a receber até 50 mil reais. Segundo a operadora, o volume de dívida acertada no programa foi de 410 milhões de reais.

A data da segunda convocação da assembleia de credores foi mantida em 27 de novembro, segundo a decisão de Viana.

Na decisão, o juiz afirmou que a realização da assembleia 15 meses depois da aprovação do pedido de recuperação judicial da Oi, além do prazo máximo previsto em lei de 5 meses, está “em consonância com a realidade forense”.

“Se considerarmos a magnitude deste processo, nunca antes vista, em termos de números de credores, valor da dívida, temas inéditos e de profunda complexidade, a assembleia será realizada em tempo que considero satisfatório”, escreveu Viana em sua decisão.

O juiz disse que não pretendia adiar novamente a assembleia, mas diante dos pedidos de “credores extremamente relevantes...não vejo como não autorizar o adiamento”.

Entre os bancos que pediram a postergação da reunião estão Banco do Brasil, que aparece como credor de 3,9 bilhões de reais da Oi, e Caixa Econômica Federal, com créditos de cerca de 1,9 bilhão de reais.

Para a assembleia de segunda-feira, a Oi esperava presença de até 5 mil pessoas ao anfiteatro do pavilhão 6 do centro de convenções Riocentro, que tem capacidade para 6 mil pessoas.

Na conversa, da qual participaram também os ministro da Casa Civil, Eliseu Padilha, e da Secretaria de Governo, Antonio Imbassahy, Temer afirmou que se transição e idade mínima forem aprovados pelo Congresso, “já estaria de bom tamanho”.

Padilha acrescentou, então, a necessidade do corte de privilégios aos servidores, afirmando que esses três itens preservariam 75 por cento da reforma planejada pelo governo.

O presidente ainda admitiu, na entrevista, que não sabe se o governo terá condições de levar adiante a reforma, mesmo limitada, ainda em 2017, como pretendia.

“O ideal é que isso seja aprovado neste ano. Agora, eu faço mais uma ressalva aqui, para tirar qualquer pretensão. Temos de consultar as bancadas novamente, como foi feito na primeira vez. Na primeira vez estava tudo ajustado para aprovar, não fosse uma certa irresponsabilidade denunciativa”, disse Temer, fazendo referência à primeira denúncia apresentada contra ele pelo ex-procurador-geral da República, Rodrigo Janot, em junho.

“Então, vamos fazer uma nova avaliação e verificar se é possível ou não. E tentar aprovar este ano”, acrescentou.

O presidente disse ainda que poderá enviar o pacote de medidas de ajuste fiscal, com que a equipe econômica conta para fechar o orçamento, por projeto de lei, e não por medida provisória. Entre os temas estão a suspensão do reajuste dos servidores, a elevação da contribuição previdenciária dos servidores de 11 por cento para 14 por cento e a equiparação do modelo de tributação dos fundos fechados de investimento com o dos fundos abertos.

“Se acontecer o que aconteceu agora com o projeto referente ao Banco Central (sobre acordos de leniência), aprovado praticamente em um ou dois dias, pode ser via projeto de lei”, afirmou Temer. “Se isso acontecer, posso até mandar o projeto de lei. Se houver dificuldade, aí sou obrigado a me utilizar da medida provisória”.

Temer disse ainda “não ser improvável” que edite uma MP prorrogando mais uma vez a adesão ao Refis. Segundo o presidente, vai haver vetos no projeto, mas esses ainda não estão definidos. O governo tem até 3 de novembro para sancionar o projeto, mas a adesão é apenas até o final deste mês.

TRABALHO ESCRAVO

Temer ainda confirmou informações publicadas na quinta-feira pela Reuters de que estuda modificações sugeridas pela procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, na portaria que alterou a definição de trabalho escravo, mas que a norma não deve ser suspensa.

“A portaria é do ministro do Trabalho. Mas ainda hoje ele falou comigo e já esteve duas vezes com a dra. Raquel Dodge”, disse. “Ele esteve duas vezes com ela e recebeu sugestões que ela fez. Ele está examinando as sugestões. É muito provável que incorpore várias”.

As modificações, segundo o presidente, seriam feitas através de uma nova portaria.

Kennedy International Airport, soon to be ringed with people coming from Puerto Rico on one-way tickets they never would have bought if not for the hurricane.

Moving at a canter, Emily Pagan and three colleagues from various New York state government agencies carted their fold-up table halfway down the Terminal 5 arrivals hall, setting it up by the carousel against a pillar.

They had volunteered to help orient the latest batch of the tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans that New York officials estimate will flee from the lingering devastation wrought a month ago by Hurricane Maria.

Many are expected to stay for months - or years - and some forever, in a largely reluctant wave of migration abetted by the spare mattresses and couches of the one million Puerto Ricans who already call the New York area home.

“A lot of them are saying they came to start a new life here because they lost everything,” Pagan said on her third day of greeting arrivals from the U.S. territory, where the power grid and water supply remain in disarray.

She tried to make the makeshift help desk look nice, centering a bowl of mints and squaring off the piles of leaflets about health and job resources.

A clipboard wedged into her elbow, Pagan hurried up to anyone who looked like they were waiting for relatives from the island, flipping between English and Spanish: “Hi, I‘m Emily, and I represent the state.”

Lissette Feliciano, who had driven down from Bridgeport, Connecticut, was among those grateful for a leaflet. Then bags began thudding onto the carousel and the automatic doors slid open to admit her 10-year-old nephew, sporting an Incredible Hulk T-shirt, alongside her youngest sister, Madeline Feliciano.

The nephew, Carlos, grinned as he was nuzzled by his aunt. It was their first time leaving the island. They never expected an airplane cabin would be so cold, he said, shivering.

“I‘m so-so,” his mother said, looking daunted.

Many Puerto Rican families are divided between those who prefer the island’s warmth and those who cannot understand why one would not move to the mainland’s hustle, as Lissette did seven years ago. But the storm put those disagreements on hold.

“Four days, no running water,” Madeline said of their hometown, Isabela. She did not know when they could return.

“They’ll stay with me until we can find something for her,” said Lissette, who had already found a bilingual school for Carlos.

They headed out, with Madeline and Carlos added to the tally on Pagan’s clipboard.

People gravitated toward Pagan and her purple top bearing the logo of New York’s Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, where she normally works as a compliance officer.

Born in Puerto Rico, Pagan, 42, listened to the accounts of each new arrival that made her beautiful native island seem unfamiliar: no water, no power, no green left on the tropical trees, no sort of place where a child or grandparent could thrive.

“It’s heartbreaking,” she said between flights. But she tried to put on a welcoming face, slipping lollipops to children before moving on to the next family. She was yet to meet anyone without relatives to stay with, but younger adults seemed worried about finding jobs in a place where they had never planned to live.

Pagan cooed at the green eyes of a 7-year-old boy called Jayden with a Transformers backpack. “You speak English!” she said after the boy squirmed at the compliment. “You understand everything I say!”

Jayden’s father, Joemil Ramirez, was returning to New York City, where he was raised, for only three weeks, partly for its functional telephone network. Much of that time he expected to spend making calls trying to salvage his hurricane-ravaged restaurant in Rincon. But when he returned, he would be leaving behind Jayden, who would move in with the boy’s mother, from whom Ramirez was separated.

“There’s no place for him to be, no school,” Ramirez said. “It’s a situation I wouldn’t give to my own worst enemy.”

Genoveva Mendez, 48, watched the carousel from her wheelchair. She had been undergoing physical therapy three times a week following a stroke, but Maria halted that.

“We had to force her,” said her daughter, Jessenia Lalama. Mendez had refused the offer of a ticket to New York for weeks.

“I like the island, the island’s beautiful,” Mendez said, becoming tearful at the memory of her home before the hurricane.

When the hall emptied, a lone suitcase remained on the carousel as Pagan and her colleagues carried their table back to the corner, ready to greet the next day’s flights.","Plane by plane, New York greets Puerto Ricans displaced by hurricane",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-puertorico-arrivals/feature-plane-by-plane-new-york-greets-puerto-ricans-displaced-by-hurricane-idINKBN1CQ0CM?il=0

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

Un cambio al vertice, per la Banca d‘Italia, è la migliore tra diverse opzioni negative.

Il bilancio con luci ed ombre del governatore Ignazio Visco durante la crisi bancaria italiana indebolisce l‘ipotesi di un rinnovo del suo mandato. Le critiche dei politici nei suoi confronti minacciano l‘indipendenza della banca centrale e potrebbero sconsigliare una sua sostituzione. Ma se Visco restasse al suo posto, rischierebbe di diventare in un‘anatra zoppa.

Il mandato di Visco scade alla fine del mese. Fino a lunedì la riconferma del governatore per altri sei anni sembrava una mera formalità. Adesso invece non è più certa, dopo che martedì la Camera ha approvato una mozione del Pd critica sul ruolo svolto da Bankitalia durante la crisi delle banche e dopo che giovedì l‘ex premier Silvio Berlusconi è intervenuto nello stesso senso.

Ci sono buoni motivi per criticare Visco. La banca centrale non è riuscita a individuare le enormi perdite da derivati occultate del Monte dei Paschi. Lo scandalo, scoperto a inizio 2013, si è concluso col salvataggio di Stato della banca toscana.

Visco è stato anche lento nel costringere le banche italiane a far emergere i crediti in sofferenza, prolungando così, probabilmente, la recessione economica. Durante il suo mandato i contribuenti, gli investitori e istituzioni semi statali hanno speso oltre 60 miliardi di euro per risolvere la crisi di 10 banche, secondo i calcoli del quotidiano “La Repubblica”.

Tuttavia, anche scaricare Visco così tardi comporta rischi. Il governo non si è preoccupato di vagliare seriamente candidature alternative, anche se ci sono diversi qualificati candidati italiani. Una nomina affrettata potrebbe non essere rigorosa. Inoltre, un nuovo governatore potrebbe essere considerato come il risultato di un mercanteggiamento politico, e indebolire così la reputazione della banca centrale. Ma se Visco restasse, correrebbe il rischio di essere il bersaglio di accuse quotidiane da parte di tutto l‘arco politico prima delle elezioni del 2018. Una commissione di inchiesta sul sistema bancario appena insediata potrebbe diventare teatro di altri attacchi politici, piuttosto che l‘opportunità di fare chiarezza sulle decisioni della banca centrale.

È vero che, oggi, il governatore potrebbe sembrare una figura meno importante dal momento che le funzioni di vigilanza più importanti sono state trasferite alla Banca Centrale Europea. Ma Banca d‘Italia rimane centrale per la gestione quotidiana delle operazioni bancarie italiane. Se Visco decidesse di lasciare, potrebbe disinnescare le tensioni politiche e contribuire a preservare l‘integrità della banca centrale. Sarebbe il risultato meno negativo.

The decision by a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel gave the government until Oct. 31 to approve a sponsor, who could help the 17-year-old obtain the procedure without the government’s assistance.

If the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) signed off on the sponsor, she “will be lawfully able, if she chooses, to obtain an abortion on her own,” the court said.

It said the requirement that a sponsor be found did not “unduly burden” the immigrant’s right to an abortion under Supreme Court precedent.

The panel was made up of two Republican-appointed judges and one Democratic appointee, Patricia Millett, who wrote the sole dissenting opinion.

“What reason does the federal government offer for taking over (her) decision completely and forcing her to continue an unwanted pregnancy that Texas law permits her to terminate? None that remotely qualifies under the Constitution, or that even makes sense,” Millett wrote.

The teen, from an unidentified country, is currently detained in Texas and 15 weeks pregnant. She entered the United States without any family in September and was immediately detained by the government and placed in a shelter.

A federal judge in Washington this week ruled the abortion procedure could go ahead. But the government obtained a temporary order blocking the decision until the appeals court ruled.

The appeals court said that if the teen could not find a sponsor, she could renew her legal claim.

She had sought and received a Texas court order to approve the abortion because she is under 18, and had scheduled a sonogram and consultation with a physician, as required by state law. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, an arm of the HHS, refused to let her leave the detention center to carry out those steps, however.

The Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS, issued the following statement later on Friday: “For however much time we are given, the Office of Refugee Resettlement and HHS will protect the well-being of this minor and all children and their babies in our facilities, and we will defend human dignity for all in our care.”

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has taken up the case, said in a court filing that the Office of Refugee Resettlement revised its procedures in March to mandate that abortions for under-age detainees required office approval.

The policy change came weeks after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican who campaigned on promises to clamp down on illegal immigration and seek new restrictions on women’s access to abortions.

“Justice is delayed yet again for this courageous and persistent young woman,” said ACLU lawyer Brigitte Amiri in a statement. “She continues to be held hostage and prevented from getting an abortion because the Trump administration disagrees with her personal decision.”",U.S. court blocks immigrant teen's bid to obtain abortion,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-abortion-court/u-s-court-blocks-immigrant-teens-bid-to-obtain-abortion-idUSKBN1CP2L1

Handout photo of director Devashish Makhija

Makhija tells Reuters why “Ajji” is about urban privilege and how the making of the film took a toll on his health.

Q: One of the big themes that emerge out of “Ajji” is urban privilege. Why was that important?

A: I don’t know if you have seen my short films, but I do this in all my stories. Not only because I feel guilty being born into a middle-class family and having three meals a day, but because I have actively travelled in tribal areas. When I came to Mumbai, I stayed in a slum for the first two years. I have actively tried to understand inequality, because inequality manifests in injustice. The law, though it says it is equal for all, everyone cannot access it. In all my stories, I try to remind those who have a little privilege that you are having it easy and there is someone out there who is not.

Q: How did you end up living in a slum?

A: I am from Calcutta. I was a journalist for a bit, in advertising for a bit, and I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. I had a few friends who knew videography and they said, “Come here”. I came to Mumbai and lived in a slum rehabilitation colony. I didn’t have a choice – I didn’t have too much money. My mum had just passed and I had walked away from life as I knew it. Living there, I started questioning my life as it had been up until then.

The first film I worked on was ""Black Friday"". Even during the research of that film, we worked in the ghettos like Behrampada, Navpada. We lived in those areas for days and that just set me on a journey I couldn’t turn back from. I have taken it upon myself to put these people in all my stories - to tell stories about them because they are not represented in the mainstream.

I could have made “Ajji” more arthouse than it actually is. But somewhere in its story-telling, I tried to make it accessible. I tried to keep the thrill and drama going because I want the mainstream to watch it so that they will think about the other sections of society.

Q: What have you learned about the “other sections”?

Handout still from the movie ""Ajji""

A: There’s nothing that I learned from them. The more time I spend in strata and milieus that I don’t belong to, the more I learn about us. The fact that we take too much for granted. We feel wronged about being shortchanged while buying a pair of shoes. And over there is a grandmother whose granddaughter had her life taken from her as she knew it. She will never be the same again. That level of shortchange doesn’t compare to this. There is such a dichotomy and we understand life at such a different level... we operate at such a different frequency.

Q: Does it frustrate you as a film-maker that we don’t see too many of these subjects in the mainstream?

A: No, it doesn’t. And I try and not be arrogant about it. This film, even though it was made at a frighteningly low budget of 1.2 crores (12 million rupees), is still one point two crores, the kind of money I will never see at one go in my lifetime. And I am using someone else’s money to make my film. If someone is giving you money, they don’t want you to hold a mirror to them. They want to escape somewhere else. I get that and I have no sour grapes about that.

Q: How did you come up with the character of Ajji, the protagonist in your film?

A: Ajji was a response to a lot of things, (like) the constant reportage of rape after Nirbhaya. After a point, the film goes beyond rape and revenge. It is about all these inequalities. I had an idea about the most unlikely candidate in a family who would go out and do something about this. And the answer was the grandmother. And we made it even harder for her – we gave her arthritis, we made her live in a milieu where the patriarchy is so systemic that you don’t even realise it’s there until something gets out of hand. The truth of rape-revenge is so universal that I knew that if I make it dramatic enough, I’ll have the audience. The question was - how do I throw in all the other things that I wanted to talk about. That is how Ajji emerged.

Q: Your villain is completely despicable. Did he have to be that way for the film to work?

A: That’s a fair question. But like I said, in that milieu, the patriarchy is 5,000 years old. I was trying to distill that thought process into a person. Dhawale is not a person, but a thought process, and because it is so powerful, he had to be that way.

Q: You said that the making of the film affected your health.

A: (Pauses). I finally feel ready to talk about it. All of last year, during the making of the film, I started hating on my own masculinity. I was in prep in September last year when I started urinating blood. I was in severe pain and thought I wouldn’t be able to shoot. A doctor at the Hinduja Hospital thought it was prostate cancer. I shot on medication and as I went into post-production, I started healing myself. I met a few alternate healers who told me that I was hating on my own masculinity and the prostate gland is really the seat of the male hormone. In retrospect, I think in the making of the film, I sort of went through what Manda (the granddaughter) did. I could feel what Manda was feeling, what Ajji was feeling, because I was in so much pain, and it probably manifested on screen.",Q&A: Devashish Makhija on 'Ajji' and urban privilege,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-bollywood-ajji-devashish-makhija/qa-devashish-makhija-on-ajji-and-urban-privilege-idINKBN1CN1MG

Kurz said in post-election interviews that his government would be “pro-European” and intolerant of any anti-Semitism, with which the Freedom Party has been strongly associated – though now softened by its present leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, who has shifted from general xenophobia to a focus on opposing Muslim migration.

Kurz wants stronger borders and drastic reductions in immigration. He agrees with Strache that “several hundred people have made their way from Austria to fight and murder for the Islamic State … (there is) no place for radical thought and political Islam.”

Kurz’s win is remarkable for his youth and his refurbishment of a fading party, but it’s in tune with the rest of a rising anti-European Union mood in Middle Europe. That mood is likely to be strengthened in the outcome of this weekend’s elections in the Czech Republic. There the ANO (""Yes"") center-right party is the likely winner. Its leader, the billionaire industrialist and media owner Andrej Babis, 63, would be the natural choice as prime minister – assuming that legal action threatened against him doesn’t halt his rise. At a conference in Prague last month in which I participated, Babis said that “Europe is failing on security” and that, if the 17 countries using the euro (the Czechs do not) integrate further – “we will be out. We do not need further integration.” Babis knows his fellow citizens: only small minorities are enthusiastic Europeans, or wish their country to join the common currency zone.

A swing against the European Union was not what the end of communism in the region was supposed to ordain. The Czech Republic, like the other former Communist states, sloughed off the Soviet yoke in the late 1980s with an affirmation of freedom. In Czechoslovakia (as it then was), the stubborn dissident writer Vaclav Havel invoked “the power of the powerless” – and in 1989, a few years after being released from powerless detention in prison, won power as president of his country.

Havel saw the central European states as returning to their natural European home, after decades of icy post-war imprisonment in the Soviet bloc. But that home has become one of disputes and mutual disappointment, not of amity. Freedom from communism has, indeed, meant the creation of electoral democracy, of varying degrees of strength and transparency. But it’s also meant corruption in politics and business – bribery was pervasive in the Communist era, but relatively small scale compared to today - periods of high unemployment, a growing suspicion of the European Union as an alien force (though a careful retention of its subsidies) and a strong dislike of immigration, which has meant closed borders and a refusal to participate in the EU’s migrant resettlement program. In the Czech Republic, a new ferociously anti-immigrant and anti-Islam party, headed by Tomio Okamura, a citizen of half-Czech and half Korean-Japanese ancestry has leapt to fourth place in the opinion polls.

Central Europe is now deeply and popularly conservative. Austria, geographically part of it even if it escaped the Soviet embrace, is now more politically in tune with its neighborhood than it has ever been. Indeed Kurz spoke in a Financial Times interview of his wish, if and when chancellor, to be a “bridge” between the post-communist states and the EU -- while sharing many of the former’s concerns.

Building that bridge is going to be a tough job. The countries in which Havel placed so much importance as an enthusiastic addition to Europe – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – no longer find much common ground, except in agreeing to keep out immigrants. Babis says the group, known as the Visegrad Four, is no longer useful. All of its member states have become more closed and hostile to the EU, but in different ways.

Poland differs most strongly in one sense: in a generally pro- Moscow grouping, it is unremittingly hostile to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice Party, blames for the death of his brother Lech, with other members of the Polish elite, in a plane crash in Russia. Under Kaczynski’s guidance, the Polish government has sought ever-greater control over the justice system and the media, all the while attacking liberal institutions and framing the EU as an external and unwelcome influence which must be defied.

Hungary, with the authoritarian Viktor Orban at the head of a rightist government, combines strong antagonism to the EU, a close relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and a paranoia which has given rise to a clamorous campaign with anti-Semitic undertones centered on the figure of the liberal, Jewish Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who funded many of the institutions and rising politicians in post-Soviet Hungary – including Orban himself. Soros’ largest contribution, the creation of the highly regarded Central European University, is now under threat of closure.

The veteran Hungarian-Austrian journalist Paul Lendvai, author of a new, fiercely critical biography of Orban, told me that the Hungarian prime minister “is deeply cynical and very skillful. He has imposed his power everywhere. The left is split and demoralized; the only opposition he fears is from Jobbik” – a far-right anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, anti-Romany party that is now, like the Austrian Freedom Party, softening its image to seek a possible future place in a coalition.

The Middle Europeans have, in part, done what the democratic world urged them to do: they have developed an independent politics. But increasingly, their dominant political sentiment is antithetical to, even contemptuous of, the liberal, pro-integrationist ideals of the European Union. These ideals, which Havel would have recognized, are now best expressed by President Emmanuel Macron of France. But, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, once the EU’s undisputed leading actor, begins what is billed as a long negotiation to form a governing coalition after her failure to win an outright majority in Germany’s recent election, she can no longer offer the Frenchman the support on which he counted.

The EU is now caught between a Brexit-ing Britain – with which negotiations are not going well – and an increasingly disenchanted group of Middle Europeans. The relief with which the defeat of the far-right in France and the Netherlands was greeted earlier this year was premature. A determination to close borders, to oppose more powers for Brussels and reluctance to accept its authority grows and spreads – and renders the European dream of unity, for the moment, impossible.",Commentary: Middle Europe turns its back on the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-austria-commentary/commentary-middle-europe-turns-its-back-on-the-eu-idUSKBN1CP26M

While the deadly storms in August and September slammed insurers who are now on the hook for billions of dollars in damaged property, many retailers, manufacturers and banks are also feeling the pain.

Over half of S&P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results in recent weeks, including Harley-Davidson (HOG.N), Delta Airlines and Costco (COST.O), have said on conference calls with investors that the storms harmed their businesses to some degree, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis.

“We estimate the impact of the hurricanes accounted for approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of Harley-Davidson’s retail sales decline during the quarter,” the motorcycle maker’s Chief Financial Officer, John Olin, told investors on Tuesday after reporting a decline in quarterly profit per share.

The hurricanes were part of the worst Atlantic hurricane season in over a decade, destroying or damaging homes, businesses and public infrastructure, killing over 200 people and paralyzing normal economic activity.

Senior executives of least 48 S&P 500 companies have told investors on quarterly conference calls that their businesses had been negatively affected by the storms.

At least 12 companies, including U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), also said their businesses were hurt by a September earthquake that killed 369 people in Mexico, a major market for U.S. firms.

American International Group (AIG.N) has estimated pretax losses of about $1 billion each from Harvey and Irma, up to $700 million from Maria and additional catastrophe losses, including Mexico’s earthquake, of about $150 million.

Travelers Cos Inc said on Thursday it recorded $700 million in catastrophe losses from the destruction wrought by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, although its quarterly profit fell less than Wall Street feared.

S&P 500 companies on average are expected to have increased their non-GAAP earnings per share by 4.2 percent in the third quarter, the slowest growth in a year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding insurers, which are expected to have suffered a 63.3-percent decline in quarterly profits, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 6.9 percent.

The lingering effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hobbled activity at factories in September and blunted a rebound in U.S. industrial production, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday

Still, the storms have not stopped the stock market’s record advance. Up 15 percent in 2017, the benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 18 times expected earnings, a multiple not seen since 2002, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

The S&P 500 property and casualty index .SPLRCINPC on Friday hit a record high, more than recovering from a selloff that coincided with the Harvey’s destruction. Many investors believe that insurers will raise premiums to make up for losses, and that those higher premiums will become permanent.

Dover (DOV.N) Chief Executive Robert Livingston said overtime and other related expenses to get back up to speed had cost the manufacturing company as much as 2 cents per share in the quarter after Harvey forced it to close its Texas factories for four or five days.

Hand tool maker Snap-On (SNA.N) said the storms cost it about $8 million in sales in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.

“Timing of both further disruption and rebuilding are unclear,” Snap-On Chief Executive Nicholas Pinchuk told analysts on Thursday.

Waiving late fees and increasing reserves for customer credit cost PayPal Holdings (PYPL.O) about 1 cent per share in the past quarter, leaving its non-GAAP EPS at 46 cents.

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) on Friday said it had to suspend operations along the Gulf Coast due to the hurricanes and in Mexico because of the earthquake.

Some companies, including Constellation Brands (STZ.N), said the hurricanes had only a minor negative on their results. For others, the storms will mean new business.

With 600,000 homes in Texas and Florida in need of re-roofing, shares in building materials firms USG Corp (USG.N), Owens Corning (OC.N) and Eagle Materials Inc (EXP.N) have jumped between 17 percent and 30 percent since just before Harvey struck Texas.

Home Depot (HD.N) has surged 9 percent since the end of August on bets that homeowners repairing damage will spend more at its stores.

“They were hurricanes of a massive size that caused significant disruption to labor forces and spending,” said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “But it’s a pendulum, early on it has an impact, but as the rebuild gets going and there’s an inventory ramp-up, I think it swings back the other way.”",Recent hurricanes take toll on quarterly earnings,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/recent-hurricanes-take-toll-on-quarterly-earnings-idUSKBN1CP2GE

Three of Merck’s U.S. sales teams will be cut: primary care, disease-focused endocrinology and hospital chronic care, spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in an emailed statement.

The aim is “to better support changes in our business in the United States,” she said.

The spokeswoman said Merck’s new chronic care team will focus on diabetes drug Januvia, as well as other primary care products such as sleep medication Belsomra, and products for respiratory conditions and women’s health.

She noted that Merck’s pipeline also has potential new candidates in primary care - for Alzheimer’s disease, asthma, chronic cough and heart failure.

Merck’s stock was little changed in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, at $63.78.

Earlier this month, Merck said it would not seek regulatory approval for once-promising cholesterol drug anacetrapib after disappointing trial results.

Last month, the drugmaker discontinued developing an experimental drug combination for chronic hepatitis C, as competition rises and patient population shrinks. The company has previously written off an earlier hepatitis C program.

Other pharmaceutical companies have also downsized. Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N) earlier this month said it would lay off about 8 percent of its employees as the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks over the past year in the development of two potential blockbuster drugs, works to cut costs.
