Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

Authorities have said Stephen Paddock targeted the country music festival, opening fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel before killing himself.

Wane Gelinas, a senior at Bonny Eagle High School in Standish, said hunting is a family tradition and he wanted his last yearbook photo to show his love of the sport.

“It’s just my sport,” he told WCSH-TV. “It’s just what I do. I don’t play football. I don’t play basketball. I just hunt.”

In a Facebook post, Gelinas wrote: “So here's what I wanted to have as my senior picture but was informed ‘No you can't put something like that in the yearbook.’ So you're telling me that a football player can have theirs with a football, a lacrosse player can have theirs with their stick, and a guy or girl can dress up like one or the other but a hunter can't have theirs with their gun!”

School Principal Lori Napolitano told WCSH-TV the photo goes against the school’s code of conduct, which prevents bringing weapons to school or wearing clothing or other items that depict weapons.

“We just want to draw the line at weapons of any kind being in the picture, that way we’re not trying to pass judgement on which was are promoting violence or which ones aren’t,” she said.

Smith and Conley initially tried extinguishing the fire themselves.

“I took the garbage out of the garbage can in the bathroom,” Conley said. “We were filling it up with water trying to put the fire out, it wouldn’t go out.”

Within three minutes, the entire house was engulfed in flames and the family was beginning to feel overwhelmed by the smoke.

""After I kept trying to put the fire out, I couldn't breathe anymore, so at that point, I just knew I had to get everyone out the house,"" Smith said.

My best guess as to what happened is that President Trump made the call to Sgt.
To assume that a grieving family would lie about what they heard the president say, knowing that it would cause Sgt.
That’s what the President tried to say to the four families the other day.”That’s what the President tried to say.","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.

The brouhaha over President Trump’s phone call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson has gotten even worse in recent days. After Chief of Staff John Kelly inserted himself in the debate, Kelly, himself a Gold Star father, became the subject of attacks from the left.

What have we become as a country when we use the families of fallen soldiers as weapons to attack political opponents? Or attack these families to protect politicians on our own side?

Not all of the families of fallen soldiers are going to say things that patriotic Americans agree with. Cindy Sheehan, the mother of Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004, is a prime example of a Gold Star mother who says things that are offensive to many other Americans.

The bottom line, however, is that they have the right, as American citizens, to express their opinions. As Americans who have sacrificed a family member, they have paid an unusually high price for the right to speak their minds freely. Their opinions should be respected, if not necessarily agreed with.

Can we resolve the issue of the phone call to Mrs. Johnson without calling either President Trump or Cowanda Jones-Johnson a liar? Yes. It’s surprisingly easy to guess what happened when we lay aside political grudges and preconceptions.

Keep in mind that first-person witnesses to an event are notoriously unreliable. This is especially true in cases where the individuals are under stress and distracted. Neither side recorded the call so both only have their fallible human memories and impressions to fall back on.

My best guess as to what happened is that President Trump made the call to Sgt. Johnson’s widow in good faith and went off script, as he tends to do. What seemed to be an innocuous comment to the president and Gen. Kelly was taken differently by the Johnson family and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fl.).

One of my favorite philosophies is Hanlon’s Razor, which advises, “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.” This advice applies to both sides in the current debate.

First, liberals should acknowledge that Donald Trump would not intentionally act so callously toward the widow of a fallen American soldier. The fact that Gen. Kelly now backs up Trump’s claim is a powerful argument that Trump’s statement may have been misheard or misinterpreted.

Second, Trump supporters should not assume that the family is intent on using the death of Sgt. Johnson to embarrass and attack the president. To assume that a grieving family would lie about what they heard the president say, knowing that it would cause Sgt. Johnson’s name to be dragged through the mud and that family members would be subjected to personal attacks in their time of grief, defies logic.

Kelly’s statement seems to support the idea that the president unintentionally misspoke. Recalling the words of Gen. Joseph Dunford after the death of his own son in Afghanistan, Kelly said, “He was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that one percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we were at war. And when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends. That’s what the President tried to say to the four families the other day.”

And there is no significant difference in citizen complaints about camera-wearing officers versus those without cameras, the study says.
“Evidence of their effectiveness is limited,” researchers David Yokum, Anita Ravishankar and Alexander Coppock conclude about the cameras in their report, titled, “Evaluating the Effects of Police Body-Worn Cameras.”The study tracked more than 2,000 Washington, D.C., police officers – half with cameras, half without – for 18 months.
The research team then tallied their use-of-force situations, civilian complaints against them, etc., and examined whether cameras affected the results.
""The results call into question whether police departments should even be adopting body-worn cameras, especially given their high cost.""","Prompted in part by high-profile complaints about police use of force, the U.S. government in recent years has allocated tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for body cameras for state and local police departments – and those states and municipalities have invested millions of their own dollars as well.

But a study released Friday reveals that body cameras have little to no effect on police behavior. Officers wearing the devices act similarly to those who don’t, the study concludes.

And there is no significant difference in citizen complaints about camera-wearing officers versus those without cameras, the study says.

But every measure showed the differences to be insignificant.

“The results call into question whether police departments should even be adopting body-worn cameras, especially given their high cost,” Harlan Yu, a consultant with Upturn, a Washington nonprofit that examines technology’s effect on society, told the New York Times. Yu’s group was not involved in the study, the Times says.

""The results call into question whether police departments should even be adopting body-worn cameras, especially given their high cost."" - Harlan Yu, consultant with Upturn, a nonprofit that examines technology’s effect on society

Police departments investing in body cameras “should not expect dramatic reductions in the use-of-force complaints, or other large-scale shifts in police behavior solely from the deployment of this technology,” study director Yokum, of The Lab @DC, told the Washington Post.

“So if you are a police department thinking that this technology on its own is going to be something to cause big shifts on those two dynamics, this would be a cause to recalibrate your expectations,” Yokum said.

Washington, D.C., police Chief Peter Newsham told the Times he was surprised by the results because he was expecting the use of cameras to at least have an impact on those officers “who might be more inclined to misbehave.”

If the cameras have any value at all, the chief told the Post, it’s likely to be in helping clarify details of controversial cases – such as whether a suspect is armed or not when officers arrive at a crime scene.

Sgt. Matthew Mahl, chairman of the D.C. police labor union, told the Post that he too expected the study’s conclusions to be different.

“I honestly thought that complaints would have come down,” Mahl told the newspaper. “We’re spending all this money to realize that everything is the same.

He also criticized the dictatorship of North Korea, and met with several North Korean escapees, American college students, who are the recipients of the Bush Institute's North Korean Freedom Scholarship program.
The U.S. government military force, or any independent force should stop the North Korean regime, because the regime is killing the innocent people in the country.
""I believe North Korean regime will not listen if we speak nicely.
President Bush warned that one of biggest problems facing the nation right was ""a deficit of confidence.""","Decrying what he called bigotry, bullying and prejudice in politics, former President George W. Bush bluntly warned about dangers to democracy, both abroad and here at home.

He spoke at a New York City forum sponsored by his Dallas-based Bush Institute, called 'The Spirit of Liberty At Home, In the World.' He warned that democracy is weakening in the coarseness of current politics.

""People of every race, religion and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed, and it means that the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation,” he said. “Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.""

He warned that ""we have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty. At times, it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are strong than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily to animosity. Disagreement escalates into dehumanization. Too often, we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions – forgetting the image of God we should see in each other.""

He also slammed what he called Russia and China's aggression and challenging of the world order, but said here in the U.S. we must be on guard against isolationism and nationalism.

He also criticized the dictatorship of North Korea, and met with several North Korean escapees, American college students, who are the recipients of the Bush Institute's North Korean Freedom Scholarship program. The effort, run by the George W. Bush Institute, provides $25,000 in scholarship money to eight students to ""pursue higher education and build productive, prosperous lives as new Americans.""

Among those who met with the former President, was Grace Jo, a 26-year-old student at Maryland's Montgomery College.

She addressed the gathering, earning applause when she told the group of several hundred people when she stepped up to the podium and announced, ""My name is Grace Jo, and I am an American.""

Grace told Fox News that she and her family escaped three times to China, only to be caught and sent back. Her two younger brothers died of starvation and her father died from being tortured while in police custody for sneaking a bag of rice back from China. She says starvation was rampant while she was growing up, and that the family was occasionally given a bag of potatoes by the government. She recalled her family living for 10 days without any food, surviving only on water. That's when her mother found six baby mice in a field and her grandmother made soup out of them in order for the family to survive.

She is a young woman of strong resolve who is bluntly clear about what she hopes will be the fate of Kim Jong Un's regime.

""The North Korean regime should not exist in this world any more, any longer. The U.S. government military force, or any independent force should stop the North Korean regime, because the regime is killing the innocent people in the country. Child, babies and moms are dying without any hope.""

She says from first-hand experience that tough talk is the only thing that the Kim Jong Un regime understands.

""I believe North Korean regime will not listen if we speak nicely. So I think it is time to take action to the North Korean government, because if we don't have any action and only speak words and try to give something to them, like give a candy to a little crying kid, it can solve for the moment but it will not solve for the long run,"" she says.

She does not think a military strike, with its predictions of a possible catastrophic loss of life in South Korea and the region, is feasible. ""I don't want to drop a bomb,"" she said. Grace hopes the U.S. and its allies can conduct covert actions that will lead to the toppling of the regime. She does not think sanctions have or will work to deter Pyongyang's nuclear programs and military aggression.

Bush also said it is a time that western democracies are being tested.

""We are gathered in the cause of liberty. This is a unique moment. The great democracies face new and serious threats. Yet, some seem to be losing confidence in their own calling and competence. Economic, political and national security challenges proliferate, and they are made worse by the tendency to turn inward. The health of the democratic spirit itself is at issue. And the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand.""

Former First Lady Laura Bush also spoke, and former Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice, Madeleine Albright and current U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, participated in a panel discussion. Haley called Grace Jo an inspiration.

""Grace Jo you inspire us so much you are the reason we fight for what we fight for,"" she said.

Ambassador Haley then warned that North Korea tops the list of threats against U.S. national security.

""We do have a lot of threats but we also have to remember that leadership matters so our biggest threats obviously: North Korea, Iran ISIS, those are the three because we have to always make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans and our allies,"" Haley said.

President Bush warned that one of biggest problems facing the nation right was ""a deficit of confidence.""

""But the cause of freedom justifies our all our faith and effort. It still inspires men and women in the darkest corners of the world, and it will inspire a rising generation. The American spirit does not say, ""We shall manage,"" or ""We shall make the best of it.”

It says ""We shall overcome."" And that is exactly what we will do, with the help of God and one another.""

""The American public deserves to know the facts, or at least they deserve to know what the government has kept hidden from them for all these years,"" Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of a book about Kennedy, said in an email to The Associated Press.

It's unlikely the documents contain any big revelations about Kennedy's killing, said Judge John Tunheim, who was chairman of the independent agency in the 1990s that made public many assassination records and decided how long others could remain secret.

Sabato and other JFK scholars believe the trove of files may provide insight into assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City weeks before the killing.

During the trip, Oswald visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies.

His stated reason for going was to get visas that would allow him to enter Cuba and the Soviet Union, according to the Warren Commission, the investigative body established by President Lyndon B. Johnson. However, much about the trip remains unknown.

Among the protected information up for release is details about the arrangements the U.S. entered into with the Mexican government that allowed it to have close surveillance of those and other embassies, said Tunheim, a federal judge in Minnesota.

Kennedy experts also hope to see the full report on Oswald's trip to Mexico City from staffers of the House committee that investigated the assassination, said Rex Bradford, president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which publishes assassination records.

The White House didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

The FBI declined to comment on whether it has asked Trump to keep the files hidden. A CIA spokeswoman would say only that it ""continues to engage in the process to determine the appropriate next steps with respect to any previously-unreleased CIA information.""

Congress mandated in 1992 that all assassination documents be released within 25 years, unless the president asserts that doing so would harm intelligence, law enforcement, military operations or foreign relations. The still-secret documents include more than 3,000 that have never been seen by the public and more than 30,000 that have been released previously, but with redactions.

The files that were withheld in full were those the Assassination Records Review Board deemed ""not believed relevant,"" Tunheim said. Its members sought to ensure they weren't hiding any information directly related to Kennedy's assassination, but there may be nuggets of information in the files that they didn't realize was important two decades ago, he said.

""There could be some jewels in there because in our level of knowledge in the 1990s is maybe different from today,"" Tunheim said.

The National Archives would not say whether any agencies have appealed the release of the documents.

The Archives in July published online more than 440 never-before-seen assassination documents and thousands of others that had been released previously with redactions.

Among those documents was a 1975 internal CIA memo that questioned whether Oswald became motivated to kill Kennedy after reading an AP article in a newspaper that quoted Fidel Castro as saying ""U.S. leaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to do away with leaders of Cuba.""

""Oswald might have had a clear motive, one that we have never really understood for killing Kennedy, because he thought that by killing Kennedy he might be saving the life of Fidel Castro,"" said Philip Shenon, a former New York Times reporter who has written a book about Kennedy's assassination.

Some of the files will likely remain under wraps, experts say.

It's unlikely the National Archives will release some IRS records, including the tax returns of Jack Ruby, the man who killed Oswald, Bradford said.

Sabato said he also suspects that some key records may also have been destroyed before the 1992 law ordered that all the files be housed in the National Archives.

Czech citizens are voting for a second day in a parliamentary election that could install another euroskeptic government in Central Europe.

Two days of balloting that started Friday are being held to fill 200 seats in the Czech Republic's lower house of Parliament.

Voting wraps up on Saturday afternoon and results are expected late in the day.

The centrist ANO (YES) movement led by populist billionaire Andrej Babis was the front-runner heading into the election. Polls show he is likely to become the next prime minister despite allegations of fraud linked to EU subsidies.

Babis has been critical of the European Union; he opposes the EU's quota system on redistributing refugees and setting a date for adopting the euro.

The civil complaint filed on Monday accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of football and also named Riddell, the company that previously manufactured the league’s helmets that Hernandez wore when he was playing for the New England Patriots.

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.

The Hernandez estate also said CTE caused “aggression, explosive behavior, loss of concentration, mood swings, depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment.”

Riddell, an Illinois-based manufacturer, said it intends to vigorously defend its products and its reputation against concussion-related lawsuits

Hernandez hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell in April, five days after he was acquitted of the 2012 double murder of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was serving life in prison for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.

Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE. The disease has been shown to cause depression, violent mood swings and other cognitive problems in people.

“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.

The lawyers are seeking the damages on behalf of Hernandez’s 4-year-old daughter. The case was refiled in state court after the federal case was dismissed last Friday. The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to ""disclose, treat or protect"" Hernandez from so-called ""repetitive impact injuries."" The Patriots have since been dropped from the lawsuit.

During his early high school years, Hernandez was known as a gifted athlete, but was also seen with a “rough-and-tumble” crowd, the New York Times reported. His father, Dennis Hernandez, kept him grounded until his death in 2006. His mother told reporters that she was worried the death would derail her son’s life.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he wants his Senate to give him direct power to dissolve the regional Catalan government and to call an early election as soon as possible. The Senate is likely to approve Rajoy's request.

Rajoy’s Cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution.

Rajoy proposed the powers of Catalan officials be taken over by central government ministers.

The meeting came almost three weeks after a controversial referendum seeking the region’s independence which was ruled illegal by the country’s Supreme Court.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has argued the referendum result gave him the mandate to move forward with independence.

What is Catalonia?

Located in the northeast region of Spain, Catalonia is largely independent with its own culture and language. It’s one of the richest and most industrialized areas of the country with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, according to the BBC.

The region, which includes Barcelona, is home to about 7.5 million people.

Valuing its autonomy, Catalonia has its own parliament and executive, called “Generalitat” in its language.

""What's being contested between Spain and Catalonia ... is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.""

Why do they want independence?

Because of its own cultural identity, those in favor of Catalan independence have pushed for the region to become separate from Spain. Supporters also believe that they have given more to the Spanish government than they have gotten back.

The push for independence “raises questions of the future of democracy and democratic rule,” Pamela Radcliff, a University of California, San Diego professor and modern Spain historian, told Fox News. “What’s being contested between Spain and Catalonia, one of the things is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.”

TOP EU OFFICIALS RALLY BEHIND SPANISH PM OVER CATALAN POLL

The push for independence is led by Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1.

How did the vote go?

About 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who cast votes chose independence, Catalan officials said of the disputed referendum. However, fewer than half of eligible voters participated.

About 900 people were treated for injuries after voting turned violent when Catalan civilians and Spanish police clashed earlier this month.

Andrew Dowling, an expert in Catalan history at Cardiff University in Wales, said that any independence declaration by the Catalan parliament would be symbolic without border and institutional control and no international support.

Such a declaration ""will see the fracture between hardliners and the pragmatic people in Catalonia who are already seeing an economic fallout,"" Dowling told The Associated Press.

What has been Spain’s response?

Spain's top court declared the independence referendum illegal.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria accused Puigdemont of putting the Catalan people “in the greatest level of uncertainty seen yet.”

And Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the referendum was part of a strategy “to impose independence that few want and is good for nobody.”

CATALONIA VOTERS PROTEST AGAINST VIOLENT POLICE TACTICS AFTER INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Rajoy has reportedly refused help from outside civil-society groups and lawyers to mediate negotiations between the two factions. He has also declined to engage in talks with Catalan leaders.

“There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience and unlawfulness,” Rajoy said.

Spain had given Puigdemont two deadlines – which have come and gone – on whether the independence referendum is serious.

Radcliff said that “it’s very possible” that neither side has “much incentive to compromise.”

What is Article 155?

Spain has threatened to invoke a clause of its constitution should Catalonia forge ahead with its plans to secede from the country that would take away the region’s autonomy.

A refusal to backtrack from its independence threats would trigger Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the government has said, which would allow central authorities to take over control of any of the country’s 17 regions. It’s a provision that hasn’t been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in the European nation.

An English translation of the constitution states that should an autonomous community break the law or disregard the constitution, the Spanish government can – after following certain procedures – “take the measures necessary in order to compel the [community] forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect [Spain’s] general interests.”

Rajoy's cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

COUNTRY STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CMT ARTISTS

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

For as far back as anyone can remember graduates wore gowns reflecting the school colors. The guys wore navy blue gowns and the gals wore blue gowns.

Click here for a free subscription to Todd’s newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!

But that tradition just got deep-sixed for the sake of gender inclusivity – and now graduates will only be allowed to wear one color that represents all genders.

“This is a very big national initiative,” Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Penelope DeLeon told the student newspaper. “It is not about gender equality as much as it is about being respectful to everybody’s choice to select a gender or not to select a gender, and we have students who choose not to.”

Wait. What?

So, kids now have the option of being genderless? Is that the latest fad among the sex and gender revolutionaries?

The Stinger, in a well-written report, noted that not everyone is on board with the school district’s gender neutral color palate.

“I understand that gender neutrality is a growing topic,” student Drew Reyes told the newspaper. “I just think we could have [found] a solution that allowed us to keep both colors, since they’re both shades of blue.”

Well, that’s not going to happen because the school district is 50 shades of stupid.

“The whole school shouldn’t have to wear one color just to accommodate some people,” student Isaac DeLara told the newspaper.

School staffer Lori Pristera was happy to tackle that question.

“That’s like saying you have three percent of your graduating class who are deaf so we don’t want a sign language interpreter there because that’s not what 97 percent of the students need,” she told the newspaper.

Ironic – seeing how the school district is absolutely tone deaf on this issue.

But there might be a simple fix for students who want to honor tradition and wear gender-specific graduation gowns.

The guys should show up on graduation day wearing navy blue and the girls should wear blue.

If the principal objects, just them tell you are “color neutral.” And as a color neutral student, your navy blue gown actually identifies as a blue gown – or vice versa.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months.""

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit ""Body Like a Back Road,"" which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

""It could have been any one of us standing on that stage two weeks ago,"" Bryan said. ""It's a nightmare that nobody should have to face. Jason has responded with dignity, care, respect and, some ways, defiance. And we all proud of him, especially me.""

The Bowling Green Daily News reports that Chevrolet will stop building the 2018 model on January 22 after a total of just four months of production.

Chevrolet won't say why.

The Bowling Green factory where the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 has been shut down the past few months for the installation of a new paint shop and other upgrades, so the model year was already truncated.

Chevy is still scheduled to build around 9,700 of the coupes and convertibles by January, according to the newspaper, so 2018 cars won’t exactly be rare, but they may end up being among the last of their kind.

Although the folks at Chevy haven’t admitted it, they are hard at work on a next-generation sports car that’s believed to be a mid-engine successor to the Corvette.

Prototypes of the vehicle have been spotted on the road, and it is expected to officially debut at the Detroit Auto Show in January.

The question is, what will be coming out of the factory when the plant starts building 2019 model year cars on January 29?

“What’s the deal with your mayor, de Blasio? Is there something wrong with this brain?”

The “Jimmy Kimmel Live” host then played a clip showing how the mayor “celebrates” the success of his city’s baseball team. A local news anchor reported that de Blasio is “such a die-hard Red Sox fan” that he said it would be “physically impossible” for him to support the Yankees, despite the financial and morale boosts that would come with the Fall Classic being played in the city he is expected to oversee.

“I mean I give him credit for honesty, but that might be the stupidest f--king thing I’ve ever heard anybody say,” Kimmel said.

De Blasio is a Boston Red Sox fan and Kimmel’s Brooklyn crowd booed when the late-night host mentioned that New Yorkers voted for him anyway.

“It’s like I don’t even know you anymore,” Kimmel said. “I just want to say congratulations to Bill de Blasio on his final term as mayor of the city of New York.”

ABC’s late-night star was a fairly non-political talk show host for the first 10-plus years of the show's run. That all changed in early 2017 when Kimmel detailed the open-heart surgery his newborn son, William, had to undergo. He explained that many children wouldn’t have the opportunity to survive without the Affordable Care Act, and emerged as an outspoken opponent of the Republican Congress’ attempt to undo it.

The ABC host recently said he “probably wouldn't want to have a conversation” with conservatives when asked if he was afraid of losing right-leaning viewers.

“Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats. And, then, Republican numbers went way down, like thirty percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that's not ideal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat,” he said on “CBS Sunday Morning.”

Bush had the most “destructive” presidency in U.S. history.

Bannon's scathing comments at the annual California Republican Party convention came about a week after Bush denounced bigotry in Trump-era American politics and warned that the rise of isolationism and ""nativism,"" which Bannon espouses, have clouded the nation's true identity.

""There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush's,"" Bannon said.

He also said Bush has no idea whether ""he is coming or going, just like it was when he was president,” amid boos in the crowd at the mention of Bush's name.

Bannon made the remarks in a speech thick with attacks on the Washington status quo, echoing his earlier calls for an ""open revolt"" against establishment Republicans. He called the ""permanent political class"" one of the great dangers faced by the country.

Bannon, a late-arrival to Trump’s presidential campaign who was ousted last month from his White House post, got a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech in Anaheim.

Since leaving the White House at Trump’s top political adviser, Bannon has returned to Breitbart News and embarked on an effort to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other congressional Republicans whom he thinks have slowed or blocked Trump’s legislative agenda.

Bannon has for weeks basked in the victory of social conservative Roy Moore over establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama’s GOP Senate runoff.

And at a speech last weekend in Washington to social conservatives, Bannon declared “war” on establishment candidates, particularly lose seeking reelection next year.

A small group of protesters gathered outside the Southern California hotel where Bannon spoke, chanting and waving signs including one with a Nazi swastika. The protesters were kept behind steel barricades on a plaza across an entrance road at the hotel, largely out of view of people entering for the event. No arrests were reported.

Bannon also took aim at the Silicon Valley and its ""lords of technology,"" predicting that tech leaders and progressives in the state would try to secede from the union in 10 to 15 years. He called the threat to break up the nation a ""living problem.""

He also tried to cheer long-suffering California Republicans, in a state that Trump lost by over 4 million votes and where Republicans have become largely irrelevant in state politics. In Orange County, where the convention was held, several Republican House members are trying to hold onto their seats in districts carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential contest.

""You've got everything you need to win,"" he told them.

While Bannon is promoting a field of primary challengers to take on incumbent Republicans, the GOP has been fading for years in California.

The state has become a kind of Republican mausoleum: GOP supporters can relive the glory days by visiting the stately presidential libraries of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, but today Democrats control every statewide office and rule both chambers of the Legislature by commanding margins.

Not all Republicans were glad to see Bannon. In a series of tweets last week, former state Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes said he was shocked by the decision to have the conservative firebrand headline the event.

""It's a huge step backward and demonstrates that the party remains tone deaf,"" Mayes tweeted

Political scientist Jack Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College, said he doubted the speech would color the 2018 congressional contests, which remain far off for most voters.

More broadly, he said Bannon's politics would hurt the GOP, including among affluent, well-educated voters who play an important part in county elections.

""Inviting him was a moral and political blunder,"" Pitney said in an email.

“I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!” Trump tweeted.

The feud started after Wilson listened to a phone call Trump made Monday to Myeshia Johnson, the widow of fallen Army Sgt. La David Johnson, then claimed that the president said told Johnson that her deceased husband “knew what he signed up for.”

Johnson was one of four Americans killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

After several Trump tweets and Wilson TV interviews earlier this week, White House Chief of Staff retired Gen. John Kelly on Thursday publically criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call, suggesting she’s trying to politicize the matter.

“I feel very sorry for him because he feels such a need to lie on me and I’m not even his enemy,” Wilson said Friday about Kelly's remarks, in a New York Times interview. “I just can’t even imagine why he would fabricate something like that. That is absolutely insane. I’m just flabbergasted because it’s very easy to trace.”

Wilson didn’t label Kelly a racist in the interview but claimed that others in the White House are.

“They are making themselves look like fools,” she also said. “They have no credibility. They are trying to assassinate my character, and they are assassinating their own because everything they say is coming out and shown to be a lie.”

Kelly said he was “broken-hearted” by Wilson’s involvement in the call. During his remarks, Kelly also criticized Wilson by recalling her comments during the 2015 dedication of a FBI field office in Miramar, Fla.

He said Wilson “talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million, to build the building, and she sat down.”

“And we were stunned, stunned that she'd done it,"" Kelly said of Wilson's remarks during the event. ""Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.""

But video of that event, released on Friday, showed that Wilson did not talk about the building’s funding, but instead spoke of her own efforts getting legislation passed that named the building after the fallen agents.",Trump calls Rep.

That's what Sean Penn’s lawyers are saying about Netflix in regard to their release of a documentary series about drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman which, they warn, could put the Academy Award-winning actor in danger.

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., Penn’s lawyer, wrote a letter to Netflix explaining that the release of “The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story” could potentially put Penn in danger because the series implied the actor helped the Department of Justice apprehend the notorious head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, The New York Times reported.

Boutrous told the streaming service in the letter, “blood will be on their hands if this film causes bodily harm.”

SEAN PENN TELLS CHARLIE ROSE HE REGRETS EL CHAPO INTERVIEW

The series, which was released Friday, focused on del Castillo, a Mexican actress, and Penn’s October 2015 meeting with Guzman. Penn wrote an article for the Rolling Stone detailing the interview, which was facilitated by del Castillo. The essay was published a day after the drug lord was recaptured in Mexico.

Penn claimed he had nothing to do with Guzman’s recapture.

Last year, Penn told Charlie Rose that he met the drug lord in a “place nowhere near where he was captured.” He also told Rose the accusations that he helped in Guzman's capture were “incorrect and could put him in danger.”

“It is reprehensible that, in their ongoing, relentless efforts to gain additional attention and publicity, Ms. del Castillo and her team (who have zero firsthand knowledge) have sought to create this profoundly false, foolish and reckless narrative,” Penn’s spokesman told The New York Times.

Kia, Audi and BMW filled out the rest of the top five, while Cadillac, GMC, Ram, Dodge and Volvo were ranked the lowest.

Complaints about infotainment systems and new transmissions plagued the lowest-ranked automakers, while Toyota's slow and steady implementation of new technologies paid off with high marks.

Consumer Reports predicts reliability of 2018 vehicles based on a survey of subscribers who owned or leased 640,000 vehicles from the 2000-2017 model years. It forecasts how a model will perform based on recent data for that model.

The magazine gives more weight to mechanical and safety issues than minor problems like wind noise.

The magazine's rankings are closely watched in the industry, since many buyers seek advice from Consumer Reports.

Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, says Toyota's strategy of adding new technology gradually — instead of all at once — helps make its vehicles more reliable. Toyota's new Camry sedan, for example, has an eight-speed transmission that was first tested on the Highlander SUV.

Kia has also steadily climbed in the rankings because it uses proven technology that has already been tested by its sister brand, Hyundai, which slipped in the rankings. Consumer Reports found that the Kia Niro hybrid, which went on sale earlier this year, was the most reliable vehicle in its entire survey.

Audi and BMW also have better-than-average infotainment systems because they were some of the first to market them more than a decade ago.

""They've had all those growing pains,"" Fisher said.

By contrast, Buick dropped from third to eighth in the rankings because of troubles with its new 2017 LaCrosse sedan, which has a new eight-speed transmission, new engine and new electronic shifter, among other features. Fisher said other recent Buicks, like the Envision, went on sale in China or Europe first and got some kinks worked out before heading to the U.S.

Electric cars escaped some of those reliability problems because they have fewer parts. General Motors Co. didn't fare well overall, but its new Chevrolet Bolt electric car had above-average reliability. In its debut on the list, Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 sedan got an ""average"" reliability score. The car isn't widely available yet, but the magazine based its ranking on responses for the company's Model S sedan, which has above-average reliability.

""There's a lot of stuff that's not in electric cars. They're simpler,"" Fisher said.

Chrysler was the biggest climber in the rankings, thanks to consumer reviews of its new Pacifica minivan. Acura fell the furthest, hurt by problems with the transmissions on several of its new models.

But then the skies cleared, her business was intact, and they were able to get back to work ""we had a little fruit left, we picked what was left on the Crocker estate in St. Helena.""

Starr says there are many wineries, like hers, that survived. She was touched to see first responders from as far away as Canada, and Australia, coming to California wine country to save lives and preserve homes and businesses.

Now, survivors are helping their neighbors, and wineries that are still in operation are picking up employees from the businesses that were destroyed by the fires. Starr says now that things are returning to normal, ""Napa Valley is ready for visitors, we're getting into business again.""

Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.","Friday marks the 40th anniversary of one of classic rock music’s greatest tragedies — the crash of the plane carrying the Southern band Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Killed in the Oct. 20, 1977 crash were founder and lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines and his sister, singer Cassie Gaines and members of the plane crew.

Other members of the band survived with various injuries – and eventually reformed the band, with Van Zant’s younger brother, Johnny, as lead singer. (Another brother, Donnie, has long been a member of the band .38 Special.)

The Jacksonville, Fla., band – known primarily for the songs “Freebird” and “Sweet Home Alabama” -- still tours today under the Skynyrd name.

The name was inspired by Leonard Skinner, who was a high school teacher of several band members.

But guitarist Gary Rossington is the only remaining member from the band’s classic lineup. Past members Allen Collins, Billy Powell and Leon Wilkeson have died, and drummer Artimus Pyle is estranged from his former bandmates.

The crash occurred when Lynyrd Skynyrd were nearing the peak of their success. So fans have long wondered what might have happened if the plane crash had never occurred.

The plane was to carry the band from Greenville, S.C., to Baton Rouge, La., but it crashed along the way in Mississippi, the Florida Times-Union reported.

“I think if Lynyrd Skynyrd had lasted, they would have become one of the foundations of American rock bands, much like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers or Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band,” music writer Bill Bentley told the newspaper.

In recent years, the band has recorded new albums and toured on the “classic rock” circuit, playing the old favorites as well as some more recent songs.

This year it has been involved in a legal dispute over a documentary film based on the memories of Pyle, the estranged member. In August, a judge ruled in favor of Rossington and Van Zant’s widow, who wanted the film’s distribution halted.

Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.

Q: With the Equifax breach, I am worried that hackers can steal money from my bank account. What can I do?

A: The sheer number of victims is massive, and it keeps climbing with every new report. Meanwhile, Equifax has done a miserable job of comforting its customers, and the fallout has left far more questions than answers. The best thing you can do for your security is to establish two-factor authentication on your bank account. Click here for the steps you can take to stop thieves from emptying your bank account.

Password help

Q: What’s the deal on passwords? I heard they needed to be long. Then I heard they could be short. Help!

A: The prevailing wisdom is to make a password as difficult as possible. The problem with complicated passwords is that they are very hard to remember, especially if they use an array of eccentric punctuation marks, like ampersands and pound signs. But the most current advice is actually a relief, especially if you have a poor memory. Believe it or not, hackers will have a devil of a time trying to figure your password out. Click here for three ways to craft great passwords based on the latest research.

Stalked by Google

Q: Is it true that Google keeps track of every place you go?

A: It stands to reason that your phone’s GPS can (a) track all your movements and (b) keep track of all your movements. Once you figure out just how meticulously Google records your every movement, you may be horrified enough to toss your Android in the nearest lake. All of this geographic documentation is probably harmless, but it's definitely unnerving, no matter how comfortable you are with a never-ending data stream.

Monitor color

Q: My photos look different colors when printed than they show on my monitor. Is my monitor bad?

A: A picture is only as strong as its weakest technical element, and problems are sometimes hard to pinpoint: Maybe your camera lens is malfunctioning, or you’re using cheap software, or your printer doesn’t do certain colors very well. Every little piece can affect how an image turns out. But if you’re pretty sure that your monitor isn’t showing its best colors, click here for a very simple way to fix it.

What Alexa hears

Q: I heard you say that Alexa and other gadgets are recording everything I say. Is this true?

A: The point of a hands-free device like Amazon Echo is that you don't have to press a button or flip a switch to activate the voice recognition software; you just say, “Alexa.” So what can you do to prevent your device from cataloging all of these audio files?

But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""Now That I See You"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""Now That I See You"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

At some point we have to pull up out of this downward spiral of mutual contempt — before it’s too late.","Editor's note: The following column is adapted from a post which originally appeared on AEIdeas.org, the blog of the American Enterprise Institute.

It is hard to imagine that our national descent into political contempt could get any worse than it did this week, when Congresswoman Frederica Wilson accused President Trump of disrespecting the pregnant widow of a fallen soldier during a condolence call, telling her that her husband “knew what he signed up for.”

It should have been obvious to all Trump probably flubbed what was intended as a compliment, praising his courage for volunteering to serve in a vocation he knew could cost him his life.

When I was a speechwriter for President Bush, he often praised our troops for volunteering for military service “knowing all the risks and dangers that come with wearing our nation’s uniform.”

We should have all assumed that Trump was trying to do the same thing, and that it just didn’t come out right.

Now, we know that is the case, as Gen. John Kelly — himself a Gold Star father — confirmed it in a moving statement in the White House press briefing room Thursday.

We have now arrived at the day where the president’s efforts to console grieving families who lost loved ones in a time of war is considered fair game for political attacks.

You can see Gen. Kelly’s remarks at the top of this column. They are worth watching in full.

Trump was under no obligation to make that call. General Kelly advised him not to. But the president wanted to do it anyway. And with unexpected humility, knowing he had never worn the uniform, he asked a close adviser who had worn the uniform what he should say — and then tried to say it. His motive was to praise a hero and comfort a grieving family.

That this congresswoman (who boycotted Trump’s inauguration and has called for his impeachment) would publicize and politicize what the president said in private to this Gold Star family is reprehensible. It marked a new low — one that was exceeded only by her response to Gen. Kelly’s comments declaring that she was now a “rock star” because she was being talked about from the White House podium. If that did not make her motives clear, I don’t know what would.

Also shameful was the media feeding frenzy, with reporters unquestioningly reporting her comments and then calling other Gold Star families to see if Trump had insulted them as well.

And then there was the reaction of the “The Resistance” which was epitomized by former Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon’s tweet: “Kelly isnt just an enabler of Trump. He’s a believer in him. That makes him as odious as the rest. Don’t be distracted by the uniform.”

Kelly is a decorated veteran who lost a son in service to our country. But don’t be distracted by all that. Trump hate is simply blinding to some.

This is not to suggest that Trump is blameless in this affair. The charge that he had insulted a Gold Star family would not have been believable if he had not previously insulted a Gold Star family during the 2016 campaign (a moment that Gen. Kelly referred to in his statement Thursday) or declared that John McCain was not a hero because he had been captured [while serving our country in Vietnam].

He should not have publicly questioned how his predecessors expressed their condolences to grieving families (though, again, he was inarticulately repeating what Gen. Kelly had told him — that President Obama did not call him when his son was killed in action). And rather than returning fire at Rep. Wilson on Twitter, Trump should have taken the high road and simply said, “I was trying to praise his courage, and I blew it.” He seems congenitally incapable of admitting a mistake.

There are no heroes in this entire episode, except the ones who seem to have been forgotten in the political melee: the four brave Americans who gave their lives on the battlefield.

Many have been mourning the fact that political contempt has infected every aspect of our lives, including sports. But we have now arrived at the day where the president’s efforts to console grieving families who lost loved ones in a time of war is considered fair game for political attacks.

How much hate must someone have in their heart to presume that the president would pick up the phone to call a grieving widow and intentionally insult the memory of her lost loved one?

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

With its recent announcement that it will admit girls, the Boy Scouts organization has not simply shown a profound disregard for its admirable roots. It has further abandoned boys to a culture that values them less and less.

Dressed in the language of equality and fairness, the move by the Boy Scouts may seem harmless enough. But I believe it’s unhelpful at best and damaging at worst – to both boys and girls.

However much some may wish it were otherwise, the reality is that males and females are fundamentally different in many ways – physically, emotionally and in their relationships. Pretending otherwise in the name of progress or permissiveness might be culturally acceptable, but it does both sexes a disservice.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down.

One of those differences, in most cases, is the way boys and girls learn. Girls are more likely to do well in the quiet control of a classroom, while boys squirm and struggle.

Daring, action and competition – potential strengths that rival focus, reflection, and consensus – are qualities that need to be fostered and filtered. Boys know that rough-and-tumble play – like playing with squirt guns and laser tag – does just that. Restrictions on this are alienating and downplay the natural tendencies of boys.

Boys need strong male role models. They also need a place for adventure and opportunities to test themselves in pursuit of awards that challenge and channel their innate drive and daring. In this way they can be helped to grow into men of true strength, real character, and genuine conviction – not Hollywood’s distorted version of manhood.

Sadly, the Boy Scouts appear to have bought into the idea that rather than being something to be celebrated and championed, boyhood is something to be watered down. They are discounting a historically male-focused experience that made presidents, astronauts and leaders of mere men. Indeed, making the inclusivity announcement on the International Day of the Girl Child could be considered the ultimate put-down.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

Don’t misunderstand: I’m not inferring that girls are lesser or inferior. The Boy Scouts message is actually that boys are lesser and inferior because their uniqueness needs to be denied rather than directed, stifled rather than strengthened.

While I’m clarifying something, let me also emphasize that my conviction that we must provide space for “boys to be boys” does not mean I’m advocating a breeding ground for a future generation of sexual predators.

Indeed, I believe one of the main reasons we see the sort of indefensible behavior by men in power – like the actions Harvey Weinstein is accused of – is a lack of the kind of mentoring and coaching that models true manhood.

I’m talking about instilling in today’s boys a culture of respect, honor and integrity. Properly guided, the drive and daring tendencies in boys will lead them to become the determined, focused, winning men of tomorrow who appreciate the uniqueness and dignity of women.

You don’t have to look too far to see that at every level of society we are losing ground in areas as basic as kindness, self-control, respect, honor and purity. These should be taught and modeled for boys in an atmosphere designed for their unique temperament under the tutelage of men with the mettle to guide, alongside their peers.

Robert Baden-Powell would not now recognize the organization he founded in 1910. But while the Boy Scouts may have lost their way, they are not alone. They are just another group favoring trendy political correctness over time-honored principled convictions.

The results of all this are sadly too evident when it comes to our sons. Boys are losing out in any number of categories, from heightened special education involvement and ADHD diagnoses to lower high school rankings and college attendance.

While my dismay at the Boy Scouts decision centers on what this means for boys, I am also concerned about its impact on girls. What’s bad for the gander is equally bad for the goose.

Girls, though wired differently, equally need an environment that caters to their unique traits and qualities. You can’t deliver a program at a character-changing level with any real effectiveness in the same style to two different types of learners.

As Baden-Powell observed: “Girls should … take a real and not a visionary share in the welfare of the nation.”

But they shouldn’t be squeezed into a Boy Scout uniform.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the importance of passing the budget today so we can move forward with tax reform. Listen to the full interview below:

Chairman Brady on the importance of the budget passing today's vote:

It means everything. This is, the budget gives us the runway to land tax reform on in a big, bold way. Secondly, and I think most importantly, it makes sure that no party including the democrats can obstruct tax reform from getting to the president's desk this year. So it's very simple. No budget, no tax reform. And from a timing standpoint, once that budget is reconciled between the house and senate it's signed, sealed and delivered within 24 hours. We're going to bring forward the Republican tax reform plan and for the first time in 31 years we're going to start action on it.

Chairman Brady responding to Joe Manchin saying he could get six to eight democrats:

I think we do have a lot of common ground with Democrats like Joe Manchin. They want a strong middle class tax cut. They want to stop seeing our jobs go overseas, in fact we want to see them come back here, we deliver exactly that. I wouldn't raise that business rate because it just gives an advantage to China and Europe and our competitors, but I want to continue to work with democrats on how we make our businesses more competitive, especially our main street businesses. You know those small businesses on average they make about $75,000 a year. They work their fingers to the bone. It is a tough slog and they're hiring a lot of our workers. We're continuing in the House in the Ways and Means Committee to continue to work to provide even more help for our smaller business.

Chairman Brady on what's at stake today with the budget vote:

Everything. In my view. One, it's the direction of this country. We cannot stay saddled with this current tax code. We're losing jobs right and left. We've got to change. Secondly, for Republicans you know, how hard is it for us to unite behind President Trump and deliver on our promises? Especially on tax reform. And I think Republicans are not going to disappoint.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

No such thing as a coincidence. Doesn’t exist.

Yet, we are led to believe it was merely a coincidence that Bill Clinton just happened to be on the tarmac of an Arizona airport at the same time as then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. We are supposed to accept that their private meeting on board Lynch’s plane had nothing whatsoever to do with the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton which the A-G was overseeing at the time.

Right. They just “schmoozed” about grandkids and what-not.

I guess it was also just a coincidence that a few days after the furtive tarmac meeting the decision was announced that criminal charges against Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, would not be filed, notwithstanding compelling evidence that she repeatedly violated the Espionage Act by storing highly classified documents on her private, unauthorized and unsecured email server in the basement of her home.

Sure. Makes perfect sense. To a naïve, gullible fool.

Maybe it was purely a coincidence that there was another FBI investigation going on involving Russia’s corruption-fueled purchase of U.S uranium assets and which also happened to implicate the Clintons, but was kept hidden from Congress and the American people by Lynch and her predecessor, Eric Holder. Hmm…

And perhaps it was simply an odd coincidence that the investigation of this uranium bribery, extortion, money laundering and kickback case was supervised by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, his successor James Comey, and then-U.S Attorney Rod Rosenstein, all of whom appear to have covered it up but are now directly involved in the Trump-Russia probe.

Strange confluence of people and events, eh?

I don’t buy any of it. Not for one minute. And not entirely because I don’t believe in coincidences. It is because all the above-mentioned people are known to trifle with the law or ignore disqualifying conflicts of interest. They seem to be without principles --devoid of the kind of scruples that should guide people in service of our government.

Mueller is serving as special counsel in the Trump-Russia case. He reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who appointed him.

Yet both Rosenstein and fired FBI Director James Comey are witnesses in the case, since Rosenstein recommended to President Trump that Comey be fired.

It is well established that Comey and Mueller are long-time friends, allies and former partners. How can Mueller be fair and impartial given these glaring conflicts of interest? He cannot. And he should recuse himself. Rosenstein should also step aside in overseeing the case. He cannot be prosecutor and witness simultaneously.

Their conflicts are compounded by recent reports that all three men were involved in the Russian uranium case which was kept hidden from Congress. How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia case if they engaged in a cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case?

Which brings us to Hillary and Bill. The Clinton name is synonymous with scandal. The sleazy Whitewater land deals, an illicit affair with a young White House intern that led to impeachment, deceptions following the Benghazi murders, Travelgate, cattle futures, suspected slush funds, evidence of perjury, the list is seemingly endless.

Through it all, the ability of the Clintons to evade indictments would make Houdini proud. They are escape artists of the highest order.

Loretta Lynch should never have presided over the Hillary Clinton email case. She owed her career to none other than Bill Clinton who nominated her to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York which nicely positioned her for elevation to Attorney General a few years later.

She should have recused herself from the Hillary probe from the outset, but did not. Only when the ethically-challenged tarmac meeting took place did she step aside. Belatedly. Supposedly. I have my doubts.

On Friday, Lynch met behind closed doors with the House Intelligence Committee. Too bad the public was deprived of witnessing an attempt to elicit the truth. But secrecy is endemic in Washington, which is precisely why it is so easy to obscure the truth when power corrupts.

Lynch was likely asked to explain the full content of the infamous tarmac conversation with Bill Clinton that lasted approximately 30 minutes. Did Clinton remind Lynch of how much she owed him? Are we to believe that he never broached the potential indictment of his wife with the very person who could decide her fate?

It is likely Lynch was asked by the Intel Committee if she ever directed Comey to mischaracterize the Clinton email case as a “matter” instead of what it truly was, a criminal investigation. Was Lynch downplaying the case because she planned to scuttle any criminal charges? Did she assure anyone in the Clinton orbit that prosecution would never happen, incriminating evidence be damned?

Finally, why did Lynch allow Comey to usurp the power of the Attorney General in announcing that no criminal charges would be forthcoming against Clinton? It was bad enough that Comey misinterpreted the law on “intent” and “gross negligence,” but Lynch appears to have allowed her office to acquiesce in Comey’s decision. Why?

Since Friday’s hearing was secretive, we may never learn the answers to serious questions that appear to involve lawlessness and rampant corruption.

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C.
Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.
“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.","Sun-choking debris cast off by volcanoes more than 2,000 years ago starved headwaters feeding the Nile river and hastened the downfall of ancient Egypt’s last kingdom, researchers claim.

Eruptions in the 3rd and 1st century B.C. — including one of the biggest blasts in the past 2,500 years — coincided with crop failures, large-scale revolts and the withdrawal of Egyptian armies from the battlefield, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.

Up to now, researchers had struggled to find an explanation for these events.

“Volcanic eruptions may have had a central role in the eventual collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty,” the journal noted in a summary.

The findings, the authors said, also highlight the risk today of climate engineering schemes that would combat global warming by injecting billions of tiny particles into the stratosphere — just like a volcano — to block some of the sun’s rays.

Even if so-called solar radiation management lowers the planet’s temperature a notch or two, it could inadvertently cause major disruptions in rainfall patterns.

“Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agriculture regions,” which today include 70 percent of the world’s population, the authors wrote.

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C. with the suicide of Cleopatra. After that, the region became a Roman province.

The kingdom mostly thrived, nourished by the silt-rich Nile overflowing its banks in summer across a far-flung network of grain fields. An ingenious system of channels and dams stored water after the river receded in September.

VIOLENT UPRISINGS

“When the flood was good, the Nile Valley was one of the most agriculturally productive places in the ancient world,” said Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College Dublin and co-author of the study.

But in some years, the river failed to rise, and trouble followed. Why this happened was not known.

Drawing from climate models, Greenland ice cores, and ancient Egyptian writings, researchers led by Joseph Manning of Yale University pieced together a narrative that showed an unmistakeable link with major volcanic eruptions around the world.

In 245 B.C., for example, the ruler Ptolemy III suddenly, and inexplicably, abandoned a successful military campaign against his arch nemesis, the Seleucid Empire, centred in present-day Syria and Iraq.

“This about-face changed everything about Near East history,” Manning said.

Historical records also pointed to simultaneous food shortages due to insufficient flooding of the Nile, as well as violent uprisings in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which stretched across northeast Africa and parts of the Middle East.

A similar confluence of social upheaval, disease and starvation struck the empire in its final two decades.

Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.

From more recent records, scientists know that the tens of millions of tons of sulphur dioxide particles ejected into the upper atmosphere by a major eruption can prevent monsoon weather from moving far enough north of the equator to thoroughly soak the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Nile.

This happened in 939 when Eldgja, in Iceland, blew its top, and again in 1783-84, when Iceland’s Laki erupted.

The Islamic Nilometer, a log of Nile water levels since 622, showed a corresponding impact on the river.

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.

“But they likely added fuel to existing economic, political and ethnic tensions.”

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""Now That I See You"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""Now That I See You"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

Furthermore, the Riverfront Times of St. Louis reports that the “drunk” man has yet to be criminally charged for causing a disturbance aboard the flight, despite police and EMS workers being called to deal with him upon arrival.

""He does have this invisible white card,"" Shemekia Cannon told the Riverfront Times. ""They’re protecting this man to the point where we don’t even know his name. He’s alive, living his life, thinking this is all over. That's how I know that card exists.""

WOMAN SAYS DELTA AIR LINES PREVENTED HER FROM SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The incident originally took place aboard a flight from St. Louis to Denver on June 10, though footage of the altercation was only shared on YouTube earlier this week. In the video, the man can he heard using profanity and repeatedly telling Cannon — who is black — that he was “pulling his white card” when she asked to be re-seated.

WARNING: Footage contains profane language. Viewer discretion is advised.

Cannon told the Riverfront Times that she first saw the unidentified man drinking in the airport terminal while flirting with the redheaded woman who was later seated to his left. Aboard the flight, she says Frontier continued to serve him alcohol despite being visibly drunk. Cannon also says he continued flirting inappropriately with the redheaded woman, telling her how he wanted to take her to the plane’s restroom, and describing the size of his penis. He also began rubbing his crotch area, she says.

""When he described his penis size, I couldn’t take it no more,” said Cannon. ""I told [the flight attendants] what he’d said.”

Cannon alleges that a flight attendant came by and told the man he was no longer allowed to order alcohol, which prompted him to turn to the redheaded woman and say, ""Don't worry, I have white privilege, I have a white card.""

""I went from zero to a million,” remembers Cannon. “I looked at him and I said, 'You’re a racist son of a b----.'”

AIR BERLIN FLIGHT MAKES STRANGE MANEUVER, SPARKING SAFETY PROBE

In the above footage, subsequently captured by Cannon, the man can be heard repeating that he’d be “pulling his white card” after Cannon told the crew to “get him away from me.”

Cannon also told the Riverfront Times that she was moved to a different seat, but that the man continued arguing with flight attendants.

Police were called to meet the flight upon arrival, at which point they subdued the man, Cannon says.

""He kept screaming, 'I'm a business owner, I'm a business owner,'"" she told the Riverfront Times. ""He wanted everybody to know that he is a business man and he had white privilege and a white card. He was flailing and fighting everybody.""

Later, inside the terminal, Cannon says she met a woman who claimed to have captured footage of the unidentified man being rolled through the airport on a gurney.

Cannon’s lawyer later received a letter from the airline apologizing for the incident. However, Frontier wrote that they felt the crew’s actions “were appropriate for the situation and regret any discomfort caused to Ms. Cannon.” They also issued her a $250 flight voucher.

The Riverfront Times further confirmed through the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado that the man has not faced any criminal charges for his actions, though the matter is “under investigation.”

Frontier did not confirm to Fox News whether they were planning to take any further action against the unidentified passenger.

""We take allegations of misconduct very seriously and have worked internally to investigate Ms. Cannon’s concerns,” wrote the airline in a statement. “The comfort, safety and security of our crew and passengers is our first priority at all times.""",'Racist' Frontier Airlines passenger tells seat-mate he's 'pulling his white card' during argument,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/10/19/racist-frontier-airlines-passenger-tells-seat-mate-hes-pulling-his-white-card-during-argument.html

And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us.

I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts.","Loving big is a way of life around our house. Everyone is welcome. Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

RELATED: How to Clean Your Whole House With Vinegar

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

The bull escaped an unknown slaughterhouse and ran into the south side of Prospect Park about 11 a.m., prompting people strolling in the park to dial 911 to have the animal wrangled. A 1-year-old girl was injured when the bull toppled over her stroller, the New York Daily News reported.

“I was with my son Kamren and this cow ran out of Prospect Park and ran over a baby girl,” said Alexis Small, who was in the park when the unusual incident happened. “The mom was just crying and trying to calm her down. She was in such pain, I couldn’t even imagine.”

Police officers scrambled to capture the bull as it continued to run into a car before dashing into the Parade Grounds.

The event even sparked a social media debate on whether the animal was a cow or a bull.

“Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” NYC Parks tweeted.

“Anatomy is incorrect for a cow, that, my friends is a bull. Udders=cow, penis=bull. Collectively=cattle,” one user replied.

Another person tweeted: “This cow is really milking his time in the spotlight..”

Officers tranquilized and wrangled the bull around 1:30 p.m. after it appeared to trap itself between two fences. Officials loaded it into an NYPD truck.

The bull is headed to Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue in Wantage, N.J., where workers have already named the animal ""Shankar,"" according to WABC-TV.

This isn’t the first bull run for New Yorkers.

A bull roamed the streets of Queens in February for about two hours before he was captured. The bull died shortly after. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart even saved another runaway bull last year when he transferred it to a safe haven in Watkins Glen.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the Iran deal. Listen to the full interview below:

Sen. Cotton on why he chooses not to spar with President Trump like many other Republicans:

The American people elected Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief and if we want to keep our country safe and secure, then it's important that the commander-in-chief succeed, and I think Donald Trump by and large is getting things right. He's certainly much more consistent with decades of bipartisan foreign policy leadership than Barack Obama was for the last eight years. So when the president does things like tells Congress and tells our allies that the Iran deal is not in the United States national security interests, or launches airstrikes against the Assad regime when they cross the U.S. red line, I'm going to support him.

Sen. Cotton on why he was glad the President did not certify the Iran deal:

Iran now is by all accounts about a year away from getting a nuclear weapon. This deal though starts to expire in a mere eight years, sometimes thirteen years with some of the provisions. I don't think we can wait eight to thirteen years. Iran is going to get stronger, it's economy is going to grow, it's going to get more conventional weapons like tanks and artillery and helicopters, and ultimately it will have a nuclear weapon. That's what we saw with the North Korea nuclear deal in 1994. They detonated their first bomb in 2006. So I don't think that we have the luxury of waiting eight to thirteen years to confront a nuclear Iran. I think we need to confront them now. I understand those people who say that we have so many other challenges it's best to kick this one down the road, I just think the consequences are too grave.",Sen.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

Recently, one sweet young dad went above and beyond to ensure that his partner didn’t feel self-conscious over a breastfeeding stain.

Taking to Facebook on Oct. 12 to share the story, Chris Lopez of Chino, Calif, wrote that she and her partner, Cee Grant, were running errands one morning when Grant surprised her with a funny stain on his button-down dress shirt. Grant’s spot wasn’t accidental, but rather intentional, to show support for the mother of his two children, who is currently nursing their youngest.

“I didn’t know that I was leaking, and I was like, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘Look at your nipple.’ It was a nice way to stop me from being humiliated,” Lopez told Yahoo Lifestyle. “I fell in love with him because he was always that person to turn an awkward moment into a hilarious moment.”

The gesture gave Lopez much more than a laugh. According to Lopez, Grant was recovering from a substance abuse problem back when she was breastfeeding their first child Dominic, who is now three, and his love and support as she breastfeeds little Camilla, almost 11 months old, makes all the difference.

The mom added that she felt “a lot of pain and sadness” through her initial struggles with breastfeeding, and felt guilty when her milk for Dominic dried up. After a successful recovery, Lopez described Grant as “the real deal” in supporting her as she nurses Camilla.

DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?

Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912 and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives.

After helping women and children into lifeboats Daniels swam away from the sinking ship before reaching an upturned lifeboat. He was eventually taken on board the rescue ship Carpathia, according to Encyclopedia Titanica.

Daniels died in 1983 at the age of 89.

The Board of Trustees voted 10-3 on Wednesday to fire Jurich after 20 years as the school’s AD. Jurich, 61, had been placed on paid administrative Sept. 27 by interim university President Greg Postel. Louisville’s Athletic Association fired men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino on Monday.

Jurich shepherded Louisville’s 2014 entry into the Atlantic Coast Conference. He also was responsible for facility upgrades and saw numerous sports thrive under coaches he hired.

Vince Tyra was named acting AD since Oct. 3, a move the Athletic Association approved on Monday before firing Pitino.

Louisville’s acknowledgment of being part of a federal probe into bribery of college recruits proved to be Jurich’s undoing. Postel’s Sept. 27 disciplinary letter to the AD called allegations in the complaint “disturbing and unprecedented.” His letter also called “unacceptable” the level of misconduct, alleged criminal activity and the negative attention it has brought to Louisville.

Postel also criticized Jurich for failing to update or consult the athletic board about his negotiation of the department’s sponsorship extension with Adidas.

Jurich’s lawyer, Alison M. Stemler, disputed Postel’s allegations in a letter that also questioned whether school’s disciplinary action might violate a contract clause.

Several Jurich supporters carrying signs urging trustees to retain the AD gathered outside the Grawemeyer administration building and briefly inside the meeting room. Jurich’s attorney, Alison M. Stemler, and members of Jurich’s legal team joined the meeting shortly after it began.

Trustees ultimately followed the same path as the ULAA, deciding to part ways with Jurich and move forward.

Jurich departs as construction continues on a $63 million expansion of the football stadium due for completion by next season. He had a long record of accomplishments that helped Louisville build one of the nation’s top athletic programs.

Jurich also remained loyal to coaches he hired, to a fault in some cases.

Jurich hired Pitino as coach in 2001 and celebrated Louisville’s third NCCA men’s basketball championship trophy 12 years later in perhaps the school’s most successful year in athletics.

The Cardinals’ women’s basketball team reached the NCAA championship game that same season and has remained a perennial NCAA Tournament contender. Both programs play in a 22,000-seat downtown arena that opened in 2010.

Lamar Jackson became Louisville’s first Heisman Trophy winner last year when the Cardinals flirted with a berth in the college football playoff. The Cardinals in 1998 began playing in Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium, which is undergoing its second expansion from its original 42,000-seat capacity.

The baseball team is coming off its third College World Series berth in five years and is also preparing to expand its stadium.

Jurich was scrutinized for his decision to re-hire football coach Bobby Petrino in January 2014, less than two years after Arkansas fired Petrino for misleading school officials about a motorcycle accident in which his passenger was later revealed to be his mistress.

Jurich’s support of Pitino through a series of embarrassing transgressions in recent years drew the most criticism.",Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich fired amid corruption scandal,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/louisville-athletic-director-tom-jurich-fired-amid-corruption-scandal.html

But it turns out the joke’s on everyone who made one — including me — because it’s been the brand’s best-seller ever since.

Cut us some slack, though. Back then, there weren’t many subcompact crossovers on the road, so it did seem a little odd. But as the segment filled out over the years, it’s become clear that quirky styling is the norm, and no one does quirky like Mini. It really was a perfect fit.

Now there’s an all new one, and guess what. It’s even bigger! (A little.) It’s also much better.

The original had good looks, but economy class accommodations. The 2017 version is built on the same bones as the BMW X1, and the quality shows.

Prices start at $27,450 for a front-wheel-drive Cooper with a 139 hp three-cylinder turbocharged engine and run up to $38,650 for an all-wheel-drive John Cooper Works powered by the X1’s 228 hp four-cylinder turbo. A plug-in hybrid version is also available, but the right one — as with all Minis — is the Cooper S, which costs $32,550 with all-wheel-drive before you start getting frisky with the extensive options sheet.

That price spread puts the Countryman in a crowd that includes the Buick Encore, Mercedes GLA and Audi Q3. It deserves to be among them.

My tester rang up at $35,400 with a six-speed manual transmission and a technology package that includes a head-up display projected onto a small screen that rises from the dashboard. Radar cruise control with automatic emergency braking and an eight-speed automatic are some of the other features on offer.

The interior of the Countryman is classic Mini, with floating round gauges on the steering column, a circular housing for the infotainment system and toggle switches all over the place. Everything feels as good as it looks.

There’s an abundance of room for both passengers and stuff. The cabin easily passes the four 6-foot passenger test, and the cargo area is a very decent size that can be expanded further by flipping up the floor or sliding the rear seats forward … a feature all small crossovers should offer.

Few offer this much driving enjoyment. The Countryman is at once solid, nimble and limber. I wouldn’t take it too far off-road, but the pseudo-SUV is in its element on a twisty, bumpy, paved one. There’s even a computer game built into it that encourages this behavior by giving you points for driving on rough stuff. Meanwhile, its German roots show through as it drills down the highway with the smoothness and stability of a small freight train.

The Countryman may be quirky, but it’s no joke.

The Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive end already gave up his first six game checks to provide two scholarships for students in Charlottesville, Virginia. Now, he’s using the next 10 to launch the Pledge 10 for Tomorrow campaign.

“My wife and I have been passionate about education being a gateway for upward mobility and equality,” Long told The Associated Press. “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help affect change that we all want to see in this country.”

Long signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Eagles, including a $500,000 signing bonus and $1.5 million guaranteed. His base salary in 2017 is $1 million.

The charitable initiative encourages people to make donations to improve equal education opportunities. Long began his career in St. Louis in 2008 and played for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season. Long’s foundation has selected four organizations whose missions focus on making education easily accessible to underserved youth while also providing students the support they need to develop strong social and emotional character.

The four organizations are based in the three communities in which Long has played during his NFL career. The city that raises the most money during the season will receive an additional $50,000 donation.

“There’s a lot of opportunities to help out and they’re wonderful organizations,” Long said. “We have such a great platform as football players and hopefully fans get behind it.”

Long grew up in Charlottesville and starred in high school at St. Anne’s-Belfield before going to the University of Virginia. He was moved to start the scholarship program following the violent protests in Charlottesville in August.

These troubles are not new, and did not begin with President Trump.
John Kelly reminded us what dignity, honor and truthfulness looks like, and how they can illuminate that darkness.","On Thursday, John Kelly reminded the country what dignity looks like. In a hushed White House briefing room, President Trump’s chief of staff recounted that most painful of human experiences, the loss of a child. The former general spoke of the circumstances under which the bodies of fallen soldiers are returned to their families, how their loved ones are told of their heartbreaking loss, what it is like to deliver the most devastating news imaginable.

He solemnly described how Marine General Joseph Dunford had delivered the news that his own son had been killed in Afghanistan. And how he had recently visited Arlington Cemetery to visit the graves of Marines who died under his own watch. He said these things with grace and dignity.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential. Even somber personal tragedies like the death of a soldier can be hijacked by those looking to score political points. The constant back-and-forth of “gotcha” journalism – the kind of story that, in fact, inspired John Kelly’s address to the press corps – drives headlines and delivers “clicks” but also helps create today’s toxic discourse. And yes, it comes from both sides and I do not absolve myself.

It also comes from our leaders. President Trump has been derided endlessly for his lack of decorum, his inability to resist tweet-storming critics and telling whoppers about topics important and unimportant. But President Obama taking selfies at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service or jumping into a golf cart minutes after declaring himself “heartbroken” over ISIS’ savage beheading of James Foley isn’t dignified either.

Nor is Hillary Clinton yelling “At this point what difference does it make?” at the committee investigating the lies told about the deaths in Benghazi.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential.

Don’t even get me started linking Bill, Monica Lewinsky and the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. This piece is supposed to be about dignity.

How do we turn this around? President George W. Bush lamented the “casual cruelty” of today’s public discourse, in a recent speech widely interpreted as a rebuke to President Trump. At the same forum, President Obama piled on, saying “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries.”

It might be helpful if both those gentlemen acknowledged that they bear some responsibility for those widening political fault lines. Donald Trump was not elected by accident; Americans were angry over Obama’s aggressive identity politics and progressive agenda of the past eight years, and by the financial crisis overseen by Bush.

They were angry that their prospects had stagnated for over a decade. For years, America’s workers have been slighted as our leaders pursued global ambitions and forgot to tend the home fires. Bush can bemoan the “fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade” but that value seems slight to an out-of-work steel maker in Pennsylvania. As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently wrote in an oped published in the Wall Street Journal, “China’s tariffs are higher than those of the U.S. in 20 of the 22 major categories of goods. Europe imposes higher tariffs than the U.S. in 17 of 22 categories…” Our leaders have not been paying attention. It would help if Chuck Schumer, Rand Paul and so many others could stop posturing long enough to place the good of their countrymen about political one-upmanship.

There are important issues facing the country, but these folks have no sense of urgency, other than appeasing their funders and scoring political points. The battle over health care is dire for millions of Americans, but rather than work together to fix ObamaCare, which every sane person can acknowledge is deeply flawed, our politicians spend their time making sure they are not blamed for soaring premiums and ever-narrower choices.

These troubles are not new, and did not begin with President Trump. Those of us who follow current events intently do not often look up and survey a wide landscape. When we do, the horizon can appear dark.

John Kelly reminded us what dignity, honor and truthfulness looks like, and how they can illuminate that darkness.

The grant program's application has a section in which individuals have to acknowledge they ""will not boycott Israel during the term of this agreement.""
The law, which took effect Sept. 1, prohibits all state agencies from contracting with, and some public funds from investing in, companies that boycott Israel.
Hauss said the main issue in this case is the state law and the ACLU's belief that the law is ""fundamentally unconstitutional.""
Earlier this month, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit in Kansas on behalf of a teacher challenging that state's boycott law.","A civil rights group on Friday called unconstitutional a Houston suburb's hurricane repair grant program that says residents cannot boycott Israel as a condition of receiving any money.



The American Civil Liberties Union said it's considering legal action against the city of Dickinson over its Hurricane Harvey repair grant program, which will provide money to people whose homes and businesses in the city were damaged.



The grant program's application has a section in which individuals have to acknowledge they ""will not boycott Israel during the term of this agreement.""



""The Supreme Court has made very clear that participation in political boycotts is fully protected by the First Amendment,"" said ACLU staff attorney Brian Hauss.



The boycott language was included to comply with a new state law prohibiting Texas agencies from contracting with companies boycotting Israel, said David Olson, the city attorney in Dickinson, located about 30 miles southeast of Houston.

The law, which took effect Sept. 1, prohibits all state agencies from contracting with, and some public funds from investing in, companies that boycott Israel.



Olson said it's unclear if the new law applies to the city's grant program, funded by more than $1 million in private donations for victims. The confusion exists because once the city took control of the money, it became public funds and Dickinson had to create a grant program to distribute them, he said. The city classifies individuals receiving the grants as independent contractors.



""We're just trying to do what's right, comply with state law and make sure the residents get every benefit that we can lawfully give them,"" Olson said.



Dickinson was one of the areas hardest hit by Harvey's torrential rainfall in late August. More than 7,300 homes in the city were damaged, displacing about 7,900 residents.



Dickinson is waiting to hear back from state officials on whether the law applies to the city's grant program and if it doesn't, ""then there's no reason for us to have it in the agreement,"" Olson said.

It is hard to imagine that our national descent into political contempt could get any worse than it did this week, when Congresswoman Frederica Wilson accused President Trump of disrespecting the pregnant widow of a fallen soldier during a condolence call, telling her that her husband “knew what he signed up for.”

It should have been obvious to all Trump probably flubbed what was intended as a compliment, praising his courage for volunteering to serve in a vocation he knew could cost him his life.

When I was a speechwriter for President Bush, he often praised our troops for volunteering for military service “knowing all the risks and dangers that come with wearing our nation’s uniform.”

We should have all assumed that Trump was trying to do the same thing, and that it just didn’t come out right.

Now, we know that is the case, as Gen. John Kelly — himself a Gold Star father — confirmed it in a moving statement in the White House press briefing room Thursday.

We have now arrived at the day where the president’s efforts to console grieving families who lost loved ones in a time of war is considered fair game for political attacks.

You can see Gen. Kelly’s remarks at the top of this column. They are worth watching in full.

Trump was under no obligation to make that call. General Kelly advised him not to. But the president wanted to do it anyway. And with unexpected humility, knowing he had never worn the uniform, he asked a close adviser who had worn the uniform what he should say — and then tried to say it. His motive was to praise a hero and comfort a grieving family.

That this congresswoman (who boycotted Trump’s inauguration and has called for his impeachment) would publicize and politicize what the president said in private to this Gold Star family is reprehensible. It marked a new low — one that was exceeded only by her response to Gen. Kelly’s comments declaring that she was now a “rock star” because she was being talked about from the White House podium. If that did not make her motives clear, I don’t know what would.

Also shameful was the media feeding frenzy, with reporters unquestioningly reporting her comments and then calling other Gold Star families to see if Trump had insulted them as well.

And then there was the reaction of the “The Resistance” which was epitomized by former Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon’s tweet: “Kelly isnt just an enabler of Trump. He’s a believer in him. That makes him as odious as the rest. Don’t be distracted by the uniform.”

Kelly is a decorated veteran who lost a son in service to our country. But don’t be distracted by all that. Trump hate is simply blinding to some.

This is not to suggest that Trump is blameless in this affair. The charge that he had insulted a Gold Star family would not have been believable if he had not previously insulted a Gold Star family during the 2016 campaign (a moment that Gen. Kelly referred to in his statement Thursday) or declared that John McCain was not a hero because he had been captured [while serving our country in Vietnam].

He should not have publicly questioned how his predecessors expressed their condolences to grieving families (though, again, he was inarticulately repeating what Gen. Kelly had told him — that President Obama did not call him when his son was killed in action). And rather than returning fire at Rep. Wilson on Twitter, Trump should have taken the high road and simply said, “I was trying to praise his courage, and I blew it.” He seems congenitally incapable of admitting a mistake.

There are no heroes in this entire episode, except the ones who seem to have been forgotten in the political melee: the four brave Americans who gave their lives on the battlefield.

Many have been mourning the fact that political contempt has infected every aspect of our lives, including sports. But we have now arrived at the day where the president’s efforts to console grieving families who lost loved ones in a time of war is considered fair game for political attacks.

How much hate must someone have in their heart to presume that the president would pick up the phone to call a grieving widow and intentionally insult the memory of her lost loved one?

LUPITA NYONG’O DETAILS HARASSMENT FROM HARVEY WEINSTEIN: ‘I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING AT FIRST’

The “12 Years a Slave” star detailed her experience with Weinstein in a lengthy op-ed to The New York Times that was published Thursday.

Nyong’o wrote Weinstein invited her to his Connecticut home in 2011 while she was a student at the Yale School of Drama.

After having lunch with him and meeting his young children, they entered his private screening room with a large group. Eventually, he asked her to go to a bedroom with him and propositioned her for a massage.

""I thought he was joking at first. He was not,"" the actress wrote.

Nyong’o said she gave him a massage instead but when he tried to remove his pants, she insisted she leave.

She described several other encounters with him over the years, including some propositions.

It was not until she became an Oscar winner in 2014 for her role in “12 Years a Slave” that Weinstein apologized for his behavior and agreed to show her the respect she deserves.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN EXPELLED FROM MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY

She said she later declined an offer to appear in one of his movies.

Nyong’o was the latest A-list star to speak out against the disgraced movie mogul. Recently, The New York Times and The New Yorker Magazine released exposes detailing Weinstein’s sexual misconduct spanning over decades.

Weinstein was fired from the company he founded with his brother Bob, the Weinstein Company and was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences last week.

Vega was one of the 14 residents who died when the facility’s central air conditioning failed during the hurricane. She was living on the second floor of the nursing home, which did not have air conditioning for three days, the news outlet reported. Hollywood police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into the deaths, but Fernandez wonders if Medicaid has also been billed for Vega’s care, or if the other victims have received similar bills.

The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration would not comment on the incident, but said the facility was suspended from the Medicaid program in September, according to The Sun Sentinel.

Fernandez said she filed a complaint with the bank manager, while a spokeswoman for the nursing home said the billing was part of an automated system that was beyond the facility’s control.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

RELATED: Budget-Friendly Bathroom Sets for Guests

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms.

But in comparison to those fleeing other deeply oppressive or war-torn countries, defectors from North Korea remain relatively quiet.","Escaping North Korea is a journey that is almost always a perilous one — thousands of miles on buses or motorcycles or sneaking on foot through mountains and valleys amid falling snow or torrential rain — in the desperate quest to evade border police and reach the frontier of a new life. Some pay a broker to traffic them out, some are too poor and bear the burden alone, and some are granted temporary visas to work in China but never return to their native land.

So how many North Korea defectors are there, and where do they go?

Since the hostilities of the Korean War ended in 1953, an estimated 300,000 North Koreans have defected from the tightly controlled hermit country. According to statistics from the Human Freedom Initiative at the Bush Institute, there is approximately 225 North Korean refugees that have been directly granted asylum in the United States since the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. This was signed into law under President George W. Bush in an effort to promote freedom and human rights to those fleeing the dictatorship.

A further 250 North Koreans have arrived since as legal immigrants, after spending time in South Korea and receiving citizenship there. There are believed to be several hundred — although less than 1,000 — illegal North Korean immigrants also residing across the United States.

The European Alliance for Human Rights in North Korea surmises that there are at least 1,400 in Europe, with the highest number — some 600 — reportedly in South West London. However, most defectors stay much closer to home.

“Most defectors head to China, but if they are caught there, they will likely be returned to North Korea, where they are punished harshly. Therefore, many either live their lives under the radar or make the harrowing trip to South Korea. There, North Korean defectors are welcomed by the government,” Vernon Brewer, founder and president of World Help, a Christian humanitarian organization that supports the defectors, told Fox News. “South Korea longs for reunification and sees the suffering North Koreans as their neighbors.”

South Korean law grants those from the North automatic citizenship following a mandatory three-month transition that involves debriefing and education to prepare them for their new lives in a much more open society. Official statistics published by the Ministry of Unification have documented just over 30,000 defectors since 1998. That year, at the height of the starvation and famine that claimed over one million lives in the North, the government registered 302 males and 116 females — a total of 947 North Korean defectors.

By 2008, the number of males had dropped slightly to 608 while the number of females had jumped dramatically to 2,195, bringing the overall to 2,803 and 78 percent female. These numbers have declined in subsequent years as a result of stricter border patrols and inspections having been put in place by the Kim Jung-un regime, along with rising broker costs.

Last year, South Korea documented 302 male and 1,116 female defectors — 1,418 in total, and 79 percent female. So far in 2017, the ministry has recorded 593 defectors — 85 percent of who are female. Overall, just under one quarter of the total defector numbers are minors: 8,839 of the total to-date are male, and 21,541 are female.

China, which also borders North Korea, is host to the majority of defectors. Although official statistics are hard to come by and many are deported back to their origin if discovered, an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 refugees from the country are believed to have crossed into China illegally — more than 70 percent of which are female.

The rise in female defectors to both South Korea and China, experts have conjectured, is likely because of the notion that it is easier for women to flee undetected and face less scrutiny from authorities than their male counterparts. However, women are routinely subjected to gross human rights violations such as sex trafficking and forced into prostitution for survival, and without proper documentation, have little resources to turn to.

WHAT DOES BUSH THINK ABOUT TRUMP'S HANDLING OF NORTH KOREA?

Defectors also flee using obscure routes to other Asian countries in the region — including Mongolia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and Laos — but these are often used as transit points before moving to a third country such as South Korea.

But in comparison to those fleeing other deeply oppressive or war-torn countries, defectors from North Korea remain relatively quiet.

“The regime punishes the families of anyone who defects at the time of their defection,” explained Todd Nettleton, Chief of Media Relations and Message Integration for the Voice of the Martyrs USA, an NGO that aids refugees and defectors. “If they were to comment publicly and further embarrass the regime, they know their families would be punished further, possibly even executed or sent to a labor camp.”

Punishment often extends for up to three generations after the defection.

“We have the type of defectors that believe they must speak out so their fellow nationals can know life is better and free on the other side. Then, there are those that don’t want to be heard for fear of their family’s safety,” Brewer said. “The latter tend to be defectors who have seen firsthand more government surveillance and punishment or who have been outside North Korea for a number of years.”

Yet some analysts predict that deserter numbers are set to rise and then fall in the coming months.

“As economic conditions worsen due to tough economic sanctions imposed over the summer, there will likely be a surge of defectors — followed then by a steep decline as Pyongyang cracks down hard to limit information outflows to the outside world,” noted Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest. “Defectors have told me on many occasions that new smuggling routes out of the country will open up, however in just a few months, are shutdown thanks to informants. It is a constant game of cat and mouse.”

President Donald Trump’s new travel ban proclamation, which came into play on Thursday, included North Korea for the first time.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he wants his Senate to give him direct power to dissolve the regional Catalan government and to call an early election as soon as possible. The Senate is likely to approve Rajoy's request.

Rajoy’s Cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution.

Rajoy proposed the powers of Catalan officials be taken over by central government ministers.

The meeting came almost three weeks after a controversial referendum seeking the region’s independence which was ruled illegal by the country’s Supreme Court.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has argued the referendum result gave him the mandate to move forward with independence.

What is Catalonia?

Located in the northeast region of Spain, Catalonia is largely independent with its own culture and language. It’s one of the richest and most industrialized areas of the country with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, according to the BBC.

The region, which includes Barcelona, is home to about 7.5 million people.

Valuing its autonomy, Catalonia has its own parliament and executive, called “Generalitat” in its language.

""What's being contested between Spain and Catalonia ... is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.""

Why do they want independence?

Because of its own cultural identity, those in favor of Catalan independence have pushed for the region to become separate from Spain. Supporters also believe that they have given more to the Spanish government than they have gotten back.

The push for independence “raises questions of the future of democracy and democratic rule,” Pamela Radcliff, a University of California, San Diego professor and modern Spain historian, told Fox News. “What’s being contested between Spain and Catalonia, one of the things is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.”

TOP EU OFFICIALS RALLY BEHIND SPANISH PM OVER CATALAN POLL

The push for independence is led by Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1.

How did the vote go?

About 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who cast votes chose independence, Catalan officials said of the disputed referendum. However, fewer than half of eligible voters participated.

About 900 people were treated for injuries after voting turned violent when Catalan civilians and Spanish police clashed earlier this month.

Andrew Dowling, an expert in Catalan history at Cardiff University in Wales, said that any independence declaration by the Catalan parliament would be symbolic without border and institutional control and no international support.

Such a declaration ""will see the fracture between hardliners and the pragmatic people in Catalonia who are already seeing an economic fallout,"" Dowling told The Associated Press.

What has been Spain’s response?

Spain's top court declared the independence referendum illegal.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria accused Puigdemont of putting the Catalan people “in the greatest level of uncertainty seen yet.”

And Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the referendum was part of a strategy “to impose independence that few want and is good for nobody.”

CATALONIA VOTERS PROTEST AGAINST VIOLENT POLICE TACTICS AFTER INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Rajoy has reportedly refused help from outside civil-society groups and lawyers to mediate negotiations between the two factions. He has also declined to engage in talks with Catalan leaders.

“There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience and unlawfulness,” Rajoy said.

Spain had given Puigdemont two deadlines – which have come and gone – on whether the independence referendum is serious.

Radcliff said that “it’s very possible” that neither side has “much incentive to compromise.”

What is Article 155?

Spain has threatened to invoke a clause of its constitution should Catalonia forge ahead with its plans to secede from the country that would take away the region’s autonomy.

A refusal to backtrack from its independence threats would trigger Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the government has said, which would allow central authorities to take over control of any of the country’s 17 regions. It’s a provision that hasn’t been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in the European nation.

An English translation of the constitution states that should an autonomous community break the law or disregard the constitution, the Spanish government can – after following certain procedures – “take the measures necessary in order to compel the [community] forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect [Spain’s] general interests.”

Rajoy's cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155.

On Friday night, mourners gathered at the church for a public viewing, the Miami Herald reported.

According to the newspaper, the evening was focused solely on Johnson, a 25-year-old father of two children, with a third on the way, who was remembered as “a G.I. Joe,” “a leader,” and “a lovable, humble, peaceful person.”

There was no mention, the Herald reported, of this week’s verbal feud between U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., and President Donald Trump, which was sparked when Wilson commented on remarks that Trump reportedly made during a condolence phone call to Johnson’s widow, Myeshia Johnson.

The Herald reported Friday that after Johnson’s death, Wilson established a college scholarship fund for his children – Ah’leeysa, 6; La David Jr., 2; and a daughter expected in January. The GoFundMe account had raised more than $627,000 in donations as of early Saturday.

Three other soldiers were killed in the Niger attack:

-- Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, whose funeral was held Sunday in his hometown, Lyons, Ga.

-- Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash., whose funeral was held Wednesday in Fayetteville, N.C. Black will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Oct. 30, WTVD-TV in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., reported.

-- Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio, whose funeral was held Thursday in Fayetteville, N.C.

A memorial service for all four soldiers is scheduled for Nov. 7 at Fort Bragg, N.C., the Springfield (Ohio) News-Sun reported.

The four Green Berets were among a group of American and Nigerien troops ambushed by about 50 Islamic extremists. Two other soldiers were injured in the attack, and nearly 10 Nigerien troops were also killed.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said that his department is investigating the circumstances that led to the attack.

American and French troops have been providing training and support to the militaries of Niger and other vulnerable African countries where Islamic extremism has grown.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates.
Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart.
Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

By Anna Eliopoulos

A New York family discouraged, after getting a letter from their insurer, that their nine-month-old's cancer treatment is denied.

Connor Richardson is the newborn of a retired NYPD officer, Wayne. He tells Fox News Radio, that up until two months ago, he was a smiling normal baby.

But then he was rushed to a Long Island hospital after exhibiting symptoms that Richardson says weren't normal for his son... and that's when they found out about the cancer

""He was in the operating room. They had to relieve the fluid,"" Richardson says."" The tumor in his brain was preventing the fluid from circulating to his spine.""

A cat scan and MRI confirmed that an aggressive and rare form of cancer was affecting Connor.

""They made an attempt to remove the tumor the first time and they got approximately 85% of it, bleeding started by the pituitary gland, and they had to wait approximately a week to go back in, and the doctor believes he got it all.""

However, doctors at Saint Jude's Childrens Hospital in Memphis, who had accepted him for chemo, said that they noticed that the cancerous cells had come back.

Connor continues to remain in their care, and to receive treatment.

Richardson says though that on October 11, he didn't expect to get a letter from his insurance provider that coverage for his son's treatment was denied.

""They're not covering because one of the chemo treatments is clinical,"" he says.

The experimental trial that their son was undergoing, with a mix of medications was considered by the letter ""investigational"" with no evidence of being effective.

""It's like a form letter, and the bold faced part is the part they fill on their own, and it wasn't medically necessary.""

Saint Jude's provides free care to patients. So while no one is really footing the bill for treatment, Richardson says it's the principal that bothers him.

""I believe Saint Jude's should get paid for this. It's going to come out to millions of dollars I'm sure.""

And Richardson adds that money is crucial to finding out how to treat and prevent cancer and other life-threatening diseases in children.

""It's taking literally millions of dollars away from their research development.""

Richardson says he plans on contesting the denial.

""You have insurance but you don't really. It's really for disasters and this is a disaster and they're not willing to cover it.""

According to Richardson, Connor is responding well to treatment.",Insurer Allegedly Sends Coverage Denial Letter to 9-month-old with Brain Cancer,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/insurer-allegedly-sends-coverage-denial-letter-to-9-month-old-with-brain-cancer/

Other changes planned for November include emailing account owners when they are suspended for abuse violations.

John Kelly reminded us what dignity, honor and truthfulness looks like, and how they can illuminate that darkness.","On Thursday, John Kelly reminded the country what dignity looks like. In a hushed White House briefing room, President Trump’s chief of staff recounted that most painful of human experiences, the loss of a child. The former general spoke of the circumstances under which the bodies of fallen soldiers are returned to their families, how their loved ones are told of their heartbreaking loss, what it is like to deliver the most devastating news imaginable.

He solemnly described how Marine General Joseph Dunford had delivered the news that his own son had been killed in Afghanistan. And how he had recently visited Arlington Cemetery to visit the graves of Marines who died under his own watch. He said these things with grace and dignity.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential. Even somber personal tragedies like the death of a soldier can be hijacked by those looking to score political points. The constant back-and-forth of “gotcha” journalism – the kind of story that, in fact, inspired John Kelly’s address to the press corps – drives headlines and delivers “clicks” but also helps create today’s toxic discourse. And yes, it comes from both sides and I do not absolve myself.

It also comes from our leaders. President Trump has been derided endlessly for his lack of decorum, his inability to resist tweet-storming critics and telling whoppers about topics important and unimportant. But President Obama taking selfies at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service or jumping into a golf cart minutes after declaring himself “heartbroken” over ISIS’ savage beheading of James Foley isn’t dignified either.

Nor is Hillary Clinton yelling “At this point what difference does it make?” at the committee investigating the lies told about the deaths in Benghazi.

It was impossible to watch the retired four-star general without feeling at once inspired but also discouraged that so much of what consumes the public these days is petty and inconsequential.

Don’t even get me started linking Bill, Monica Lewinsky and the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. This piece is supposed to be about dignity.

How do we turn this around? President George W. Bush lamented the “casual cruelty” of today’s public discourse, in a recent speech widely interpreted as a rebuke to President Trump. At the same forum, President Obama piled on, saying “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries.”

It might be helpful if both those gentlemen acknowledged that they bear some responsibility for those widening political fault lines. Donald Trump was not elected by accident; Americans were angry over Obama’s aggressive identity politics and progressive agenda of the past eight years, and by the financial crisis overseen by Bush.

They were angry that their prospects had stagnated for over a decade. For years, America’s workers have been slighted as our leaders pursued global ambitions and forgot to tend the home fires. Bush can bemoan the “fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade” but that value seems slight to an out-of-work steel maker in Pennsylvania. As Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently wrote in an oped published in the Wall Street Journal, “China’s tariffs are higher than those of the U.S. in 20 of the 22 major categories of goods. Europe imposes higher tariffs than the U.S. in 17 of 22 categories…” Our leaders have not been paying attention. It would help if Chuck Schumer, Rand Paul and so many others could stop posturing long enough to place the good of their countrymen about political one-upmanship.

There are important issues facing the country, but these folks have no sense of urgency, other than appeasing their funders and scoring political points. The battle over health care is dire for millions of Americans, but rather than work together to fix ObamaCare, which every sane person can acknowledge is deeply flawed, our politicians spend their time making sure they are not blamed for soaring premiums and ever-narrower choices.

These troubles are not new, and did not begin with President Trump. Those of us who follow current events intently do not often look up and survey a wide landscape. When we do, the horizon can appear dark.

No such thing as a coincidence. Doesn’t exist.

Yet, we are led to believe it was merely a coincidence that Bill Clinton just happened to be on the tarmac of an Arizona airport at the same time as then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. We are supposed to accept that their private meeting on board Lynch’s plane had nothing whatsoever to do with the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton which the A-G was overseeing at the time.

Right. They just “schmoozed” about grandkids and what-not.

I guess it was also just a coincidence that a few days after the furtive tarmac meeting the decision was announced that criminal charges against Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, would not be filed, notwithstanding compelling evidence that she repeatedly violated the Espionage Act by storing highly classified documents on her private, unauthorized and unsecured email server in the basement of her home.

Sure. Makes perfect sense. To a naïve, gullible fool.

Maybe it was purely a coincidence that there was another FBI investigation going on involving Russia’s corruption-fueled purchase of U.S uranium assets and which also happened to implicate the Clintons, but was kept hidden from Congress and the American people by Lynch and her predecessor, Eric Holder. Hmm…

And perhaps it was simply an odd coincidence that the investigation of this uranium bribery, extortion, money laundering and kickback case was supervised by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, his successor James Comey, and then-U.S Attorney Rod Rosenstein, all of whom appear to have covered it up but are now directly involved in the Trump-Russia probe.

Strange confluence of people and events, eh?

I don’t buy any of it. Not for one minute. And not entirely because I don’t believe in coincidences. It is because all the above-mentioned people are known to trifle with the law or ignore disqualifying conflicts of interest. They seem to be without principles --devoid of the kind of scruples that should guide people in service of our government.

Mueller is serving as special counsel in the Trump-Russia case. He reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who appointed him.

Yet both Rosenstein and fired FBI Director James Comey are witnesses in the case, since Rosenstein recommended to President Trump that Comey be fired.

It is well established that Comey and Mueller are long-time friends, allies and former partners. How can Mueller be fair and impartial given these glaring conflicts of interest? He cannot. And he should recuse himself. Rosenstein should also step aside in overseeing the case. He cannot be prosecutor and witness simultaneously.

Their conflicts are compounded by recent reports that all three men were involved in the Russian uranium case which was kept hidden from Congress. How can Americans have confidence in the outcome of the Trump-Russia case if they engaged in a cover-up of the Clinton-Russia case?

Which brings us to Hillary and Bill. The Clinton name is synonymous with scandal. The sleazy Whitewater land deals, an illicit affair with a young White House intern that led to impeachment, deceptions following the Benghazi murders, Travelgate, cattle futures, suspected slush funds, evidence of perjury, the list is seemingly endless.

Through it all, the ability of the Clintons to evade indictments would make Houdini proud. They are escape artists of the highest order.

Loretta Lynch should never have presided over the Hillary Clinton email case. She owed her career to none other than Bill Clinton who nominated her to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York which nicely positioned her for elevation to Attorney General a few years later.

She should have recused herself from the Hillary probe from the outset, but did not. Only when the ethically-challenged tarmac meeting took place did she step aside. Belatedly. Supposedly. I have my doubts.

On Friday, Lynch met behind closed doors with the House Intelligence Committee. Too bad the public was deprived of witnessing an attempt to elicit the truth. But secrecy is endemic in Washington, which is precisely why it is so easy to obscure the truth when power corrupts.

Lynch was likely asked to explain the full content of the infamous tarmac conversation with Bill Clinton that lasted approximately 30 minutes. Did Clinton remind Lynch of how much she owed him? Are we to believe that he never broached the potential indictment of his wife with the very person who could decide her fate?

It is likely Lynch was asked by the Intel Committee if she ever directed Comey to mischaracterize the Clinton email case as a “matter” instead of what it truly was, a criminal investigation. Was Lynch downplaying the case because she planned to scuttle any criminal charges? Did she assure anyone in the Clinton orbit that prosecution would never happen, incriminating evidence be damned?

Finally, why did Lynch allow Comey to usurp the power of the Attorney General in announcing that no criminal charges would be forthcoming against Clinton? It was bad enough that Comey misinterpreted the law on “intent” and “gross negligence,” but Lynch appears to have allowed her office to acquiesce in Comey’s decision. Why?

Since Friday’s hearing was secretive, we may never learn the answers to serious questions that appear to involve lawlessness and rampant corruption.

As the son of a minister, I grew up attending church three to four times a week learning traditional, Christian values. My parents ingrained in me that an individual’s highest call is to serve God, family and country—in that order. They never insulated me from culture, but always warned me to stay leery of the messages I might hear. Fortunately, at age 23, I would still rather listen to one of my father’s lectures than a Jimmy Kimmel monologue any day. But most don’t have that luxury.

If cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility.

As marriage rates decline, millennials hobble around from relationship to relationship (or worse: hookup to hookup) desperately trying to find purpose. Still, popular culture continues to sing the same tired tune. While my friends are hurting, all Hollywood’s doctrines have to offer are regurgitated lines about “find your own truth” and “discover the god-within.” It isn’t working.

My point isn’t to join the chorus of culture critics bemoaning the “me generation.” To the contrary, if cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility. If the traditional values of faith and family were given a fair opportunity to compete in the free market of ideas, they wouldn’t be so easily dismissed as relics of the past. In fact, research already seems to vindicate them.

In a review of mental health studies, The Center for Research on Religion and Urban Civil Society found a positive link between religious involvement and greater “happiness, life satisfaction, and morale.” They also found that regular religious practice is associated with individuals having greater hope and a greater sense of purpose in life. There are even links between religious activity and reduced incidences of domestic abuse, crime, substance abuse, and addiction. While correlation doesn’t necessarily prove causation, there seems to at least be a strong connection between faith and emotional health – just as there exists a compelling link between family life and economic stability.

In “The Millennial Success Sequence” recently published by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies, researchers Wendy Wang and W. Bradford Wilcox find that “97% of Millennials who follow what has been called the ‘success sequence’—that is, who get at least a high school degree, work, and then marry before having any children, in that order—are not poor by the time they reach their prime young adult years (ages 28-34).” Their research shows that eight in ten millennials (86 percent) who have followed the sequence are in the middle or top third of the income distribution by ages 28 to 34—while only 29 percent of young adults who missed all three steps are in the middle or upper income groups.

The researchers conclude that millennials are more likely to follow the success sequence if they “have been exposed by family, friends, or members of their social network to norms, aspirations, and expectations that are conducive to education, work, and marriage.” It seems as though one of the greatest hindrances to economic success is culture. Citizens bound to institutions of faith and family seem to be better off emotionally and financially than their peers who subscribe to the teachings of secularism.

My parents gave me the greatest gift a child can receive in an era of uncertainty. They gave me a foundation. In a culture where everything is relative to the individual and lines are blurred, Hollywood leaves my friends navigating through the wilderness of life with nothing more than the broken compass of their own impulses.",Hollywood’s gospel of ‘do what feels right’ is not serving millennials well,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/19/hollywood-s-gospel-do-what-feels-right-is-not-serving-millennials-well.html

Lynch is one of several former Obama officials who have been called to Congress for closed-door questioning over the Russia accusations.

But sources close to the investigation told Fox News that questions over her infamous tarmac meeting with President Bill Clinton also may have been on the agenda. That June 27, 2016 meeting with Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix raised questions about whether Lynch – or the Justice Department – could be impartial in the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Days after the tarmac meeting, then-FBI director James Comey called Hillary Clinton’s actions “extremely careless” but did not seek criminal charges.

Lynch ignored three questions from Fox News’ Catherine Herridge Friday morning on Capitol Hill, in reference to those issues.

The first was whether Lynch instructed Comey to call the Clinton email probe a “matter” versus an “investigation,” as he claims. Lynch also ignored questions on whether she sought permission from anyone in the White House before the tarmac meeting, and whether she could address any of the issues raised by Comey during his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year.

In his closely watched Senate testimony that otherwise was devoted to discussing the circumstances of his firing by President Trump, Comey said the tarmac meeting was a ""deciding factor"" in his decision to act alone to update the public on the Clinton probe.

""Her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me, and I then said, you know what, the department cannot, by itself, credibly end this,” Comey told the committee.

""There were other things, significant items,"" Comey added, citing how ""the attorney general directed me not to call it an investigation and call it a matter—which confused me.""

The tarmac meeting has become a subject of scrutiny once again, as conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch confirmed the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the meeting.

The meeting also was referenced in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week, when Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions if there was a phone call between Lynch and the White House on whether Lynch should have taken the meeting with former President Clinton.

Sessions responded to Graham by saying any inquiries on the matter should be made to the deputy attorney general.

Friday’s closed-door appearance also was a potential venue for questions on “unmasking.”

Samantha Power, Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations, recently told the House Intelligence Committee that other people made a rash of so-called unmasking requests in her name.

“Her testimony is they may be under my name, but I did not make those requests,” Rep. Trey Gowdy, a member of that committee, said of Power during an interview with Fox News on ""Special Report with Bret Baier.""

Power is among the Obama administration figures who made requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting, known as unmasking.

Last month, Fox News reported that Power was unmasking at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 – and even sought information in the days leading up to Trump’s inauguration.

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

Concerned at the leakage of unmasked names, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has been delving into what happened, and how to prevent abuses.
In May, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the unmasking requests of three former senior Obama administration officials: Power, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and CIA Director John Brennan.
Rhodes has not yet testified to the House Intelligence Committee, but it is considered likely he will have that opportunity.
But if service in the Obama administration is a qualifying credential, the firm has a pool of former Obama administration legal talent on tap, including at least three other former associate counsels to Obama.","Congressional testimony by President Barack Obama’s former ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, about the “unmasking” of U.S. citizens’ names she requested in hundreds of foreign intelligence intercepts by the National Security Agency, has raised new questions about how the sensitive information was ordered up, and subsequently handled.

Power spoke to the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 13 behind closed doors, and what she said is still cloaked in secrecy. But on Oct. 17, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, told Fox News: “Her testimony is they [the unmasking requests] may be under my name, but I did not make those requests.” Gowdy said little else about the session.

The sheer volume of such requests submitted to U.S. intelligence authorities in her name was already unusual. But if she did not initiate them, then who did, and why? Was the resulting information delivered to Power, as the normal protocols of handling such constitutionally-protected information require? Was she even aware of the gush of highly sensitive and secret information solicited under her name?

So far, Power has not responded to queries on those issues, which were emailed by Fox News to her Harvard University office on Oct. 19.

According to former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, a Fox News contributor, if someone submitted unmasking requests in Power’s name without her knowledge or consent, it would be “potentially criminal.”

“Unmasking” involves asking U.S. intelligence authorities to fill in the redacted names of U.S. citizens whose comments are caught up in the NSA’s foreign intelligence intercepts, which are routinely removed to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. Such revelations are supposed to be relatively rare, clearly justified and tightly controlled.

The issue flared, however, after the unmasked name of the Trump administration’s disgraced former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, was leaked in connection with conversations with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak.

Concerned at the leakage of unmasked names, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has been delving into what happened, and how to prevent abuses.

In May, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the unmasking requests of three former senior Obama administration officials: Power, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and CIA Director John Brennan. Power agreed in July to appear before the House committee; Rice spoke to the committee in closed-door session on Sept. 6.

Power’s role in the unmasking affair was highlighted by Nunes in a July 27 letter to Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats. In the letter, the House committee chairman cited an unnamed Obama Administration official for the high volume of their unmasking requests, noting that this official’s position had “no apparent intelligence-related function.” The official was widely believed to be Power, something she never denied.

In August, Nunes wrote to the head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, asking for the total number of unmasking requests made by former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, during the 13 months prior to President Trump’s inauguration.

With the exception of career-CIA officer Brennan, the other persons are a group of politically-appointed Obama loyalists, all serving at various times during his administration on the National Security Council.

Rhodes was on the NSC as a deputy national security advisor throughout Obama’s two terms, from 2009-2017. He was profiled in the New York Times Magazine last year as Obama’s foreign-policy guru, especially on Iran. He told the Times, “I don’t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.”

Rice served during Obama’s first term, from 2009-2013, as his ambassador to the U.N., a post Obama designated as cabinet level. During Obama’s second term, Rice served as head of the NSC, with Rhodes as one of her deputies.

Power, a former journalist, served during Obama’s first term on the NSC, designing and running a body called the Atrocities Prevention Board. She kept a seat on the NSC during Obama’s second term, while also replacing Rice from 2013-2017 as U.N. ambassador.

Interestingly enough, for purposes of congressional inquiries into the unmasking issue, all three of the politically appointed former Obama administration officials — Power, Rhodes and Rice — have something else in common: lawyers who served alongside them in the Obama White House, adding another layer of insider complexity to the issue.

In July, for a meeting with investigators from the Senate Intelligence Committee, Power was represented by David Pressman, a former Obama administration official, who was described in news accounts at the time simply as her attorney. At the time, Pressman declared, among other things, that “any insinuation that Ambassador Power was involved in leaking classified information is absolutely false.”

As reported by Fox News on Sept. 12, Pressman’s ties to Power were closer and rather more extensive than simply legal representation. He had worked intensively with Power during most of the interval under scrutiny in the unmasking probe.

Until last November, Pressman was one of Power’s closest associates at the U.S. mission to the U.N., sharing an office suite with Power and serving for two years, from 2014-2016, as her alternate, with the rank of ambassador, on the U.N. Security Council. In that position, he had access to daily intelligence briefings, and dealt with such sensitive issues as the Middle East and Russian aggression in Ukraine.

When Pressman resigned from the administration the week before the election, to go into private practice, Power praised him as having been her “partner.”

It was a partnership that arrived at the U.S. mission by way of the White House, where Pressman and Power (and Ben Rhodes) overlapped on the National Security Council, during Obama’s first term. In 2011, Pressman and Power coauthored an article for the White House blog about Obama’s creation under the NSC of the Atrocities Prevention Board, which Power chaired, and on which Pressman also had a seat.

The personal connections dated back even earlier. Power, in the acknowledgments to her 2008 book “Chasing the Flame,” praised Rhodes for his daily support and listed Pressman among her “close friends.”

As Fox News noted, congressional investigators might usefully have tapped Pressman for insights into the inner workings of the U.S. mission during the period of the many unmaskings under Power’s name, had Pressman not been acting as Power’s attorney.

Now, however, Pressman has apparently stepped aside, at least for the time being, from that role. A spokesperson for Pressman’s law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, told Fox that “Boies Schiller Flexner LLP continues to represent Ambassador Power,” but added: “David Pressman was one of the lawyers that represented the Ambassador for her Senate appearance; other lawyers at the firm are representing the Ambassador for the purpose of her House appearance.”

Boies Schiller Flexner did not respond to queries about the identities of the “other lawyers” who are now representing Power. But when Power appeared before the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 13, the lawyer representing her was Michael Gottlieb, from Boies Schiller’s Washington office.

Gottlieb has also been acting as an attorney for Ben Rhodes, whom he represented for an appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee in July. Rhodes has not yet testified to the House Intelligence Committee, but it is considered likely he will have that opportunity.

As it happens, Gottlieb is another veteran of the Obama White House, where he served during Obama’s first term as an associate counsel, leaving in 2013.

No additional information has surfaced on who at Boies Schiller might also be representing Power. But if service in the Obama administration is a qualifying credential, the firm has a pool of former Obama administration legal talent on tap, including at least three other former associate counsels to Obama.

Susan Rice has been represented, via a different law firm, by another former star of the Obama administration’s legal firmament, former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler. Now a partner at Latham & Watkins LLP, Ruemmler is described on the firm’s web site as having been “President Obama’s chief lawyer” and “one of his most senior advisers.” She worked for almost six years in the Obama administration. First, she worked at the Department of Justice and then from 2011-2014 she worked at the White House, attending high-level conclaves along with officials such as Power and Rice.

When Ruemmler left the administration in 2014, the New York Times profiled her as someone who had “held powerful sway” at the Obama White House. Among other things, the Times reported that Ruemmler “took a hard line in internal debates about keeping executive branch documents secret” — a line that “contributed to Mr. Obama’s transition from promising greater transparency to being criticized even by his own allies for excessive secrecy.”

Much of the home, however, has been reduced to ashes and debris in the wake of the Atlas Fires that have already claimed 5,700 structures, according to SF Gate.

As seen in footage shared by Bay Area reporter Jodi Hernandez, firefighters worked to save the “Glass House” of Solano County before the fires could reach it, but now it barely resembles the structure it once was.

SF Gate further reports that the house itself was first built in 2003 by John Roscoe, a “tobacco packaging entrepreneur” who spent around $17 million to build the house and purchase the surrounding property. He later became involved in a lawsuit with R.J. Reynolds, who accused him of selling “gray market” cigarettes, and was convicted of fraud in 2011.

Spoiler alert: If you squint really hard, you’ll see the phrase “Bring McNuggets” appear in the background … that is, if you don’t give yourself a migraine first.

People commented that the image was causing them serious eye problems, but the fast-food chain doesn’t seem too concerned: After one user on Facebook wrote “[that] just messed up my eyes, thanks mcdonalds,” the restaurant cheekily responded with “#sorrynotsorry.”

Others seemed to love the tricky imagery, with a few people even noting that they planned to use this on their wedding invitations.

The 55-year-old also added, “[Michael] knew exactly what he wanted with every shot and every scene.”

A post shared by @murielfoenkinos on Oct 16, 2017 at 4:37am PDT

Landon’s widow Cindy confirmed the claim.

“If you watch ‘Little House,’ truly it was like watching Michael,” she said. “The love that he had for his family, the type of person he was – it was all apparent.”

Rachel Greenbush, who starred as Carrie Ingalls alongside twin sister Sidney, also had fond memories of working with Landon.

A post shared by @melissawithoutsueanderson on Oct 12, 2017 at 8:35am PDT

“For all the kids’ birthdays, he would have a cake made and throw a little party,” she recalled. “When it was time to work, you had to be focused.”

And while Landon expected hard work from everyone involved in the beloved show, he wasn’t afraid to get out of character to many anyone smile. Greenbush revealed he “was a big practical joker.”

“We used to go with Melissa [Gilbert] to catch frogs in the creek,” she said. “We would bring them back to Michael, and then he would put them in his mouth and walk up to people, open his mouth and the frog would jump out! People would freak out!”

But that wasn’t the only surprise the cast would encounter. The publication added that when production moved from Paramount Studios to MGM in the late ‘70s, they made an unlikely discovery.

“They were ripping up the floor of the set, and what Melissa [Gilbert] and I see, lying beneath, was the Yellow Brick Road [from the 1939 ‘Wizard of Oz’ set]!” said Arngrim. “Melissa and I went nuts. We were dancing around, singing the song, pretending to be Dorothy!”

“Little House on the Prairie” would go on to stay in the top 30 ratings for nearly its entire nine-year run. But when it finally came to an end, Landon was eager to go out with a bang.

“He literally strapped dynamite on all those buildings and blew them to smithereens in one take,” said Melissa Francis, who played Cassandra Cooper Ingalls.

Landon passed away in 1991 at age 54 from cancer of the liver and pancreas. Arngrim previously told Fox News that “Little House on the Prairie” is currently airing in 140 countries and has kept her busy traveling to make appearances, especially in France where the show has a cult following.

'Trick-or-treat' is right around the corner and one way to help keep Halloween safe is to make sure kids can see and be seen.

""Costumes should be as bright and colorful as possible, especially since a lot of trick or treating happens in the evening hours,"" Dr. Omar Baker says. ""And we always recommend to our patients if the costume is dark to consider using reflective tape.""

Dr. Baker also says make sure younger kids can't trip on their costumes, use a flashlight, walk in large groups with parents, if under age 12 and watch where kids are walking.

""Kids get extremely excited during Halloween, sometimes in unpredictable ways, so pay close attention to the sidewalks,"" Dr. Baker says.

He also urges homeowners to clear a path, keep lights on and pets inside and to help avoid a sore tummy.

""You want kids to be kids, but obviously with guidelines and limitations.""

He also says a good meal before they go out can help curb the appetite for candy when they get home.

Some familiar advice still holds true. Dr. Baker says remind kinds not to eat any candy that's not in its original wrapper. He also encourages homeowners to keep kids with allergies in mind and to only offer treats that don't contain nuts. For young children, he suggests non-toxic face paint as an alternative to masks, but says don't forget to wash it off before bedtime. And he reminds everyone not to look at their cell phone while they're walking.",Parenting: Tips for a Happy and Safe Halloween,https://radio.foxnews.com/2017/10/20/parenting-tips-for-a-happy-and-safe-halloween/

At least one of the cases has resulted in death, with nearly 250 others requiring hospital care.

The cases span across 48 states, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the number to be far higher than what’s been reported.

“For one salmonella case we know of in an outbreak, there are up to 30 others that we don’t know about,” CDC veterinarian Megin Nichols said.

Nichols said many people raising chickens don’t understand the potential danger, and treat the birds like pets allowing close contact and access to the family home. But poultry can carry salmonella bacteria in their intestines that can be shed in their feces, which could attach to feathers and dust and brush off on shoes or clothing.

YOUR BRAIN KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE JUST DIED, RESEARCHERS SAY

While salmonella can be prevented with thorough handwashing and discarding shoes used in chicken coops outside, some have taken to snuggling or kissing the birds. Nichols said they view the uptick in cases as a preventable health problem, and that the best way to protect against infection is to assume all birds carry the bacteria.

Salmonella infection is more widely-known as a food-borne illness, with more than 1 million cases and 300 deaths due to contaminated food recorded each year.

There are no firm figures on how many households in the U.S. have backyard chickens, but a Department of Agriculture report in 2013 found a growing number of residents in Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City expressed interest in getting them. Coops are now seen in even the smallest yards and densest urban neighborhoods.

“I think it’s really important to know where your food comes from, but I do think they need to be educated on how to do it safely,” Dr. Stacene Maroushek, a pediatric infectious disease physician in Minneapolis, told the Associated Press. “There are things growing up as a farm kid you know instinctively, but city people don’t know.”

Salmonella can cause flu-like symptoms, including diarrhea, and can pose a more serious risk in children, pregnant women, elderly people and those with compromised immune systems.

“It gets into their blood and it can get into organs,” Maroushek said. “It can be much more significant in people with underlying health problems.”

The brouhaha over President Trump’s phone call to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson has gotten even worse in recent days. After Chief of Staff John Kelly inserted himself in the debate, Kelly, himself a Gold Star father, became the subject of attacks from the left.

What have we become as a country when we use the families of fallen soldiers as weapons to attack political opponents? Or attack these families to protect politicians on our own side?

Not all of the families of fallen soldiers are going to say things that patriotic Americans agree with. Cindy Sheehan, the mother of Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004, is a prime example of a Gold Star mother who says things that are offensive to many other Americans.

The bottom line, however, is that they have the right, as American citizens, to express their opinions. As Americans who have sacrificed a family member, they have paid an unusually high price for the right to speak their minds freely. Their opinions should be respected, if not necessarily agreed with.

Can we resolve the issue of the phone call to Mrs. Johnson without calling either President Trump or Cowanda Jones-Johnson a liar? Yes. It’s surprisingly easy to guess what happened when we lay aside political grudges and preconceptions.

Keep in mind that first-person witnesses to an event are notoriously unreliable. This is especially true in cases where the individuals are under stress and distracted. Neither side recorded the call so both only have their fallible human memories and impressions to fall back on.

My best guess as to what happened is that President Trump made the call to Sgt. Johnson’s widow in good faith and went off script, as he tends to do. What seemed to be an innocuous comment to the president and Gen. Kelly was taken differently by the Johnson family and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fl.).

One of my favorite philosophies is Hanlon’s Razor, which advises, “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.” This advice applies to both sides in the current debate.

First, liberals should acknowledge that Donald Trump would not intentionally act so callously toward the widow of a fallen American soldier. The fact that Gen. Kelly now backs up Trump’s claim is a powerful argument that Trump’s statement may have been misheard or misinterpreted.

Second, Trump supporters should not assume that the family is intent on using the death of Sgt. Johnson to embarrass and attack the president. To assume that a grieving family would lie about what they heard the president say, knowing that it would cause Sgt. Johnson’s name to be dragged through the mud and that family members would be subjected to personal attacks in their time of grief, defies logic.

Kelly’s statement seems to support the idea that the president unintentionally misspoke. Recalling the words of Gen. Joseph Dunford after the death of his own son in Afghanistan, Kelly said, “He was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that one percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we were at war. And when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends. That’s what the President tried to say to the four families the other day.”

The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings.
Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday.
""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.","The U.S. government is urging the world airline community to ban large, personal electronic devices like laptops from checked luggage because of the potential for a catastrophic fire.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a paper filed recently with a U.N. agency that its tests show that when a laptop's rechargeable lithium-ion battery overheats in close proximity to an aerosol spray can, it can cause an explosion capable of disabling an airliner's fire suppression system. The fire could then rage unchecked, leading to ""the loss of the aircraft,"" the paper said.

The U.N. agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, sets global aviation safety standards, although member countries must still ratify them. The proposed ban is on the agenda of a meeting of ICAO's panel on dangerous goods being held this week and next week in Montreal.

The FAA has conducted 10 tests involving a fully-charged laptop packed in a suitcase. A heater was placed against the laptop's battery to force it into ""thermal runaway,"" a condition in which the battery's temperature continually rises.

In one test, an 8-ounce aerosol can of dry shampoo —which is permitted in checked baggage — was strapped to the laptop. There was a fire almost immediately and it grew rapidly. The aerosol can exploded within 40 seconds.

The test showed that because of the rapid progression of the fire, Halon gas fire suppressant systems used in airline cargo compartments would be unable to put out the fire before there was an explosion, the FAA said. The explosion might not be strong enough to structurally damage the plane, but it could damage the cargo compartment and allow the Halon to escape, the agency said. Then there would be nothing to prevent the fire from spreading.

Other tests of laptop batteries packed with potentially dangerous consumer goods that are permitted in checked baggage like nail polish remover, hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol also resulted in large fires, although no explosions.

As a result, the paper recommends that passengers shouldn't be allowed to pack large electronic devices in baggage unless they have specific approval from the airline. The paper says the European Safety Agency, the FAA's counterpart in Europe; Airbus, one of the world's largest makers of passenger airliners; the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Association, and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aircraft makers, concurred in the recommendation.

The paper doesn't address whether the ban should extend to domestic flights, but points out the risk that baggage containing a large electronic device could be transferred from one flight to another without the knowledge of the airline. The FAA said it believes most devices larger than a smartphone are already being carried by passengers into the cabin, rather than put in checked bags.

Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Manufacturers like them because they pack more energy into smaller packages, but the batteries can self-ignite if they have a manufacturing flaw, are damaged, exposed to excessive heat, overcharged or packed too closely together. The fires can burn up to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit, close to the melting point of the aluminum used in aircraft construction.

Since 2006, three cargo jets have been destroyed and four pilots killed by in-flight fires that investigators say were either started by batteries or made more severe by their proximity.

Earlier this year, the U.S. imposed a ban on laptops in the cabins of planes coming into the country from 10 Middle Eastern airports for security reasons. The ban was fully lifted in July after U.S. officials said airports in the region had taken other steps to increase security.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration formerly led the U.S. negotiations on the regulation of dangerous goods at ICAO meetings. But the Obama administration put the FAA in charge in 2009 after congressional Democrats accused high-level officials at PHMSA of being too cozy with the industries they regulate.

Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has now decided to put PHMSA back in charge at future ICAO dangerous goods deliberations, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said Thursday. Both agencies are part of the Transportation Department.

DeFazio called the decision ""inexplicable"" in a letter to Chao.

""I strongly believe it has the potential to put the lives of airline passengers and crews at serious risk,"" he said.

Chao didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Lobbyists for lithium battery makers and companies that use the batteries in their products have previously urged the change.","US: Laptops in checked bags pose fire, explosion risk",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/20/us-laptops-in-checked-bags-pose-fire-explosion-risk.html

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

RELATED: Duvet vs. Coverlet - What’s the Difference?

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

""Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them,"" said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

""He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something,"" said Jennifer.​

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate.

""There is no country in the world ready to allow this kind of situation within its borders,"" Rajoy said Saturday. ""It is my wish to call elections as soon as normality is restored.""

Rajoy’s Cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution.

The meeting came almost three weeks after Catalan citizens voted for independence in a controversial referendum that was ruled illegal by the country’s Supreme Court.

CATALONIA'S PUSH FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN: WHAT TO KNOW

After the meeting, Rajoy said he wants the Senate to allow central ministers to take over functions from all the regional Cabinet members and give him the power to call regional elections — something that only Catalonia's top leader can do now.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has argued the referendum result gave him the mandate to move forward with independence.

Under Article 155, central authorities are allowed to intervene when one of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions fails to comply with the law. It has never been used since the 1978 Constitution was adopted.

On Saturday, Rajoy said the early election seeks to remove the regional officials who violated the country’s laws by actively promoting the referendum bid.

Such actions are expected to spark angry opposition from supporters of independence and moderate Catalans who will see them as an attack on their autonomy.

The slow-burning constitutional crisis over secession escalated this month when regional government officials claimed a disputed independence referendum held Oct. 1 gave them a legal basis for separating from Spain.

The country's Constitutional Court has so far ruled against all moves toward secession, including the controversial referendum. The court's website appeared to be offline Saturday, and a spokeswoman said it had been affected by vandalism of unknown origin.

Spain's National Security Department had warned of potential digital vandalism Friday and said slogans supporting independence for Catalonia had popped up on a number of government websites.

The Constitutional Court spokeswoman said Saturday only the court's website was not working and no internal information was compromised. She requested anonymity in line with internal rules.

The referendum vote itself was marred by sporadic violence as police took action to shut down some polling locations. The central government says the results have no legitimacy.

Opposition parties have agreed to support the prime minister in revoking Catalonia's autonomy as a way to thwart the independence drive.

Although the ruling Popular Party has a strong enough majority to get the specific measures passed by the country's Senate, Rajoy has rallied the support of the opposition to give his government's actions more weight.

Puigdemont has threatened to call a vote in the regional parliament for an explicit declaration of independence from Spain.

Catalan activist groups called for another protest Saturday in Barcelona over the jailing of two pro-independence leaders who are being investigated on possible sedition charges.

A National Court judge had Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, the heads of grassroots organizations Catalan National Assembly and Omnium Cultural, preventatively held on Monday.

The prominent activists are accused of orchestrating earlier demonstrations in mid-September that allegedly hindered a judicial probe of preparations for the Oct. 1 referendum after it had been declared unconstitutional and got in the way of police carrying out orders to prevent the vote.

Barcelona resident Rosa Isart said the Spanish government's determination to prevent Catalonia from leaving Spain reminded her of the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco four decades ago.

""It seems unbelievable that I have to see this again because of the incompetence of these politicians who don't know how to speak or dialogue,"" Isart said.

Kia, Audi and BMW filled out the rest of the top five, while Cadillac, GMC, Ram, Dodge and Volvo were ranked the lowest.

Complaints about infotainment systems and new transmissions plagued the lowest-ranked automakers, while Toyota's slow and steady implementation of new technologies paid off with high marks.

Consumer Reports predicts reliability of 2018 vehicles based on a survey of subscribers who owned or leased 640,000 vehicles from the 2000-2017 model years. It forecasts how a model will perform based on recent data for that model.

The magazine gives more weight to mechanical and safety issues than minor problems like wind noise.

The magazine's rankings are closely watched in the industry, since many buyers seek advice from Consumer Reports.

Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of auto testing, says Toyota's strategy of adding new technology gradually — instead of all at once — helps make its vehicles more reliable. Toyota's new Camry sedan, for example, has an eight-speed transmission that was first tested on the Highlander SUV.

Kia has also steadily climbed in the rankings because it uses proven technology that has already been tested by its sister brand, Hyundai, which slipped in the rankings. Consumer Reports found that the Kia Niro hybrid, which went on sale earlier this year, was the most reliable vehicle in its entire survey.

Audi and BMW also have better-than-average infotainment systems because they were some of the first to market them more than a decade ago.

""They've had all those growing pains,"" Fisher said.

By contrast, Buick dropped from third to eighth in the rankings because of troubles with its new 2017 LaCrosse sedan, which has a new eight-speed transmission, new engine and new electronic shifter, among other features. Fisher said other recent Buicks, like the Envision, went on sale in China or Europe first and got some kinks worked out before heading to the U.S.

Electric cars escaped some of those reliability problems because they have fewer parts. General Motors Co. didn't fare well overall, but its new Chevrolet Bolt electric car had above-average reliability. In its debut on the list, Tesla Inc.'s Model 3 sedan got an ""average"" reliability score. The car isn't widely available yet, but the magazine based its ranking on responses for the company's Model S sedan, which has above-average reliability.

""There's a lot of stuff that's not in electric cars. They're simpler,"" Fisher said.

Chrysler was the biggest climber in the rankings, thanks to consumer reviews of its new Pacifica minivan. Acura fell the furthest, hurt by problems with the transmissions on several of its new models.

According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady's office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.

During then-President Barack Obama’s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year.

This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June. Their salaries totaled $486,700.

The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel. Both the Obama and Trump administrations acknowledged several additional staffers beyond those listed in the report with the term “first lady” in their titles. But even counting all those employees -- 24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady -- Melania Trump's office is relatively small.

It's an approach her spokeswoman says is intentional.

“As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,” communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email. “It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together. She also wants to be mindful and responsible when it comes to taxpayer money.”

MELANIA TRUMP SLAMS IVANA FOR CALLING HERSELF FIRST LADY

While the 2009 annual report listed 16 staffers for Michelle Obama, her press secretary said at the time the staff actually included 24 people. A 2009 FactCheck.org story said Obama’s 24 aides might have broken records.

“That may indeed be the largest of any first lady, but Hillary Clinton, with 19 staffers, and Laura Bush with at least 18 and perhaps more, weren’t far behind,” FactCheck.org said.

Grisham told Fox News this week there are nine people working in the East Wing under Melania Trump, a few more than listed in the annual report.

According to those personnel reports, Melania Trump’s staffers include a chief of staff, a communications director, a deputy chief of staff and a deputy director of advance.

Michelle Obama’s staff included those same positions and a slew of others: additional press aides, a director of policy and projects, a personal aide, a traveling aide and a director of correspondence.

Michelle Obama’s office did not return a request for comment.

But the larger staff is likely due in part to Michelle Obama entering the East Wing with a more aggressive agenda and embracing initiatives like her Let's Move! child obesity campaign.

During the first few months of the Trump presidency, Melania Trump and son, Barron, remained in New York as he finished the school year.

But she has noticeably ramped up public activity in recent weeks, including hosting a roundtable discussion on the opioid crisis and traveling with her husband to tour the destruction of hurricanes and meet with the victims of the Las Vegas massacre.

“She is more like a Pat Nixon or a Bess Truman than a Hillary Clinton or a Michelle Obama,” Andrew Och, a first lady historian who was a producer for the C-SPAN's “First Ladies: Influence and Image” series, said of Melania Trump.

Och noted that there is no formal job description for a first lady and each one defines their role. Melania Trump, he said, does not come from the world of politics and “clearly does not feel the need for the larger staffs that her predecessors have had.”

The first lady’s office isn’t the only place in the White House where the Trump administration has trimmed staff positions. When the White House personnel report was released in June, Forbes reported 110 fewer employees under Donald Trump than Barack Obama and said the projected four-year savings resulting from the cuts could be more than $22 million.",Melania Trump cuts bloated first lady payroll from Michelle Obama days,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/20/melania-trump-cuts-bloated-first-lady-payroll-from-michelle-obama-days.html

The prominent activists are accused of orchestrating earlier demonstrations in mid-September that allegedly hindered a judicial probe of preparations for the Oct. 1 referendum after it had been declared unconstitutional and got in the way of police carrying out orders to prevent the vote.

Barcelona resident Rosa Isart said the Spanish government's determination to prevent Catalonia from leaving Spain reminded her of the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco four decades ago.

""It seems unbelievable that I have to see this again because of the incompetence of these politicians who don't know how to speak or dialogue,"" Isart said.

Police say a man with a knife has lightly wounded four people in Munich. Officers are looking for the assailant.

Munich police called on people in the Rosenheimer Platz area, located close to the German city's downtown, to stay inside after the incident on Saturday morning.

The perpetrator fled the scene. Police said he appeared to be about 40 years old and had a black bicycle, gray trousers, a green jacket and a backpack.

The police department said on Twitter that officers are looking for the assailant ""with all available police forces.""

It said the motive for the attack was not immediately clear.

The tech company recently tested a feature that showed users how many calories they would burn walking from point A to point B, along with a note that equated those calories to mini cupcakes. For example, as Buzzfeed pointed out in one example, a four and a half mile walk would burn around 406 calories: “that’s almost 4 mini cupcakes,” the app reads, alongside a pink cupcake graphic.

The feature also included additional info about how those numbers were calculated. “The average person burns 90 Calories by walking 1 mile. To help put that into perspective, we’ve estimated how many desserts your walk would burn. One mini cupcake is around 110 Calories.”

Google began testing this feature with some iPhone users about a week ago, but not everyone was happy with it. While some welcomed it as motivation to walk rather than take a car or public transit, others accused it of being potentially harmful to those with an eating disorder, pointing out that an obsession with calorie-counting can be a warning sign. There was also no opt-out option available, forcing anyone who used the app to see the built-in feature.

""This is reinforcing behaviors that we’re trying to stop when we're treating a patient for an eating disorder,"" Michelle Lupkin, Ph.D., clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at Montefiore Medical Center, tells SELF. And, according to Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, using exercise as a way to compensate for calories consumed is a hallmark of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, SELF reports.

In addition to the potentially harmful side effects of the feature, as the Washington Post points out, Google’s measurements of both calories burned and calories per cupcake were questionable.

Bush had the most “destructive” presidency in U.S. history.

Bannon's scathing comments at the annual California Republican Party convention came about a week after Bush denounced bigotry in Trump-era American politics and warned that the rise of isolationism and ""nativism,"" which Bannon espouses, have clouded the nation's true identity.

""There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush's,"" Bannon said.

He also said Bush has no idea whether ""he is coming or going, just like it was when he was president,” amid boos in the crowd at the mention of Bush's name.

Bannon made the remarks in a speech thick with attacks on the Washington status quo, echoing his earlier calls for an ""open revolt"" against establishment Republicans. He called the ""permanent political class"" one of the great dangers faced by the country.

Bannon, a late-arrival to Trump’s presidential campaign who was ousted last month from his White House post, got a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech in Anaheim.

Since leaving the White House at Trump’s top political adviser, Bannon has returned to Breitbart News and embarked on an effort to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other congressional Republicans whom he thinks have slowed or blocked Trump’s legislative agenda.

Bannon has for weeks basked in the victory of social conservative Roy Moore over establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange in Alabama’s GOP Senate runoff.

And at a speech last weekend in Washington to social conservatives, Bannon declared “war” on establishment candidates, particularly lose seeking reelection next year.

A small group of protesters gathered outside the Southern California hotel where Bannon spoke, chanting and waving signs including one with a Nazi swastika. The protesters were kept behind steel barricades on a plaza across an entrance road at the hotel, largely out of view of people entering for the event. No arrests were reported.

Bannon also took aim at the Silicon Valley and its ""lords of technology,"" predicting that tech leaders and progressives in the state would try to secede from the union in 10 to 15 years. He called the threat to break up the nation a ""living problem.""

He also tried to cheer long-suffering California Republicans, in a state that Trump lost by over 4 million votes and where Republicans have become largely irrelevant in state politics. In Orange County, where the convention was held, several Republican House members are trying to hold onto their seats in districts carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential contest.

""You've got everything you need to win,"" he told them.

While Bannon is promoting a field of primary challengers to take on incumbent Republicans, the GOP has been fading for years in California.

The state has become a kind of Republican mausoleum: GOP supporters can relive the glory days by visiting the stately presidential libraries of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, but today Democrats control every statewide office and rule both chambers of the Legislature by commanding margins.

Not all Republicans were glad to see Bannon. In a series of tweets last week, former state Assembly Republican leader Chad Mayes said he was shocked by the decision to have the conservative firebrand headline the event.

""It's a huge step backward and demonstrates that the party remains tone deaf,"" Mayes tweeted

Political scientist Jack Pitney, who teaches at Claremont McKenna College, said he doubted the speech would color the 2018 congressional contests, which remain far off for most voters.

More broadly, he said Bannon's politics would hurt the GOP, including among affluent, well-educated voters who play an important part in county elections.

""Inviting him was a moral and political blunder,"" Pitney said in an email.

Brown, 14, posted a picture of a quote reading: “You may not understand today or tomorrow, but eventually God will reveal why you went through everything you did.” The reality star’s caption detailed her struggles to get out of bed in the morning and her loss of motivation.

“For the past few days I’ve been struggling with some things, such as my depression, life, and some teen girl probs too (ya know a broken nail) and I couldn’t figure out why I was in such bad shape. I stayed in bed for about four days with minor aches and pains and I couldn’t find out a reason, it bothered me so much, I lost any want to be healthy or motivational, I was just a husk,” Brown wrote.

She continued that although it felt wrong to “stay in bed and watch videos” it was sometimes “okay” to not do anything.

“In the time of all this happening I told myself that over and over but it also hit me I had to actually believe it and just let it go and stop being bothered by it, I still feel kinda down and like being lazy, but that’s alright because my body knows what it needs and if that’s rest I won’t be one to refuse,” Brown said.

She concluded with telling her fans to stay strong and not to let “depression or dark feelings” get you down.

The Brown family, which stars on the hit Discovery Channel reality show, learned in June 2016 that the family’s matriarch, Ami Brown, had stage 4 lung cancer. The family shared Ami’s diagnosis during an episode that aired this June. In the episode, Rain said she was “very scared” for her mother.

“I don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve been through. I don’t care how old you are. If you hear that your mother has cancer, it’s going to shock you,” Rain said. “I just wish I could change it somehow. I’m very scared for her.”

“They said they were concerned about pressure that would be put on Mr. Campos by someone like Sean Hannity,” Hickey told Fox News.
The meeting ended with Campos slipping out while Hickey was in another room and disappearing from the public spotlight for days.
Campos resurfaced on television Wednesday for the pre-recorded interview, despite saying last week that he wanted to tell his story and move on, Hickey said.
The union president said the “officers at Mandalay Bay,” such as Campos, are the ones who haven’t been recognized enough in the wake of the attack.","What happened in Vegas seems to be staying in Vegas.

Nearly three weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the release of details surrounding the horrific attack has slowed from a trickle to a standstill: police have yet to schedule another news conference, confusion continues to surround the gunman's motive and critical questions linger about what exactly happened on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The president of the union representing Jesus Campos – a security officer at the hotel who was shot during the attack and who became the subject of intense public interest after bailing on scheduled TV interviews last week – also told Fox News he has “no idea” whether or not Campos will return to work at Mandalay Bay.

And inside and outside the opulent resort and casino, the crime scene remained frozen in time Friday, as the Las Vegas enterprise was ordered by a judge to not destroy anything that could be considered evidence in a trial -- right down to the broken glass from gunman Stephen Paddock’s suite.

“What our client is saying and what the community and the nation is saying is shifting timelines, witnesses missing...it just creates this general sense of unease, people just don’t feel safe,” attorney Brian Nettles, who is representing shooting victim Rachel Sheppard, told KSNV.

The preservation order from Judge Mark Denton, which was issued Thursday, blocks Mandalay Bay from erasing video surveillance, card swipe data and complaints coming from Paddock’s hotel suite – among other items – until another hearing on Oct. 30 where MGM Resorts International will have a chance to argue against it.

“This was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. We have no intention of renting that room,” the company said in a statement following the order. “We’ve been cooperating with law enforcement from the moment this happened, which includes preserving evidence.”

COUNTRY MUSIC STARS HONOR LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS AT CONCERTS

Opposite Mandalay Bay, pictures of the festival grounds taken by KSNV this week show little has changed since the Oct. 1 attack, where 58 people attending a country music concert were gunned down by Paddock from his room. Nearly 500 others were wounded.

“This weekend!” reads a billboard on the festival grounds, surrounded by fences and yellow crime scene tape. Across the street, a black #VegasStrong banner is hanging from the top of the Mandalay Bay resort -- its golden facade glimmering in the sunlight -- with the two boarded up windows Paddock took aim from noticeably standing out.

Campos, who was shot in the leg by Paddock while investigating an alarm on his floor, appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' show this week alongside Stephen Schuck, a hotel maintenance worker who credits Campos for saving his life.

But the host did little to clear up the plethora of unanswered questions about Paddock and response to the shooting, including what caused Paddock to stop firing before authorities ever gained entry to his room, where Paddock was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“If you watch the entire show, the venue is not where I would have put these two heroes to tell their story,” David Hickey, president of the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, told Fox News. “I’m not criticizing Mr. Campos and his decision, since he has been through a horrendous event, but what I was saying is it’s not the venue I would have chosen or recommended.”

Hickey said he and Campos met with MGM’s corporate team last week before a series of scheduled television interviews, including one with Fox News' Sean Hannity, which the security officer had agreed to do.

“They said they were concerned about pressure that would be put on Mr. Campos by someone like Sean Hannity,” Hickey told Fox News.

FULL COVERAGE OF LAS VEGAS SHOOTING

He added the casino giant’s executives cited worries about Campos' “health” and expressed concern about the “stress” of appearing on five shows.

“I felt like this was a time that Mr. Campos should be made comfortable and confident to do something he had never done before, to speak on air and to do it live,” Hickey said.

The meeting ended with Campos slipping out while Hickey was in another room and disappearing from the public spotlight for days. Campos resurfaced on television Wednesday for the pre-recorded interview, despite saying last week that he wanted to tell his story and move on, Hickey said.

The union president said the “officers at Mandalay Bay,” such as Campos, are the ones who haven’t been recognized enough in the wake of the attack.

The round of 12 gets underway Sunday in the Monster Energy Cup playoffs.

FOX's Matt Napolitano has more:

It's down to a dozen in the quest for the Cup as the top circuit returns to Charlotte for the Bank of America 500 Sunday. Kyle Busch entering this race weekend in quest of his third straight win, but says momentum doesn't mean anything in the playoffs:

(Busch) ""There's a lot of racing to go. You know, I think week to week you can probably change your favorite.""

Busch trailing the leader Martin Truex Jr. by 18 points in the playoff standings.

This as one of the final 12 speaks out on pay for drivers. Denny Hamlin sounding off during the week that salary should be on the level of athletes in leagues like the NBA and the NFL:

(Denny Hamlin) ""They're risking their life each and every weekend, and they're on the road just, you know, just like everyone else is each and every weekend.""

Hamlin speaking with Sirius XM NASCAR Radio there, calling for more revenue from NASCAR's TV deal to be shared with teams.

This as NASCAR unveiled rule changes for 2018 to cars that will see the addition of radiators and common flat splitters for all races, and efforts to increase down-force and horsepower for competitors.

“Everyone has been basically saying ‘Oh my gosh I’m crying’ (and) another girl was even like ‘I just put on my makeup and now it’s all over my face,'” Vanessa told KSAT.

“There’s also a lot of people on Twitter saying that they wish they had that from their dad or their mom and if they can hear their loved ones voice one more time, it would have made their entire world,” Vanessa said.

She said David was ordered to travel to South Carolina for basic training in August, leaving the family of three a few weeks to spend together before he left.

The same may well happen—or be happening—with Donald Trump.

One reason is that there is no hard constituency in America for political incompetence, and that is what he continues to demonstrate.

The first sign of political competence is knowing where you stand with the people. Gallup this week had him at 36 percent approval, 59 percent disapproval.

Many of his initial list, 7,000 books on topics ranging from Agriculture to Zoology didn't make it, lost in a fire in the 1800's, but thanks to a 40-year search by a librarian at the school, more than 330 legal works have been collected so that people today can read for themselves.

However, the company did try to find a silver lining to their failed promotion, writing in the same post, “But there is also some good news. 48 young women took part in this campaign.”

To try and salvage their reputation with female customers, Dvijok launched a second “movement” after dismantling the big bust discount. This one asked women to give ingredient suggestions for their newest menu item, “the Femen-dog.”

“Men have no right to decide what should be in its composition,” the Instagram post said. “Girls, offer your ingredients in the comments.”

The restaurant followed up with another post on Instagram saying they “got some great recipes, which pleases,” as well as “a lot of aggression that saddens.” Then they listed the winning ingredients, which included “brains,"" but the fast-food company said “unfortunately [they] can not add brains.”

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

""Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.","Olympics may soon feature pole dancing, foosball and poker",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/olympics-may-soon-feature-pole-dancing-foosball-and-poker.html

“For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” wrote Business Insider, who added that “Chick-fil-A dominates — which isn’t surprising.”

Twitter users were quick to refute the study’s findings, however, arguing that the results don’t actually reflect what people in any given state prefer, and calling the study “nonsense.”

Some also claimed that, in states where Chick-fil-A wasn’t the winner, the restaurants were determined to be a state’s “favorite” weren’t even all that popular.

Media outlets like the Oregonian and the SFGate, too, were unconvinced by the results, with the Oregonian calling them ""inconceivably bad"" and SFGate saying they've ""got issues"" with Cane's as California's top choice.

Johnson was one of four Americans killed in an Oct. 4 ambush in Niger.

After several Trump tweets and Wilson TV interviews earlier this week, White House Chief of Staff retired Gen. John Kelly on Thursday publically criticized Wilson’s involvement in the call, suggesting she’s trying to politicize the matter.

“I feel very sorry for him because he feels such a need to lie on me and I’m not even his enemy,” Wilson said Friday about Kelly's remarks, in a New York Times interview. “I just can’t even imagine why he would fabricate something like that. That is absolutely insane. I’m just flabbergasted because it’s very easy to trace.”

Wilson didn’t label Kelly a racist in the interview but claimed that others in the White House are.

“They are making themselves look like fools,” she also said. “They have no credibility. They are trying to assassinate my character, and they are assassinating their own because everything they say is coming out and shown to be a lie.”

Kelly said he was “broken-hearted” by Wilson’s involvement in the call. During his remarks, Kelly also criticized Wilson by recalling her comments during the 2015 dedication of a FBI field office in Miramar, Fla.

He said Wilson “talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million, to build the building, and she sat down.”

“And we were stunned, stunned that she'd done it,"" Kelly said of Wilson's remarks during the event. ""Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.""

The “12 Years a Slave” star detailed her experience with Weinstein in a lengthy op-ed to The New York Times that was published Thursday.

Nyong’o wrote Weinstein invited her to his Connecticut home in 2011 while she was a student at the Yale School of Drama.

After having lunch with him and meeting his young children, they entered his private screening room with a large group. Eventually, he asked her to go to a bedroom with him and propositioned her for a massage.

""I thought he was joking at first. He was not,"" the actress wrote.

Nyong’o said she gave him a massage instead but when he tried to remove his pants, she insisted she leave.

She described several other encounters with him over the years, including some propositions.

It was not until she became an Oscar winner in 2014 for her role in “12 Years a Slave” that Weinstein apologized for his behavior and agreed to show her the respect she deserves.

But a study released Friday reveals that body cameras have little to no effect on police behavior. Officers wearing the devices act similarly to those who don’t, the study concludes.

But every measure showed the differences to be insignificant.

“The results call into question whether police departments should even be adopting body-worn cameras, especially given their high cost,” Harlan Yu, a consultant with Upturn, a Washington nonprofit that examines technology’s effect on society, told the New York Times. Yu’s group was not involved in the study, the Times says.

""The results call into question whether police departments should even be adopting body-worn cameras, especially given their high cost."" - Harlan Yu, consultant with Upturn, a nonprofit that examines technology’s effect on society

Police departments investing in body cameras “should not expect dramatic reductions in the use-of-force complaints, or other large-scale shifts in police behavior solely from the deployment of this technology,” study director Yokum, of The Lab @DC, told the Washington Post.

“So if you are a police department thinking that this technology on its own is going to be something to cause big shifts on those two dynamics, this would be a cause to recalibrate your expectations,” Yokum said.

Washington, D.C., police Chief Peter Newsham told the Times he was surprised by the results because he was expecting the use of cameras to at least have an impact on those officers “who might be more inclined to misbehave.”

If the cameras have any value at all, the chief told the Post, it’s likely to be in helping clarify details of controversial cases – such as whether a suspect is armed or not when officers arrive at a crime scene.

Sgt. Matthew Mahl, chairman of the D.C. police labor union, told the Post that he too expected the study’s conclusions to be different.

“I honestly thought that complaints would have come down,” Mahl told the newspaper. “We’re spending all this money to realize that everything is the same.

If not, the system will slowly shut itself down and bring the vehicle to a stop in the lane it is currently driving in with the hazard lights on.

I recently had the opportunity to take a prototype Rogue fitted with ProPilot Assist on a short drive in New York City. It quickly locks onto lane markers and engages, but needs two well-defined lines to work. Faded paint will cause it to deactivate, as will the veering lines at exit ramps. It’s at its best in a center lane, where it holds itself dead center, even through wide radius curves. If they're too tight for the speed the vehicle is traveling at, ProPilot Assist will alert the driver to take back full control.

More impressive than its lane-keeping ability is the adaptive cruise control component of the system. This isn’t a new concept, but many cars so equipped apply the brakes abruptly when the car they’re following slows down or one pulls into their lane, often jarring passengers. ProPilot Assist has the same smooth touch as a very alert driver, and works in stop-and-go traffic, as long as the vehicle doesn’t stay stationary for very long.

Overall, ProPilot Assist is a step behind similar systems that Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Volvo currently offer, but is far ahead of anything available from Nissan's peers in the mainstream automotive segment. Nissan has sketched out a roadmap toward a fully autonomous car by 2022, however, so the abilities of its technology should increase quickly and dramatically in the coming years.

ProPilot Assist will be available initially only on the top of the line Rogue SL equipped with an optional Platinum Package at a starting price of $34,875.",Nissan ProPilot Assist semi-autonomous driving system to launch in 2018 Rogue,http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/18/nissan-propilot-assist-semi-autonomous-driving-system-to-launch-in-2018-rogue.html

Landon’s widow Cindy confirmed the claim.

“If you watch ‘Little House,’ truly it was like watching Michael,” she said. “The love that he had for his family, the type of person he was – it was all apparent.”

Rachel Greenbush, who starred as Carrie Ingalls alongside twin sister Sidney, also had fond memories of working with Landon.

“For all the kids’ birthdays, he would have a cake made and throw a little party,” she recalled. “When it was time to work, you had to be focused.”

And while Landon expected hard work from everyone involved in the beloved show, he wasn’t afraid to get out of character to many anyone smile. Greenbush revealed he “was a big practical joker.”

“We used to go with Melissa [Gilbert] to catch frogs in the creek,” she said. “We would bring them back to Michael, and then he would put them in his mouth and walk up to people, open his mouth and the frog would jump out! People would freak out!”

“They were ripping up the floor of the set, and what Melissa [Gilbert] and I see, lying beneath, was the Yellow Brick Road [from the 1939 ‘Wizard of Oz’ set]!” said Arngrim. “Melissa and I went nuts. We were dancing around, singing the song, pretending to be Dorothy!”

“Little House on the Prairie” would go on to stay in the top 30 ratings for nearly its entire nine-year run. But when it finally came to an end, Landon was eager to go out with a bang.

“He literally strapped dynamite on all those buildings and blew them to smithereens in one take,” said Melissa Francis, who played Cassandra Cooper Ingalls.

Landon passed away in 1991 at age 54 from cancer of the liver and pancreas. Arngrim previously told Fox News that “Little House on the Prairie” is currently airing in 140 countries and has kept her busy traveling to make appearances, especially in France where the show has a cult following.

Authorities in Catalonia who want their northeastern region to leave Spain plan to hold a independence referendum Sunday — a vote that the central government in Madrid has vowed to halt.

Catalonia, one of Spain's 17 autonomous regions, has some 7.5 million people and includes the tourist-popular Mediterranean port of Barcelona, the country's second-largest city, which is home to a Catalan parliament and regional government. The region has its own language and generates a fifth of Spain's 1.1 trillion euro economy.

Here is a look at the events leading up to the deeply divisive vote:

—2006: Spain's central government and Catalan authorities agree on devolving more powers to the northeastern region, including finance, health care and education. The agreement is approved by both Catalan regional lawmakers and the national parliament.

—2008: Spain enters a five-year financial crisis that brings harsh austerity measures and recession, leaving many Catalans feeling their wealthy region could do better on its own.

—2010: Spain's Madrid-based Constitutional Court strikes down key parts of the 2006 charter, inadvertently breathing new life into the secession movement. Some 1 million Catalans voice their anger in a march through Barcelona. Pro-independence parties win a regional election.

—Sept. 11 2012: On Catalonia's national day, a huge turnout provides a show of force for the independence movement. But Madrid snubs Catalan officials by refusing to grant greater financial independence to the region.

—March 2014: Spain's Constitutional Court rules that Catalonia can't go ahead with a planned Nov. 9 vote on its independence, as all Spaniards must be allowed to cast a ballot.

—Nov. 9 2014: The Catalan government scraps its planned referendum on independence and, instead, calls the ballot an unofficial opportunity for locals to express their opinion about Catalonia's future. Of the around 2.3 million Catalans — less than half of those eligible — who vote, more than 80 percent choose secession. The national government rejects the vote as propaganda.

—Sept. 2015: Then-U.S. President Barack Obama says the United States wants a united Spain. European Union chiefs say an independent Catalonia wouldn't be allowed as a member. In another regional election, Catalonia's pro-independence parties narrowly win the most seats.

—Dec. 2015: Spain's Constitutional Court rules that a pro-independence resolution at the Catalan parliament is unconstitutional.

—March 2017: Former Catalan president Artur Mas is barred from holding public office for two years for holding the Nov. 2014 ballot.

—June 9 2017: Catalan president Carlos Puigdemont announces a new vote on independence on Oct.1. Catalan officials say they will proclaim a new republic within 48 hours of the ballot if a 'yes' vote wins, regardless of the turnout.

—Sept. 7 2017: After a legal challenge from the central government in Madrid, the Constitutional Court suspends the ballot.

—Sept. 20: Spanish police arrest a dozen Catalan officials for organizing the independence referendum, sparking mass street protests. Police seize 10 million ballot papers in a crackdown.

—Sept. 21 : Spain's Constitutional Court says it is fining 22 Catalan electoral board members between 6,000 euros ($7,000) and 12,000 euros ($14,200) a day as long as they fail to comply with the court order suspending the ballot.

—Sept. 29: The Spanish government vows to block the ballot. Catalan officials vow to proceed with it.

—Sept. 30: Police give activists and parents occupying schools in Catalonia so they can be used as polling stations for the Oct. 1 vote an ultimatum to leave by 6 a.m. on Oct. 1.",Timeline of recent events in Catalonia's independence drive,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/30/timeline-recent-events-in-catalonias-independence-drive.html

There’s just one problem: Plenty of fast-food fans aren’t buying it.

According to the results of the study, Chick-fil-A was found to be the favorite restaurant chain in a total of 39 states, as illustrated in this heavily maroon-tinged map first shared by Business Insider:

“For the study, we looked at which chains received the most visits on average in every state based on the total number of visits to each chain divided by the number of locations in that state,” wrote Business Insider, who added that “Chick-fil-A dominates — which isn’t surprising.”

Twitter users were quick to refute the study’s findings, however, arguing that the results don’t actually reflect what people in any given state prefer, and calling the study “nonsense.”

Some also claimed that, in states where Chick-fil-A wasn’t the winner, the restaurants were determined to be a state’s “favorite” weren’t even all that popular.

Media outlets like the Oregonian and the SFGate, too, were unconvinced by the results, with the Oregonian calling them ""inconceivably bad"" and SFGate saying they've ""got issues"" with Cane's as California's top choice.

Joanie Simpson, whose 2016 medical ordeal was detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with the loss of a spouse or child.

The symptoms can mimic those of a heart attack and is also referred to as “broken-heart syndrome,” The Washington Post reported. The condition is most common in women ages 58 to 75, and can cause weakening of the left ventricle, according to Harvard Medical School.

For Simpson, who at the time was stressed due to her son’s impending back surgery, her son-in-law’s unemployment and a property sale, it was the loss of the dog named Meha that sent her over the edge.

“The kids were grown and out of the house, so she was our little girl,” Simpson, 62, told The Washington Post.

But when the dog was diagnosed with congenital heart failure, Simpson decided it was best to have her euthanized. She canceled the appointment when the dog seemed to bounce back to health, but Meha died the next day.

“It was such a horrendous thing to have to witness,” Simpson told The Washington Post. “When you’re already kind of upset about other things, it’s like a brick on a scale. I mean everything just weighs on you.”

Sometime after Meha’s death, Simpson woke with back pain that traveled to her chest and went to an emergency room near her Houston home.

Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

Lulu started her training just like I started mine … full of excitement, nervous and eager for a belly rub.
I remember sizing up the other recruits in my class, and suspect Lulu went through the same thing.
Whatever her reason, the CIA let it be known the other day that Lulu was being let go.
Second, I’m glad to see the CIA occasionally letting the public peek into its world … it helps to humanize an organization full of wonderful, patriotic and dedicated humans.","The three most common questions I get asked about the Central Intelligence Agency are:

1. “How did you join the CIA?”

2. “No, I mean, why did they take you?”

3. “What was the training like?”

My answers are usually the same:

1. “Uh, I just got lucky.”

2. “Oh, yeah, I see what you mean … I guess they lowered the bar that year.”

3. “It was exciting, challenging and never boring … it was tough, you had to work like a dog.”

Like a dog. Anyone who has been through a long-term physically and mentally demanding training program knows what I’m talking about. Some make it, some don’t.

The CIA typically washes out an impressive number of recruits from each new class. Some can’t absorb the training fast enough, some realize they’re not suited for the agency. And occasionally – not very often – new recruits just can’t get excited enough to wag their tails.

I refer, of course, to Lulu the black Lab. The CIA announced on Twitter this week – and it was picked up by major media outlets hungry for the next spy bites dog story – that Lulu will not be continuing in her effort to be a CIA bomb dog.

The CIA’s latest washout entered the Fall 2017 K9 Explosives Detection Training program with high hopes and a little puppy head full of dreams. Lulu had passed all the preliminary tests. She excelled during the accelerated house-training course … learning quickly to only pee in the little areas where the trainers had spread classified documents on the floor.

Lulu started her training just like I started mine … full of excitement, nervous and eager for a belly rub. I remember sizing up the other recruits in my class, and suspect Lulu went through the same thing. Although, looking back on it, my classmates never introduced themselves by sticking their noses up anyone’s backside. That would come later as students worked to impress instructors.

My training lasted for a couple of years. As with Lulu and her puppy pals, my classmates and I needed a strict regimen of instruction mixed with constant exercises designed to reinforce the training. Our instructors were fair, firm and only occasionally did I get wacked in the nose with a rolled up newspaper. More often than not, positive reinforcement rather than a stern rebuke was the order of the day.

Lulu, according to credible sources with a solid track record of reporting, started the class well. But then, something happened. Maybe she began questioning her career choices. Perhaps she couldn’t reconcile the need for national security with the question of privacy and civil liberties. It could be that she just doesn’t like the smell of explosives.

Whatever her reason, the CIA let it be known the other day that Lulu was being let go. She reportedly lost interest in her training … sticking her nose in various canisters and noodling around cinderblocks and other materials just wasn’t interesting for her any longer. She was bored and that, frankly, is not a quality you’re looking for in a bomb dog.

Now some folks might accuse the CIA of puppy shaming. After all, why shine a light on Lulu’s shortcomings? Is it anybody’s business if Lulu can’t tell the difference between C4 and Silly Putty?

Well, first of all, there’s no shame in Lulu not making the cut. The fact that she was accepted into the course to begin with makes her a very good dog. My dog Hendricks, a 100 pound English Golden Retriever with a brain the size of a chickpea, couldn’t detect a small thermonuclear warhead unless it was covered in pork chops.

Hendricks is the world’s finest dog, but he’s nobody’s idea of a rocket scientist. He’s still trying to figure out who’s a good boy. I think he’s worried he may never get the answer to that question.

Lulu was accepted into the CIA, for crying out loud. That makes her at least as smart as me. So what that she didn’t finish the course. After a few weeks of sniffing stuff, I think she demonstrated remarkable maturity in walking into the chief’s office and announcing her early retirement.

Second, I’m glad to see the CIA occasionally letting the public peek into its world … it helps to humanize an organization full of wonderful, patriotic and dedicated humans. And dogs.

Best of all, the story has a happy ending. Lulu’s trainer eagerly adopted Lulu. She now spends her days lying on a rug, chasing squirrels, eating treats and getting petted. Which, if you think about it, is a fine way to spend your retirement. Good girl.","Ex-CIA officer: OK, so Lulu the lab wasn’t up to snuff at the CIA.

The Westin New York hotel in Times Square will soon be offering a $1,000 bagel smeared with over-the-top spreads and edible gold, according to the Associated Press.

The bagel itself will be provided by a company called New York Bagels, reports WNBC-TV, and each will come topped with Alba white truffle-infused cream cheese and goji berry-infused Riesling jelly. For an extra lavish touch, the bagels will also be sprinkled with edible gold leaf.

FIREBALL WHISKEY BAGELS ARE THINGS THAT EXIST

The white truffle cream cheese, however, might actually be the star of the show. According to the hotel, white truffle is the second most expensive food in the world after caviar, largely because the truffles are grown in a specific region of Italy, and only trained dogs and pigs can locate them, WNBC reports.

Oddly enough, this is actually the second time the hotel has made this $1,000 bagel available. According to a spokesperson for the Westin, the first appearance of this bagel, in 2007, was so popular that ""requests for this over-the-top bagel have come in yearly without fail.”

This year’s bagel, too, is more than an expensive treat — 100 percent of the proceeds generated from the sale of the breakfast item will go New York City’s Holy Apostle Soup Kitchen, the AP reports.

People commented that the image was causing them serious eye problems, but the fast-food chain doesn’t seem too concerned: After one user on Facebook wrote “[that] just messed up my eyes, thanks mcdonalds,” the restaurant cheekily responded with “#sorrynotsorry.”

Others seemed to love the tricky imagery, with a few people even noting that they planned to use this on their wedding invitations.

""The one constant was always, 'I want to see my girls grow up, and I want to walk them down the aisle,'"" said Cheryl Shelton.

With seven daughters, the family realized it was unlikely the U.S. Army veteran would be able to accomplish that, so they came up with a plan to make his dream a reality.

With last minute help from hospice; David's Bridal; Taylor Elchert Photography in Tiffin, Ohio; a local hair studio, and others, the plan came together in just days.

""We had this idea we put together in three days. We got all the wedding gowns for the girls and hospice helped us out a great deal with some of the planning,"" said Cheryl.

""What girl doesn't want to get in a wedding dress and her hair and makeup done? So I was all in but more so for the reasoning behind it,"" said Candice Talbot.

The plan was kept a secret from Willie who was asked only to give away Emily Flinn, the only one of his daughters who was already married, so she could renew her vows.

""We got maried at a courthouse so there wasn't the formality to it where he could actually give me away,"" said Flinn.

""He had no clue that this was going on and everybody got dressed, so I said, 'she is going to have all the girls be the bridesmaids and everything for her;' little did he know that they were all going to be brides,"" said Cheryl.

""Actually, it was my sister, Candice, that texted me and said, 'hey, you need to pick out a wedding dress and give me your measurements because we are going to pick one out for you; you are going to walk down the aisle on Saturday,"" said Jennifer Talbot.

Three days later, with Willie in his dress uniform in a backyard ceremony, each of his daughters came out of the house, one at a time, all in wedding gowns.

""He looked a little confused , and then it was just great to see everybody,"" said Flinn.

""This was very touching for him and it was a dream that we could fulfill to the best or the closest we could possibly do,"" said Cheryl.

In a father-daughter ceremony performed by Millersburg Christian Church Pastor Wes McElravy, the girls got to see the gleam in their father's eye they would expect to see at their actual wedding.

And Willie was helped out of his wheelchair to stand with his daughters and experience his greatest wish.

""I always assumed that my dad would be there to walk me down the aisle and when the possibility was there that he wasn't going to be able to -- this was everything,"" said Lindsey Shelton.

Less than two weeks after the ceremony, on Monday, October 16, Willie Shelton passed away.

The girls will each now also have something of their own to keep for their actual weddings.

All seven will have a locket in which they will have a photo of their father with them in a wedding dress, and the words, ""a father's love never ends,"" engraved on the back.

""Even though part of the dream was fulfilled last week, when they get married, the rest of it will be because he will still be with them,"" said Cheryl.

Through their loss, the family says it is only fitting that they honor the life and the memory of Willie.

""He was the happiest person, the most giving person, and this was our chance to give him something,"" said Jennifer.​

Researchers found that only one of them was predictive of higher flu antibodies four weeks after the flu shot.

“Your immune system will be stronger, and that can be helpful on the day you get your flu shot.”This article first appeared on Prevention Magazine.","Unfortunately, getting a flu shot doesn’t absolutely guarantee that you’ll sail through flu season unaffected, or even that you’ll be safe from the specific flu strains contained in the shot. But there is one factor that might give you better odds: your mood.

A recent study recruited 138 adults aged 65 to 85, collecting data for two weeks before a flu shot about food and drink consumption, physical activity, stress levels, sleep, and having a positive or negative outlook. For a month after the shot, participants continued to track all of these factors.

Researchers found that only one of them was predictive of higher flu antibodies four weeks after the flu shot. They write in the study, “We found that greater positive mood, whether measured repeated over a 6-week period around vaccination, or on the day of vaccination, significantly predicted greater antibody responses to influenza vaccination.”

Previous studies have noted that chronic stress can negatively affect the immune response to vaccines, but this is the first one to look at whether lack of stress can have a positive impact, says Lisa Christian, PhD, at the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

Having a sunnier outlook on life doesn’t just make you less likely to get the flu, either. Christian says research suggests that those with consistently low stress levels also have better health behaviors overall—they tend to exercise more, eat healthier foods, and sleep more soundly than their less-joyful peers.

“What we see is that the longer you maintain a positive mood, the better your health outcomes tend to be,” she says. “So, if you have that positivity for at least a few weeks before your flu shot, for example, you’ll likely be in a better position for that vaccine to work effectively.”

This is especially important for seniors, she adds, since those over age 65 tend to have a poorer response to flu shots than kids, teens, or younger adults.

Don’t have weeks to turn your mood around? Even having a short-term feeling of uplift can be helpful, adds Loretta Graziano Breuning, PhD, author of Habits of a Happy Brain. That’s because a positive mood can decrease levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with the stressful “fight or flight” response.

When cortisol is high, she says, the body shuts down or depresses systems that aren’t necessary in an emergency, and that includes the immune system. But when that hormone decreases, others surge—such as dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin—that support a healthy immune system.

“Even in the short term, this can have a beneficial effect,” says Breuning. “Your immune system will be stronger, and that can be helpful on the day you get your flu shot.”

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Spain had given Puigdemont two deadlines – which have come and gone – on whether the independence referendum is serious.","The Spanish central government moved Saturday to invoke a never-before used constitutional article that would strip Catalonia of its autonomous power, calling it a last resort to ""restore order.""

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he wants his Senate to give him direct power to dissolve the regional Catalan government and to call an early election as soon as possible. The Senate is likely to approve Rajoy's request.

Rajoy’s Cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution.

Rajoy proposed the powers of Catalan officials be taken over by central government ministers.

The meeting came almost three weeks after a controversial referendum seeking the region’s independence which was ruled illegal by the country’s Supreme Court.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has argued the referendum result gave him the mandate to move forward with independence.

What is Catalonia?

Located in the northeast region of Spain, Catalonia is largely independent with its own culture and language. It’s one of the richest and most industrialized areas of the country with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, according to the BBC.

The region, which includes Barcelona, is home to about 7.5 million people.

Valuing its autonomy, Catalonia has its own parliament and executive, called “Generalitat” in its language.

""What's being contested between Spain and Catalonia ... is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.""

Why do they want independence?

Because of its own cultural identity, those in favor of Catalan independence have pushed for the region to become separate from Spain. Supporters also believe that they have given more to the Spanish government than they have gotten back.

The push for independence “raises questions of the future of democracy and democratic rule,” Pamela Radcliff, a University of California, San Diego professor and modern Spain historian, told Fox News. “What’s being contested between Spain and Catalonia, one of the things is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.”

TOP EU OFFICIALS RALLY BEHIND SPANISH PM OVER CATALAN POLL

The push for independence is led by Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1.

How did the vote go?

About 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who cast votes chose independence, Catalan officials said of the disputed referendum. However, fewer than half of eligible voters participated.

About 900 people were treated for injuries after voting turned violent when Catalan civilians and Spanish police clashed earlier this month.

Andrew Dowling, an expert in Catalan history at Cardiff University in Wales, said that any independence declaration by the Catalan parliament would be symbolic without border and institutional control and no international support.

Such a declaration ""will see the fracture between hardliners and the pragmatic people in Catalonia who are already seeing an economic fallout,"" Dowling told The Associated Press.

What has been Spain’s response?

Spain's top court declared the independence referendum illegal.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria accused Puigdemont of putting the Catalan people “in the greatest level of uncertainty seen yet.”

And Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the referendum was part of a strategy “to impose independence that few want and is good for nobody.”

CATALONIA VOTERS PROTEST AGAINST VIOLENT POLICE TACTICS AFTER INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Rajoy has reportedly refused help from outside civil-society groups and lawyers to mediate negotiations between the two factions. He has also declined to engage in talks with Catalan leaders.

“There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience and unlawfulness,” Rajoy said.

Spain had given Puigdemont two deadlines – which have come and gone – on whether the independence referendum is serious.

Radcliff said that “it’s very possible” that neither side has “much incentive to compromise.”

What is Article 155?

Spain has threatened to invoke a clause of its constitution should Catalonia forge ahead with its plans to secede from the country that would take away the region’s autonomy.

A refusal to backtrack from its independence threats would trigger Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the government has said, which would allow central authorities to take over control of any of the country’s 17 regions. It’s a provision that hasn’t been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in the European nation.

An English translation of the constitution states that should an autonomous community break the law or disregard the constitution, the Spanish government can – after following certain procedures – “take the measures necessary in order to compel the [community] forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect [Spain’s] general interests.”

Rajoy's cabinet met in a special meeting Saturday morning to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155.

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.
