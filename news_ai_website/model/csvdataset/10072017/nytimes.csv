Tricky Clues

37A: This is one of those clues that was probably a no-brainer for some of you, but I went down the catwalk looking for an answer to “Prep for the runway, maybe.” We’re dealing with airliners, not fashion lines, and the answer is a crossword stalwart, DEICE.

51A: Religious references always bounce off my unschooled mind, but I find Pope Francis’ personality fascinating and when I saw this quote — “when one goes against one’s conscience” — I assumed that he meant guilt, which didn’t fit. This was also probably not a universally difficult clue, but it was a thought-provoking one for me. He’s referring to SIN, something I’ve always thought of as an absolute, objective rather than subjective or personal.

72A: “Cause of insomnia, maybe” just had to be guilt. Why did I fixate on this particular sensation while doing this puzzle? Worry, stress, self-doubt, a strong urge to begin a move to Scandinavia at 3 a.m. — there are many things that can keep one up at night. Including, I guess, a DRIP — be it a slow leak or someone who just won’t stop talking.

138A: An example of how precise cluing can be, “We should avoid doing that” led me to snap in BAD IDEA when I was first circling the grid. I realized my mistake soon thereafter — it’s LETS NOT — but I probably could’ve avoided the error by reading more closely. Also, what word was I thinking of at 112D to end in B? Not using my noggin.

46D: This term for a “ratcheting wheel mechanism,” PAWL, was a completely new word to me. It wasn’t a blocker for anything so I just let it fill itself in with crosses at the end of solving. This used to happen to me all the time when I started doing puzzles 350 years ago, but these days it’s a novelty to discover a common word like this. It’s also used in the puzzle, though rarely.

This is the sweetgum tree, which you might encounter daily if you’re in between New York City and Florida on the East Coast. I took my dog to the emergency room twice in one month thinking she had broken her ankle when in fact a prickly little sweetgum ball had gotten lodged in between her pawpads. Just like Androcles and the lion, just more neurotic and less swashbuckling.

But do the results prove that individual investors are pleased with the way corporations are managing governance matters?
They contend that for individual investors, the proxy voting system is onerous, frustrating and broken.
A result, they say, is that annual vote tallies represent only a small portion of individual investors’ shares and views.
“Institutions vote at very high rates,” said Chuck Callan, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Broadridge, in an interview.","The same split between institutions and individuals also emerged on the topic of questionable executive pay practices. At the 32 companies whose pay programs failed to win majority support from shareholders this year, individual investors were twice as likely as institutions to vote in favor of that compensation. Some 66 percent of individuals’ shares were cast in support of companies whose pay plans failed to win majority approval, compared with 32 percent of institutions’ shares.

To a great degree, these figures reflect the fact that institutions hold the overwhelming portion of company shares — 70 percent to individuals’ 30 percent, Broadridge data shows.

But do the results prove that individual investors are pleased with the way corporations are managing governance matters? While executives might want to believe this, it’s probably not the case, according to experts who study shareholder voting. They contend that for individual investors, the proxy voting system is onerous, frustrating and broken. A result, they say, is that annual vote tallies represent only a small portion of individual investors’ shares and views.

Voting is just too hard for retail investors, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and co-director of its Institute for Law and Economics. “It’s not surprising that they often give up,” she added. “As a result, there’s a group of investors that corporate managers aren’t hearing from consistently.”

The Broadridge-PricewaterhouseCoopers study bears this out. It found that 91 percent of the shares owned by institutional investors — but only 29 percent of those held by individuals — were voted during the most recent proxy season on director elections and shareholder proposals covering the full array of governance issues.

The main reason for this divergence is that institutions are generally required to vote their shares as part of their fiduciary duty to the investors or pension beneficiaries whose money they oversee. “Institutions vote at very high rates,” said Chuck Callan, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Broadridge, in an interview. “Retail shareholders are not required to vote by law or regulation. Typically, the understanding has been that if these shareholders have a problem with a company, they vote with their feet.” In other words, they sell their shares.

But if you examine the results of almost any annual shareholder meeting, it also becomes clear that throngs of individual investors were absent this year in voting on directors and other governance issues.

Most individuals keep their shares at their brokerage firms, but the brokers cannot vote them on the clients’ behalf. Instead, the investors have to cast their votes by mail, on the phone or online. Those who fail to do so are categorized as broker nonvotes in regulatory filings.

Even at troubled companies, this inertia can be widespread and surprising. At Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in April, for example, when the company came under pressure for its questionable sales practices, roughly four billion shares were voted in the director elections. Broker nonvotes on those elections totaled almost 500 million shares.

Institutional investors, meanwhile, have it easier when they vote their shares. They can take advantage of technological advancements in voting platforms that allow them to leave standing instructions on how they want their votes cast on particular proposals.

“Because they have such a huge work flow, institutions will flag certain types of proposals and will develop guidelines on how they want to vote on them,” Mr. Callan said. “Platforms for institutions integrate all that.”

Ms. Fisch, the law professor, asked why a similar process couldn’t be set up for individual investors. In a coming article in the Minnesota Law Review, she argued that low individual investor turnout is a result of an antiquated voting system. In the article, “Standing Voting Instructions: Empowering the Excluded Retail Investor,” she contended that “current regulatory restrictions impede market-based innovation” that could allow individual investors’ voices to be heard.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has weighed in on this problem recently. Acknowledging that the low level of voting by individual investors is a concern, it sponsored a roundtable on proxy voting in 2015. A major agenda item was how to increase individual investor participation.

But proposals for a system that would allow individuals to leave standing instructions for the voting of their shares have gone nowhere. As Ms. Fisch noted, the commission has voiced concerns that such a system would require investors to make voting decisions before they had received proxy materials “containing the disclosures mandated under the federal securities laws and possibly without consideration of the specific issues to be voted upon.” The agency also warned that the availability of standing voting instructions might mean investors would not bother to read the proxy statement.

Still, regulations have gotten in the way of what might be the natural market development of tools to encourage individual investor voting, Ms. Fisch said. “When the voting platforms and proxy advisers work with institutional investors, they provide tools for categorizing issues and proposals to accommodate investor voting preferences even though the issues might differ a little,” she added. “I would envision a platform being able to provide retail investors that same sort of functionality.”

Ms. Fisch and others are convinced that individual investors are interested in the makeup of corporate boards, executive pay and other governance matters. Given that technology can lower the hurdles these shareholders face in expressing their views, it seems unfair to ignore it.",Small Investors Support the Boards.

At the time of the protest, Ms. Alghanem was 34, with a high school degree, a husband, four children and a job at an elementary school.

“I didn’t have anything interesting in my life,” she recalled.

At the time, Saudi women were severely restricted. The culture was highly patriarchal, and clerics, thanks to their alliance with the royal family, had tremendous power to defend the kingdom against what they considered to be corrupting influences.

Much of that meant controlling women, and they saw the driving ban as necessary to prevent adultery and other social ills.

“Allowing women to drive contributes to the downfall of the society,” the kingdom’s top cleric at the time wrote in a fatwa that was removed recently from a government website. “This is well known.”

Women who chafed under the ban saw an opportunity when Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi strongman, invaded Kuwait in 1990. American forces flooded the kingdom, including American servicewomen who drove military vehicles. Kuwaiti women who had fled the invasion also drove.

Ms. Alghanem took note.

“I saw that we as Saudi women were powerless,” she said.

She invited other women to her home to discuss the issue, and they later decided to take action. They sent a letter to Salman — at the time the governor of Riyadh Province — telling him that they planned to drive.

They never heard back, they said, so on Nov. 6, 1990, they met near a supermarket in Riyadh, piled into 14 cars piloted by women with valid foreign licenses and drove around town.

They were social outliers, backed by no political party, and other Saudi women did not rush to join them. Many came from affluent families and had studied abroad. They included teachers, professors, a social worker, a photographer and a dentist.

Most were married with children; at least two were pregnant. One woman joined late, with her two daughters, one of whom was breast-feeding. Some had defied their male relatives to show up. Supportive husbands and brothers dropped off others at the meeting place.

Word spread, and the women were stopped by both the traffic police and the religious police, some of whom furiously banged on the cars.

“‘I want to dig a hole to bury you all!’” Fawziah al-Bakr, an education professor, recalled one man shouting at her. “They were thinking that we were going to destroy this country.”

They were taken to the police station and released around dawn, after they and their male relatives signed pledges that the women would not drive again.","Once Shunned as ‘Drivers,’ Saudi Women Who Fought Ban Now Celebrate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-driving-ban.html

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Do you ever feel your jaw immediately hit the ground the moment you look at a grid for the first time? Well, that was certainly the case for me today. Joe Krozel has been known to create some inventive puzzles in the past, and this one was no exception.

There’s a black square pattern resembling an animal in the grid’s center, and yet, the triple-stacked, nine-letter answers in the top-left corner make it appear to be themeless. And those orphaned five letters at 35A? What exactly is going on?

Today’s Theme

Turns out that Mr. Krozel wants us to put on our blindfolds to understand this theme. The revealer, 44D, indicates that the figure in the center is a PIÑATA. This also explains the black squares that connect to it; they represent the piñata’s thread.

Yet how are we supposed to nail 35A without any crossings to check? Take a look at the notepad accompanying the puzzle:

“Two letters of the alphabet are missing from the main, connected portion of the completed grid. What are they? The answer goes, appropriately, at 35-Across.”

A thorough scan of the grid conveys that every letter of the alphabet has been used at least once except for C and Y. Hold up. C. AND. Y. CANDY!

Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.
One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.
After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers.","“You have a commercial relationship with TWC via a TV deal so how can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?” Mr. Maerov asked in the email.

In a separate email, Mr. Maerov, who declined to comment on Saturday, said that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”

Bob Weinstein wrote Ms. Bloom a disapproving email on Friday morning, shortly before she appeared on “Good Morning America.” He pointed out that Democratic politicians were giving away money that Mr. Weinstein had donated to them, women’s rights organizations were calling for him to be fired and actors and actresses were openly stating how appalled they were. “It is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel,” he wrote. “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”

Bob Weinstein declined to comment on Saturday.

The details about the emails came to light one day after a third of the all-male board of the Weinstein Company resigned. The remaining board members announced on Friday that they had hired an outside law firm to investigate the allegations and that Mr. Weinstein would take an indefinite leave of absence.

“I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Bloom said on Twitter on Saturday morning. “My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”

Ms. Bloom said on Saturday that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the press. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.

“A conflict is representing two different sides in the same case,” she said. “This is a difficult time for all involved and I wish everyone the best.”

But he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.

The allegations of harassment against Mr. Weinstein reach back decades. Women accused him of requesting massages, appearing naked in front of them and asking if they wanted to watch him shower, among other behaviors. The Times investigation found that Mr. Weinstein had settled with at least eight women over the years.

Mr. Weinstein apologized for his behavior and acknowledged that it had “caused a lot of pain.” But he denied many of the allegations and said he intended to sue The Times for failing to give him enough time to respond to them.

Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that Mr. Weinstein had had two days to respond before the article was published, and that his full statement had been included. “Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story,” she said. “They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story.”

In a statement on Friday, four of the Weinstein Company’s remaining board members said that Mr. Weinstein’s leave of absence would begin immediately. The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”

Ms. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on “Good Morning America” that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.

“It’s gross, yeah,” Ms. Bloom said. “I’m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, ‘I have caused a lot of pain.’”

She had previously described Mr. Weinstein as “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”

Ms. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.

“Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,” Ms. Allred said. “While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.”

This year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.

After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.

“I can’t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,” she said, adding, “Authors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.”

President Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time,” adding, “I’m not at all surprised to see it.”","Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html

The question is whether Mr. Weinstein, as a liberal lion of Hollywood and prominent donor to Democratic politicians, will suffer the same consequences as those Fox News troglodytes Mr. Ailes and Mr. O’Reilly.

If past is prologue, perhaps not. As Camille Paglia noted in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, prominent feminists like Gloria Steinem didn’t waste any time discarding sexual harassment guidelines when it came to Bill Clinton’s sexual predations as president. Principle rapidly gave way to partisanship and political opportunism.

Mr. Weinstein clearly understands this calculus. In the wake of the Times report, he issued a cringe-inducing apology: “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then,” as if in the good olde days of the women’s liberation movement it was totally acceptable to ask a 20-something colleague to bathe you.

He promises “to do better” and “conquer my demons.” He misquotes Jay-Z. He says he has hired a team of therapists to “deal with the issue head on.”

But the real heart of his message was that he will be an even better progressive if given a second chance: “I’m going to need a place to channel that anger so I’ve decided I’m going to give the N.R.A. my full attention.” He’s also making a movie about Donald Trump.

And if the virtue-signaling isn’t enough, the man who has bankrolled Barbara Boxer, Charles Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand — the list goes on and on — is determined to pay out much more. “One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors” at the University of Southern California, he said, adding, “It will be named after my mom and I won’t disappoint her.” Perhaps, like Mitt Romney, he has “binders full of women” to fill those slots.

Several Democratic politicians, including Ms. Warren, have already announced that they are planning to donate Mr. Weinstein’s campaign contributions to charity. But some women seem prepared to go along, at least for a price. Take Lisa Bloom, the feminist superlawyer who represented many of Bill O’Reilly’s victims at Fox. “When women speak our truth the old world shatters,” she tweeted this year. “We slayed the dragon.”

But now Ms. Bloom is trying to train her own dragon: Harvey Weinstein. “I’ve asked Lisa Bloom to tutor me,” Mr. Weinstein writes in his letter. “I hope that my actions will speak louder than words and that one day we will all be able to earn their trust and sit down together with Lisa to learn more.”

It would be interesting to know how much earning Ms. Bloom expects to do with that learning. I’m guessing her tutoring doesn’t come cheap.

Mr. Weinstein knows the ways of Hollywood well enough that he might get away by acting out his part in this clichéd repentance script. Or, at 64, he may have played out his last cards. Either way, what’s telling is that Ms. Bloom and his other advisers seem to believe their best chance of salvaging their damaged client is, like the Catholic Church of yore, to pay for his sins in the coin of liberal affirmation. The behavioral issues will take time.

In her interview, Ms. Paglia noted that, in the case of Mr. Clinton, “Hypocrisy by partisan feminist leaders really destroyed feminism for a long time.” She might have added that it also helped Donald Trump get elected.

Harvey Weinstein Harassment Allegations

3. Weinstein’s statement about the ’60s and ’70s is correct, as far as it goes.

Such behavior was certainly considered rude, even caddish and the decent men I knew wouldn’t do it.

However, it was not then considered sexual harassment; it certainly was not regarded as anything that you could lose your job over, or be prosecuted over. It was widely regarded as a matter of internal restraint on the man’s part and a matter of lack of internal restraint on the part of the occasional woman who would slap a man in the face.

That said, that was then, this is now. And it’s been “now” for a couple decades. It’s long past time for Harvey to have gotten with The Program. He certainly should know that the ’60s and ’70s aren’t going to excuse anything now.

— Wine Country Dude in Napa Valley, reacting to an investigation by The New York Times that found previously undisclosed allegations of sexual harassment by the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.

4. That’s the trick to getting away with it, you pick out the most vulnerable, the ones who have the most to lose. Others you treat well so you always have cover. It still goes on and not just in Hollywood. Success rules. Quiet settlements and life goes on. Thankfully, the rules are changing.

9. Most Spaniards are not against freedom of independence if they wish so. But we will not tolerate to have our rights taken away from us. We have a constitution. If it needs to be amended, let’s do it from the parliament.

Catalan parties have been present in the parliament since its inception, have been willing part on governments from both sides of the aisle and have been an integral part on the stability of the country.

Ignoring the laws that govern us all and even their local constitution, just crosses a line no state is willing to accept or the country would simply disappear in utter chaos.

Lin-Manuel Miranda, ‘Almost Like Praying’

Most of the lyrics to “Almost Like Praying,” the benefit single for Puerto Rican hurricane relief organized by Lin-Manuel Miranda , are the names of towns in Puerto Rico, passionately sung and rapped by a multigenerational assembly of 20 American and Latin-American musicians including Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Rubén Blades, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Ednita Nazario, Fat Joe and Rita Moreno. The music is multigenerational, too, bridging reggaeton, salsa and Broadway, with Mr. Miranda singing lines from the “West Side Story” song named, like the hurricane, “Maria.” JON PARELES

Kehlani, ‘Honey’

“Honey” is a quietly lilting acoustic number from Kehlani, a singer who’s thrived in more processed, 1990s-referencing environments. But here she’s calm and grounded — in her singing at least. The lyrics tell a different story: “I’m a beautiful wreck/A colorful mess, but I’m funny/Oh, I’m a heartbreak vet.” JON CARAMANICA

Big K.R.I.T., ‘Keep the Devil Off (Take 1)’

The kinship between rapping, preaching and the shouts of soul and gospel singers has always been clear, but it’s rarely so upfront as it is in “Keep the Devil Off (Take 1)” by Big K.R.I.T., the longtime Mississippi rapper who has recorded his share of both high-living boasts and pointed social commentary . “Keep the Devil Off (Take 1),” produced by Big K.R.I.T., is from an album due Oct. 27, “4EVA Is a Mighty Long Time.” The song rides a sweaty funk-gospel groove revved up by jabbing, swooping organ chords, a wah-wah guitar and fervent women’s call-and-response vocals. Big K.R.I.T., hortatory and percussive, exults in his rise “from the bottom of the map to the top of the mountain,” while he warns, “What good those riches if you’re six feet under?” J.P.

The Breeders, ‘Wait in the Car’

“Wait in the car!” Kim Deal snarls on the Breeders’ first song in 24 years to feature all four members of the lineup that played on its 1993 breakout album, “Last Splash.” “I got business.” The bassist Josephine Wiggs and the drummer Jim Macpherson returned to the fold with Ms. Deal and her sister Kelley for a “Last Splash” anniversary tour and spun the reunion into new music (7-inch records will be available on the band’s fall tour). It sounds less like the spacier explorations of the Deals’ 2008 album “Mountain Battles” and more like the crispy rock of the band’s 1990 debut, “Pod.” Bonus points for including the lyric “Μeοw meow meow meow meow.” CARYN GANZ

Bermuda Triangle, ‘Suzanne’

Brittany Howard, a vocal powerhouse in Alabama Shakes, eases off in “Suzanne” with her latest project Bermuda Triangle, a trio with Becca Mancari and Jesse Lafser. It’s a lament about a frustrating triangle: “You love Suzanne and I love you,” Ms. Howard observes. “She don’t want you but I do/She makes us lonely together.” It starts like a casual demo — a syncopated guitar and Ms. Howard’s breathiest croon, joined in the second verse by a drum machine and harmony vocals — but wanders into surprisingly murky territory before it’s over. J.P.

Charlie Puth, ‘How Long’

The unraveling of Charlie Puth continues anon. The once tightly controlled pop-soul singer is maturing with a robust second act full of bruises. Following his sinister thumper “Attention” comes “How Long,” a sweet song that masks pulsing sadness at every turn. J.C.

Sarah Elizabeth Charles, ‘Zombie’

Ms. Charles, a young singer of full-throated poise, started writing the material for “Free of Form” in 2014, after the death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police. That album, out Friday and co-produced with the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah , is laden with introspection and calls to conscience, but rarely weighted down. With help from her backing trio, Scope, words of indignation and warning come wrapped in a hazy indeterminacy. Covering the Cranberries’ “Zombie,” she sounds the alarm on a dichotomy you’ll recognize: The fleeting scroll of brutal imagery and ideas that plays upon our minds can leave us feeling withdrawn — even disembodied. “When the violence causes silence/We must be mistaken,” she sings. On the soaring chorus, she funnels the philosophy down to a challenge: “What’s in your head/In your head, zombie?” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Jazmine Sullivan and Bryson Tiller, ‘Insecure’

There’s now a music video for “Insecure,” a duet about pathological jealousy that was first heard on Issa Rae ’s HBO series of the same name. Over a slow track full of silences, Jazmine Sullivan complains about being distrusted and relentlessly interrogated, singing, “I’m your lady not a slave.” Bryson Tiller responds, “Control freak? I tell you that’s better than no freak.” The video mostly promotes the show, but it also points up the syllabic rush of the verses, while the song suggests things won’t end happily: “I won’t take that no more,” Ms. Sullivan warns. J.P.

Schnellertollermeier, ‘Rights (Part 1)’

Here's a rapid, nervous Minimalist evolution, from quick staccato picking and percussion tapping, to the emergence of a guitar riff, to a full-band insistence on a stomping 7/4 riff. The trio of the guitarist Manuel Troller, the bassist Andi Schnellmann and the drummer David Meier have learned well from groups like the Necks , from Australia, and made music that's more methodical and ominous. In “Rights (Part 1),” after the riff takes over, there’s a wrenching key change, a swerve and pullback and a reminder of the opening, which seems to be eons in the past after all that pounding and blasting. J.P.

Anat Cohen Tentet, ‘Anat’s Doina’

Anat Cohen can easily get by on the sanguine grace of her clarinet playing, and the way her succinct and joyful compositions elevate it. But a new album, “Happy Song,” features a 10-piece band playing the wily arrangements of Oded Lev-Ari, a fellow Israeli jazz musician. He gives the music a different kind of depth and coagulation. On “Anat’s Doina,” a klezmer-inspired suite written by Ms. Cohen, the distant electric guitar, vibraphone and accordion evoke the chatter of an urban scene, and the resonance of a fable.

When the overall Republican vote share in the state is 50 percent or more, the authors of the paper show, the map behaves much like an unbiased one. But when the map is tested by an electorate that leans Democratic, its special features kick in, maintaining a healthy Republican majority against the popular headwind. To gain control of the State Assembly, the authors estimate, Wisconsin Democrats would have to beat Republicans by 8 to 10 points, a margin rarely achieved in statewide elections by either party in this evenly split state. As a mathematician, I’m impressed. As a Wisconsin voter, I feel a little ill.

Republican legislators argue that any Wisconsin map will look biased, because Democratic voters tend to congregate in big cities like Milwaukee and Madison. That packs the Democratic half of the state into a small cluster of districts. “Why are you gerrymandering yourselves?” they ask.

They’re partly right. The clustering of Democrats in cities does indeed give the Republicans an edge. But it’s a much smaller advantage than the turbo-boost the current map provides, as the Duke paper demonstrates. The main tool in the Duke paper is a method called the “Markov chain Monte Carlo” algorithm. Starting from the current Wisconsin district map, it makes a sequence of random changes, swapping wards from one district to an adjacent one, carrying out a “random walk” through the set of all possible maps. Completely unconstrained changes would create crazy-looking districts, so it weights its changes in favor of traditional districting criteria.

Few if any of these maps provide the Republicans the firewall against a Democratic electorate that the Wisconsin district map does. In other words, the map is an “outlier” — so far outside the ordinary run of things that it can’t be mistaken for a map without partisan purpose. It’s an outlier in another way, too: Research by the political scientist Jowei Chen suggests that the Wisconsin district map does much worse on traditional districting criteria than neutral maps do, despite the Wisconsin Constitution’s requirement that districts be “in as compact form as practicable.”

Outlier detection is a critical part of data analysis, and mathematicians have gotten really good at it by now. That’s the good news about advanced computation: You can use it to make electoral mischief, but you can also use it to detect and measure that mischief. It’s not math versus democracy; it’s math versus math, with democracy at stake.

If the Supreme Court sides with the three-judge panel that blocked the Wisconsin map, some liberals foresee an end to gerrymandering, while some conservatives imagine a districting process that is the purview of legislatures being completely usurped by the courts. Both sides of Gill v. Whitford agree: This is a momentous case with major implications for American democracy.

But what if it’s not? The panel’s standards for determining impermissible gerrymandering are hard to meet except in the most egregious cases. Judges empowered by an anti-gerrymandering precedent from the Supreme Court will blunt the worst cases, but won’t end gerrymandering. There will be many cases, maybe most of them, where it’s impossible, no matter how much math you do, to tell the difference between innocuous decision making and a scheme — like Wisconsin’s — designed to protect one party from voters who might prefer the other.",How Computers Turned Gerrymandering Into a Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/sunday/computers-gerrymandering-wisconsin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

On Friday, three members of the board — Marc Lasry, Dirk Ziff and Tim Sarnoff — resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. In a statement, Bob Weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from Debevoise & Plimpton, including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes, would lead an investigation into Harvey Weinstein’s behavior.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the board’s independent investigation and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”

The Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped to activate the indie-film boom with “Sex, Lies and Videotape.” They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like “Inglourious Basterds.”

Lately they have hit a dry spell. Although they have a fast-growing television division, the Weinsteins have not had a mainstream hit at the North American box office since 2013, when “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” took in $116.6 million.

So far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner “The King’s Speech,” has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been “Wind River,” a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.

To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.

The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.

At the same time, a new cluster of independent movie companies — some better financed and with more contemporary sensibilities — arrived on the scene. They include A24, which released the reigning Oscar winner for best picture, “Moonlight,” and Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures, which has emerged as a favorite home for the kind of rebel filmmakers that Mr. Weinstein used to have to himself.

Ms. Ellison, whose films include “American Hustle” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” has been one of the few Hollywood executives willing to comment about the accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “Women face serious repercussions for sharing their experiences and deserve our full support,” she wrote on Twitter on Thursday, with a link to The Times report. “I admire the courage of these women.”

Mr. Weinstein acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that his behavior had “caused a lot of pain” and vowed to “do better.” On Friday, a lawyer advising him, Lisa Bloom, said in a television appearance that he had acted inappropriately and agreed with an interviewer who characterized Mr. Weinstein’s reported actions as illegal. And on Saturday, Ms. Bloom said that she had resigned as an adviser to Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein’s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like “Shakespeare in Love” to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, “Lion,” to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when “The Artist” collected five awards, including best picture.)

In this year’s Oscars cycle, the company’s big hopes are “Wind River” and “The Current War,” a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month’s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.

Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein’s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.

As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum’s “Project Runway.” That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.

Series in development include a crime drama for Amazon starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore and created by the director of “Silver Linings Playbook,” David O. Russell. The Weinstein Company is also working with Oliver Stone on a series for Showtime called “Guantánamo.” It has three major projects with the Viacom-owned Paramount Network, including “Yellowstone,” a drama starring Kevin Costner and written by Taylor Sheridan, the writer-director behind “Wind River.”

Amazon, Showtime, A&E, and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.

One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.","Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/media/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harrassment.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As a physician who graduated from a domestic medical school, I’ve often heard others disparaging doctors who went to medical school outside the country as if they were inferior. Those complaints are not supported by data. A study from Health Affairs in 2010 found that patients with congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction had lower mortality rates when treated by doctors who were foreign medical graduates. Another from earlier this year in the BMJ found that older patients who were treated by foreign medical graduates had lower mortality as well, even though they seemed to be sicker in general.

A recent study in Annals of Internal Medicine shows that these graduates are also responsible for a significant amount of teaching. Of the 80,000 or so academic physicians in the country, more than 18 percent were foreign medical graduates. More than 15 percent of full professors in medical schools in the United States were educated elsewhere, most often in Asia, Western Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Foreign medical graduates also do a lot of research. Although they are ineligible for some National Institutes of Health funding — which is granted only to citizens of this country — they still manage, through collaboration, to be primary investigators on 12.5 percent of grants. They led more than 18 percent of clinical trials in the United States and were responsible for about 18 percent of publications in the medical literature.

“Our findings suggest that, by some metrics, these doctors account for almost one fifth of academic scholarship in the United States,” said the lead author of the study, Dhruv Khullar, who is a physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a researcher at Weill Cornell and a contributor to The Upshot. “The diversity of American medicine — and the conversations, ideas and breakthroughs this diversity sparks — may be one reason for our competitiveness as a global leader in biomedical research and innovation.”

The United States is not the only country that relies on doctors trained or educated in other countries. We’re not even the country with the highest percentage of such physicians. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, almost 58 percent of physicians practicing in Israel are foreign medical graduates. About 40 percent of the doctors in New Zealand and Ireland were trained outside those countries.

Because of the sizes of those nations, even though the percentages of foreign medical graduates are higher there, the total numbers aren’t as high as in the United States. In 2015, the O.E.C.D. estimated that the United States had more than 213,000 foreign-trained doctors, and no other country was close. Britain had about 48,000, Germany had about 35,000, and Australia, France and Canada had between 22,000 and 27,000.

For years, I’ve listened to doctors tell me stories of physicians who leave Canada — because they were dissatisfied about working in a single-payer health care system. That might have been true decades ago. But in the last 10 years, that number has dropped precipitously. The number of Canadians returning to their country to practice may actually be higher than the number leaving.

Although many feared that coverage expansions from the Affordable Care Act might lead to an overwhelmed physician work force, that didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean that America doesn’t have a shortage of physician services, especially when it comes to the care of the oldest, the poorest and the most geographically isolated among us. Even though we know foreign medical graduates care for those patients disproportionately, we make it very difficult for many born and trained elsewhere to practice here. Some Americans need these doctors desperately. Evidence suggests that policies should be made to attract them, not deter them.",Why America Needs Foreign Medical Graduates,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/upshot/america-is-surprisingly-reliant-on-foreign-medical-graduates.html

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

11A: Do you get confused as to whether the idiom is “TOE the line” or “tow the line”? A good way to remember that is to visualize a track event where athletes are required to put their toes on the starting line.

Belarus produces top-level technical talent, an inheritance from its Soviet past, said Arkady M. Dobkin, who immigrated to the United States in the 1990s and established a software company there.

Today, Mr. Dobkin is the chief executive of EPAM, which does programing for the world’s leading tech companies and is considered one of the fastest-growing public tech companies in the world.

EPAM’s headquarters is in Newtown, Pa., but its main development hub is in Minsk, where more than 6,000 of its technology specialists work.

“I think it was the absence of oil that made Belarus do this,” said Mr. Dobkin, 57. “Here, universities produce more highly qualified specialists than the internal market needs.”

Many locals say the government’s talk about growing as a tech hub is a comfortable distraction in a country that heavily depends on Russia for cut-rate fuel and political patronage.

Sergei Chaly, an outspoken economist and former government official, calls Belarus “a dying country with bitcoins.”

巴黎——残破的滴水嘴兽和掉落的栏杆柱被塑料管和木板替代。飞扶壁因污染变暗，受雨水腐蚀。小尖塔要靠梁支撑，并用绑带做了固定。

对于每年前往巴黎圣母院那几百万瞠目结舌的游客来说，这些颓丧的迹象并不明显，很多人忙着赞叹精雕细琢的外表，没有注意它的破损与斑驳。

For better or worse, the star-centric Warhol turned out to be the modern artist who got the future right.

Photo

Some of his observations in Mr. Roth’s script, largely culled from 80 hours of recorded conversations between its two characters (who both died in the 1980s), are so presciently on-target they leave you reeling. Listen, for example, to an aside Warhol delivers about his ever-trusty cassette recorder.

Everybody he came in contact with, he says, wound up performing for the tape. “You couldn’t tell which problems were real,” he said, “and which problems were exaggerated. Better yet, the people telling you the problems couldn’t decide anymore if they were really having the problems or just performing.”

Did you hear that, Kardashians and Real Housewives of everywhere? Decades before you became TV stars by just being “yourself,” Warhol had predicted your future.

As might have been expected, “WARHOLCAPOTE” is filled with gleefully exchanged gossip. Some of it is merely lubricious; some of it verges on the profound. Capote recalls Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis telling him, “Because of an accident of history, I’ll always be an object of curiosity, like something you see in a freak show.”

That Warhol and Capote were kindred sideshow attractions may make you nostalgic for an era in which artists and writers were considered worthy of mass fascination. But Mr. Roth’s play, which doesn’t always disguise its cut-and-paste seams, turns out to be about how public freakishness leads its victims to the solace of anesthesia.

Capote found it in pills and liquor; Warhol, in a willed detachment that transformed emotional peaks and valleys into glazed, flatline curiosity. Both men turned their ways of battling anxiety into copiously documented public personas that would seem to be easy to imitate but are not.

Mr. Spinella, best known for his passionate, Tony-winning performances in the “Angels in America” plays, here has the harder task, finding the affect in Warhol’s affectlessness. And his owlish, little-boy-lost Andy only sporadically convinces. (In wig and spectacles, he reminded me more of the superstar book editor Robert Gottlieb.)

The more combustible Capote, who wore his psychodrama like a cascading pocket handkerchief, provides more obvious actorly substance. And Mr. Butler, who replaced Leslie Jordan late in rehearsals, has moments of raw, bleeding anguish that make you ache for the cyclone of self-destruction that his character became. Of course, as Warhol might have pointed out, this Capote is performing for a tape recorder.

The pain that courses through Ms. Friedman’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” which I saw in an earlier version at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London four years ago, is authentic enough to keep its audience bathed in tears. Never mind that Mr. Furth’s book — adapted from a 1934 play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart and a 16-performance flop on Broadway — remains a compendium of heartbreak-of-success clichés.

There’s a reason that these clichés — about shedding your integrity and identity on the road to stardom — have never been displaced: They still apply. The hard truth that celebrity, or the maintenance of it, tends to make its possessors more and more superficial is the reason that novels about the rich and famous so often feel flat. (I would argue that Jacqueline Susann, the author of celebrity potboilers like “Valley of the Dolls,” was as right in her way as Warhol was.)

Ms. Friedman, best known as a star of the London musical stage and a veteran interpreter of Sondheim, appreciates the depths of feeling to be dredged from such shallows. And she allows the layers of ambivalence in this exquisite score to color everything onstage.

In following the show’s chronologically reversed path of a successful film producer — from middle age in Hollywood to his idealistic youth in Manhattan — the production brings out the sharpness in the showbiz satire. (This aspect is wittily enhanced by Soutra Gilmour’s time-capsule sets and costumes and by Tim Jackson’s effortlessly integrated choreography.)

But what makes this “Merrily” transcendent is the conviction and nuance of the three performers at its center, who embody a friendship under siege. They include two happy holdovers from the London production: Mark Umbers, as Franklin Shepard, the charismatic composer who goes Hollywood, and Damian Humbley, as Charley Kringas, his longtime pal and collaborator.

New to the cast (although you wouldn’t know it) is Eden Espinosa as Mary, the alcoholic novelist in love with Frank. Supported by a fine-tuned ensemble, they are all close to flawless in navigating Mr. Sondheim’s intricate melody lines. More important, they use the splintered music to convey a fractious but blessed interconnectedness that makes their retrospective coming apart all the more poignant.

For the first time in my experience, Frank is the beating, shattered heart of the show. That’s partly a matter of how Ms. Friedman has ingeniously framed her production. But it’s also a consequence Mr. Umbers’s startlingly sympathetic performance of a (usually unsympathetic) man to whom fame happens.

“Who says lonely at the top?” Frank sings in the show’s opening Hollywood party scene. Mr. Umbers lends the lyric a polyurethane sheen. But the varnish doesn’t quite disguise the hopeful, bewildered young man he will become as his life — to borrow from F. Scott Fitzgerald, who knew from fame and disenchantment — is borne back ceaselessly into a reproachful past.","The Pain of Fame, With Sondheim, Warhol and Capote as Guides",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/theater/sondheim-warhol-and-capote-as-guides-to-fame.html

Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, have held on-again, off-again talks about a bipartisan plan to stabilize the insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, which have been roiled, in part, by the persistent uncertainty over the fate of the law.

Their negotiations were revived after the latest Republican repeal-and-replace bill, sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, collapsed because of a lack of votes.

An aide to Mr. Schumer said the timing of Mr. Trump’s call was particularly awkward, given that the administration had just announced rules to expand the right of employers to deny women coverage for contraception on religious grounds — a move widely condemned by Democrats.

The Trump administration, the aide said, needed to stop sabotaging the law before bipartisan negotiations could begin.

Mr. Trump has established an easy rapport with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he likes to call Mr. Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, and Ms. Pelosi, of California. The three bonded last month over a dinner of honey sesame crispy beef in the White House, and their discussions have gone beyond the fiscal deal and how to protect young immigrants brought to this country illegally from being deported.

They have prodded Mr. Trump to put aside the Republican credo of “repeal and replace” in favor of more modest tweaks to the existing law. They have urged him to preserve subsidies, known as cost-sharing reductions, paid to insurers under the health law to help low-income consumers pay for out-of-pocket health expenses like co-payments and deductibles.

But Mr. Schumer’s quick rebuff of Mr. Trump on Friday shows the limits of the partnership. The senator has said that much will depend on whether the president keeps his promise to protect the young undocumented immigrants who are beneficiaries of the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

“Whether he pivots or not will be one of the most fundamental questions of this administration,” Mr. Schumer said recently. “It’s the $64,000 question. The only way it can happen is if we have a successful negotiation on DACA, and secondly whether we get health care.”

The president’s call is sure to further rankle Republicans, with whom Mr. Trump has had increasingly tense relations over their failure to knock down a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s legacy.

Mr. Trump’s latest move comes at a sensitive moment. The White House is working with Republicans on an ambitious plan to rewrite the tax code, perhaps the party’s last chance for a major legislative victory this year.

The president is also widely expected to decline to recertify the Iran nuclear agreement, a decision that would kick the matter to Congress, which would have to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and potentially blow up the deal negotiated by the Obama administration.

Mr. Trump’s tweet about his call to Mr. Schumer came during another busy weekend morning on social media for him. He railed against late-night talk show hosts and NBC News for what he said was their persistently negative and inaccurate coverage of him.

But he also praised The Washington Post — a frequent target of his “fake news” rants — for an article about how Mr. Trump’s fund-raising appeals to his political base have swelled the coffers of the Republican Party.

And in what has become an almost weekly ritual, Mr. Trump promised residents of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida that the federal government was mustering resources to deal with the next approaching hurricane, Nate. “Please listen to your local authorities & be safe!” he wrote.

In short, policing has become the most politicized job in Spain.

“The police is the same as the time of Franco, only they had horses back then,” said Carme Adzerias, a 58-year-old painter who was buying cigarettes in a tobacco shop across the street from the national Police Headquarters in Barcelona, where thousands protested on Wednesday.

The anger is a direct response to the actions of the national police in riot gear on Oct. 1. The government in Madrid sent the troops to defend the integrity of Spanish democracy, but the violence against peaceful residents had the effect of turning the story into one about the harsh crackdown on voting rights rather than the suppression of radical secessionists.

Television cameras and social media accounts showed officers stomping on voters with their boots, pounding them with truncheons and dragging them out of polling places. In contrast, the Mossos d’Esquadra, which was responsible for public order and had instructions to stop the vote and keep people out of polling stations, essentially stood down.

In the fallout, Catalonia’s police chief, Maj. Josep Lluís Trapero, appeared on Friday in the national court in Madrid to face accusations of sedition. He denied he had refused to assist the national police and blamed his force’s response on poor communication, according to a statement by the Mossos d’Esquadra, which only months ago was hailed across Spain for gunning down the suspect in a terrorist attack that killed 14 people in the Barcelona area.

In an interview with the newspaper El País published on Saturday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the region’s political leaders had “done a very serious harm to the prestige of Mossos d’Esquadra.”

A day earlier, Enric Millo, the Spanish government’s representative in Catalonia, apologized for any injuries suffered at the hands of the national police. The apology does not seem to have been accepted.

Angry residents have insulted the children of officers. Police forces brought in from across Spain found their hotels surrounded by angry residents who protested loudly and forced the officers, some of whom responded by spitting out the window, to find other accommodations apart from population centers.

The poisonous atmosphere has led national police officers to hole up behind thick walls and barbed wire in towns like this one, or to retreat to a cruise boat, incongruously plastered with cartoon images of Looney Tunes characters, moored in the auto terminal of the Barcelona port.

But the police say they are getting a raw deal, and one police union spokesman, Ramón Cossío, compared the persecution of officers to that of Jews in World War II. Others have complained that Madrid had abandoned them to harassment similar to that seen during the height of terrorism scares in the Basque region.

But mostly, national police leaders have expressed disgust with the Mossos d’Esquadra, accusing it of failing to do its job and of allowing an illegal vote. They talk about infiltration by radicals in the upper echelons of the Mossos d’Esquadra and roll their eyes at the booming popularity of what they call the “flower police” who, with local firefighters, at times protected pro-independence voters from the national police.

That softer, gentler approach of the Mossos d’Esquadra is a departure from its crackdowns during austerity protests years ago, for which the force received ample criticism.

In fact, some members of the Mossos d’Esquadra say that a united public front masks division within the force on the question of independence, one that echoes the deep split over independence throughout Catalonia. Members speaking on background because they were not authorized to comment said a feeling of impotence pervaded the unit.

National police leaders say their forces are far less politicized and fragmented, as they are simply enforcing Spanish law in Spain.

In the Police Headquarters next to an apartment building flying both Spanish and pro-independence flags, Luis Mansilla, a detective and the general secretary of the police union who has lived and worked in Catalonia for 25 years, said that supporters of independence had waged an effective campaign against the police on social media that had exaggerated the confrontations, violence and injuries. (Amnesty International this past week described the riot police as having used excessive force.)

As officers from across Spain sat in a room in the back of the headquarters, surrounded by videocassettes, a Parcheesi board and a photograph of King Felipe VI, who has accused Catalan leaders of “disloyalty,” Mr. Mansilla said hard-line supporters of independence were trying to turn the region against their countrymen.

“They say we are foreigners, or an occupational force, that we came to take something from them,” he said. “They hate us.”

In these conditions, he said, it was safer for national police officers to stay on the cruise ship with the Looney Tunes characters (“The Tweety boat,” he called it). But pressure is mounting as the officers wait, he added. “There is a tension under the calm surface,” he said. “Nobody knows what is going to happen.”

Deep behind multiple check points, stacked cargo containers and towering shipping cranes in the port of Barcelona, police officers jogged in a secure perimeter in fluorescent shirts and then returned to the ship guarded by the military police with machine guns and bulletproof vests. The cartoon characters were partly obscured with tarps after the yellow canary Tweety Pie became an unexpected symbol of secessionists, appearing on walls and T-shirts in Barcelona.

Mr. Puigdemont, the Catalan leader, has asked them to sail home, but police officials say they will stay until the situation is resolved, and some are looking forward to a sign of support during a pro-Spanish unity march on Sunday.

Even in Sant Boi de Llobregat, where flags for independence face the barracks and color the town, the national police have their supporters. Cipriano Salgado, 68, took a walk while waiting to visit an ear doctor. Speaking fondly of Franco’s dictatorship and lamenting the erosion of the rule of law, he looked toward the barracks.

The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

Diplomats and their underlings have brokered deals for weapons and drugs, and more mundane products like machine tools and cows. They have also smuggled liquor, cigarettes, luxury cars and anything else that can be imported duty free and then sold at a gain.

“My late father-in-law was an ambassador,” said Marcus Noland, who studies North Korea and is executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “and he told me that in India, years ago, it was known within the diplomatic corps that if you wanted to buy beef, you could knock on the backdoor of the North Korean embassy in Delhi. They ran an abattoir in the basement.”

Earning money is a necessity for the embassies — North Korea doesn’t fund them. Instead, they are expected to support themselves and send home any surplus.

Despite the sanctions it is under, North Korea did $6.5 billion in trade last year. Analysts estimate that embassy revenues represent a small sum compared with the country’s other low-profile foreign ventures.

Those included cadres of bodyguards leased to dictators who don’t trust their own citizens, laborers dispatched to work sites around the world who must remit their wages and state-owned companies that export ballistic missiles and other arms to countries like Syria.

In some cases, diplomats get involved with weapons deals. The third private secretary of the North Korean embassy in Beijing doubled as an employee of the Haegeumgang Trading Company. The company, according to a United Nations report, supplied surface-to-air missiles and radar systems to Mozambique. Haegeumgang also sold machine tools, and an ad in 2014 for those products on a Chinese website listed the company headquarters at the same address as the North Korean embassy in Beijing.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to faxed questions.

Diplomats for the country have been ad hoc entrepreneurs since at least 1976. That year, Norway’s police found through surveillance that every member of the North Korean embassy in Oslo was involved in the import and sale of as many as 10,000 bottles of spirits and 100,000 cigarettes.

Today, sanctions have forced many embassies to curb their ambitions, with some intent on keeping the lowest possible profile.

The North Korean embassy in London sits unobtrusively in Ealing, a suburb-like section of London, just another brick house in a row of them. The difference is a small sign, barely visible from outside the wrought iron fence: “Residence and office, embassy of D.P.R. Korea.”

Aside from black luxury sedans in the driveway, there are rarely signs of life in the building, even to neighbors.

“I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of there,” said Ali Wiseman, a student who lives in a group house two doors down. “And I’ve been here a year.”

His roommate, Rupert Thomson, has seen people there. “I once saw three women working on the lawn out front and they did everything to not look at me,” he said.

The way that the London embassy sustains itself is a mystery. One theory comes from Kim Joo-il, a former member of the North Korean military who defected and moved to London in 2007. He said he often saw embassy employees at a type of Sunday flea market called a car-boot sale.

“They are always there buying secondhand electronics, toys, dolls, kitchen goods,” Mr. Kim said through an interpreter, seated at a restaurant he owns in a London suburb. “Some of these things they are cleaning up and fixing to resell, others they are sending home to North Korea.”

North Korean embassies in the former eastern bloc, where the missions were long ago granted generous square footage, have a more lucrative stratagem.

In Poland, 40 businesses are listed at the address of the North Korean embassy in Warsaw, including a pharmaceutical company, several advertising agencies and a yacht club. How many of these businesses are actually staffed there is unclear.

In Sofia, the embassy owns a number of buildings on two separate properties. One is a complex that includes the embassy itself. Passers-by can pause at a glass display case — standard issue for embassies in the city — filled with photographs. One captures the Supreme Leader beaming at a crowd, others were of missiles that had just been launched.

The event space, known as Terra Residence, is a 15-minute walk east. It’s the former home of the North Korean ambassador, built in the 1980s with dazzle instead of comfort in mind. Photos on Terra’s promotional website show an interior that is essentially a communist take on Versailles — a series of huge and austere halls with chandeliers, gold curtains and paintings of ballerinas.

Terra rents out the space for magazine photo sessions, music videos and television ads, including a handful for national banks and one for the Bulgarian version of “Celebrity Apprentice.” Its main business is weddings, proms and corporate events.

Few attendees, it seems, realize they are spending the evening on North Korean property.

“I knew it was a former embassy building, but I had no idea it was owned by North Korea,” said Bilyana Dimitrova, who attended a friend’s wedding at Terra in September. “The atmosphere was very pleasant.”

A spokeswoman for Terra, Anelia Baklova, wrote in an email that the company has had a long-term lease with the embassy of North Korea that predates the imposition of economic sanctions. When the U.N. approved stricter sanctions, this year and last, Terra “froze” its payments, she said. The company has not been evicted, she wrote, because of the “considerable amount of money” it had spent on renovations and upkeep.

Emails to the embassy were not returned.

Some countries have succeeded in shutting down businesses that rent from North Korea. In May, Germany closed a youth hostel that was operating in what was originally North Korean diplomatic quarters.

The governments of Poland and Bulgaria have so far been unable to end the ancillary activities. A spokesman for the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had repeatedly raised the issue of renting out space with North Korean officials here, urging them to “use properties in Sofia solely for diplomatic and consular activities.”

Terra, unlike its landlord, has tried to become a more agreeable neighbor. People who live across the street say that notices are now taped on the doors of their apartment building a day before there will be fireworks, giving a heads up and promising that the show will end by 10 p.m.

Surprisingly, residents didn’t seem particularly vexed about living near an enterprise that has pumped money into the world’s most repressive and notorious regime. But that may say more about Bulgaria’s government than the dangers of North Korea.

An explosion at a gas station in the African nation of Ghana killed at least one person and injured several others, according to government officials and news reports.

Officials told local news outlets that a fire broke out at a gas station in the capital, Accra, and then spread to another station. Videos on social media showed giant balls of flames that set the night sky aglow.

Abu Ramadan, an official with the National Disaster Management Organization, told JoyNews late on Saturday that at least one person had been killed. He cautioned that emergency responders had not been able to access a convenience store at the gas station and said it was unclear whether anyone was inside.

He said 10 people had been injured in the chaos of people fleeing.

The deputy information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, said a “significant number of persons” were affected by the explosion and “a few” had died.

“There was some panic and we all just moved away from the scene,” George Agbey, who was near the explosion, told The Associated Press. “It was like refugees moving away from a war-torn zone.”

Firefighters were working to extinguish the blaze, which apparently engulfed at least one fuel tanker. By late Saturday, officials said the fire was about 95 percent contained and no longer posed a threat.

On Twitter, Accra city officials warned of an explosion in the Legon and Madina areas around 7:30 p.m. local time. Broadcast news reports showed scenes of destruction and some flames as onlookers milled about.

However the tastes and demand for electric vehicles evolve domestically, China may have the biggest influence in shaping the marketplace.","But the upstart automaker Tesla has proved the potential of electric vehicles to generate excitement, with its first mass-market offering, the Model 3 sedan, attracting $1,000 deposits from hundreds of thousands of potential buyers. (It is also showing the challenges of getting the technology to scale, announcing on Monday that it produced only 260 Model 3s in the third quarter, “less than anticipated due to production bottlenecks.”)

More than consumer demand, however, it is regulatory pressure that is revving up the electric push, with officials in China, Europe and the United States ratcheting up emissions standards and setting or discussing deadlines that could eliminate gasoline-powered cars within a generation.

The announcements by G.M. and Ford follow pledges by the German automakers Volkswagen and Daimler to build hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles in the coming years, and the decision by Volvo, the Chinese-owned Swedish luxury brand, to convert its entire lineup to either electric cars or hybrid vehicles that are powered by both batteries and gas.

The accelerated pace of development also reflects the symbiotic relationship between battery-powered cars and another technological frontier; auto companies are tying their electric-car plans to lofty goals of building fleets of autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.

The automakers believe they can solve the problem of achieving — as G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, has begun stressing — a world with “zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion.”

It is a stunning statement from a company that, together with Ford, sells more large pickup trucks and full-size sport utility vehicles than the rest of the global industry combined — and from an industry that grudgingly got into building electric vehicles in the face of stricter fuel emissions standards.

Just last month, during a visit to China, Ms. Barra cautioned against mandates in which the transition to electric vehicles outpaces consumer demand. “I think it works best when, instead of mandating, customers are choosing the technology that meets their needs,” she said.

On Monday, Mr. Reuss framed the company’s strategy as a natural outgrowth of what it had learned from its existing entry in the all-electric arena, the Chevrolet Bolt, even though it has achieved only negligible sales so far.

“There is a transition going on,” said Mr. Reuss, adding that G.M. has no timetable to eliminate gasoline engines from its vehicles. He said that by the 2023 target date for the new electric models, G.M. will still be building cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“They wisely gave no time frame because, frankly, no one knows how the future will evolve,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the research firm Autotrader.

For its part, Ford said it intended to accelerate its development of electric cars as part of a broader business strategy that will be laid out for Wall Street on Tuesday by its new chief executive, Jim Hackett. Mr. Hackett was installed in May after his predecessor, Mark Fields, failed to persuade investors and his board that the company was moving fast enough to develop the vehicles of the future, like battery-powered and self-driving cars.

Ford already fields several slow-selling hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in models, and has said it also plans to add hybrid versions of its big sports-utility vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, as it expands its electric offerings.

The company has formed a group it calls Team Edison to focus on pure battery-electric cars, said Sherif Marakby, Ford’s vice president for autonomous vehicles and electrification.

By 2020, Ford plans to produce an electric car that can go 300 miles before needing to recharge, Mr. Marakby said. “That’s a big change,” he said, compared with the early electric models that could go fewer than 100 miles, a limitation that made them impractical for many consumers.

However the tastes and demand for electric vehicles evolve domestically, China may have the biggest influence in shaping the marketplace. Sales of electric vehicles, or E.V.s, are already in the hundreds of thousands there and could exceed 400,000 by 2019, representing two-fifths of the world market, according to LMC Automotive, a global consulting company.

“China is a huge part of the story in E.V.s, and it is a big factor in the decision making of the automakers,” said Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner who tracks auto-industry technology. “China’s move toward higher emissions standards and the E.V. mandates gives the big global automakers certainty that they are going to have a significant market for these cars and they can know these investments will be worth it.”

Reflecting the importance of the Chinese market, Ms. Barra, the G.M. chief, visited Shanghai last month as the company announced that it would roll out at least 10 all-electric or hybrid models in China between 2016 and 2020, including those already in the market.

Just a few days earlier, China had joined other countries, including Britain and France, in announcing plans for an eventual ban on sales of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars. But unlike those countries, which said that they hope to halt sales in 2040, China set no date.

The chief auto-emissions regulator in California — whose agency largely sets the standards to which automakers design their American fleets — said last week that Gov. Jerry Brown was asking why his state shouldn’t follow suit.

“I’ve gotten messages from the governor asking, ‘Why haven’t we done something already?’” the regulator, Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, told Bloomberg News. “The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California.”

At the same time, however, the Trump administration is pushing in the opposite direction, conducting a review of tight fuel-emissions standards for 2025 set by the Obama administration; it is widely expected to scale them back.

Investors reacted positively to G.M.’s announcement, with its shares tacking on more than 4 percent in Monday’s trading. And Mr. Reuss said G.M. did not expect to be hurt financially by a shift toward electric models, which at least for now can cost more to produce than comparably sized gasoline-powered vehicles.

Mr. Erdogan himself seemed to confirm the suspicion last month, when he told a gathering of police officers in Ankara that he would hand over an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, once the United States gave him Mr. Gulen.

“They say, ‘Give us this certain pastor,’” he said, recounting his meeting with American officials. “You have another pastor in your hands; give him to us,” he railed.

If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case. “Give him to us and we will put yours through the judiciary; we will give him to you,” Mr. Erdogan said.

At the same time, Turkish officials have repeatedly insisted that the detainees are charged with serious crimes of terrorism and trying to overthrow the state, and that if they are not guilty, the courts will release them in due course.

A presidential aide said in a recent interview that the government had been surprised by the scale of the Gulen network, and believed it had infiltrated nearly every major institution of power. The aide added that the authorities now faced an enormous task to dismantle it. He spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the protocol of his position.

More than 50,000 Turks have been imprisoned and 150,000 more have been suspended from their jobs since the attempted coup in July 2016, which killed 249 people. The crackdown has stretched far beyond the immediate culprits and has swept up people with vague links to the Gulen movement.

The Americans are among them. For the families of the detainees, the drama has shifted from the surreal to deep dread.

Serkan Golge, 37, the NASA scientist of Turkish decent, was arrested in the first frenzy of suspicion and police activity after the coup attempt as he was vacationing in the sleepy southern town of Hatay.

Tipped off by a relative, the police arrested Mr. Golge outside his parent’s house as the family was leaving for the airport to return home to Houston.

At first, his relatives thought it was a bad dream. A year later, as a lengthy prison sentence appears imminent, they are in despair.

“His case is getting worse,” his wife, Kubra Golge, said tearfully in an interview as she cuddled her two small sons. “The lawyer said he no longer knows how to defend the case.”

Since then, she and her two sons, 7 and 19 months, all American citizens, have been barred from leaving the country.

The main evidence against her husband, she says, is the account he held at Bank Asya, a financial institution said to be owned by the Gulen movement, and a dollar bill found in his younger brother’s bedroom that is supposedly a secret sign of membership in the movement.

As the government has begun prosecuting hundreds of Turkish citizens on charges of instigating the coup, the pressure on the Americans and other foreigners has only hardened.

The missionary, Mr. Brunson, lived and raised a family for 23 years in the seaside city of Izmir before he was detained last October and accused of links to the Gulen movement. This summer, he was indicted on new charges of espionage, trying to overthrow the state and acting against the Constitution.

In a recent interview, a presidential adviser defended Mr. Brunson’s continued detention, saying that new evidence must have come to light to merit the additional charges.

But Ihsan Ozbek, the chairman of the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, a fellow pastor and a friend of Mr. Brunson’s, dismissed the accusations.

“Andrew was a normal American Christian; he is not a spy,” he said. “I know him; I know his wife and kids. It’s very sad.”

He suggested, as Western officials have, that foreigners like Mr. Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary, were being held as hostages for political reasons by Turkey. The new charges came soon after the White House intervention.

A NATO member and a long-term ally of the United States, Turkey would never have dared to arrest Americans in earlier times, said Clyde Forsberg, an American professor who was detained in August last year.

“I was arrested because I was an American,” he said by telephone from the Kyrgyz Republic, where he now lives. “The only reason I was released was because I got lucky. It was very early in the game.”

Accused of aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, Professor Forsberg was released after four days in jail for lack of evidence, and he immediately left the country. The case against him is still pending, and he could have ended up incarcerated for months like Mr. Brunson, he said.

“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.

But appeals by American officials, including Mr. Trump, may have only persuaded the Turkish president that he was holding valuable assets that could be used as leverage over the United States.

Mr. Erdogan has also expressed anger at American court cases brought against his personal bodyguards, who are charged with attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a case against a former minister of Turkey and three others charged with conspiring to violate sanctions against Iran.

Perhaps the most high-profile case may be that of Mr. Brunson. The American vice president, who shares Mr. Brunson’s faith, has shown particular interest in his fate. So have the nearly 80 members of Congress who signed a letter to Mr. Erdogan in February asking him to release the missionary and saying he had been unjustly detained.

“There appears to be no evidence to substantiate the charges against him for membership in an armed terrorist organization,” the letter said.

Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them. Turkish law regards them as Turkish citizens and ignores their rights as Americans.

United States consular staff members have been given only limited access to the Americans in Turkish prisons and have not been able to visit the Turkish-Americans, such as Mr. Golge, at all.

Among them are Ismail Kul, a chemistry professor from Widener University in Pennsylvania, and his brother Mustafa Kul, a real estate agent. They were arrested in August 2016 at their home in Bursa during their summer vacation. They are accused of being members of the Gulen movement and playing a part in the failed coup.

At his trial, which is continuing, Ismail Kul admitted knowing Mr. Gulen but exposed the shakiness of the government’s charges when he explained that it was a member of Mr. Erdogan’s own ruling Justice and Development Party, Ahmet Aydin, the deputy chairman of Parliament, who first took him to meet the cleric.

“In 2010 I met Ahmet Aydin at a culture festival in Philadelphia,” Mr. Kul told the court, the nationalist daily newspaper Sozcu reported in January. “I had breakfast with him and his detail. They told me that they will see Gulen and suggested that I accompany them. That’s how I met Fethullah Gulen. After that, I visited Gulen four or five times.”

The United States Embassy in Turkey has expressed dismay that even local employees working at United States consulates have been swept up.

It issued a statement on Thursday saying that it was “deeply disturbed” at the arrest of a locally employed staff member in Istanbul. He was identified as Metin Topuz by the Turkish state news media, which said he was accused of having ties to Gulen members, spying and attempting to overthrow the government.

“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.

The spokesman for Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, Huseyin Muftuoglu, confirmed that Mr. Topuz had been detained on terror charges Sept. 25, but contended that he was neither a staff member of the American Consulate nor entitled to diplomatic or consular immunity.

Another United States Consulate employee, Hamza Ulucay, who had worked for 36 years in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was detained in February and accused of having contacts with the Gulen movement and the outlawed Kurdish movement, the PKK.

Ms. Golge, 33, the wife of the detained NASA scientist, remains deeply shaken over the trial of her husband, who is expected to be sentenced this month. She describes the shock of his arrest as being like an amputation.

Her American life is gone. She lives with her husband’s parents and visits the prison once a week for a 45-minute chat on a phone through a glass window.

At NASA, her husband was put on unpaid leave. Unable to keep up their mortgage payments, she is selling their house in Houston.

Her husband is resigned, Ms. Golge said. “He is very sad,” she added. “He says, ‘I feel a lot of pain in my heart, but I know it is going to pass.’”

How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.

The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.

Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allgäu, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker’s family-owned farm.

In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around €40 million has been invested over the years — much of it by residents — into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.

Günter Mögele, Wildpoldsried’s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village’s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.

Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents’ shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.

But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.

These big increases “are absolutely not O.K.,” said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.

The higher prices have had political consequences.

The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an “immediate exit” from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a “burden” on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program’s mounting costs.

Julian Hermneuwöhner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuwöhner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional €800 a year because of Energiewende.

“But it hasn’t brought lower CO 2 emissions,” he said. “It’s frustrating that we’re paying so much more, because the country hasn’t gotten anything for it.”

As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.

For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.

But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government’s decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.

The country has yet to address the transport industry, where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and France, Germany has not set a date to end the sale of diesel and gasoline cars.

Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy.

Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.

How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.

Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects — though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.

A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.

Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.

“Some of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,” said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “It is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.”","Germany’s Shift to Green Power Stalls, Despite Huge Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/energy-environment/german-renewable-energy.html

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

In it, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Manilow complained that he was turning into a milquetoast Andy Williams.
By that time, Mr. Griffith, the man who found Ms. Houston, had quit his job working for Mr. Davis.
“I said, ‘Whitney, are you pinching yourself?’ and she said ‘Yeah, Clive, I’m pinching myself,’” Mr. Davis said.
Afterward, said Ms. Houston’s former bodyguard David Roberts, speaking in “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” Ms. Houston descended further.","Ms. Houston was different.

Mr. Davis signed her in 1983 when she was just 19 years old, and he played an essential role on all but one album she recorded over the next 29 years.

He brought her songs and scouted producers. He introduced her at publicity events. He repeatedly extolled her supremacy over Mariah Carey.

At the peak of her life, she secured his place as an industry titan. In death, she haunts his legacy.

This past April, a laudatory documentary about him, “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” (based on his own memoir and available next week on Apple Music), opened the Tribeca Festival. A great party was given at Radio City Music Hall. Jennifer Hudson sauntered through the crowd singing a medley of Ms. Houston’s greatest hits.

Then came mixed reviews — and the debut at the festival of “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” a contrasting documentary that casts Ms. Houston as a victim of the music business’s most base inclinations. (It is currently airing on Showtime.)

Much like last year’s Academy Award-winning documentary “O.J.: Made in America,” it raises difficult questions about race and arrives at the conclusion that there was a psychological cost to being a black superstar whose image was created with the express purpose of maximum crossover.

Kenneth Reynolds, who worked at Arista, the label founded by Mr. Davis and on which Ms. Houston made her career, recounts how material that “was too black-sounding was sent back.” Kirk Whalum, who played saxophone on several of Ms. Houston’s tours, describes a woman who became devastated to learn that black people were calling her “White-ney” and a “sellout.”

Mr. Davis isn’t the principal villain in this other film.

There is much blame directed at Ms. Houston’s mother, the gospel singer Cissy Houston, and various members of the Houston clan, who had been on her payroll for many years.

But, still.

Another powerful component of this documentary is the on-camera testimony of more than a half-dozen colleagues of Ms. Houston’s, who say that the singer’s spiral into addiction had as much to do with her sexuality as it did with race.

Ms. Houston’s relationship with Robyn Crawford, an essential person in her camp from before Ms. Houston became famous until 1999, was the subject of speculation and gossip. Now, the narrative that the two were lovers had gained real currency, even without confirmation from Ms. Crawford.

Mr. Reynolds, who toured the country with Ms. Houston during the promotion of her debut album, described her lesbianism as “an open secret” at Arista during those early years.

“Every Little Step,” a recent book by Ms. Houston’s ex-husband, the R&B singer Bobby Brown, also takes the position that Ms. Houston’s sexuality was part of her struggle. Her marriage to him, he suggests, gave her the ability to reclaim her blackness while holding on to a basic image of straightness.

“They couldn’t let Whitney live the life she wanted to live; they insisted that she be perfect, that she be someone she wasn’t,” Mr. Brown writes. “That’s why they wanted Robyn out.”

Some people were circumspect about who “they” was. Mr. Brown wasn’t. He named them: “Clive Davis and her family.”

How Will I Know

“An artist can be extremely gifted and yet remain unsuccessful if he or she records the wrong music, or gets an image that confuses potential audiences.” That’s from “Clive: Inside the Music Business,” Mr. Davis’s 1974 memoir about his time at CBS Records.

Being out as lesbian or bisexual certainly would have confused audiences in 1985, said the actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell, who knew Ms. Houston and Ms. Crawford socially and said she had “no doubt” they were together and that what they had “was real.” (Ms. Crawford declined to speak for this article, and did not submit to an interview for “Whitney: Can I Be Me”).

Back then, Ms. O’Donnell said, “There was no Ellen. There was no ‘Will & Grace.’ Lois Smith was my publicist, and she was Whitney’s publicist. When I would go to a show or the Emmys with my girlfriend Kelly, Lois would literally sit between us. She wasn’t doing it to be mean to Kelly. She was trying to protect me.”

Among the first of Ms. Houston’s contemporaries to come out was the country singer K.D. Lang, who declared she was a lesbian in 1992. A few months later, Melissa Etheridge followed suit.

But it was another half a decade until Ellen DeGeneres and Ms. O’Donnell broke the news, and they waited until shortly before their television shows went off the air to do so.

That was how it happened back then with the biggest stars, if it happened at all. You did it when you had enough money to walk away from the machine, or you used a decline to propel yourself into a life of paid appearances at gay pride parades.

“Whitney was the first evidence I had that people were willing to acquiesce to whatever it was in order to hold on to an image that wouldn’t offend, because at the time, it meant you wouldn’t have a career in show business,” Ms. O’Donnell said. “None.”

The decision to come out was also hard for those in the music business who worked behind the scenes.

David Geffen, the veteran record label owner and manager, announced he was gay at an AIDS benefit in 1992. His friend Sandy Gallin, who managed Dolly Parton and Michael Jackson, followed in 1994, around the time the Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner left his wife for a man.

Yet it wasn’t until 2013 that Mr. Davis acknowledged what many had known for a while: that after two marriages and four children, he had a male partner.

The New York Times reviewer who panned his second memoir wrote: “Though we do hear about his failed first marriage, his second and its aftermath go M.I.A. for several hundred pages before he awkwardly cops to being ‘bisexual’ and in ‘a strong monogamous relationship for the last seven years’ with another man.”

Step by Step

Mr. Davis’s life is a story, and he’s a dazzling character in it. It’s his tinted glasses, snazzy suits and apparent fondness for telling tales again and again — life as a rolling press junket. That some of those stories do not track, are dated and appear false on their face matters little. He probably didn’t wind up as a co-writer of Air Supply’s “All Out of Love” by being principally concerned with the opinions of skeptics.

Most of Mr. Davis’s contemporaries who became label heads started as music men. Mr. Davis is a former lawyer and his corporate sensibilities poked through the material he released, particularly at Arista.

When Aretha Franklin traded in the analog soul sound and distinctly political edge of her work at Atlantic for the consumerist, synthetic pop of Arista , The Washington Post described her first album there by saying “The queen of soul seems to be striving for a new role — the queen of sap.” The effect was sad, but few could deny Mr. Davis had an ear.

Carly Simon also had a comeback with Arista. She adores Mr. Davis, who had some great advice for her over the years. But she also said, “His energy, his testosterone, all his hormones were ignited by having the biggest No. 1 records.” She added: “He is on the side of the winner at all costs, and the cost can be very high. The cost can be somebody’s career or somebody’s innateness.”

Mr. Davis grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, where he was a member of the high school honors society, which was called Arista. While he was in college at New York University, his parents died in close succession. It was devastating, but the loss turned out to be propulsive.

“Life can change on a dime,” he said.

After Harvard Law School, he worked at a law firm, then joined CBS Records (later Columbia) in 1960 as one of two in-house lawyers. At the time, its main business was classical music, Broadway cast albums and middle-of-the-road pop singers. But profits were dropping. Mr. Davis understood that the future was in rock ’n’ roll. Within seven years, at 35, he was running the label.

At the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, he heard Janis Joplin and described it as almost like finding religion. Yet when she came to Columbia’s offices and suggested that they seal the deal with a trip to bed, Mr. Davis demurred.

In 1968 she finished her first album, and Mr. Davis thought that its single “Piece of My Heart” was too long and didn’t repeat the chorus enough. He went into the studio and re-edited it for radio on his own. He played his version for Ms. Joplin and gently coaxed her into allowing the label to release it.

It went gold, the album sold more than a million copies, and the myth of the Great and Powerful Clive, a man with no musical training and supreme ears, was underway.

He was “devastated” when Joplin died in 1970. “Our fortunes were intertwined,” he writes in his first memoir. It was a “terrible loss.”

But it went beyond the personal. “It would be wrong to pretend I wasn’t upset over the commercial loss as well,” he adds in the memoir. “The music business is a business.”

Over the next few years, CBS (now called Columbia) signed Santana; Earth, Wind & Fire; Blood, Sweat & Tears; and Liza Minnelli. Mr. Davis entered into a promotion and distribution deal with Philadelphia International, which moved the company into R&B and disco, with great success.

Then, a reckoning followed when a Newark federal grand jury investigation was convened to look into the practice of industry payola. The Internal Revenue Service obtained financial records that showed that quarterly promotion checks sent by Columbia to Philadelphia International had been used to illegally supply money and drugs to radio programmers.

Mr. Davis also ended up in a muddle in which a mafia-acquainted head of artist relations dummied up false expense reports, included one for $18,000 for the Plaza Hotel bar mitzvah of Mr. Davis’s son Fred, billed as a party for Ms. Minnelli. Other violations included airfare for two of Mr. Davis’s pet beagles.

Mr. Davis was charged with six counts of tax evasion and pleaded guilty to one count. He maintains that he did nothing wrong, besides relying on someone who went too far on his unknowing behalf. “It was a witch hunt,” he said, and many agree.

Payola was never proven. But he was still fired.

In Fredric Dannen’s 1990 book, ‘“Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business,” Arthur Taylor — who dismissed Mr. Davis from his job — explained that the cause of the firing was that Mr. Davis had been offered the opportunity to come clean on the expense account issues and responded with lies.

“There’s something so strange about Clive Davis,” said Mr. Dannen, speaking now. “He has had one of the most remarkable careers in the music business, and yet so much about it is tainted. Not just by the payola thing, but by his need for attention. It may be that Clive’s greatest talent is his ability to distort reality.”

In My Business

Determined to rebuild his reputation, Mr. Davis took over a small label called Bell Records in 1974 and renamed it Arista. He signed Patti Smith and Lou Reed, but his principal success in the early years came from middle-of-the-road singers.

Photo

Enter: Barry Manilow and Melissa Manchester, both of whom sold loads of albums at their peak, yet subsequently seemed to lose part of their souls, as Mr. Davis relentlessly molded their images and their music to his liking.

“We could not find a comfortable way to communicate,” Ms. Manchester said. “As my albums progressed, I had to fight harder and harder to get a place for my songs, which was weird, because I’d come in thinking he liked what I did as a singer-songwriter, and he wanted me to be a vocalist for songs that I thought were rather bland and simply loud. He always wanted me to be current, and I always wanted to be timeless. It’s a different way of looking at the same picture.”

Mr. Manilow had similar issues. When he first started out, he wrote pop songs with contemplative lyrics about broken marriages. Then he met the label head who, Mr. Manilow said in a memoir, “looked more like a banker than a music man” and told him that his album was “nice” but needed hits. Mr. Davis started delivering him other people’s songs to sing.

“I Write the Songs,” despite the title, was one. Another was “Brandy,” later changed to “Mandy.” These cemented Mr. Manilow’s status as the grieving straight guy who couldn’t get over a lost love.

It was hard for Mr. Manilow to know what to think. He was a giant success, yet he was miserable. He wrote in his diary: “Why am I angry?”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In 1981, Mr. Manilow and Mr. Davis had a tense meeting. In it, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Manilow complained that he was turning into a milquetoast Andy Williams. Mr. Davis responded: “Well, if you were Irving Berlin, we would know it by now.”

So Mr. Manilow left the label, although not before someone handled the rumors of him being gay by saying that he was living with a female production assistant named Linda Allen.

Then, his first album with RCA bombed, and he returned. Mr. Manilow finally came out in 2017, many years after returning to Mr. Davis’s stable.

The sabbatical was fortuitous. “It helped him get a different perspective and cherish the partnership,” Mr. Davis said.

“There’s this eternal argument between the part of us that wants to be an artist and the part of us that wants to be a success,” Ms. Simon said. “The success part often wins.”

Same Script, Different Cast

Mr. Davis never liked being called a Svengali for what he did with Ms. Houston. He thought that sounded slithery. Still, it’s hard to describe their collaboration without leaving that impression.

They met in 1983 at the behest of Gerry Griffith, who worked in Arista’s A&R department.

Ms. Houston was born near housing projects in Newark. Her family moved to the more middle-class East Orange, N.J., when Cissy, Ms. Houston’s mother and a backup singer for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, began enjoying success.

As a child, Whitney sang gospel with the New Hope Baptist Choir. She was unsure of herself, with a tendency to sing in the back. Cissy had some ambivalence about whether her daughter should become an entertainer, but she nevertheless told her that if she was going to sing, she’d better step up.

By 16, she was singing with Cissy on Chaka Khan’s disco masterpiece “Clouds.” Whitney may not have known then what the bargain of fame would feel like, but she knew where she was headed. “I was always going to be a star,” she later said.

So a showcase for Mr. Davis was set up.

Her performances that night were standards: “Home” from “The Wiz” and then “The Greatest Love of All.”

“They were knockouts,” Mr. Davis said. “She had the entire package.”

Ms. Houston was beautiful. She had great power as a singer. But beyond that, he said, she had a level of self-control that was remarkable.

If she did not have great ambitions to become a songwriter (a thing critics subsequently used to discount her artistry), Ms. Houston knew exactly what she was singing about. When she did runs, it was usually because the lyrics called for it.

Mr. Davis’s recollection is that he talked with Ms. Houston around that time about music, and she told him Lena Horne and Dionne Warwick (who was her cousin and already on Arista) were her favorite singers.

Later, Ms. Houston would say her favorites growing up were Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole, which is a big difference. Who knows which version of the story is true. Ms. Houston, like Mr. Davis, was never the world’s most reliable narrator.

Two weeks after Mr. Davis signed her, he went on “The Merv Griffin Show” and introduced his protégée to the world. She hadn’t recorded a song yet, but that was how much he believed in her. (Also: He loved going on television.)

Making her debut album took nearly two years. Mr. Davis said the idea back then was to build her appeal in both the pop and the R&B markets, but Mr. Reynolds said there was never any question which one was more important.

“Arista was a pop-oriented label,” Mr. Reynolds said. “That’s what the staff knew and that’s what Clive knew. That’s what he did best — and he did it better than most record executives. There was no platform for Aretha Franklin’s ‘Ain’t No Way’ on Arista. They needed Aretha Franklin doing ‘Who’s Zoomin’ Who?’ and Whitney Houston doing ‘Greatest Love of All’ and Billy Ocean doing ‘Caribbean Queen.’ Because the bigger the pop record, the more money you could make.”

And when “Whitney Houston” came out in 1985 and turned into the biggest-selling debut album in history, the principals involved did make money.

Three songs went No. 1 on the Hot 100. She won a Grammy in the pop category for “Saving All My Love for You” but lost in the R&B category for “You Give Good Love,” a clear indication of the success of the appeal to white audiences.

By that time, Mr. Griffith, the man who found Ms. Houston, had quit his job working for Mr. Davis. “He only saw the big numbers. That was just his mind-set,” Mr. Griffith said. “It’s like hiring our current president to run a label. That’s why I could not agree with everything he was doing. That’s why I left.” (Mr. Davis apparently felt more warmly about Mr. Griffith. He later hired him back.)

In 1987, Ms. Houston’s follow-up arrived and the first four singles all hit No. 1, making her the first artist in history to have had seven consecutive chart toppers. “I said, ‘Whitney, are you pinching yourself?’ and she said ‘Yeah, Clive, I’m pinching myself,’” Mr. Davis said.

It’s a story he loves to tell, but the tale was abbreviated.

The reviews for the follow-up album were brutal. Jon Pareles, in The New York Times, said it smacked of corporate perfectionism. The Los Angeles Times’s Robert Hilburn called it a “considerable disappointment.”

Behind the scenes, Ms. Houston was dealing with a family who increasingly depended on her and whose appetites turned out to be nearly bottomless.

She made her father her manager and bought her mother a house. They had divorced after their daughter was famous. She was taught to freebase cocaine in the late 1980s by her brother Michael.

It was Robyn Crawford who went to Cissy Houston’s house to say there was a problem with drugs.

Cissy, a Christian who still sang in church, had separate issues with the idea her daughter was gay. She wasn’t open to staging an intervention with Ms. Crawford, and decided to deal with her daughter’s problem on her own.

Mr. Davis seemed equally disinclined to address Ms. Houston’s sexuality or what effect hiding it may be having on her happiness or psychological health.

He said he has “no idea” whether Ms. Houston was gay. “We never discussed it,” he said, and went on to list the romances she’d supposedly had in the ’80s with Jermaine Jackson and Eddie Murphy.

“Oh, nonsense,” Mr. Dannen said. “Put that on the record. I remember going to a launch party for one of her albums when I was writing ‘Hit Men.’ It was all anybody could talk about. Clive didn’t know? Of course he knew.”

Rosie O’Donnell said: “For Clive Davis to claim ignorance about this is, I believe, a boldfaced lie.”

When asked about this, Mr. Davis said that any implication he “orchestrated” a cover-up around Ms. Houston’s sexuality or that he “did not want her to be herself” was “crazy.”

“I’m telling the truth,” he said. “Did I read that there was speculation? I did.”

“There was never a discussion between me and Whitney about any kind of romantic relationship with Robyn,” he said. “There was never an indication that there was.” Mr. Davis added that he first became aware there was a drug problem sometime around 2000.

All the Man That I Need

In April 1989, Ms. Houston and Ms. Crawford attended the Soul Train Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. When Houston’s name was announced among the nominees for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Single, female, a loud booing could be heard in the audience.

“I was there,” said the producer Kenny Edmonds, known as Babyface. “We talked about it because we were all a little shocked. She was very upset.”

That was the night she met Mr. Brown for the first time. He sat in front of her and also performed, gyrating on the stage while singing “My Prerogative,” the song that had turned him into the spokesman for recalcitrant youth — the sort who were no longer playing her records.

Ms. Houston flirted with him a little, then invited him to her 26th birthday party in New Jersey. Ms. Houston and Mr. Davis also hired Babyface and his partner L.A. Reid to work on her third album, “I’m Your Baby Tonight.”

“The irony is that if she was trying to go blacker, I don’t know that we were the guys to go to,” Mr. Edmonds said. “We were in the middle. But maybe that’s why Clive called us in the first place.”

In 1992, Ms. Houston and Mr. Brown were married in New Jersey.

The morning of the wedding, Mr. Brown walked into Ms. Houston’s bedroom, he writes in his memoir, hoping “for a quickie” with his bride-to-be.

He found her “hunched over a bureau, doing a line of coke.” So he joined in, thinking to himself what good fortune it was to have found someone like her. “She was classy and street at the same time,” he writes. Then came the ceremony, where the maid of honor was Ms. Crawford.

By now, Ms. Houston was promoting what would become her biggest commercial vehicle yet, “The Bodyguard,” a new movie she had just filmed with Kevin Costner.

It was to be a great event, America’s black sweetheart and Hollywood’s most famous white Republican (at least back then), falling in love on screen in what seemed like a marketing team’s decision to build a movie around as many demographics as possible.

Thanks in large part to Ms. Houston’s brilliant performance of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” for the film, the movie earned $411 million at the global box office.

Even the wedding to Mr. Brown became part of the film’s promotion plan, as Ms. Houston submitted — with Ms. Crawford — to interviews with ABC News and USA Today, where they explained that they had not been lovers but were simply best friends.

“I think once she’s married, she’ll feel a lot more complete,” Ms. Crawford said. “I think that’ll be a self phase where she’ll be doing something for her life.”

One might assume Ms. Crawford would have made an exit soon after the wedding. Instead, she remained for seven years as part of the management team, locked with Mr. Brown in what several people in “Whitney: Can I Be Me” describe as a battle for the ear of Ms. Houston. During that time, Mr. Davis receded somewhat from the picture.

Ms. Houston starred in films that grappled more directly with African-American issues but descended further into her own addiction. Whatever had led Ms. Houston to pick Mr. Brown, their addictions helped make it real. “It may have seemed dysfunctional, but that doesn’t say anything about whether they loved each other,” Mr. Edmonds said. “She loved him like crazy, and he loved her like crazy.”

She suffered an overdose during the making of the 1995 film “Waiting to Exhale.” Then she pulled out of big promotional appearances for “The Preacher’s Wife” because of “throat issues.”

Around that time, Ms. Houston gave a rare interview.

“Money doesn’t make you happy,” she said. “Fame certainly doesn’t make you happy. People will tell you that who are famous. You’ve got to find the happiness within yourself. You’ve got to know who you are before you step into this business, because if you’re trying to find it, you’ll probably wind up being somebody else that you probably don’t even like.”

In 1997, Mr. Davis’s patience ran out.

He wrote her a letter: “Dearest Whitney, you know my love for you goes beyond the professional nature of our relationship, which in and of itself is almost as long as the age you were when I met you. To put it succinctly, I am seriously concerned. I know that I have absolutely no right to reflect on anything but your professional recording career, so let me address that. You have not done a studio album in seven years. You have only recorded a total of seven pop songs during the last five years and those were chosen to integrate into the characters of two motion pictures. So insofar as your position as the number one contemporary recording artist in the world is concerned, you have been practically missing in action.”

Soon enough, Houston was back in the studio, working on “My Love Is Your Love,” an album that burst with collaborations with edgy producers like Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Rodney Jerkins, who delivered her a song about being in a messy marriage with a man who can’t stop cheating on her.

It got some of the best reviews of her career, but the tour was another story. The problem wasn’t the voice, but her marriage’s increasingly Mr. and Mrs. Smith-like quality.

The situation finally broke Ms. Crawford, who determined it was time to quit the family business. She ultimately settled down with Lisa Hintelmann, a former magazine editor who works as the director of talent and entertainment partnerships at Audible.

Afterward, said Ms. Houston’s former bodyguard David Roberts, speaking in “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” Ms. Houston descended further.

Exhale

The following year, Burt Bacharach fired her from a performance at the Oscars when Houston began singing the wrong song during rehearsal. She abruptly pulled out of her performance at Mr. Davis’s induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

In September 2001, she popped onstage at a tribute concert for Michael Jackson, looking so thin that the sounds of people gasping could actually be heard throughout the arena.

Mr. Davis tried to help.

After the Oscars debacle, he invited her to come stay at his weekend home. He gently brought up her drug use. She told him she had it under control, that it was her business.

After the Michael Jackson show, he wrote her another letter begging her to get treatment, telling her how he’d seen her on television and cried. She never responded.

By then, Mr. Davis had been pushed out of Arista by his corporate higher-ups at Bertelsmann and was setting up another new label. That left Houston behind.

Her 2002 album tanked. She gave a disastrous interview to Diane Sawyer in which Ms. Houston explained, in a moment that became notorious, that she did not smoke crack. “Crack is cheap!” she said. “I make too much money to ever smoke crack.”

She described Mr. Davis being removed at Arista as a tremendous source of pain. “That hurt,” she said. “A lot.”

They did reunite, and she got divorced and released an album, “I Look to You,” with Mr. Davis once again listed as executive producer. But the combination of cocaine and years of heavy cigarette smoking had taken their toll. With her fortune diminishing and her family ever dependent on her, she agreed to stage a tour. It was a disaster.

Yet Mr. Davis was pleased to see Ms. Houston when she arrived in Los Angeles in 2012, the week of the Grammys. The way he remembers it, she seemed sober as they chatted by the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he was staying.

She told him that she had finally quit smoking and would be ready to record again that summer. She also said she was swimming daily.

But later that week, Ms. Houston went out for a night on the town with her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, and left a nightclub with her leg bleeding, after an altercation with a woman she believed was making a move on Ray J, the man she was dating.

After she died, the coroner’s report described some of the items in her hotel room: prescription drugs, empty liquor bottles and a metal spoon covered in white powder.

Mr. Davis did memorialize her at his Grammy event, the show that infamously went on no matter what, bringing Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson to the stage to perform some of Ms. Houston’s songs.

Then he went to Newark for her funeral. In his eulogy, he rattled off all the record-breaking statistics of their 27-year collaboration, name checking five of her 11 No. 1 songs, five more Top 10 hits, four of her movies and one earth-shattering rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Once again, but not for the last time, he told the story about how he’d asked her in 1987 whether she was pinching herself at her success.

Ms. Crawford didn’t speak that day. Instead, she published a remembrance on Esquire’s website. It left a lot out.

But she did include her diagnosis of what happened to Whitney Houston. “The record company, the band members, her family, her friends, me — she fed everybody,” she wrote. “Deep down inside that’s what made her tired.”",Production of a Lifetime: Whitney Houston and Clive Davis,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/style/whitney-houston-clive-davis-sexuality.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Given his personal ties to Puerto Rico, as well as the substantial Puerto Rican population in his state, Mr. Rubio has been engaged in ensuring that the relief effort there gets on track and stays there. He has flexed his influence on American policy toward Cuba and Venezuela. He has worked with Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, on a proposal to expand the child tax credit that could become an important element of the coming tax debate. He has helped push to passage a bill to help the Department of Veterans Affairs hold employees more accountable. He was part of a bipartisan group behind a new law directing drug companies to pursue more pediatric cancer treatments. He is an important party voice on immigration.

Whether this is all a prelude to a future presidential run for Mr. Rubio, 46, is hard to gauge. But he attributes his rededication to the Senate to a confluence of factors, including the fact that his party is in power and that, now in his second term in the Senate, he is a little more sure of what he is doing.

“It is true that experience generally makes you better at something, not worse,” Mr. Rubio said. “And so the longer you’re in some place, to a certain extent, the better you can be at it. So I am certainly a better senator today than I was five years ago simply because I’m more familiar with the process. It also doesn’t hurt to have your party in the White House with a lot of people over there that I know.”

Mr. Rubio wasn’t supposed to be here at all. A rising superstar in his party with a personality and background that thrilled donors, Mr. Rubio was in the top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls in 2016. Many in Washington believed he would be the nominee, a candidate who would finally broaden the party’s appeal with Hispanics while holding true conservative credentials.

Openly antagonistic about the slow pace of the hidebound Senate, Mr. Rubio made it clear that it was the White House or bust. And bust it was as Donald J. Trump upended him in the Florida primary race. But after insisting he would give up his seat at the end of his term, Mr. Rubio instead decided to run, citing second thoughts about public service that were prompted by the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

It was not without risk. “Losing two elections in a year has never been part of my plan for life,” Mr. Rubio said.

He won and re-entered an institution that allies said he found frustrating. Mr. Rubio wouldn’t be the first senator to rate his experience as a second-term lawmaker an improvement over the first. Figuring out the Senate can take time, and more-senior lawmakers might not even begin to take colleagues seriously until they have at least one term under their belts.

“I’m at 58 in seniority,” Mr. Rubio noted. “I came in at 99.”

Mr. Rubio, who has close friends in Puerto Rico and visited soon after Hurricane Maria had passed, said that he had no quarrel with the federal response, but that the conventional reaction to a severe hurricane didn’t suffice for the already struggling island.

“The problem,” he said, “is that the model that works in Florida and in Texas doesn’t work as well in Puerto Rico for a lot of reasons: the geographic isolation, the pre-existing challenges and the fact that they had just previously been impacted by a storm.”

As for his relationship with Mr. Trump — who ridiculed Mr. Rubio as “Little Marco” during primary race debates, prompting Mr. Rubio to try to get under his opponent’s skin by noting his “small hands” — Mr. Rubio said those jabs did not extend beyond the campaign stage.

“Politics is verbal combat,” he said. “And in the process of a campaign, which is a competitive environment, people are going to bump up against each other.”

“We were competitors,” he said. “But I never felt we had a negative interaction.”

Assessing Mr. Trump’s performance in office, Mr. Rubio characterized him as “unorthodox” — a description he said Mr. Trump himself would embrace. He acknowledged policy differences and concerns about Iraq and Syria, but said they were in agreement on multiple other fronts.

“I still would rather have him be president than Hillary Clinton, to be frank,” Mr. Rubio said. “And that was the choice before America in November.”

Left unsaid was that Mr. Rubio was ultimately not part of that choice. Is he now satisfied with his Senate role? For the moment, it seems.

“I want to be the best senator I can be — the best senator Florida has ever had,” he said. “That’s obviously a lofty goal, and there will be plenty of people to argue that I didn’t achieve it no matter what I do.”

What he is not doing, the senator said, “is executing on any sort of long-term plan to get to a particular destination other than to do this job as well as I can and make my time here as productive as possible.”

That alone is a big change for a man who a little more than a year ago was happily on his way out the Senate door for good.

Consulting with Gardiner Harris, who covers international diplomacy for The Times and has written several articles about this case, I learned there was not even an official medical report.

I decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story. Is the idea of a sonic attack plausible, based on what scientists know about sound and the human body?

I wound up perusing a massive 2009 book called “ ‘Non-Lethal’ Weapons,” with a chapter summarizing research on using sound to incapacitate people at a distance.

But there’s less than meets the eye. There’s a lot of wild rumor about secret weapons that can make brains explode or make people think there’s a voice inside their head. And while medical researchers have studied the effects of sound for decades, they’ve done so sporadically, leaving us with a very patchy understanding.

So I hit the phone. I didn’t want to talk with just anyone — I looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question. I started with Timothy Leighton, whose job title at Southampton University is, literally, professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics. Better yet, Dr. Leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that I’m aware of.

When I interviewed Dr. Leighton and others, I made clear I didn’t expect them to solve this mystery; I just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science. Everyone I spoke with had been following the news, too, so in each interview we hit the ground running.

Spoiler alert: The consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon. It would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously. The notion has ricocheted like mad around the press, making it possible for readers to assume that it has been generally accepted by experts. But it most certainly has not. I’ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation.

If the United States government ever does release the results of a detailed investigation, I would love to report on the case again. But, as the retired acoustics professor Steven L.

She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.","An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.

During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.

In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”

He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”

Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.

He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”

Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”

Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”

The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.

In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.

“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.

Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.

Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.

Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”

I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished.  From Lauren O’Connor‘s memo

At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.

“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.

Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”

In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”

A Common Narrative

Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.

“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.

Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.

Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.

In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.

Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”

“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.

Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.

Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”

The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.

Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.

But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?

“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.

Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.

Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.

In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.

Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.

Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.

Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.

‘Coercive Bargaining’

For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”

But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.

Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.

“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”

To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”

Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved.

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.

Increased Scrutiny

Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.

Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.

In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.

The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.

But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.

The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.

Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.

After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.

Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”

She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.

But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.

“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.",Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html

Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Friday’s live updates.

The night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.

Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.

Then came gunfire — sudden and rapid and seemingly endless. When it was over, 58 people had been killed and hundreds more injured, making the attack at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.

Hannah Ahlers

Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.

Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers’s death. Her family described her as having “loved life and people.”

“She was our sunshine,” they said in a statement.

She was a homemaker, an active member in her children’s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter’s volleyball team.

“She wasn’t too good for anybody,” Mr. Ahlers said. “Beautiful, inside and out.”

Heather Alvarado

Heather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.

“It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,” Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.

A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado’s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and “so much more.” She was “always the first to help out,” the page said, and “anyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.”

Dorene Anderson

Dorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.

Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.

“Dorene was our treasurer of the cowbell crew this past year and a wonderful, generous person who was a friend to many,” wrote Marie English, a fellow fan, on the fan club’s Facebook page.

She was also “the most amazing wife, mother and person this world ever had,” her husband, John Anderson, wrote in a statement issued by his employer, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.

So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. “We ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,” read a post on the fan page. “Bring your cowbell.”

Carrie Barnette

With a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.

A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.

“That was Carrie,” a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. “She just liked to go out and do things.”

“We mourn a wonderful member of the Disney family: Carrie Barnette,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert Iger, said on Twitter on Monday night.

Ms. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.

“O.K. everybody I just entered Lucy in this,” she posted on Facebook last month, of a calendar contest to raise money for a local animal shelter. “I really hope she can win and make the cover.”

Jack Beaton

In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.

“Day Three Route 91 Vegas!” he wrote in the caption.

Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.

His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife’s body with his own, and was shot. “He told her he loved her,” he said. “Laurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.”

Mr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.

Mr. Beaton’s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. “Lost my best friend,” he wrote. “I love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!”

Steve Berger

Photo

Whatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.

He was an all-star high school basketball player in Wauwatosa, Wis., his father, Richard Berger, told MPR News, and went on to play for St. Olaf College in Minnesota. In 2007, his friend Josh Decker brought him to EFS Advisors, a company in Cambridge, Minn., where he would spend the last 10 years and earn accolades from Mpls.St.Paul Magazine and Twin Cities Business.

As a financial adviser, “Steve was able to touch thousands of lives, enhancing the ability of his clients to retire earlier and/or in a better financial position,” the company said in a statement.

Mr. Berger had three children, between the ages 8 and 15, and was in Las Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. The week before, he and his father had spoken about his bet on the Wisconsin-Northwestern football game, his father told The Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“I said, ‘Steve, be careful,’” his father recalled.

Candice Bowers

Photo

On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.

When the gunfire began, Ms. Bowers and her friend dove under a table, then became separated in the chaos, her grandmother, Patricia Zacker, told The Orange County Register. Ms. Bowers leaves behind three children and a large extended family, relatives said.

“Candice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,” a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. “She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.”

Denise Salmon Burditus

Photo

Whenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.

“I can’t say enough — her smile,” Mr. Burditus, of Martinsburg, W.Va., said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “If I was out of town or something I would get a selfie, on her way to the gym, or on her way to school. I would get a huge smile,” he said.

“If I didn’t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.”

That same smile beamed from a photo she and her husband took together in front of the music festival stage, not long before the shooting. She posted the photograph on Facebook.

As the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. “We stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, ‘No.’ And then it was during the second burst that we knew,” Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.

“I was leading her through the crowd,” he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he “immediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.” Ms. Burditus was 50.

Sandy Casey

Photo

Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.

The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.

Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.

“She was a person who brings light wherever she is,” he said. “She has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.”

Ms. Casey’s fiancé, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: “As I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that’s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!”

Andrea Castilla

Photo

It seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fiancé, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.

And there was to be a surprise, according to People.com: Mr. Miller had been planning to propose.

He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.

In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fiancé tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.

“I was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,” Athena Castilla said. “We all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.”

Denise Cohen

Photo

Denise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the “life of the party,” her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: “the first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.”

She loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. “‘I can’t wait to see Jason Aldean’ — that’s all I heard all weekend,” Ms. Vogel said.

Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.

Austin Davis

Photo

Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.

The two played “fast-pitch softball” together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. “Tom kind of guided him.”

A member of the United Association, the union representing pipe fitters, Mr. Davis “had a swing like no other,” another softball friend said.

After the shooting, Mr. Davis’ girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: “My everything … Please come home to us.”

A “Homerun Derby” was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. “I will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,” Ms. Hennigan wrote.

Thomas Day Jr.

Photo

Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father’s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.

His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.

The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a “great dad” who often attended concerts with his children.

He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. “They still have him,” he said.

Christiana Duarte

Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. “She was very giving,” Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother’s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte’s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.

“I can’t tell you how this has hit all of us,” Ms. Meyers said. “This is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.”

Stacee Etcheber

Photo

After the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber’s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.

Then the second round came.

Mr. Etcheber’s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple’s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber’s death on Monday night.

Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.

“Please pray for our family during this difficult time,” Ms. Etcheber’s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.

Brian Fraser

Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, “Dirt Road Anthem,” was coming soon.

Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions — his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends — survived.

“A bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,” his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. “Brian was a rock of love and support to his family.”

A vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.

“Brian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,” his employer said in a statement.

Keri Galvan

Photo

Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a “super tired super mama of 3.” On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: “New baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.”

“They always went to Disneyland together,” Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. “She was just a great mother.”

The children are 10, 4 and 2, according to a GoFundMe page set up by Ms. Galvan’s sister, Lindsey Poole.

Ms. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro’s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.

“Her days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,” Ms. Poole said.

Dana Gardner

Photo

Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was “known for her ‘can-do’ attitude and vibrant energy,” Bob Dutton, the county’s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.

“Everybody here is still in shock,” Mr. Dutton told The San Bernardino Sun. “They’re waiting for her to walk through the door.”

In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner’s daughter, said: “She spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.”

She added later, “As we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.”

Angela Gomez

Photo

When the daughter of Angela Gomez’s cheerleading coach died four years ago, Ms. Gomez was quick to appear at the coach’s door to offer her sympathies. In an interview with The Press-Enterprise, her coach from Riverside Polytechnic High School, Lupe Avila, recalled Ms. Gomez, 20, as “one of the most genuine and loyal people you could ever meet.”

Ms. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.

Rocio Guillen

Rocio Guillen and her fiancé, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha’s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha’s mother, Donna.

“We Facetimed all weekend,” Ms. Jaksha said. “We would say ‘Look, it’s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.’”

Ms. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.

The couple met when they worked at a Chili’s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. “I already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,” Ms. Jaksha said.

Charleston Hartfield

Photo

Charleston Hartfield, 34, an off-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer, had written a book not long ago. “Memoirs of a Public Servant,” was published in July and focused on his day-to-day work, his time on the force and his interactions on the streets of Las Vegas.

“Every time you talked to him, your life would be better,” Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. “You wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.”

Officer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.

Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, “Captain America” as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.

“I know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I’m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else’s way,” said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.

Chris Hazencomb

Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of “The Little Couple” that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.

The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb’s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend’s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)

Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.

“He looked like he was sleeping,” Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.

Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend’s wife from bullets. “He’d give you the shirt off his back,” Ms. Hazencomb said.

Jennifer Irvine

Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo — and for her friends and country music.

“She did go to a lot of concerts,” Jason Irvine, Jennifer’s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.

Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.

“She was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,” Mr. Irvine said.

Nicol Kimura

Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said — a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.

“Just a beaming light,” Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.

Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend’s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.

The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.

As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.

“We couldn’t pull her to safety,” Mr. Miller said.

Jessica Klymchuk

Jessica Klymchuk, 34, from the province of Alberta in Canada, had been visiting Las Vegas with her boyfriend, The Globe and Mail reported. She was a school librarian, a bus driver and the mother of four children.

Carly Kreibaum

Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum’s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls’ weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas — a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.

At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.

Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.

She lived with her husband, Chris, and their children, Dalten and Cambri, on a farm just outside town, according to The Des Moines Register.

On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.

Rhonda LeRocque

When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.

At home in Tewksbury, Mass., her sister told The Boston Globe, she showed the same kindness and devotion to her husband, Jason, and their 6-year-old daughter. The three were together at the Route 91 festival when the shooting began.

Ms. LeRocque, 42, was active in her local Jehovah’s Witnesses church and worked for the design company IDEO, which confirmed her death in a Facebook post.

“For more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,” the company wrote. “Nobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.”

Victor Link

When Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.

“Rob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,” Mr. Link’s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. “But it didn’t happen.”

Mr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.

“My son took a bullet to the chest,” he said.

Jordan McIldoon

Jordan McIldoon, 22, a mechanic from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, was among the dead, a family member said. His parents described him to CBC News in Canada as outdoorsy, about to begin trade school, and on the trip to Las Vegas with his girlfriend. They were expecting him to return home on Monday evening.

“We only had one child,” they told CBC News. “We just don’t know what to do.”

Kelsey Meadows

There were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.

Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, “along with an entire community that loved and respected her,” the school said in a statement.

The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher — alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. “Kelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,” Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. “She had a sweet spirit and a love for children.”

Brad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook “with an absolutely shattered heart,” he wrote.

Calla Medig

Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie’s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.

“I even gave her a hard time because I don’t like country music,” said her boss, Scott Collingwood. “I told her, ‘You’re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with two-stepping!’”

Ms. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.

She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn’t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.

“Calla is super responsible,” he said. “I just knew.”

Ms. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.

Sonny Melton

When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.

“I felt him get shot in the back,” Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.”

Mr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.

“He was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,” said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.

“When the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,” Ms. Sanders said on Monday.

Pati Mestas

Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.

“That was the type of person she was,” her cousin Tom Smith said. “If you could do it and if it wasn’t wrong, she would do it.”

Ms. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.

“When she did something, she did it 100 percent,” Mr. Smith said. “She was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn’t get enough out of life.”

Austin Meyer

Austin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.

Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.

He was a fan of Bobby Bones and the Raging Idiots, one of the acts performing at the Route 91 festival, which he attended with his fiancée, Dana Getreu.

“He was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,” Ms. Getreu’s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. “The loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.”

Adrian Murfitt

Adrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.

He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.

“He had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,” Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.

Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.

Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother’s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. “He was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,” she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.

“Sadly, he died in my arms,” Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. “I don’t really know what else to say at this time. I’m really sorry.”

Rachael Parker

Rachael Parker, a police records technician from Manhattan Beach, Calif., was off duty when she was shot. She died in the hospital, the Manhattan Beach Police Department confirmed in a statement.

She was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.

Jennifer Parks

As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.

“She said, ‘I am going to marry Bobby,’” said Jennifer Parks’s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. “I guess she always had a little crush on him.”

They became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.

The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks “will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.”

Ms. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.

“She had a heart of gold,” Ms. Boyle said.

Carrie Parsons

Carrie Parsons, 31, a manager at the Seattle office of the employment firm Ajilon, was on a “girls trip” to the festival, a friend, Laura Cooper, told KOMO, a local television news station.

Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote “Night made,” after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.

Lisa Patterson

Photo

Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.

She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband’s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.

The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.

The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.

“She has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,” Ms. Beckman said. “And I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.”

John Phippen

Photo

When the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.

John Phippen, 56, who ran a home remodeling company in Santa Clarita, Calif., and Travis, 24, an emergency medical technician, covered the bodies of strangers with their own. They crawled toward the wounded and used belts as tourniquets to try to stop their bleeding, his son said in a local television news interview.

Then John Phippen was shot.

“I got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,” Travis Phippen said.

With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.

“He told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,” the younger Mr. Phippen said.

Melissa Ramirez

Photo

Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California’s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.

Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez’s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.

The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.

“She always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,” Ms. Farnetti said.

The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.

On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.

Jordyn Rivera

Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school’s study abroad program.

“We will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,” the university’s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.

A member of the health education honor society, Eta Sigma Gamma, Ms. Rivera was “a total sweetheart with piercing eyes & a beautiful smile,” a fellow student, Natasha Lavera, wrote on Facebook.

Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

She would have graduated next year.

Quinton Robbins

An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.

“I can’t say enough good about this sweet soul,” the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. “Everyone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.”

Outside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother’s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.

Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. “He was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,” said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins’s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. “It was a last-minute thing.”

Cameron Robinson

Photo

Cameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.

The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government’s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.

“He was driven, but not so driven that he didn’t know how to enjoy life,” Mr. Jerbic said.

Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley’s arms.

Tara Roe Smith

Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.

“Tara was an aide in my granddaughter’s preschool class,” wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. “She will be missed.”

The mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is “heartbroken,” a family friend told CTV Manitoba.

“It is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,” John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district’s website. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.”

Lisa Romero-Muniz

Photo

Last year, Lisa Romero-Muniz’s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.

So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.

“She was beyond excited,” said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. “For her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.”

Ms. Romero-Muniz’s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.

Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.

“We were known as the two loudmouths of the office,” Ms. Fernandez said. “She knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I’d hear her saying, ‘I know you can do better than this.’”

On Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.

Christopher Roybal

Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.

The two had become separated at the event, Ms. Allen told local television stations, and when the gunfire started, she ran but then tried to return to the festival grounds to look for him.

“I just kept saying, ‘My son, my son, where is my son?’” Ms. Allen said. “This guy wouldn’t let me go back in. He goes: ‘You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.’”

Mr. Roybal had recently moved to Denver from Colorado Springs, where he was the general manager at a Crunch gym, which announced his death on its Facebook page.

He was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: “The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you’ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.”

Brett Schwanbeck

Photo

Growing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. “He was very, very full of life,” she said.

Mr. Schwanbeck had gone to the Route 91 festival with his fiancée, Anna Orozco, who he had been planning to marry in January. Photographs of the couple on Facebook show them posing on the concert grounds, the gleaming Mandalay Bay resort in the background.

Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.

Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.

“Family meant everything to him,” she said.

Bailey Schweitzer

At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer “was always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,” Fred Brakeman, the company’s president, said. “No one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.”

Before graduating, Ms. Schweitzer was a cheerleader at Centennial High School in Bakersfield and a frequent volunteer at the Bakersfield Speedway, which her family owned, The Bakersfield Californian reported. A co-worker, Katelynn Cleveland, told the newspaper that Ms. Schweitzer, 20, had been looking forward to the Route 91 music festival for weeks.

Laura Shipp

The staff at the Chili’s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.

“Like clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,” said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.

The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp’s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey’s other friends took to calling her “Mama Shipp.” And Corey Shipp liked having her around.

“These two seemed like, even if they weren’t family, they would still be best friends,” Mr. Atkinson said.

Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. “Corey was her only and Laura was his only,” said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp’s brother, who confirmed her death.

They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili’s staff.

“It took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,” Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.

Erick Silva

The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.

As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva’s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.

Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. “Watching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.”

Mr. Silva worked long hours on the job. “When he wasn’t helping me, he would always go where he was needed the most to help out in any way possible,” James Garrett, a co-worker, wrote in a Facebook tribute.

“He never complained about anything.”

The company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.

Susan Smith

Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.

“A wonderful person,” said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.

She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.

Brennan Stewart

Photo

A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song “You Should Be Here.” It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends — and not just his — have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.

In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a “slower approach” to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. “Thoughts on this one!?” Mr. Stewart asked.

“Solid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,” read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.

A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.

“This is one of those moments that’s got your name written all over it,” Mr. Brennan sings. “You know that if I had just one wish, it’d be that you didn’t have to miss this.”

“You should be here.”

Derrick Taylor

A California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.

He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous — and honest.

When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father’s death. They remembered him as a kind of “second dad.”

“He was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,” Mr. Taylor said, “for who you could be and who you should be.”

Neysa Tonks

Neysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought “so much joy, fun and laughter” to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.

Her father, Chris Davis, told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Ms. Tonks was a devoted parent to her sons, Kaden, Braxton and Greysen, and a generous member of her community, every year delivering hundreds of backpacks with supplies to people who needed them.

Michelle Vo

Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn’t waste time.

In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies — paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland — she was determined to travel there by herself.

Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. “He was like, ‘You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,’” Ms. Lubin said. “She’s like a shark. She’s a go-getter. She’s so inspiring.”

Ms. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.

Kurt Von Tillow

Kurt Von Tillow, 55, was “the most patriotic person you’ve ever met,” his brother-in-law, Mark Carson, told KCRA, a local NBC News station for Cameron Park, Calif., the small town in the Sierra foothills near Sacramento where Mr. Von Tillow lived.

Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow’s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.

Mr. Von Tillow’s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. “That was probably the hardest part for her — having to leave him there,” he said.

On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.

“Guarantee you, he’s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,” Mr. Carson told the television station.

Bill Wolfe Jr.

Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Only Robyn came home.

“It is with the most of broken hearts, the families of Bill Wolfe Jr. and his wife Robyn share that Bill has been confirmed to be among the deceased as a result of the mass attack in Las Vegas,” the Shippensburg Police Department said on Facebook. “Please continue to hold our entire family as well as those affected across the nation in your unending prayers.”

Mr. Wolfe, 42 and a coach at Shippensburg Greyhound Wrestling, was also an employee of the engineering consulting firm Dewberry and a former president of the Shippensburg Wrestling Booster Club.

“He was just a good guy,” the current president of the booster club, Cory Forrester, told Penn Live. “He was a go-to kind of guy, a guy you could depend on, a kind of guy you could be proud to be around.”",The Victims of Las Vegas: Remembering Their Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/vegas-victims-names.html

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a longtime advocate for veterans, said she planned to look into the agency’s decision.","“It’s just reckless and sloppy,” said Walter M. Shaub Jr., a former director of the Office of Government Ethics, said of the agency’s action. He questioned why such a blanket exception for more than 330,000 agency employees should exist when the law allows waivers for individuals or even classes of individuals, like those teaching courses. Invoking the waiver also requires public hearings, he said.

Most troubling to Mr. Shaub, now senior counsel at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, is that the move seems like an attempt by the executive branch to overrule the legislative branch. “They are saying the statute is unreasonable, but that’s not for them to say,” he said of agency officials.

Curtis Cashour, a V.A. spokesman, said officials had focused on the ethics law after the agency’s inspector general investigated complaints this year that two V.A. employees were teaching at a for-profit institution. There were no significant conflicts and a waiver was ultimately granted, he said, but the report led to worries among many employees about the impact of more rigorous enforcement.

“Our response was aimed at easing the concerns of numerous V.A. employees,” Mr. Cashour said in an email, adding that the ethics law had been superseded by subsequent conflict-of-interest statutes.

One concern of critics is that officials at the organization’s upper levels could be making decisions about a college in which they have a financial interest, like permitting a school with a record of abuses to recruit at military bases. Another is that people advising veterans about their educational benefits could steer students to a particular school because they were on the payroll.

“There’s no good that can come from allowing colleges to have unseemly financial entanglements with V.A. employees,” Carrie Wofford, director of Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Congress enacted a zero tolerance for financial conflicts of interest for V.A. employees precisely because Congress uncovered massive fraud by for-profit colleges targeting veterans.”

She added that “student veterans were already facing an aggressive rollback of their protections under the Trump administration’s Education Department.”

Two months ago, the Republican-led Senate Appropriations Committee issued a report during its debate over the military budget instructing the department to review the statute — but its concern was that the current rules “may be inadequate to identify conflicts of interest that can develop” because of gifts or expensive meals.

Veterans are particularly valuable as potential students: There are limits on the federal funds that for-profit schools can receive, but money from the G.I. Bill is not counted.

Even before last year’s presidential election, some of the biggest veterans and military organizations were urging the department to better monitor for-profit colleges that were misleading veterans about the costs and benefits of enrolling, and violating legal and regulatory standards.

And a report issued in July by the director of the agency’s Education Service found that financial issues involving tuition and fees were by far the leading complaint among students who had called the agency’s G.I. Bill hotline since 2014.

Some ethics experts disagreed with the department’s contention that other federal statutes made the ethics law unnecessary, saying the agency’s rule sets a higher bar, requiring, for example, more public review.

Dozens of other agencies also have supplemental ethics rules that have been written to address potential problems specific to those agencies.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and a longtime advocate for veterans, said she planned to look into the agency’s decision. “I am deeply concerned the V.A. is opening the door for predatory for-profits to take advantage of men and women who have bravely served our country,” she said.",Veterans Agency Seeks to Scrap Ethics Law on For-Profit Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/business/veterans-affairs-ethics.html

More than that, boy, you’re risking everything.”

This “Strange Interlude” won’t be the longest straight play staged in New York in recent years — that honor belongs to Elevator Repair Service’s eight-hour “Gatz.” It’s certainly not the longest solo, clocking in at only a quarter of the length of Taylor Mac’s “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music.” But it is an occasionally lurid interwar ragout of sex, death and boat races. It is also probably one of the last times anyone decided to name a dashing romantic swain Gordon. Censored in New York and banned in Boston, the play nevertheless became an unlikely Broadway hit.

O’Neill joked that if the play were a sandwich it would be “a four-decker with nothing but ham.”

Mr. Greenspan has been chewing on that for a while now. In the summer of 2013, he, Transport Group’s artistic director, Jack Cummings III, its dramaturge Krista Corcoran Williams and a couple of associates met for an artistic residency in upstate New York. They’d all enjoyed working together on “The Patsy.” Now they wanted a project “to go deeper and further with,” Ms. Williams said.

So Mr. Greenspan read “Strange Interlude” aloud, which took him seven or eight hours. And the company agreed to produce it. Mr. Greenspan has been rehearsing ever since.

The published script runs 190 pages. Mr. Greenspan worked through the acts one at a time, putting in four to five hours a day, five to six days a week even while rehearsing, performing and touring other plays. Last year, Mr. Cummings gave him a cameo in his William Inge double-bill just to keep Mr. Greenspan around and on salary while he worked. This summer, while appearing in “Minor Character” in Connecticut, he requested a rehearsal space as part of his contract. “I had to memorize Act 8,” he said.

Mostly, Mr. Greenspan works at home, in the small one-bedroom in Westbeth Artists Housing that he shares with his partner, the teacher and painter William Kennon. He moves their furniture around to replicate the set and takes breathers to feed their two cats and one German Shepherd. Sometimes he borrows Mr. Kennon’s painting studio.

On a good five-hour day, he can learn perhaps two pages. But often it’s less. “Line by line,” he said. “Sometimes you learn just a few words, sometimes a sentence. It’s very deliberate.” Ms. Williams, who has often observed him, described the process as “mind-numbing and thrilling in kind of equal measure.”

Mr. Greenspan prizes accuracy. In rehearsal he scolded himself for missing “and” in one sentence, “the” in another. But for him, memorizing means more than rote learning or brute-force drills. It means discovering in each line “what the intentions are, what the feeling is, what the state of being is, what the emotional state is,” he said.

He tries to make his characters as full and real as possible, figuring out how they move, how they think, how they sound. From there he develops a map of each act, “like making up a dance in a way,” he said, a dance he then fine-tunes with Mr. Cummings and his team.

Sitting in the rehearsal room, he cycled though some of this choreography. He stuffed his hands into his pockets for Ned, then gave his neck a sensual stroke as Ned’s lover, Nina, then knit his fingers as Nina’s forbidding father, Professor Leeds. Each character was conjured with what looked like minimal effort and eerie, easy grace. Then Mr. Greenspan stood and played the bit where Ned hands the prescription to Sam. One man moved to offer it; another snatched it away. The effect was delightful, and also unnerving.

Ms. Williams said that watching the full production can feel “like you’re either on drugs or experiencing some kind of religious reckoning.”

“There is something that happens when you’re in the room that long with one person doing something this audacious,” she continued.

For Mr. Greenspan, the effects are mellower. When he finishes a run-through he feels “good afterward,” he said, “neither tired or exhilarated.” And if there is lingering excitement “a little herbal tea will, I think, handle that.”","A Eugene O’Neill Marathon: 1 Actor, 1 Script, 5 Hours",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/theater/david-greenspan-eugene-oneill-marathon-performance.html

Sea turtles, which take 25 to 30 years to reach reproductive age, lay their eggs in the open beach, under vegetation or at the base of a dune. The hurricane eroded key nesting beaches, washing away nests or flooding them with rainwater or seawater, Dr. Mansfield said.

Along two stretches of beach south of Cape Canaveral, more than 90 percent of incubating loggerhead nests were destroyed by the storm, representing about 25 percent of the season’s total.

Sea turtles may lay eggs several times a season. Loggerhead nesting tends to wrap up by August or September, while green turtle nesting may continue through part of the peak hurricane season, Dr. Mansfield said.

Loggerheads have laid only eight new nests at the refuge since the storm, while green turtles have laid 466.

Green turtles typically lay more nests in alternate years. Last year, Hurricane Matthew wiped out many nests, but it was a light laying season for the greens, so there were fewer nests to destroy, Dr. Mansfield said.

This year, with record numbers of green turtle nests on the northeastern coast of Florida — with 12,000 north of Cape Canaveral and more than 15,000 a bit farther south — huge numbers were lost, Dr. Ceriani said.

Hurricane Nate, which is bearing down on Florida’s Gulf Coast, is unlikely to have a huge impact, because the loggerheads that are more common in that area have already laid their nests for the season.

There may be some impact on remaining green turtle nests on the Atlantic coast if the storm hits hard on those beaches, “but I don’t expect it would be bad,” Dr. Ceriani said in a follow-up email.

Although the losses this year are significant, sea turtle populations will survive as long as the hits don’t keep coming, Dr. Mansfield said.

He had traveled from his small town in Utah to the Catskill Mountains, to a celebration of photography where he studied with such masters of photojournalism as Mary Ellen Mark, Greg Heisler and Jodi Cobb.

A local high school band in Jeffersonville was playing a thunderous welcome as he entered a large, partly built barn. Inside he was greeted by the festival’s mastermind: Eddie Adams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war photographer.

“Everybody who was anybody was there and I didn’t even know they existed,” said Mr. Rasmussen, now the director of photography for digital and print media at ESPN. “I went to this small agricultural college in Utah and didn’t know anybody, but in less than a week I left there with four or five lifelong friends. Sometimes you spend your whole life seeking your community and for me that was the moment that I found it.”

Mr. Rasmussen will return to Jeffersonville this weekend for the 30th Eddie Adams Workshop, which has since become one of the most important stops for up-and-coming photojournalists.

Mr. Adams died in 2004, but the workshop continues under the aegis of his wife, Alyssa Adams, and the assistance of around 150 volunteers. Some things have changed since the first session — Kodak slide film gave way to digital imagery in the late 1990s and audio and video have been added. Some sponsors have fallen away as the industry has withered, and while tuition is still free, students pay $375 for lodging.

The workshop is structured much as it was 30 years ago, with 10 groups of 10 students managed by a well-known photographer as team leader, a photo editor and a producer. This year, all the teams are led by photographers who were once students in the workshop.

For Jimmy Colton, a well-traveled photo editor who will be attending his 27th consecutive session this week, the workshop is about family. He calls himself Uncle Jimmy, and considers all 2,700 students he has worked with to be his nieces and nephews. The barn is also a place of family ghosts for Mr. Colton, whose brother Jay, and father, Sandy, both volunteered as photo editors before their deaths.

The core values of the workshop continue to be “a level of ethics beyond reproach, having great concern for your subjects and treating everyone as you would like to be treated,” Mr. Colton said.

Mr. Adams purchased the 64-acre farm in Jeffersonville in 1976 intending to convert it into a center for photography. But progress on rebuilding the ramshackle structures was slow as assignment work kept him busy. It was after he met Alyssa in 1983 that the plans for a free, merit-based workshop came together. They married shortly after the first workshop.

“This workshop is not a ‘how to,’ it’s more inspirational and aspirational,” Ms. Adams said. “This is a place where you can let your hair down and experiment a little as a student.”

The workshop does not romanticize photojournalism, and it acknowledges the price many photojournalists have paid while covering conflict. An annual memorial service for photographers who have died during war recognizes friends of Mr. Adams who were killed in Vietnam, like Henri Huet and Larry Burrows, as well as more recent casualties like Chris Hondros, who attended the 1993 workshop. An annual Award is given to a student by the Chris Hondros Foundation.

Recognizing colleagues who have been killed emphasizes that “the truth matters, pictures matter, and you can make a difference with your pictures not just in war,” said Nancy Andrews, who attended the first workshop in 1988 and has volunteered as a photo editor and will be a team leader this year. She returns for the sense of community and generosity, she said.

“I’m actually improved when you, my colleague, or you, my student, make a great picture” said Ms. Andrews, who was a Washington Post staff photographer and director of photography at The Detroit Free Press. “It’s not like there are finite numbers of great pictures out there and you stole one of them so now I can’t get one. It elevates the profession and I might be better as a result.”

Admission to the workshop, for students and professionals with less than three years’ experience is through portfolios judged by a panel of photo editors.

Not being included can be a difficult blow.

Ruth Fremson was among those young photographers who did not make the cut in the late 1980s. She remembers the rejection well, though she has since been part of three Pulitzer Prize-winning teams as a staff photographer for The Associated Press and starting in 2000 at The New York Times. While it is a great way “to jump-start your career, it is not the only way,” she said.

She has been a team leader at the workshop the last two years and is returning this weekend as a kitchen volunteer to help prepare food for the students.

“It’s such a gift to be able to participate in it because the team leaders and volunteers get as much out of the workshop as the students,” she said. “I’ve had the benefit of many great mentors who have championed my career and this is a great place to pay it forward.”

If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case.
“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.
Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them.
“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.","But American officials have appeared powerless to secure their release, and it has become increasingly clear that the detainees are potential bargaining chips in a long-running effort by Turkey to force the American government to extradite Mr. Gulen.

Mr. Erdogan himself seemed to confirm the suspicion last month, when he told a gathering of police officers in Ankara that he would hand over an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, once the United States gave him Mr. Gulen.

“They say, ‘Give us this certain pastor,’” he said, recounting his meeting with American officials. “You have another pastor in your hands; give him to us,” he railed.

If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case. “Give him to us and we will put yours through the judiciary; we will give him to you,” Mr. Erdogan said.

At the same time, Turkish officials have repeatedly insisted that the detainees are charged with serious crimes of terrorism and trying to overthrow the state, and that if they are not guilty, the courts will release them in due course.

A presidential aide said in a recent interview that the government had been surprised by the scale of the Gulen network, and believed it had infiltrated nearly every major institution of power. The aide added that the authorities now faced an enormous task to dismantle it. He spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the protocol of his position.

More than 50,000 Turks have been imprisoned and 150,000 more have been suspended from their jobs since the attempted coup in July 2016, which killed 249 people. The crackdown has stretched far beyond the immediate culprits and has swept up people with vague links to the Gulen movement.

The Americans are among them. For the families of the detainees, the drama has shifted from the surreal to deep dread.

Serkan Golge, 37, the NASA scientist of Turkish decent, was arrested in the first frenzy of suspicion and police activity after the coup attempt as he was vacationing in the sleepy southern town of Hatay.

Tipped off by a relative, the police arrested Mr. Golge outside his parent’s house as the family was leaving for the airport to return home to Houston.

At first, his relatives thought it was a bad dream. A year later, as a lengthy prison sentence appears imminent, they are in despair.

“His case is getting worse,” his wife, Kubra Golge, said tearfully in an interview as she cuddled her two small sons. “The lawyer said he no longer knows how to defend the case.”

Since then, she and her two sons, 7 and 19 months, all American citizens, have been barred from leaving the country.

The main evidence against her husband, she says, is the account he held at Bank Asya, a financial institution said to be owned by the Gulen movement, and a dollar bill found in his younger brother’s bedroom that is supposedly a secret sign of membership in the movement.

As the government has begun prosecuting hundreds of Turkish citizens on charges of instigating the coup, the pressure on the Americans and other foreigners has only hardened.

The missionary, Mr. Brunson, lived and raised a family for 23 years in the seaside city of Izmir before he was detained last October and accused of links to the Gulen movement. This summer, he was indicted on new charges of espionage, trying to overthrow the state and acting against the Constitution.

In a recent interview, a presidential adviser defended Mr. Brunson’s continued detention, saying that new evidence must have come to light to merit the additional charges.

But Ihsan Ozbek, the chairman of the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, a fellow pastor and a friend of Mr. Brunson’s, dismissed the accusations.

“Andrew was a normal American Christian; he is not a spy,” he said. “I know him; I know his wife and kids. It’s very sad.”

He suggested, as Western officials have, that foreigners like Mr. Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary, were being held as hostages for political reasons by Turkey. The new charges came soon after the White House intervention.

A NATO member and a long-term ally of the United States, Turkey would never have dared to arrest Americans in earlier times, said Clyde Forsberg, an American professor who was detained in August last year.

“I was arrested because I was an American,” he said by telephone from the Kyrgyz Republic, where he now lives. “The only reason I was released was because I got lucky. It was very early in the game.”

Accused of aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, Professor Forsberg was released after four days in jail for lack of evidence, and he immediately left the country. The case against him is still pending, and he could have ended up incarcerated for months like Mr. Brunson, he said.

“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.

But appeals by American officials, including Mr. Trump, may have only persuaded the Turkish president that he was holding valuable assets that could be used as leverage over the United States.

Mr. Erdogan has also expressed anger at American court cases brought against his personal bodyguards, who are charged with attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a case against a former minister of Turkey and three others charged with conspiring to violate sanctions against Iran.

Perhaps the most high-profile case may be that of Mr. Brunson. The American vice president, who shares Mr. Brunson’s faith, has shown particular interest in his fate. So have the nearly 80 members of Congress who signed a letter to Mr. Erdogan in February asking him to release the missionary and saying he had been unjustly detained.

“There appears to be no evidence to substantiate the charges against him for membership in an armed terrorist organization,” the letter said.

Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them. Turkish law regards them as Turkish citizens and ignores their rights as Americans.

United States consular staff members have been given only limited access to the Americans in Turkish prisons and have not been able to visit the Turkish-Americans, such as Mr. Golge, at all.

Among them are Ismail Kul, a chemistry professor from Widener University in Pennsylvania, and his brother Mustafa Kul, a real estate agent. They were arrested in August 2016 at their home in Bursa during their summer vacation. They are accused of being members of the Gulen movement and playing a part in the failed coup.

At his trial, which is continuing, Ismail Kul admitted knowing Mr. Gulen but exposed the shakiness of the government’s charges when he explained that it was a member of Mr. Erdogan’s own ruling Justice and Development Party, Ahmet Aydin, the deputy chairman of Parliament, who first took him to meet the cleric.

“In 2010 I met Ahmet Aydin at a culture festival in Philadelphia,” Mr. Kul told the court, the nationalist daily newspaper Sozcu reported in January. “I had breakfast with him and his detail. They told me that they will see Gulen and suggested that I accompany them. That’s how I met Fethullah Gulen. After that, I visited Gulen four or five times.”

The United States Embassy in Turkey has expressed dismay that even local employees working at United States consulates have been swept up.

It issued a statement on Thursday saying that it was “deeply disturbed” at the arrest of a locally employed staff member in Istanbul. He was identified as Metin Topuz by the Turkish state news media, which said he was accused of having ties to Gulen members, spying and attempting to overthrow the government.

“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.

The spokesman for Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, Huseyin Muftuoglu, confirmed that Mr. Topuz had been detained on terror charges Sept. 25, but contended that he was neither a staff member of the American Consulate nor entitled to diplomatic or consular immunity.

Another United States Consulate employee, Hamza Ulucay, who had worked for 36 years in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was detained in February and accused of having contacts with the Gulen movement and the outlawed Kurdish movement, the PKK.

Ms. Golge, 33, the wife of the detained NASA scientist, remains deeply shaken over the trial of her husband, who is expected to be sentenced this month. She describes the shock of his arrest as being like an amputation.

Her American life is gone. She lives with her husband’s parents and visits the prison once a week for a 45-minute chat on a phone through a glass window.

At NASA, her husband was put on unpaid leave. Unable to keep up their mortgage payments, she is selling their house in Houston.

Her husband is resigned, Ms. Golge said. “He is very sad,” she added. “He says, ‘I feel a lot of pain in my heart, but I know it is going to pass.’”

Diplomats and their underlings have brokered deals for weapons and drugs, and more mundane products like machine tools and cows. They have also smuggled liquor, cigarettes, luxury cars and anything else that can be imported duty free and then sold at a gain.

“My late father-in-law was an ambassador,” said Marcus Noland, who studies North Korea and is executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “and he told me that in India, years ago, it was known within the diplomatic corps that if you wanted to buy beef, you could knock on the backdoor of the North Korean embassy in Delhi. They ran an abattoir in the basement.”

Earning money is a necessity for the embassies — North Korea doesn’t fund them. Instead, they are expected to support themselves and send home any surplus.

Despite the sanctions it is under, North Korea did $6.5 billion in trade last year. Analysts estimate that embassy revenues represent a small sum compared with the country’s other low-profile foreign ventures.

Those included cadres of bodyguards leased to dictators who don’t trust their own citizens, laborers dispatched to work sites around the world who must remit their wages and state-owned companies that export ballistic missiles and other arms to countries like Syria.

In some cases, diplomats get involved with weapons deals. The third private secretary of the North Korean embassy in Beijing doubled as an employee of the Haegeumgang Trading Company. The company, according to a United Nations report, supplied surface-to-air missiles and radar systems to Mozambique. Haegeumgang also sold machine tools, and an ad in 2014 for those products on a Chinese website listed the company headquarters at the same address as the North Korean embassy in Beijing.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to faxed questions.

Diplomats for the country have been ad hoc entrepreneurs since at least 1976. That year, Norway’s police found through surveillance that every member of the North Korean embassy in Oslo was involved in the import and sale of as many as 10,000 bottles of spirits and 100,000 cigarettes.

Today, sanctions have forced many embassies to curb their ambitions, with some intent on keeping the lowest possible profile.

The North Korean embassy in London sits unobtrusively in Ealing, a suburb-like section of London, just another brick house in a row of them. The difference is a small sign, barely visible from outside the wrought iron fence: “Residence and office, embassy of D.P.R. Korea.”

Aside from black luxury sedans in the driveway, there are rarely signs of life in the building, even to neighbors.

“I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of there,” said Ali Wiseman, a student who lives in a group house two doors down. “And I’ve been here a year.”

His roommate, Rupert Thomson, has seen people there. “I once saw three women working on the lawn out front and they did everything to not look at me,” he said.

The way that the London embassy sustains itself is a mystery. One theory comes from Kim Joo-il, a former member of the North Korean military who defected and moved to London in 2007. He said he often saw embassy employees at a type of Sunday flea market called a car-boot sale.

“They are always there buying secondhand electronics, toys, dolls, kitchen goods,” Mr. Kim said through an interpreter, seated at a restaurant he owns in a London suburb. “Some of these things they are cleaning up and fixing to resell, others they are sending home to North Korea.”

North Korean embassies in the former eastern bloc, where the missions were long ago granted generous square footage, have a more lucrative stratagem.

In Poland, 40 businesses are listed at the address of the North Korean embassy in Warsaw, including a pharmaceutical company, several advertising agencies and a yacht club. How many of these businesses are actually staffed there is unclear.

In Sofia, the embassy owns a number of buildings on two separate properties. One is a complex that includes the embassy itself. Passers-by can pause at a glass display case — standard issue for embassies in the city — filled with photographs. One captures the Supreme Leader beaming at a crowd, others were of missiles that had just been launched.

The event space, known as Terra Residence, is a 15-minute walk east. It’s the former home of the North Korean ambassador, built in the 1980s with dazzle instead of comfort in mind. Photos on Terra’s promotional website show an interior that is essentially a communist take on Versailles — a series of huge and austere halls with chandeliers, gold curtains and paintings of ballerinas.

Terra rents out the space for magazine photo sessions, music videos and television ads, including a handful for national banks and one for the Bulgarian version of “Celebrity Apprentice.” Its main business is weddings, proms and corporate events.

Few attendees, it seems, realize they are spending the evening on North Korean property.

“I knew it was a former embassy building, but I had no idea it was owned by North Korea,” said Bilyana Dimitrova, who attended a friend’s wedding at Terra in September. “The atmosphere was very pleasant.”

A spokeswoman for Terra, Anelia Baklova, wrote in an email that the company has had a long-term lease with the embassy of North Korea that predates the imposition of economic sanctions. When the U.N. approved stricter sanctions, this year and last, Terra “froze” its payments, she said. The company has not been evicted, she wrote, because of the “considerable amount of money” it had spent on renovations and upkeep.

Emails to the embassy were not returned.

Some countries have succeeded in shutting down businesses that rent from North Korea. In May, Germany closed a youth hostel that was operating in what was originally North Korean diplomatic quarters.

The governments of Poland and Bulgaria have so far been unable to end the ancillary activities. A spokesman for the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had repeatedly raised the issue of renting out space with North Korean officials here, urging them to “use properties in Sofia solely for diplomatic and consular activities.”

Terra, unlike its landlord, has tried to become a more agreeable neighbor. People who live across the street say that notices are now taped on the doors of their apartment building a day before there will be fireworks, giving a heads up and promising that the show will end by 10 p.m.

Surprisingly, residents didn’t seem particularly vexed about living near an enterprise that has pumped money into the world’s most repressive and notorious regime. But that may say more about Bulgaria’s government than the dangers of North Korea.

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Like many other frivolous things on the island these days, the shiny motorcycles at the Planet Honda showroom have been pushed to the side.

In their place are dozens of folding chairs, and on Thursday morning, they were all filled with Puerto Ricans waiting to buy the most essential machines on the post-hurricane landscape: portable generators, to light their powerless homes.

María Aguilera, 57, a teacher, was waiting in the line that had formed outside the showroom Thursday morning. When the sun sets these days, she said, she relies on candles for light. And like everyone else in Puerto Rico — including Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló — Ms. Aguilera said she had no idea when the power grid might be restored.

“From the things I’ve seen with the infrastructure,” she said, “it could be months.”

Hurricane Maria’s near total destruction of the commonwealth’s electric power grid has transformed Puerto Rico into Generator Island. Running on gas or diesel, and ranging from lawn mower to moving-truck size, the generators are the only option for the roughly 90 percent of the island that has no access to the decimated grid. Generators now power big-box stores, high-rise apartment buildings, auto shops, fast-food restaurants, wastewater treatment plants and little country homes. And their low, incessant groan is the new drone note in the discordant symphony of post-storm Puerto Rican life.

The generators are a temporary fix that is raising health and safety concerns and highlighting the stark divisions of class in a place with a 45 percent poverty rate. They are also the only option for most Puerto Ricans for now, as the island struggles with restoring its electrical system — by far the most important and complex challenge the storm has presented.

In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Rosselló could not say when the system, which was infamously fragile before the storm, would be fully restored.

“There is no estimated date right now,” he said. “We have established, right at the beginning of this week, we want to have 10 percent of the energy generation in Puerto Rico. Now we’re up to 10.6 percent. And our expectation is, within the next month, to have 25 percent.”

Many big-box stores and hardware stores are selling out of generators for home use. Julito Ramírez, the Planet Honda general manager, said that his company was having a hard time keeping up with demand, selling 250 to 300 units per day. After ordering all of the generators he could find in the United States, he has turned to a cache he found in Canada.

“We are in that cycle of finding and bringing, and finding and bringing,” Mr. Ramírez said. The generator everyone wants, he said, is a $6,000 model that can run a home air-conditioning system. The biggest model he had in stock this week was a $2,300 machine that can run a refrigerator, some lights, a washing machine — but not an air conditioner.

For one customer, Victor Negrón, it would have to do. He said his old generator had given out two days earlier. “I’ve had to go to hotels to charge my phones,” said Mr. Negrón, 50, a health care executive. “We’ve lost all of the food in our refrigerator.”

The storm destroyed 85 percent of the island’s energy transmission and distribution system, and the fix could cost $5 billion, said Ricardo Ramos, chief executive of the beleaguered Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. The public utility is saddled with $9 billion in debt and filed for bankruptcy in July. The Puerto Rican government also filed a form of bankruptcy in May.

The Trump administration has asked Congress to approve a $29 billion aid package for Puerto Rico, as well as for hurricane-damaged Florida and Texas. But in the days after September 20, when Hurricane Maria strafed Puerto Rico, Prepa’s money troubles made it “almost impossible” to pay the large contracts required to bring in other states’ power companies to help restore the grid, said José E. Sánchez, a director with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the head of the task force to restore power in Puerto Rico.

“It is not only personnel, but all the trucks and materials,” Mr. Sánchez said in an email. “That could cost millions of dollars.”

But Meena Dayak, a spokeswoman for the American Public Power Association, the trade group that coordinates the state-to-state mutual aid networks for public power utilities, said that Prepa never reached out to them for help.

“The way our mutual aid works is we can only go in if help has been requested,” she said over the phone on Friday.

Mr. Ramos, Prepa’s chief executive, said he did request help but when none came, he hired a Montana-based company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, to restore many of the power lines. Mr. Ramos said 200 subcontractors were already on the ground.

Andy Techmanski, chief executive of Whitefish, said that a shortage of housing for his crews meant that only 75 were on the island, and that clogged ports were making it a challenge to bring in heavy equipment.

He also said it would take six months or longer for all of Puerto Rico to have its power restored.

The rebuilding will be particularly difficult because many lines stretch across the island’s mountainous interior. There is also the question of whether Puerto Rico should modernize its rickety and outmoded system while it rebuilds. On Friday, the governor said that a modernization effort would “run parallel” with the effort to simply restore power. He said he has begun speaking with Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, about ways to increase green energy options for Puerto Rico, which received just 2 percent of its power from renewable sources before the storm. (Mr. Musk said on Twitter Thursday that rebuilding the island’s grid with independent solar and battery systems “could be done.”)

But Mr. Sánchez said that the assignment from the Federal Emergency Management Authority is to repair the system only. “We are there to repair-replace, but not to augment,” he said.

As he waited to buy his generator, Mr. Negrón sympathized with the governor. The island needed a better power system, he said. But people did not want to wait. His mother, he said, “wants her electric now.”

In the meantime, the generators rumble on, though not without problems. A few blocks from the Honda store, the Hospital San Francisco has had two generators fail since the storm, resulting in the evacuation of patients, according to El Nuevo Dia, a local newspaper. In a visit to the hospital Thursday, the lights were on, and a worker said a backup generator was powering them. But hospital officials declined a request for comment.

Across town at the Costco, Juan Torres, an assistant manager, showed off the massive, truck-size generator that the business, like many here, had installed before the storm. Mr. Torres said it was burning 1,000 gallons of diesel per day.

But Mr. Torres said that home generators normally offered at the store were sold out.

Across the island, the Army Corps of Engineers has set up 34 huge generators so far, running everything from police departments to water pumping facilities to a Prepa office, according to Lisa Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Corps. Corps officials said on Friday that 177 other generators arrived late in the week, with some of them headed to the United States Virgin Islands.

Camilla Feibelman, a founder of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Sierra Club who currently runs the Rio Grande chapter, said that Facebook was full of complaints about the generator noise on the island these days.

More seriously, she said, generators can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning when misused — a common concern among officials in post-storm environments. Last month, three people in Orange County, Fla., died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside their homes.

Adriana González, a Sierra Club organizer in Puerto Rico, said the high cost of a generator “creates a disparity” between rich and poor. In her neighborhood, she said, “you have one house illuminated, and then total darkness for like a block.”

Mr. Ramírez, the Honda store manager, said that some generators were stolen from the showroom in the days just after the storm. So the store now makes the sale in the showroom, then has customers pick up their generators from a warehouse a day later.

If nothing else, it is a good time to be a generator repairman like José Miguel Márquez, 35. Mr. Márquez said he was so busy these days that the biggest problem is finding time to deposit his checks at the bank.","Minus Electrical Grid, Puerto Rico Becomes Generator Island",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/puerto-rico-power-generators.html

The apocalyptic fear aroused by the recent destructive hurricanes is the latest manifestation of the mounting dread that has taken hold in the American mind-set about the implications of our steadily warming planet.

So yes again, hurricanes have now become a central component of what I call the climate swerve: the powerful shift in our awareness of climate truths. The swerve is a change in collective consciousness that includes a coherent narrative of global warming, of cause and effect and of steps necessary for mitigation. The swerve forces us to look upon ourselves as members of a single species in deep trouble.

This mind-set is evident in public opinion surveys, in the reporting of catastrophes that regularly invoke the influence of global warming, in growing doubts about a carbon economy and in challenges to the morality of extracting and burning underground fossil fuel resources.

The Paris climate conference of December 2015 was a stunning demonstration of the reach and force of the climate swerve. Virtually every nation in the world joined in what could be called a species-wide recognition of global warming and its dangers, each putting forward a promised goal of reduced carbon emissions. True, Paris was more a demonstration of universal climate awareness than an enforceable treaty. But the mind-set it expressed is crucial for all subsequent climate action.

And that mind-set could not be readily defied, as President Trump has learned. His determination to withdraw from the agreement was no surprise, since he had long rejected the idea of climate change as nonexistent, not human-caused or a hoax. What was perhaps surprising was the immediate and overwhelming reaction to his announcement of the American withdrawal. The decision was widely denounced in this country by governors who declared that their states would hold to the Paris protocols, and by mayors who said the same of their cities. It was also condemned abroad. France, Germany and Italy insisted that the Paris momentum was “irreversible,” and China asserted that it would follow the protocols no matter what the United States did.

What followed were clarifications by the White House having to do with renegotiation and continuing to attend climate meetings — all amounting to equivocation and leaving the whole issue of withdrawal confused.

It would seem that the climate swerve is greater than any individual person, even one as dangerous to the world as Donald Trump. And while the climate swerve may ebb and flow, it is gathering momentum and will have to be reckoned with for generations.

The string of hurricanes we experienced recently and can expect again in the future raises a crucial question about the kind of adaptation we make to climate change. Of course we must prepare for extreme climate conditions, with special attention to coastal areas and flood plains, and to restrictions on what and how we build or rebuild in those areas.

But to do only that would neglect the primary cause of our danger, and would do nothing to prevent ever more lethal expressions of global warming. The climate swerve moves us to focus on the adaptation of our entire species. That would require meeting the Paris pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and going further in making renewable energies a dominant force in national and world economies. In that inclusive form of adaptation, the human species becomes our operative group, and we do all we can to bring our historical and psychological imagination to the task.

We have squandered opportunities to reduce global warming and there has already been more suffering from climate change than we have allowed ourselves to recognize. But we can still avert civilization-ending catastrophe, and even achieve a modest new beginning for our species.

But the nature of the Cold War, especially early on, complicated things.
Since part-time students did not receive deferments, men could not take semesters off to earn tuition money or recover from academic probation.
The doctors performing the cursory exams at pre-induction physicals often failed to detect health defects that would have guaranteed exemptions from military service.
Instead, they learned to work a system designed to encourage them to see military service as a personal choice rather than an obligation.","Deferments are a necessary element of any system of selective military service. If a nation does not require all of its citizens to participate in the armed forces, then someone must decide who goes and who stays. Deferments allow those with skills needed on the home front to exempt themselves from their military obligations because, especially during the upheaval of war, they ensure a viable domestic economy and stable society. Factories, hospitals and schools, for example, can operate only when fully staffed with skilled employees. Farmers and agricultural workers maintain necessary food supplies. In theory, deferments should be limited only to those considered more valuable to war aims as civilians than as soldiers.

But the nature of the Cold War, especially early on, complicated things. Defeating Communism was more than a military endeavor; the home front became a crucial site of defense operations. Americans believed that triumph over the Soviet Union required a prolonged ideological, technological and economic struggle. The circumstances of the Cold War, therefore, granted the Selective Service System license to use deferments as a tool of social engineering.

Hershey believed that all able-bodied American men had the obligation to serve the nation, but he began to advocate a definition of service that included civilian pursuits, particularly in science, mathematics and engineering. Throughout the 1950s, the perception that the United States was in danger of falling behind the Soviets caused national panic, especially after the U.S.S.R. successfully launched its Sputnik satellite in 1957. According to politicians and intellectuals, American superiority rested on outpacing Soviet technological development, both in the domestic realm and in the military sector. The Army’s strategic plans for countering atomic attack depended on the invention of new weapons, while consumer capitalism required new products to buy and sell. The United States needed a steady supply of men in STEM fields to develop the state-of-the-art appliances and futuristic weapons systems that it so desperately wanted.

In Hershey’s view, the Selective Service was the “storekeeper” of America’s manpower supply. He believed that the promise of deferments could be used as a tool to coerce — or bribe — men to go to college and enter occupations defined as in the national interest. In the words of one planning memo, the Selective Service could use the “club of induction” to “drive” individuals into “areas of greater importance.” This policy, known as manpower channeling, specifically defined these pursuits as service to the state on a par with military service.

The availability of deferments for men attending college and in professional fields ballooned. Occupational deferments increased by 650 percent between 1955 and 1963. But men had to qualify for higher education and be able to pay for it. Since part-time students did not receive deferments, men could not take semesters off to earn tuition money or recover from academic probation. Eligible occupations skewed toward those with college degrees. Unlike during World War II, most factory and agricultural workers could not gain occupational deferments by the late 1950s. Such dispensations were reserved for scientists, engineers, doctors and teachers.

Even those deferments theoretically available to anyone really were not. Medical deferments, for example, were harder for poorer men to obtain. The doctors performing the cursory exams at pre-induction physicals often failed to detect health defects that would have guaranteed exemptions from military service. And if men did not have a record of private medical care, they had little recourse when declared available for service.

By 1965, many middle-class men had come to expect deferments. Military service, to them, was for “suckers” who had made poor choices. Working-class men, of course, were not “suckers.” Rather, Great Society policies meant to strengthen the economy by alleviating poverty ended up targeting them for military service.

Policy makers in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations began to focus on America’s poor as the weak link between national strength and the promise of democracy. Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz identified the Selective Service as an “incomparable asset” in locating men who could benefit from government aid. Virtually all American men underwent a pre-induction exam. Approximately one-third failed. Such “rejectees” were overwhelmingly from poor and minority backgrounds. In early January 1964, less than two months after taking office, Johnson ordered the Selective Service, the Department of the Army, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to address the problem.

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara actively wanted the armed forces to be part of the solution. He firmly believed that military service could be used to “rehabilitate” men caught in the cycle of poverty. He, along with Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan, argued that military training freed poor men from the “squalid ghettos of their external environment” and the “internal and more destructive ghetto of personal disillusionment and despair.” McNamara wanted a program that would bolster national security by eliminating a source of social unrest and benefit American combat readiness by boosting the number of men in uniform.

In August 1966, he announced the Defense Department’s intention to bring up to 100,000 previously ineligible men into the military each year to “salvage” them. Project 100,000, as it came to be known, would “rescue” poor and especially minority men from the “poverty-encrusted environments” in which they had been raised. These so-called New Standards men — who were otherwise ineligible for military service — were to be admitted into all branches of the armed forces, both voluntarily through enlistment and involuntarily through the draft.

Over all, all branches of service added a combined total of 354,000 New Standards men to their active-duty rosters between 1966 and 1971, when the program ended. Forty percent of these men were black, at a time when the entire military averaged only 9 percent African- American. McNamara hoped that a stint in the military would make New Standards men better husbands, better fathers and better breadwinners, and thus better citizens. Most ended up as infantrymen in Vietnam.

It was no coincidence that those men who already fit the middle-class mold of domestic masculinity — those men who were college students or teachers or scientists — received deferments. Midcentury liberals believed such men did not need the military to lift them up. Meanwhile, every slot filled by a New Standards man was one a middle-class man avoided.

Ultimately, what made sense during the militarized peace of the Cold War did not during a hot war. Many middle-class men did not consider it their responsibility to serve in the military, especially in a war they often categorized as somewhere on the continuum between unnecessary and immoral. Instead, they learned to work a system designed to encourage them to see military service as a personal choice rather than an obligation. Working-class men simply were not offered the same option.",How the Draft Reshaped America,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/vietnam-draft.html

“We were not bound by the specific casting conditions required of a professional production,” he said.

Mr. Ward said he and his team searched their local theater and community groups, contacted agents representing diverse actors and combed local hip-hop and salsa dance studios in search of cast members.

“While Brisbane has only a small Latinx community, and an even smaller community of Latinx musical theater performers,” Mr. Ward said, “we do have a rich and vast multicultural heritage, and this was proudly reflected in our casting of the work.”

But while one of the lead actresses, Stephie Da Silva, who was cast to play Vanessa, is Uruguayan, most of the other actors cast in top roles were not Latino and looked white. Usnavi, the character originally played by Mr. Miranda, was to be played by Jason Bentley.

The producers initially defended their casting decisions, pointing out in a statement that “50 percent of the cast identified with an ancestry other than Australian” — including Mr. Bentley, who is part Samoan.

But as the response to the show spread online and beyond, the producers decided to pull the plug.

Ms. Da Silva, the cast member who was born and raised in Uruguay, said she was disappointed to see the show canceled.

“This was a lesson for many,” she said, noting that minorities and actors involved in the show all ended up feeling hurt. She added: “It’s time to educate ourselves more when it comes to racial and cultural awareness.”

In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn’t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses “machine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists” to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is “better” based on “current trends and what flatters you.”

The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon’s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.

It’s these kinds of intersections – like this small collision between robot “helpfulness” and a latent commercial agenda — that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not “Alexa.” She’s a corporate algorithm in a black box.

Grace doesn’t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future — preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer “people.”

Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: “Hey, Alexa, how old are you?” and “What are you?” Some thought the device had multiple personalities. “She doesn’t know the answer,” said one child, wisely. “Ask the other Alexa.”

Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.

How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?

Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn’t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear — and many more even important things in life — my job? I decided to retire Alexa to the closet.",Co-Parenting With Alexa,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/children-alexa-echo-robots.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“People are finding it harder and harder to take risks,” said Ms. Roumanos, who started Photoville with her husband, Sam Barzilay, and Dave Shelly. “Some galleries and festivals look to whoever is more established or could potentially make money. We are really strong believers that we want to create an even playing field for everyone.”

The free New York Portfolio Review was created in 2013 to spur opportunities for outstanding photographers from around the world, regardless of class, race, gender, ethnic background or sexual orientation. The photographers exhibited in the emergicubes hail from Ethiopia, Kenya, Singapore, Venezuela, Columbia, Nigeria, Mexico, Egypt, Scotland, Colorado and New York.

The emergicubes feature the following projects:



Amr Alfiky: “Psychology of Hatred,” which is about his journey as an Egyptian photographer exploring religiosity, racism and hate across the United States.

Kirsten Leah Bitzer: “Jason & Rachel,” a long-term photo documentary project that follows a triple-amputee veteran and his wife as they pursue in vitro fertilization to start a family.

Cinthya Santos Briones: “Abuelas: Portraits of the Invisible Grandmothers,” a series of portraits of undocumented Mexican immigrant women who came to live in New York City in their youth and, over time, became grandmothers. The portraits are taken in their homes, focusing on how they want to show themselves in their most intimate spaces.

Adriana Loureiro Fernandez: “Paradise Lost,” which documents the political chaos that continues to upend her homeland, Venezuela.

Emily Macinnes: “The New Scots,” which explores the integration of Syrian refugees into Scotland as they are relocated to both urban centers and small remote islands.

Andres Millan: “The New Gold,” a conceptual work that explores the relationship between man and his environment using gold as a metaphor for wealth and lust.

Eloghosa Osunde: “And Now We Have Entered Broken Earth,” a conceptual story exploring familial relationships, intergenerational cycles and the effects of blood and genealogy on individual identities.

Charmaine Poh: “Room,” a series of portraits, self-portraits and letters exploring the transition from girlhood to womanhood in Singapore.

Aron Simeneh: “The Patriots Story,” a portrait series that explores the rarely told history of living Ethiopian Patriots, who proudly fought against the Italian army during the five-year occupation (1935-1941) in Ethiopia under the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

Biko Wesa: “The Smallest Library in Africa,” which tells the story of Peter Otieno, a Kenyan who saw the need to address one of the main problems in his community — access to books — and prompted him to build the tiniest library in the continent.

Austin Willis: “A Beautiful Abstraction,” a series of portraits that represent his “love for fine art and photography brought together, depicting how I see the world and the people around me,” he said.

Perched on the edge of Suttle Lake, a 20-minute drive from the tiny town of Sisters, the lodge was renovated last year by some of the team behind the Ace Hotel in Portland; the result, which reopened late last summer, emanates a sort of Wes Anderson Goes Glamping vibe.

The Boathouse also sports a cool-kid pedigree: its menu was designed by Joshua McFadden, the executive chef at and co-owner of Ava Gene’s and a founding partner at Tusk, two of Portland’s buzziest restaurants. “It would be so easy to put a world-class restaurant in that location, but for me it would feel like such an injustice,” Mr. McFadden said of the Suttle Lodge. Instead, he continued, his guiding principle was “let’s do the basics and do them really, really well.”

From Splinter: Welcome to the United States of Snitches, land of the petty, home of the brazen — at least when they’re anonymous. Except they aren’t when they call the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (Voice) hotline run by the federal government. This report not only documents Americans dropping a dime on their neighbors, it reveals that Voice stupidly posted online personal identity details, even Social Security numbers, of both complainants and accused. In most cases there weren’t even crimes involved, viz.: “Caller requested to report her mother-in law and sister-in law. Caller stated these individuals came to the U.S. as tourists and stayed in the U.S. in order to get legal status.” — Rod Nordland, international correspondent at large

The Making of a Scoop

From Politico: Over the past several weeks, Politico smoked the competition in Washington with a series of stories about the private jet travel of Tom Price, President Trump’s health secretary. After Mr. Price resigned, the two reporters who broke open this story wrote about how much time, energy and resources went into their investigation. In an era where news outlets are struggling to stay afloat, there are no better examples of why it’s so important to have beat reporters who can zero in on a big target when needed. — Katie Rogers, correspondent

Citizenship 101

From Chronicle of Higher Education: Why do we hear of speech suppressed even at UC Berkeley, calls for “some muscle” to intimidate a student journalist and campus trials that ignore the rights of accused? Because, according to this professor overseeing Columbia University’s core curriculum, too many students are never taught the basics of liberal democracy — indeed, are even encouraged to sneer at it.

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans.","Painting didn’t pay the bills, and so she ran a boardinghouse where her tenants ranged from “inanimate, mincing ninnies” to “door slammers.” The house, which is on Simcoe Street, is around the corner from the Emily Carr House, with its small rooms crammed with books, prints, old china, furniture and, in high season, Emily Carr fans.

In cooler months, the house is closed, but do walk by; in the yard, you might glimpse the “Elephant,” the trailer-like caravan that Carr acquired in 1933 for sketching trips.

But inspiration was also nearer at hand: Beacon Hill Park, the subject of many Carr paintings. Western red cedars, Douglas firs, ponds, peacocks, frothy fountains and stone bridges (one is named for Carr): It is an enchanting park, and, occasionally, a place of high drama. As we strolled, a terrible screeching arose. It was nesting season, and dozens of great blue herons burst from the mid-reaches of some tall trees. The reason for their frenzy: a bald eagle circling overhead patiently, menacingly. It was a drama that showed no signs of abating by the time we left.

Photo

When Emily was a teenager, her mother died, and she became mysteriously distant from her father. Though she would remain close to her older sisters and had a few friends, loneliness remained a constant theme in her journals; marriage and a life of afternoon tea at the Empress seemed unlikely and undesirable. She once compared herself to “a lone old tree.”

But she also took pleasure in solitude, writing stories deep into the night, and sketching during the day. Though her work received praise, she trusted none of it. Success for her was a complex, spiritual matter; the business of melding art and godliness was an unending quest.

And, of course, she had her animals for company: a Javanese monkey who got into all sorts of trouble, multiple dogs and a white rat.

Photo

And then there was the forest. “I sought my companionship out in the woods and trees rather than persons,” she wrote. “It was as if they had hit and hurt me … so that I went howling back like a smacked child to Mother Nature.”

And so, with the aid of the Elephant, she began producing some of her best work as she entered her 60s. “Nothing ever, ever stands still,” she wrote, “and we never, never catch up.”

It doesn’t take long to find wilderness on Vancouver Island. On yet another overcast afternoon, we pulled into a parking lot about 10 miles outside Victoria, and walked down a wide trail. This was Goldstream Provincial Park, more than 900 acres of Douglas fir, cedar, hemlock and other trees; through it all runs a river where salmon spawn each fall.

Photo

Emily Carr loved to anthropomorphize; after reading about brown-eyed lilies and screaming trees, it was easy to imagine that the giant fern fronds on the trail weren’t just brushing against our legs, but reaching out beseechingly, or at least curiously, trying to get as much a visceral sense of us as we were of them.

In 1933, Emily had the Elephant towed to the Goldstream River flats, and there she settled down for a lengthy visit. It wasn’t her first. A few years earlier she had been there, producing sketches in which, say, a cedar branch was not a static thing, but a moving wave of foliage. (One of her most famous works, “Red Cedar,” illustrates this effort.)

No doubt she expected to experience the same productivity two years later, but a parade of parkgoers wasn’t helping. “They started early this morning — the Public,” she wrote. “The air is riled up with motor snorts, dog parks and children’s screechings.” Add to that the antics of Woo, her monkey — who consumed her green paint and had to be treated with Epsom salts — and the rain and the darkness. “I am not afraid, but it’s creepy,” she wrote, before leaving.

Photo

To us, nothing seemed creepy, and there were few people. We arrived at the visitor’s center, which smelled of damp, fragrant wood. Everything inside, it seemed, had been made either by or for visiting school children: Nature paintings hung on the walls, and exhibits — most of them handmade — focused on things like bald eagle counts and the salmon life cycle. Outside, a deck overlooked the river; in the distance, three eagles soared above the trees.

A volunteer with a lined, sunny face expressed enthusiasm for our driving trip to the island’s western side — a trip I was nervous about after reading online warnings about the dangers of washed-out roads, aggressive logging-truck drivers and frequent rain. She brushed it all aside. “Nothing but ocean till you get to Japan!” she said of the views from the wild western coast, then gave us directions to a nearby waterfall, advising us to ignore the high safer path, and to walk instead along the dry riverbed. It was a precarious walk on slippery stones, and rain was beginning to fall, but finally, the waterfall appeared. I saw my friend far ahead of me, her jacket a tiny red smudge below the trees and the falls. Everything here was big.

We drove on, toward Albert Head Lagoon, located in a populated area where the prospects of transformative beauty weren’t promising. As it turns out, Albert Head, its beach edged with trees and strewn with driftwood, is an understated arc of paradise on this developed shore. Here and nearby, Carr found fodder for luminous sky and sea paintings such as “Strait of Juan de Fuca” and “Lagoon at Albert Head,” in which she unleashed an incredible range of colors.

Photo

Our goal was to reach the artsy resort town of Sooke before night fell, but we decided to backtrack in hopes of finding Esquimalt Lagoon. On the way, we stumbled upon the Royal Roads Forest, a hauntingly beautiful woodland where some of the largest Douglas firs on the island are found. We wandered in the cool, dark forest, forgetting about our schedule.

The lagoon itself is a fragile place, a bird sanctuary protected by a wisp of land. Carr, seduced by the “wide sweeps of sea and sky,” arrived here on a beautiful spring day in 1934. Her caravan was deposited on a field of daisies. “Woo rolls among the daisies with her four hands in the air,” she wrote happily. But that night, an epic storm rolled in: “Everything inside blew out and outside things blew in till in and out were all mixed up.” Soon enough, the caravan was hauled to higher ground on a farmer’s field.

A few years later she would return to this area off the coast, and find inspiration in something that was basically ugly: gravel pits. Paintings called “Above the Gravel Pit,” show scenes of denuded land and tree stumps, all beneath a brilliant, rippled sky. There would be more paintings of bare landscapes, some with spindly second- or third-growth trees struggling upward beneath a blue sky.

Photo

In this period, Maria Tippett writes in her biography, Carr approached the sketching or painting process ritualistically: Sitting on her camp stool, she might light a cigarette, sing a hymn, then “raise her gaze slightly above and just beyond her subject, so that it was out of focus. Then, with her sketching-board on her lap and brush or charcoal in her hand, she would strike out with her arm and wrist and with curved or slashing motions make great sweeping strokes.…”

Michelle Jacques, the chief curator at the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria said that the environmentally themed exhibition, “Picturing the Giants: The Changing Landscapes of Emily Carr” — which includes Carr’s two gravel pit paintings — is based on “the hypothesis that Carr was thinking about logging and environmental issues in a real way.” In British Columbia, Ms. Jacques noted, there are currently many concerns: debates over an oil pipeline and increased shipping, salmon farming, land and resource rights for indigenous groups and, of course, protection of forests.

“There’s a torn and splintered ridge across the stumps I call the ‘screamers,’ Carr wrote. “These are the unsawn last bits, the cry of the tree’s heart, wrenching and tearing apart just before she gives that sway and the dreadful groan of falling, that dreadful pause while her executioners step back with their saws and axes resting and watch.”

Photo

Later on our trip, those words would resonate.

We arrived in Sooke an hour before sunset, too late to explore Sooke Hills, which Emily had visited. We stayed at a rambling hotel on the wedding circuit with wide porches overlooking the water. On a Monday, it was nearly empty. By the water four harbor seals bobbed and rolled between moored boats. The clouds had dispersed, revealing a Prussian blue sky and the glimmer of stars. Here, in an area where the weather is notoriously moody, the clear skies that had evaded us in the supposedly milder Victoria area, would, with luck, greet us in the morning.

“You will lose coverage,” our waitress told us later that night in the hotel’s restaurant when we described our plans. She was referring to cellphone service on the farther reaches of the Pacific Marine Circle route. “But you will see animals, guaranteed. I saw elk and eagles and bears last time.” She told us that she had been born on the island, moved to Toronto, and not relishing the pace, returned. “I live over there,” she said, pointing at the dark hills across the water. “Sometimes I kayak to work.”

I thought of Carr, who had generally been eager to return home from her travels. In her journal, she recounts an exchange with a Vancouver art promoter: “‘It’s a shame to think of you stuck out here in this corner of the world unnoticed and unknown,’ says he. ‘It’s exactly where I want to be,’ says I.”","Vancouver Island, Through an Artist’s Eyes",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/travel/vancouver-victoria-emily-carr.html

Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with “a kind of irreverence.
Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually — Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit — Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.
Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking.
The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.","When it came to guns, Mr. Michel said, “he was not a novice.”

The son of a bank robber and a secretary, Mr. Paddock grew up lower middle class in Southern California in the 1960s. From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.

“He went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that’s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn’t there,” the younger Mr. Paddock said. “He went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn’t there either. He went to real estate and that’s where the money was.”

Stephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, “we had cash flow,” said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because “that’s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.”

“He helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,” he said.

With success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.

“He acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,” said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.

Mr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and “uppity about it.”

Mr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.

“I would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.”

Mr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot’s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.

“This guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,” said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.

Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.

“If Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,” Eric Paddock said. “He did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.”

The ‘Most Boring’ Son

Mr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.

“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” Patrick Paddock said. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”

Their father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a “glib, smooth talking ‘confidence man,’ who is egotistic and arrogant.”

His rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who “has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.”

Stephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.

The boys’ mother raised them alone on a secretary’s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.

“She kept that secret from the family,” Patrick Paddock said.

Stephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.

Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with “a kind of irreverence. He didn’t always stay between the lines.”

He recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.

“Everybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,” Mr. Alarcon said. “He had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn’t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn’t care what it took.”

A Knack for Making Money

Mr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.

In 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not “Taj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.”

Crucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.

He was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants’ complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.

Mr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. “What you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.”

To Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.

“He was frustrated by people who did stupid things,” Mr. Franks said.

He was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.

Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually — Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit — Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.

“He was a tough negotiator,” Mr. Franks said. “He wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.”

The House Advantage

By the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock’s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.

“He likes it when people go, ‘Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?” Eric Paddock said.

Gambling made him feel important, if not social.

“You could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,’’ said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. “He liked everyone doting on him.”

He sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock’s gambling history.

The analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.

Playing a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.

One of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of “Gambling Wizards: Conversations With the World’s Greatest Gamblers.” A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often “lock” a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.

For one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, “but he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.”

Mr. Paddock “knew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,” he said.

As for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.

He was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.

The Absent Neighbor

Mr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.

Colleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock’s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.

He did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.

When he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking. “He said nothing,” Mr. McKay said. “Not a word. No eye contact.”

Even more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.

“Almost everyone has a reaction to Trump,” said Mr. McKay’s wife, Darlene.

Ms. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: “He always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.”

Mr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock’s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.

It is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.

Mr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.

His neighbors added personal touches to their yards — decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock’s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.

Ms. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.

Several days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.

Ms. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.",Who Was Stephen Paddock? The Mystery of a Nondescript ‘Numbers Guy’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/stephen-paddock-vegas.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In the northern city of Gdansk, Krzysztof Januszewski told The A.P. that he worried Europe was being threatened by Islamic extremists.

“In the past, there were raids by sultans and Turks and people of other faiths against us Christians,” said Mr. Januszewski. “Today, Islam is flooding us, and we are afraid of this, too. We are afraid of terrorist threats and we are afraid of people departing from the faith.”

The demonstration was endorsed by many Polish celebrities, athletes and several politicians from the ruling conservative Law and Justice party. But others criticized the demonstration.

But he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.
Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.
One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.
After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers.","“You have a commercial relationship with TWC via a TV deal so how can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?” Mr. Maerov asked in the email.

In a separate email, Mr. Maerov, who declined to comment on Saturday, said that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”

Bob Weinstein wrote Ms. Bloom a disapproving email on Friday morning, shortly before she appeared on “Good Morning America.” He pointed out that Democratic politicians were giving away money that Mr. Weinstein had donated to them, women’s rights organizations were calling for him to be fired and actors and actresses were openly stating how appalled they were. “It is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel,” he wrote. “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”

Bob Weinstein declined to comment on Saturday.

The details about the emails came to light one day after a third of the all-male board of the Weinstein Company resigned. The remaining board members announced on Friday that they had hired an outside law firm to investigate the allegations and that Mr. Weinstein would take an indefinite leave of absence.

“I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Bloom said on Twitter on Saturday morning. “My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”

Ms. Bloom said on Saturday that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the press. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.

“A conflict is representing two different sides in the same case,” she said. “This is a difficult time for all involved and I wish everyone the best.”

Lanny Davis, another adviser to Mr. Weinstein, is also no longer representing him, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Davis, a lawyer and crisis counselor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton, declined on Saturday to discuss his departure. But he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.

The allegations of harassment against Mr. Weinstein reach back decades. Women accused him of requesting massages, appearing naked in front of them and asking if they wanted to watch him shower, among other behaviors. The Times investigation found that Mr. Weinstein had settled with at least eight women over the years.

Mr. Weinstein apologized for his behavior and acknowledged that it had “caused a lot of pain.” But he denied many of the allegations and said he intended to sue The Times for failing to give him enough time to respond to them.

Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that Mr. Weinstein had had two days to respond before the article was published, and that his full statement had been included. “Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story,” she said. “They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story.”

In a statement on Friday, four of the Weinstein Company’s remaining board members said that Mr. Weinstein’s leave of absence would begin immediately. The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”

Ms. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on “Good Morning America” that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.

“It’s gross, yeah,” Ms. Bloom said. “I’m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, ‘I have caused a lot of pain.’”

She had previously described Mr. Weinstein as “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”

Ms. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.

“Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,” Ms. Allred said. “While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.”

This year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.

After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.

“I can’t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,” she said, adding, “Authors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.”

President Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time,” adding, “I’m not at all surprised to see it.”","Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at a news conference Saturday that he expected the city’s pump system to function effectively.
As for the question of how protective the city’s $14.6 billion system of levees, flood walls and gates would be against Nate, Mr. Landrieu expressed cautious optimism.
“There is limited or no risk for storm surge in the city of New Orleans,” he added.
The storm nevertheless ground other parts of the central Gulf coast to a halt.","Even though Nate had not strengthened beyond a Category 1 storm by late Saturday night, it still had an emotional toll here in Mississippi, where a hurricane has not made landfall since 2005, when 6,000 of the city’s 25,000 structures were destroyed.

“I was a little bit more nervous about this one because we haven’t had a hurricane since Katrina,” said Ms. Moran’s 26-year-old daughter, Destiny, an employee of the casino. “It’s like PTSD.”

In New Orleans, where Katrina exacted a horrendous toll when its waters overwhelmed the flawed levee system and left the city underwater for weeks, officials began to sound a note of cautious optimism by early Saturday evening, even as they acknowledged that circumstances could change. Officials lifted the city’s short-lived curfew around 9:30 p.m.

“This is the Goldilocks of storms,” Col. Michael Clancy, the commander of the New Orleans District for the Army Corps of Engineers, said. “Big enough to bring us in here on a Saturday night, not big enough to cause a lot of damage.”

The strength of the city’s improved hurricane defense system, he predicted, “is going to make this a minimal event, at least behind the levee.”

After amassing power in the Gulf, Hurricane Nate raced toward land and was lashing coastal cities with rain by late afternoon. Some areas were expected to receive 4 to 6 inches of rainfall as the storm passed through, although forecasters said that a “life threatening” storm surge — an abnormal rise in water levels of up to several feet — and wind were likely to cause the biggest problems.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Saturday afternoon that Nate was moving at “an extremely fast rate” of 26 miles an hour, which he said was “almost unheard-of for a storm of this type.”

Even though its speed would limit the amount of time it could deluge any single place, Mr. Edwards said, “this is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.”

“It has proven to be very deadly in Honduras and Nicaragua and that area,” Mr. Edwards said. “We have to make sure we are not taking it lightly.” At least 22 storm-related deaths have been reported in Central America.

At the 17th Street Canal between New Orleans and Metairie, La., workers from the Army Corps of Engineers lowered a set of enormous gates at the mouth of the canal. On Friday, divers checked the beds that the gates rest on to make sure that they would be able to close.

In 2005, there were no gates there or at the three other major canals in New Orleans. Katrina’s surge pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain into the canals. When levees along those canals breached, much of the city was inundated, and stayed underwater for weeks, until the breaches could be closed and the neighborhoods pumped dry. The corps later acknowledged the hurricane protection system it built was “a system in name only.”

Now the corps is building permanent pumping stations at the very end of these canals. Until then, a structure of gates and temporary pumps has been built to protect nearby neighborhoods.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at a news conference Saturday that he expected the city’s pump system to function effectively. Of the 120 pumps, 108 were working. “We have plenty enough to deal with the potential rain,” he said. “Everything that we can see, we think we can handle.”

The city could be without power for as long as a week, officials said. As for the question of how protective the city’s $14.6 billion system of levees, flood walls and gates would be against Nate, Mr. Landrieu expressed cautious optimism. “There is limited or no risk for storm surge in the city of New Orleans,” he added.

In the afternoon, as Nate’s outer bands hit New Orleans, rain pounded the streets, pushed by heavy gusts. Pedestrians took off running or huddled under overhangs.

Nia Johnson, 23, who lives on Alvar Street a few dozen blocks from the Mississippi River, said she and her family had planned to pile into the car and drive to Lafayette, La., because the streets of her area “always flood.” The power would almost certainly go out because of the high winds, she said, leaving them unable to cook for days.

Many of the larger chain establishments in the French Quarter had closed. But along Bourbon Street, the daiquiri and pizza-slice joints were open, and music spilled out of bars like the Beach, where customers wearing fleur-de-lis-covered ponchos were drinking and watching college football.

Bridesmaids tried to stay dry in front of Arnaud’s restaurant, where a Rolls-Royce waited for the bride and groom. Around the corner, a wedding party was out on a second-floor balcony despite the splitting rain.

The storm nevertheless ground other parts of the central Gulf coast to a halt. The popular resort town of Orange Beach, Ala., was empty except for ominous red flags whipping in the breeze; the casino city of Biloxi had mostly emptied of the thousands of visitors who had come to the area for Cruisin’ the Coast, a showcase of 8,200 classic cars. On top of that, the Mississippi Gaming Commission closed the casinos here, leaving the waterfront Beau Rivage and other casinos eerily dark.

“Now it’s just like a ghost town,” said Faith Phillips, 30, a dialysis patient care technician who was waiting for dinner at Waffle House, looking at the Beau Rivage as water encroached on parking lots nearby. “You wouldn’t believe that all of this was full.”

Just a few hours earlier, there had been an air of calm along the coast.

Merlin and Suzie DeCorte of Metairie, La., stopped at the R & O restaurant with their son Jacob, 8, near the 17th Street Canal in New Orleans, all wearing Louisiana State University T-shirts.

“It didn’t seem like it was going to be that bad,” Ms. DeCorte said of the storm. They had more time, she said, to get away from the city if needed.

In Gulfport, Miss., Rich Hazen and his wife, Dawn, of Diamondhead, Miss., were completing their errands with a decided sense of normalcy.

“Church hasn’t been canceled for this evening,” Ms. Hazen said.

Diplomats and their underlings have brokered deals for weapons and drugs, and more mundane products like machine tools and cows. They have also smuggled liquor, cigarettes, luxury cars and anything else that can be imported duty free and then sold at a gain.

“My late father-in-law was an ambassador,” said Marcus Noland, who studies North Korea and is executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “and he told me that in India, years ago, it was known within the diplomatic corps that if you wanted to buy beef, you could knock on the backdoor of the North Korean embassy in Delhi. They ran an abattoir in the basement.”

Earning money is a necessity for the embassies — North Korea doesn’t fund them. Instead, they are expected to support themselves and send home any surplus.

Despite the sanctions it is under, North Korea did $6.5 billion in trade last year. Analysts estimate that embassy revenues represent a small sum compared with the country’s other low-profile foreign ventures.

Those included cadres of bodyguards leased to dictators who don’t trust their own citizens, laborers dispatched to work sites around the world who must remit their wages and state-owned companies that export ballistic missiles and other arms to countries like Syria.

In some cases, diplomats get involved with weapons deals. The third private secretary of the North Korean embassy in Beijing doubled as an employee of the Haegeumgang Trading Company. The company, according to a United Nations report, supplied surface-to-air missiles and radar systems to Mozambique. Haegeumgang also sold machine tools, and an ad in 2014 for those products on a Chinese website listed the company headquarters at the same address as the North Korean embassy in Beijing.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to faxed questions.

Diplomats for the country have been ad hoc entrepreneurs since at least 1976. That year, Norway’s police found through surveillance that every member of the North Korean embassy in Oslo was involved in the import and sale of as many as 10,000 bottles of spirits and 100,000 cigarettes.

Today, sanctions have forced many embassies to curb their ambitions, with some intent on keeping the lowest possible profile.

The North Korean embassy in London sits unobtrusively in Ealing, a suburb-like section of London, just another brick house in a row of them. The difference is a small sign, barely visible from outside the wrought iron fence: “Residence and office, embassy of D.P.R. Korea.”

Aside from black luxury sedans in the driveway, there are rarely signs of life in the building, even to neighbors.

“I’ve never seen anyone go in or out of there,” said Ali Wiseman, a student who lives in a group house two doors down. “And I’ve been here a year.”

His roommate, Rupert Thomson, has seen people there. “I once saw three women working on the lawn out front and they did everything to not look at me,” he said.

The way that the London embassy sustains itself is a mystery. One theory comes from Kim Joo-il, a former member of the North Korean military who defected and moved to London in 2007. He said he often saw embassy employees at a type of Sunday flea market called a car-boot sale.

“They are always there buying secondhand electronics, toys, dolls, kitchen goods,” Mr. Kim said through an interpreter, seated at a restaurant he owns in a London suburb. “Some of these things they are cleaning up and fixing to resell, others they are sending home to North Korea.”

North Korean embassies in the former eastern bloc, where the missions were long ago granted generous square footage, have a more lucrative stratagem.

In Poland, 40 businesses are listed at the address of the North Korean embassy in Warsaw, including a pharmaceutical company, several advertising agencies and a yacht club. How many of these businesses are actually staffed there is unclear.

In Sofia, the embassy owns a number of buildings on two separate properties. One is a complex that includes the embassy itself. Passers-by can pause at a glass display case — standard issue for embassies in the city — filled with photographs. One captures the Supreme Leader beaming at a crowd, others were of missiles that had just been launched.

The event space, known as Terra Residence, is a 15-minute walk east. It’s the former home of the North Korean ambassador, built in the 1980s with dazzle instead of comfort in mind. Photos on Terra’s promotional website show an interior that is essentially a communist take on Versailles — a series of huge and austere halls with chandeliers, gold curtains and paintings of ballerinas.

Terra rents out the space for magazine photo sessions, music videos and television ads, including a handful for national banks and one for the Bulgarian version of “Celebrity Apprentice.” Its main business is weddings, proms and corporate events.

Few attendees, it seems, realize they are spending the evening on North Korean property.

“I knew it was a former embassy building, but I had no idea it was owned by North Korea,” said Bilyana Dimitrova, who attended a friend’s wedding at Terra in September. “The atmosphere was very pleasant.”

A spokeswoman for Terra, Anelia Baklova, wrote in an email that the company has had a long-term lease with the embassy of North Korea that predates the imposition of economic sanctions. When the U.N. approved stricter sanctions, this year and last, Terra “froze” its payments, she said. The company has not been evicted, she wrote, because of the “considerable amount of money” it had spent on renovations and upkeep.

Emails to the embassy were not returned.

Some countries have succeeded in shutting down businesses that rent from North Korea. In May, Germany closed a youth hostel that was operating in what was originally North Korean diplomatic quarters.

The governments of Poland and Bulgaria have so far been unable to end the ancillary activities. A spokesman for the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had repeatedly raised the issue of renting out space with North Korean officials here, urging them to “use properties in Sofia solely for diplomatic and consular activities.”

Terra, unlike its landlord, has tried to become a more agreeable neighbor. People who live across the street say that notices are now taped on the doors of their apartment building a day before there will be fireworks, giving a heads up and promising that the show will end by 10 p.m.

Surprisingly, residents didn’t seem particularly vexed about living near an enterprise that has pumped money into the world’s most repressive and notorious regime. But that may say more about Bulgaria’s government than the dangers of North Korea.

They contend that for individual investors, the proxy voting system is onerous, frustrating and broken.
A result, they say, is that annual vote tallies represent only a small portion of individual investors’ shares and views.
“Institutions vote at very high rates,” said Chuck Callan, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Broadridge, in an interview.","The same split between institutions and individuals also emerged on the topic of questionable executive pay practices. At the 32 companies whose pay programs failed to win majority support from shareholders this year, individual investors were twice as likely as institutions to vote in favor of that compensation. Some 66 percent of individuals’ shares were cast in support of companies whose pay plans failed to win majority approval, compared with 32 percent of institutions’ shares.

To a great degree, these figures reflect the fact that institutions hold the overwhelming portion of company shares — 70 percent to individuals’ 30 percent, Broadridge data shows.

But do the results prove that individual investors are pleased with the way corporations are managing governance matters? While executives might want to believe this, it’s probably not the case, according to experts who study shareholder voting. They contend that for individual investors, the proxy voting system is onerous, frustrating and broken. A result, they say, is that annual vote tallies represent only a small portion of individual investors’ shares and views.

Voting is just too hard for retail investors, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and co-director of its Institute for Law and Economics. “It’s not surprising that they often give up,” she added. “As a result, there’s a group of investors that corporate managers aren’t hearing from consistently.”

The Broadridge-PricewaterhouseCoopers study bears this out. It found that 91 percent of the shares owned by institutional investors — but only 29 percent of those held by individuals — were voted during the most recent proxy season on director elections and shareholder proposals covering the full array of governance issues.

The main reason for this divergence is that institutions are generally required to vote their shares as part of their fiduciary duty to the investors or pension beneficiaries whose money they oversee. “Institutions vote at very high rates,” said Chuck Callan, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Broadridge, in an interview. “Retail shareholders are not required to vote by law or regulation. Typically, the understanding has been that if these shareholders have a problem with a company, they vote with their feet.” In other words, they sell their shares.

But if you examine the results of almost any annual shareholder meeting, it also becomes clear that throngs of individual investors were absent this year in voting on directors and other governance issues.

Most individuals keep their shares at their brokerage firms, but the brokers cannot vote them on the clients’ behalf. Instead, the investors have to cast their votes by mail, on the phone or online. Those who fail to do so are categorized as broker nonvotes in regulatory filings.

Even at troubled companies, this inertia can be widespread and surprising. At Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in April, for example, when the company came under pressure for its questionable sales practices, roughly four billion shares were voted in the director elections. Broker nonvotes on those elections totaled almost 500 million shares.

Institutional investors, meanwhile, have it easier when they vote their shares. They can take advantage of technological advancements in voting platforms that allow them to leave standing instructions on how they want their votes cast on particular proposals.

“Because they have such a huge work flow, institutions will flag certain types of proposals and will develop guidelines on how they want to vote on them,” Mr. Callan said. “Platforms for institutions integrate all that.”

Ms. Fisch, the law professor, asked why a similar process couldn’t be set up for individual investors. In a coming article in the Minnesota Law Review, she argued that low individual investor turnout is a result of an antiquated voting system. In the article, “Standing Voting Instructions: Empowering the Excluded Retail Investor,” she contended that “current regulatory restrictions impede market-based innovation” that could allow individual investors’ voices to be heard.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has weighed in on this problem recently. Acknowledging that the low level of voting by individual investors is a concern, it sponsored a roundtable on proxy voting in 2015. A major agenda item was how to increase individual investor participation.

But proposals for a system that would allow individuals to leave standing instructions for the voting of their shares have gone nowhere. As Ms. Fisch noted, the commission has voiced concerns that such a system would require investors to make voting decisions before they had received proxy materials “containing the disclosures mandated under the federal securities laws and possibly without consideration of the specific issues to be voted upon.” The agency also warned that the availability of standing voting instructions might mean investors would not bother to read the proxy statement.

Still, regulations have gotten in the way of what might be the natural market development of tools to encourage individual investor voting, Ms. Fisch said. “When the voting platforms and proxy advisers work with institutional investors, they provide tools for categorizing issues and proposals to accommodate investor voting preferences even though the issues might differ a little,” she added. “I would envision a platform being able to provide retail investors that same sort of functionality.”

Ms. Fisch and others are convinced that individual investors are interested in the makeup of corporate boards, executive pay and other governance matters. Given that technology can lower the hurdles these shareholders face in expressing their views, it seems unfair to ignore it.",Small Investors Support the Boards.

His success as a businessman showed the rotten side of capitalism — the side that exploits appetites for money, that feeds leech-like on our vices, that dissolves family and religion while promising that consumption will fill the void they leave behind.

The social liberalism he championed was the rotten and self-interested sort, a liberalism of male and upper-class privilege, in which the strong and beautiful and rich take their pleasure at the expense of the vulnerable and poor and not-yet-born.

The online future his career anticipated was the rotten side of the internet — the realms of onanism and custom-tailored erotica, where the male vanity and entitlement he indulged has curdled into resentment and misogyny.

And his appreciation of male-female difference was rotten, too — the leering predatory sort of appreciation, the Cosby-Clinton-Trump sort, the sort that nicknames quaaludes “thigh openers” and expects the girls to laugh, the sort that prefers breast implants to female intellect and rents the charms of youth to escape the realities of age.

No doubt what Hefner offered America somebody else would have offered in his place, and the changes he helped hasten would have come rushing in without him.

But in every way that mattered he made those changes worse, our culture coarser and crueler and more sterile than liberalism or feminism or freedom of speech required. And in every way that mattered his life story proved that we were wrong to listen to him, because at the end of the long slide lay only a degraded, priapic senility, or the desperate gaiety of Prince Prospero’s court with the Red Death at the door.

Now that death has taken him, we should examine our own sins. Liberals should ask why their crusade for freedom and equality found itself with such a captain, and what his legacy says about their cause. Conservatives should ask how their crusade for faith and family and community ended up so Hefnerian itself — with a conservative news network that seems to have been run on Playboy Mansion principles and a conservative party that just elected a playboy as our president.

You can find these questions being asked, but they are counterpoints and minor themes.

The study, by a team from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, examined the relationship between plant-based diets of varying quality and the risk of developing coronary heart disease among more than 200,000 health professionals. The participants, who started the study free of chronic disease, were followed for more than two decades, submitting their dietary patterns to the researchers every two years.

Based on their responses on food-frequency questionnaires, the participants’ diets were characterized by the team as an overall plant-based diet that emphasized plant foods over animal foods; a healthful plant-based diet emphasizing healthful plant foods; or an unhealthful plant-based diet. Any of the diets could have included various amounts of animal products.

Healthful plant foods like whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, as well as vegetable oils, coffee and tea, received a positive score, while less-healthful plant foods like juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes and fries, and sweets along with animal foods were assigned a negative rating.

The more closely the participants adhered to a healthful plant-based diet, the less likely they were to develop heart disease in the course of the study. Those with the least healthful plant-based diet were, on average, 32 percent more likely to be given diagnoses of heart disease. In a prior study, the researchers found a similar reduction in the risk of Type 2 diabetes of a healthful plant-based diet.

The team, led by Ambika Satija of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, concluded that “not all plant foods are necessarily beneficial for health.”

Interestingly, the Harvard finding was nearly identical to one from an 11-year European study that found a 32 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease among vegetarians than among nonvegetarians, although no health-based rating was given to the quality of the participants’ vegetarian diets.

The more detailed Harvard study, which examined gradations of adherence to a plant-based diet, found that “even a slightly lower intake of animal foods combined with a higher intake of healthy plant foods” was associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease.

In other words, you don’t have to become a strict vegetarian to protect your heart. Simply reducing your dependence on animal foods, and especially avoiding those high in fat, is helpful. In fact, “a diet that emphasized both healthy plant and healthy animal foods” was associated with a coronary risk only slightly higher than a diet based almost entirely on healthy plant foods, the researchers found.

On the other hand, overdoing “less healthy plant foods” and less healthy animal foods like red and processed meats, the study showed, significantly increased the risk of developing heart disease.

The Harvard findings lend further support to the most recently released Dietary Guidelines for Americans that urge people to consume large amounts of “high-quality plant foods,” the researchers noted. They added that the recommended diet “would also be environmentally sustainable” because plant-based food systems require fewer resources than those that rely heavily on animal foods.

Thus, the more plant foods and the fewer animal foods you eat, the lower your carbon footprint and the less you would contribute to animal suffering. But to be truly beneficial, the plant foods you choose must be rich in nutrients.

Although most Americans rely heavily on animal foods for needed protein, it’s not difficult to get quality protein on a vegetarian diet that contains dairy foods and eggs. Pescatarians, who add fish to such a diet, get a nutritious bonus of healthful omega-3 fatty acids along with high-quality protein from fish and shellfish.

Those choosing a strict vegan diet — one devoid of all foods from animals — face a greater challenge because the protein in plants is not complete and must be balanced by consuming complementary sources, like beans and grains. A sandwich of almond butter or peanut butter on whole-grain bread is totally vegan and an excellent example of balanced protein in a high-quality plant-based diet. Vegans also must supplement their diet with vitamin B-12.

Short of becoming a vegan, you can improve your diet, protect your health and add variety to your meals by a few simple dietary adjustments. For example, as Dr. Hena Patel and Dr. Kim Allan Williams Sr., cardiologists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, suggested in a commentary on the Harvard study, you might choose one day a week to be meatless and gradually add more meatless days while adding one or more new plant-based recipes each week.

Given his personal ties to Puerto Rico, as well as the substantial Puerto Rican population in his state, Mr. Rubio has been engaged in ensuring that the relief effort there gets on track and stays there. He has flexed his influence on American policy toward Cuba and Venezuela. He has worked with Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, on a proposal to expand the child tax credit that could become an important element of the coming tax debate. He has helped push to passage a bill to help the Department of Veterans Affairs hold employees more accountable. He was part of a bipartisan group behind a new law directing drug companies to pursue more pediatric cancer treatments. He is an important party voice on immigration.

Whether this is all a prelude to a future presidential run for Mr. Rubio, 46, is hard to gauge. But he attributes his rededication to the Senate to a confluence of factors, including the fact that his party is in power and that, now in his second term in the Senate, he is a little more sure of what he is doing.

“It is true that experience generally makes you better at something, not worse,” Mr. Rubio said. “And so the longer you’re in some place, to a certain extent, the better you can be at it. So I am certainly a better senator today than I was five years ago simply because I’m more familiar with the process. It also doesn’t hurt to have your party in the White House with a lot of people over there that I know.”

Mr. Rubio wasn’t supposed to be here at all. A rising superstar in his party with a personality and background that thrilled donors, Mr. Rubio was in the top tier of Republican presidential hopefuls in 2016. Many in Washington believed he would be the nominee, a candidate who would finally broaden the party’s appeal with Hispanics while holding true conservative credentials.

Openly antagonistic about the slow pace of the hidebound Senate, Mr. Rubio made it clear that it was the White House or bust. And bust it was as Donald J. Trump upended him in the Florida primary race. But after insisting he would give up his seat at the end of his term, Mr. Rubio instead decided to run, citing second thoughts about public service that were prompted by the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla.

It was not without risk. “Losing two elections in a year has never been part of my plan for life,” Mr. Rubio said.

He won and re-entered an institution that allies said he found frustrating. Mr. Rubio wouldn’t be the first senator to rate his experience as a second-term lawmaker an improvement over the first. Figuring out the Senate can take time, and more-senior lawmakers might not even begin to take colleagues seriously until they have at least one term under their belts.

“I’m at 58 in seniority,” Mr. Rubio noted. “I came in at 99.”

Mr. Rubio, who has close friends in Puerto Rico and visited soon after Hurricane Maria had passed, said that he had no quarrel with the federal response, but that the conventional reaction to a severe hurricane didn’t suffice for the already struggling island.

“The problem,” he said, “is that the model that works in Florida and in Texas doesn’t work as well in Puerto Rico for a lot of reasons: the geographic isolation, the pre-existing challenges and the fact that they had just previously been impacted by a storm.”

As for his relationship with Mr. Trump — who ridiculed Mr. Rubio as “Little Marco” during primary race debates, prompting Mr. Rubio to try to get under his opponent’s skin by noting his “small hands” — Mr. Rubio said those jabs did not extend beyond the campaign stage.

“Politics is verbal combat,” he said. “And in the process of a campaign, which is a competitive environment, people are going to bump up against each other.”

“We were competitors,” he said. “But I never felt we had a negative interaction.”

Assessing Mr. Trump’s performance in office, Mr. Rubio characterized him as “unorthodox” — a description he said Mr. Trump himself would embrace. He acknowledged policy differences and concerns about Iraq and Syria, but said they were in agreement on multiple other fronts.

“I still would rather have him be president than Hillary Clinton, to be frank,” Mr. Rubio said. “And that was the choice before America in November.”

Left unsaid was that Mr. Rubio was ultimately not part of that choice. Is he now satisfied with his Senate role? For the moment, it seems.

“I want to be the best senator I can be — the best senator Florida has ever had,” he said. “That’s obviously a lofty goal, and there will be plenty of people to argue that I didn’t achieve it no matter what I do.”

What he is not doing, the senator said, “is executing on any sort of long-term plan to get to a particular destination other than to do this job as well as I can and make my time here as productive as possible.”

That alone is a big change for a man who a little more than a year ago was happily on his way out the Senate door for good.

“We put our hiring on hold” because of the weather, Mr. Gropper said, adding that many of the 50 to 75 caregivers who work for him and would typically have been in the field were unable or unavailable to work during a two-week period. “Now, things are back to normal.”

It was the same in Texas. “There’s a lot of manufacturing jobs in Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Houston, all of which suffered damage,” noted Ray Perryman, president of the Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, Tex. “Some of these plants were shut down for an extended period of time, and that would have gotten into the September survey.”

One upside may be a surge in hiring in subsequent months. Using Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 as a benchmark, Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said he expected payrolls to bounce back by the end of the year.

“There’s no question there were huge hurricane effects,” he said. Food and drinking establishments alone lost 105,000 jobs last month, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of people who said they were not working because of bad weather jumped by 1.5 million.

Mr. O’Sullivan and several economists agreed that the labor market was still pushing ahead — no matter how unevenly — in what is now the ninth year of an economic expansion. “The other data we’ve been seeing this week don’t show any signs of a weaker trend,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. “If you take out Texas and Florida, there’s been no increase in jobless claims over the past five weeks.”

The stock market’s reaction to the news was mildly negative. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined slightly from record levels after eight straight days of gains.

President Trump called attention this week to the economy’s successes, writing on Twitter on Thursday, “Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years!” Last week, Mr. Trump said that the Republicans’ proposed tax cuts would provide further “rocket fuel for our economy.”

Many workers have been waiting to see concrete evidence of economic progress in their paychecks. Although the Census Bureau last month reported a jump in annual incomes across a wide spectrum, households with incomes below the median remain worse off than they were in 2000.

The hefty growth in average wages reported on Friday was probably exaggerated, because many low-wage workers were temporarily displaced by the storms, bumping up the overall average.

At least a portion of the 0.5 percent average hourly wage growth last month, though, is likely to stick. There is plenty of evidence that broad swaths of the labor market are tightening. Target said last month that it would increase its base hourly pay by $1, to $11 — higher than or equal to the minimum wage in every state.

Amy Glaser, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing, said that employers she worked with were raising wages and reaching into less-common pools of potential employees like retirees, stay-at-home moms and people with disabilities.

Ms. Glaser said she expected wages to rise further, saying some of her clients were thinking about increasing hourly wages as much as 20 to 40 percent during the peak holiday season and early next year. Employers are also pushing to retain the workers they have — for example, by offering more bonuses for e-commerce and other seasonal workers who stay through the holidays.

Some businesses are trying to generate and educate their work forces by offering more paid internships and apprenticeships. Others are shortening the interview cycle to improve their chances. “There is a need for speed,” Ms. Glaser said. “Whoever gets to a candidate first is well positioned.”

Radial, the second-largest direct-to-consumer e-commerce company behind Amazon, is hiring 27,000 people to work in its 25 warehouses around the country through mid-January. Even as brick-and-mortar retail is suffering significant losses, e-commerce continues to thrive.

“We’re hiring 35 percent, or 7,000, more people than we did last year,” said Stefan Weitz, Radial’s executive vice president for technology services. “It’s very competitive. A lot of logistics companies have operations in similar areas because of the proximity to air and ground transport.”

At the upper end of the labor market, the competition for highly skilled workers is intense. Bryan Leach, founder of Ibotta, a Denver company offering a mobile shopping app, said he had hired more than 100 people this year, including engineers, product managers and data scientists, mostly at six-figure salaries.

“We are hiring national search firms to shop for talent in the coasts,” in addition to seven in-house recruiters, Mr. Leach said. The company has also helped sponsor billboards in San Francisco promoting the benefits of living in Denver and is offering $1,000 apiece to employees who refer friends who are hired.

Despite the scramble for workers, the labor market has stubborn weak spots. Many of the jobs available, like the seasonal positions at Radial, are at the lower end of the pay scale and do not offer long-term stability.

For some workers, such jobs have limited appeal. The labor force participation rate peaked its head above 63 percent in September, but many workers remain on the sidelines.

Revised hiring figures for July and August showed that a total of 38,000 fewer jobs were created in those two months than previously reported, bringing the monthly average gain in 2017 — excluding September — to 170,000. August’s figures will be revised one more time, while September’s will be revised twice over the next two months. State-by-state tallies for September are not yet available.

(Although Hurricane Maria also devastated Puerto Rico in September, the survey of employers that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses to calculate monthly payroll gains does not include the island.)

The Katrina experience showed that hiring can rebound quickly after a disaster, as damaged communities clean up and rebuild. Employment gains averaged 249,000 in the six months before the storm. After New Orleans found itself underwater, gains averaged 76,000 over the next couple of months before soaring to 341,000 in November 2005.

While the recovery from the latest storms takes shape, businesses and workers are still counting their losses. Brian Petranick, Right at Home’s president and chief executive, said Palm Beach was not the only community where franchises were unable to connect workers and clients. He estimated hurricane-related losses to the company would end up at $13 million to $15 million. “During big storms, we see a loss of hours and services,” he said. “That means caregivers are losing the opportunity to work and make money.”","U.S. Lost 33,000 Jobs in September; Unemployment Rate Dips to 4.2%",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/economy/jobs-report-unemployment.html

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Entering a Rebus on the Web

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus.

Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.

Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.

Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime. Mr. Mueller is building cases against two of Mr. Trump’s former advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Michael T. Flynn. Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller’s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.

Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.

“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.

“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.

Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.

“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.

Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.

But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.

One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.

Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.

But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.

The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.

That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.

“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”","Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Photo“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said.
But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia.
While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.
“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said.","More than 20 years after Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a bloody, year-long proxy war decried by Georgian authorities as illegal and a step towards “de facto annexation,” only four United Nations member states — Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru and Russia— recognize Abkhazia, a small territory on the eastern coast of the Black Sea bordering the Caucasus Mountains.

Abkhazia is a time capsule. Many buildings, constructed during its days as a Soviet republic, are pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1992 conflict. The economy is weak and dependent on tourism from Russian visitors. Young people with means attend college outside the territory — and stay there after graduation.

But Abkhazia — which, in the local language, means “land of the soul”— is more than its decay and its disputed political status, said the Russian photographer Ksenia Kuleshova. She began photographing there in 2015 as an undergraduate at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hanover, Germany, and has returned three times since to work on an ongoing project.

Photo

“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “I didn’t want to concentrate on the negative side. I wanted to find the soul.”

Ms. Kuleshova grew up hearing about Abkhazia from her parents, who vacationed there before the war and remembered it as “a beautiful country with mountains and tasty vegetables and fruits.” When she arrived in Sukhumi, the territory’s capital, for the first time three years ago, she found its appearance unsettling.

“You come there and you feel it’s another world, that this country slept for a while because they didn’t restore buildings after the war,” she said.

Photo

She overcame her shock and got to work, connecting with locals through a friend of her parents. She was looking, she said, for signs of joy, and she found them in abundance. She attended soccer games and horse races and parades, met folk dancers and socialites and zookeepers, and watched people play in the first big snowfall in Sukhumi in nearly eight years. Once, she went to three weddings in a day.

“I wanted to show something beautiful and I wanted to show that there’s happiness,” she said.

But there was no escaping history. While bullet holes are not the focus of her photos, they sometimes appear in the background. And in her conversations with Abkhazians, talk often turned to the war.

“It was a very cruel war and almost every family lost someone,” she said. “They can’t forget it.”

Photo

There has been some change in Abkhazia’s prospects recently. After years of stagnation, business along the Black Sea coast has picked up. Avtandil Gartskiya, Sukhumi’s tourism minister, told The New York Times in 2016 that 1.5 million foreign visitors were expected that year—up from 92,000 a decade earlier. But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia. While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.

“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “But the main point is they want to be recognized by the world.”

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once.

The batter required a trip to an Indian grocery for ingredients, then 24 hours to soak, grind and ferment. But it was easier than making bread dough since I didn’t have to knead.

After my batter puffed up into a glorious pale froth, I pulled out my favorite nonstick pan and started frying.

Kitchen wisdom says that, when it comes to frying crepes, the first few should be fed to the dog.

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A.
and was able to play basketball.","The former playground phenom could dunk the ball at age 11, when he was 6 feet 2 inches. He became one of the finest players in New York City high school basketball history, starring in Brooklyn and being named a first-team all-American. Growing into a 6-foot-8-inch frame, he possessed unusually large hands and a talent for bursting through defenses before slamming down a dunk.

But by the time he reached the grandest stage in basketball, the N.B.A., he was at an advanced age for a rookie and recovering from knee surgery.

By then, a basketball career that had held so much potential for greatness had been damaged by the suspicions — unsubstantiated — that he had been involved in a collegiate point-shaving scandal in the early 1960s.

Recovering from the setback proved to be an enormous emotional challenge.

“It was totally devastating,” Hawkins told NBA.com in 2009. “I was innocent, but no one would listen to me. Plus, coming from a poor family, no one even thought about trying to get a lawyer to fight it. We just weren’t that sophisticated.”

Other players in the league shared the view that he had been mistreated. When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, Bob Lanier, the former Detroit Pistons center, who was part of that class, said Hawkins had “never got his just due,” adding, “because obviously the media wasn’t big then.”

Lanier marveled at Hawkins’s skills. Referring to Erving, he remarked how Hawkins “was doing these wild, swooping kind of moves before anyone knew about Dr. J.”

Hawkins had been recruited by numerous colleges before enrolling at the University of Iowa in 1961. But he never a played a game there.

College basketball at the time was engulfed in its second point-shaving scandal after players had received money from gamblers to affect the final score of games. Hawkins was questioned by the New York City authorities about possible connections with one of the fixers, but he was never accused of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he was banned from collegiate play and the N.B.A.

Hawkins played one season in the American Basketball League and two seasons with the Globetrotters and was a star in his two seasons in the American Basketball Association, which later merged with the N.B.A.

Hawkins’s path to the N.B.A. was buoyed in part by a 1969 article in Life magazine by David Wolf. “Evidence recently uncovered,” Mr. Wolf wrote, “indicates that Connie Hawkins never knowingly associated with gamblers, that he never introduced a player to a fixer, and that the only damaging statements about his involvement were made by Hawkins himself — as a terrified, semiliterate teenager who thought he’d go to jail unless he said what the D.A.’s detectives pressed him to say.”

On Hawkins’s behalf, Roslyn Litman, a civil liberties activist, along with her husband and law partner, S. David Litman, and another lawyer, Howard Specter, sued the N.B.A. on antitrust grounds, arguing that the league had in effect illegally banned Hawkins and deprived him of the “opportunity to earn a livelihood.”

They won. The league paid Hawkins a settlement of nearly $1.3 million and dropped the ban. Hawkins joined the N.B.A. in 1969 and became an instant star with the Suns.

Mr. Wolf recounted the Hawkins case in 1972 in the book “Foul!: The Connie Hawkins Story.” Jonathan B. Segal, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said it showed “how an underprivileged black man was victimized by a fat-cat, unfeeling Establishment.”

Cornelius Hawkins was born on July 17, 1942, in Brooklyn. He was introduced to basketball as a youngster in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by a New York City police officer, Gene Smith, who helped run recreational programs at a Y.M.C.A.

His career at Boys High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant was capped by his being named a first-team high school all-American by Parade magazine in 1960.

“My model was Elgin Baylor,” he told The Times in 1992, recalling the forward known for his superb body control when playing with the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. “My friends and I used to sneak into the old Madison Square Garden to see him play. Before Baylor, basketball was a more stand-up-and-shoot game.”

Hawkins averaged more than 24 points a game, sixth best in the N.B.A., in his first season with the Suns, and he was named to the all-N.B.A. first team.

He put up impressive numbers for several more years, but when his skills began to erode he was traded to the Lakers early in the 1973-74 season.

The Lakers dealt him to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1975-76 season, and after one season with them he retired, having averaged 16.5 points a game in his N.B.A. career.

Hawkins later worked in recreational programs for youth in Pittsburgh and was hired by the Suns as a community ambassador in 1992.

A list of survivors was not immediately available.

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A. career for so long. He displayed no rancor.

“My attitude was that had I not played in the A.B.A., I wouldn’t have a job,” The Boston Globe quoted him as saying. “Had I not played with the Globetrotters, I would not have learned the experience and traveled around the world. Those things helped me out and gave me a different style of play once I got into the N.B.A.”

Asked whether induction gave him a sense of vindication, he responded: “My vindication was that I got into the N.B.A. and was able to play basketball. This was icing on the cake.”","Connie Hawkins, Electrifying N.B.A. Forward Banned in His Prime, Dies at 75",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/obituaries/connie-hawkins-dead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

It was unclear whether Girardi understood that, unlike in the regular season, he had two challenges instead of one.","Given a night of restless sleep — and after perhaps letting an excoriation from the news media (including from commentators on the YES Network, which is partly owned by the Yankees) sink in — Girardi ventured to the Bronx on Saturday, disassembled his standard defensive armor and offered up something unusual: a mea culpa.

“I screwed up,” he said.

“In hindsight, yeah,” he added. “I wish I would have challenged it.”

“Again, I screwed up,” he went on. “And it’s hard. It’s a hard day for me.”

In his decade as manager of the Yankees, Girardi has probably offered fewer such apologies than the number of pitching changes he made on Friday night. Typically, questions to him that call for self-reflection are dealt with dismissively. On Saturday, he responded with something approaching humility.

When he was asked near the end of Saturday’s 12-minute news conference if this mistake would be hard for him to forget, Girardi said: “Let’s just see what happens tomorrow and as we move forward. That will probably determine the severity of it.”

If the replay fiasco indeed becomes the epitaph for this Yankees season, it will be the latest once-a-decade, mistake-by-the-lake moment the team has endured in Cleveland, which happens to be the ancestral home of the Steinbrenners, the team’s owners.

The nonreview would be a fitting accompaniment to Mariano Rivera’s surrendering the only road playoff home run of his career — to Sandy Alomar Jr., with the Yankees four outs from clinching a 1997 division series — and to the swarm of midges that befuddled pitcher Joba Chamberlain and unspooled the Yankees in a 2007 series loss.

That last playoff defeat here a decade ago turned out to seal the end for Manager Joe Torre, whose forced departure after the season paved the way for Girardi’s entrance.

Though the current ownership, led by Hal Steinbrenner, is more deliberate, questions will nevertheless be invited about Girardi, whose contract expires after this season — including, apparently, from inside his own clubhouse. Early Saturday morning, reliever Aroldis Chapman’s Instagram account liked a fan’s post expressing hope that the Yankees would not renew Girardi’s contract, calling the manager “a complete imbecile.”

(A Yankees spokesman, Jason Zillo, said Chapman had accidentally liked the post and had apologized to Girardi.)

Girardi had a number of other moves backfire on Friday night — lifting C. C. Sabathia after only 77 pitches, leaning too heavily on the relievers Chad Green and David Robertson, and using Ronald Torreyes as a pinch-runner and then watching him be picked off second base. But when Girardi walked into a news conference immediately after the loss, he struck a tone far different from the one he used on Saturday.

Instead of acknowledging that he had slipped on a banana peel, he offered explanations.

Girardi ignored that Green — one of baseball’s best at avoiding bats — did not appear typically untouchable after throwing 42 pitches in the Yankees’ wild-card win on Tuesday. He had allowed eight two-strike pitches to be fouled off before Lindor’s home run. Instead, Girardi clung to Green’s “success” against Lindor, who had walked twice and struck out twice previously against Green.

It was his response to questions about the replay, though, that sounded especially hollow.

“My thought is I never want to break a pitcher’s rhythm,” Girardi said. “That’s how I think about it. So if it’s not something — there was nothing that said he was not hit.”

That’s not quite accurate. Catcher Gary Sanchez told Girardi immediately that he heard the ball hit Chisenhall’s bat. Players in the Yankees dugout noticed that Chisenhall never flinched. “When there wasn’t a reaction from the hitter, I was yelling that it didn’t hit him,” designated hitter Chase Headley said.

When it comes to challenging umpire’s calls, managers generally view their players’ pleadings with a skeptic’s eye: Trust but verify.

Weber, the coaching assistant who walked away from a job as a stock analyst, has consistently rewarded Girardi’s faith.

When he sees something on one of the two flat-panel monitors, which can carry as many as 15 different camera angles, Weber picks up a phone and calls the dugout. The bench coach Rob Thomson answers and relays what Weber says to Girardi, who will signal to umpires whether he wants to challenge a call. Teams are allotted 30 seconds to make a decision.

Since replay was instituted for the 2014 season, nobody has been more efficient than Weber. The Yankees have had the highest percentage of calls overturned in three of the four seasons. The exception was in 2016, when they were second. The Yankees won 29 of 41 challenges this season.

“Webby is usually right on,” Girardi said in an interview last year. “I don’t even run back and look, and I could run back and look in our clubhouse. I trust him with anything.”

But on Friday night, Girardi said, Weber was not immediately provided with the same slow-motion replay that TV viewers saw, which showed the ball hitting the knob of Chisenhall’s bat and deflecting into the glove of Sanchez. If the call had been overturned, the pitch would have been a third strike and the final out of the inning, depriving Lindor of his bases-loaded at-bat.

(Weber said after the game that he wanted to comment but had been instructed not to.)

Girardi said he was told that Weber had found the replays available to him inconclusive. The manager had to decide whether to make a challenge anyway.

Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

It was unclear whether Girardi understood that, unlike in the regular season, he had two challenges instead of one.","Given a night of restless sleep — and after perhaps letting an excoriation from the news media (including from commentators on the YES Network, which is partly owned by the Yankees) sink in — Girardi ventured to the Bronx on Saturday, disassembled his standard defensive armor and offered up something unusual: a mea culpa.

“I screwed up,” he said.

“In hindsight, yeah,” he added. “I wish I would have challenged it.”

“Again, I screwed up,” he went on. “And it’s hard. It’s a hard day for me.”

In his decade as manager of the Yankees, Girardi has probably offered fewer such apologies than the number of pitching changes he made on Friday night. Typically, questions to him that call for self-reflection are dealt with dismissively. On Saturday, he responded with something approaching humility.

When he was asked near the end of Saturday’s 12-minute news conference if this mistake would be hard for him to forget, Girardi said: “Let’s just see what happens tomorrow and as we move forward. That will probably determine the severity of it.”

If the replay fiasco indeed becomes the epitaph for this Yankees season, it will be the latest once-a-decade, mistake-by-the-lake moment the team has endured in Cleveland, which happens to be the ancestral home of the Steinbrenners, the team’s owners.

The nonreview would be a fitting accompaniment to Mariano Rivera’s surrendering the only road playoff home run of his career — to Sandy Alomar Jr., with the Yankees four outs from clinching a 1997 division series — and to the swarm of midges that befuddled pitcher Joba Chamberlain and unspooled the Yankees in a 2007 series loss.

That last playoff defeat here a decade ago turned out to seal the end for Manager Joe Torre, whose forced departure after the season paved the way for Girardi’s entrance.

Though the current ownership, led by Hal Steinbrenner, is more deliberate, questions will nevertheless be invited about Girardi, whose contract expires after this season — including, apparently, from inside his own clubhouse. Early Saturday morning, reliever Aroldis Chapman’s Instagram account liked a fan’s post expressing hope that the Yankees would not renew Girardi’s contract, calling the manager “a complete imbecile.”

(A Yankees spokesman, Jason Zillo, said Chapman had accidentally liked the post and had apologized to Girardi.)

Girardi had a number of other moves backfire on Friday night — lifting C. C. Sabathia after only 77 pitches, leaning too heavily on the relievers Chad Green and David Robertson, and using Ronald Torreyes as a pinch-runner and then watching him be picked off second base. But when Girardi walked into a news conference immediately after the loss, he struck a tone far different from the one he used on Saturday.

Instead of acknowledging that he had slipped on a banana peel, he offered explanations.

Girardi ignored that Green — one of baseball’s best at avoiding bats — did not appear typically untouchable after throwing 42 pitches in the Yankees’ wild-card win on Tuesday. He had allowed eight two-strike pitches to be fouled off before Lindor’s home run. Instead, Girardi clung to Green’s “success” against Lindor, who had walked twice and struck out twice previously against Green.

It was his response to questions about the replay, though, that sounded especially hollow.

“My thought is I never want to break a pitcher’s rhythm,” Girardi said. “That’s how I think about it. So if it’s not something — there was nothing that said he was not hit.”

That’s not quite accurate. Catcher Gary Sanchez told Girardi immediately that he heard the ball hit Chisenhall’s bat. Players in the Yankees dugout noticed that Chisenhall never flinched. “When there wasn’t a reaction from the hitter, I was yelling that it didn’t hit him,” designated hitter Chase Headley said.

When it comes to challenging umpire’s calls, managers generally view their players’ pleadings with a skeptic’s eye: Trust but verify.

Weber, the coaching assistant who walked away from a job as a stock analyst, has consistently rewarded Girardi’s faith.

When he sees something on one of the two flat-panel monitors, which can carry as many as 15 different camera angles, Weber picks up a phone and calls the dugout. The bench coach Rob Thomson answers and relays what Weber says to Girardi, who will signal to umpires whether he wants to challenge a call. Teams are allotted 30 seconds to make a decision.

Since replay was instituted for the 2014 season, nobody has been more efficient than Weber. The Yankees have had the highest percentage of calls overturned in three of the four seasons. The exception was in 2016, when they were second. The Yankees won 29 of 41 challenges this season.

“Webby is usually right on,” Girardi said in an interview last year. “I don’t even run back and look, and I could run back and look in our clubhouse. I trust him with anything.”

But on Friday night, Girardi said, Weber was not immediately provided with the same slow-motion replay that TV viewers saw, which showed the ball hitting the knob of Chisenhall’s bat and deflecting into the glove of Sanchez. If the call had been overturned, the pitch would have been a third strike and the final out of the inning, depriving Lindor of his bases-loaded at-bat.

(Weber said after the game that he wanted to comment but had been instructed not to.)

Girardi said he was told that Weber had found the replays available to him inconclusive. The manager had to decide whether to make a challenge anyway. It was unclear whether Girardi understood that, unlike in the regular season, he had two challenges instead of one. And beginning in the eighth inning, managers can always ask the crew chief to initiate a review.

“Moby-Dick.” I read it first, and then I listened to it. I actually preferred having it read to me — having all the voices of the characters acted out was great.

Whose writing today most inspires you?

Graphic memoirs/novels are very inspiring to me. It feels like a very supple and new form. There are too many nongraphic memoir/novel writers whose work I love to name them all. George Saunders, Elif Batuman, Rachel Cusk, Matthew Klam, Rivka Galchen, Jeffrey Eugenides, Jennifer Egan, Emma Donoghue, Kazuo Ishiguro …

I love contemporary fiction, but I also love long, older novels. I love getting involved with the characters, and also getting a sense of another time and place. Right now, I’m listening to “The Old Curiosity Shop.” Listening to a book while working on a craft project, like hooking a rug or embroidering, is my idea of a really good time.

Which genres do you avoid?

Not a big fan of fantasy, although I’m O.K. with some science fiction. I avoid books about romance, sports, detailed history of wars (“And then General Eisenhower said …”), books about secrets of success, and that whole genre of self-help books that seem to be pitched mainly to women about exercise, diets, being “mindful,” etc. Depressing.

The last book that made you laugh?

“Trashed,” the graphic novel about a garbage collector that I mentioned before. At one point, the garbage collector is taunted by a jerky kid. Later that day while on his route, he sees that kid from behind and throws a bag of garbage at him. When the kid turns around, he realizes it’s just some poor bespectacled shlub who happens to be wearing the same shirt as the taunter. He muses about how, for the rest of his life, that kid is going to wonder why a trash collector threw a bag of garbage at him.

The last book that made you cry?

“A Tale of Two Cities.” That scene at the end, where the little seamstress and Sydney Carton are being taken to the guillotine. She’s terrified and asks him to hold her hand, which he does. You feel that even though she knew she was still going to have her head chopped off, he was able, somehow, to take a tiny bit of the terror away. That got to me.

The last book that made you furious?

“The Power Broker.” Robert Moses may have been a genius and a visionary, but he was also a horrible jerk. He idealized cars and loathed public transportation. Interestingly, he never learned how to drive, so his whole idea of driving and cars was shaped by a life spent in the back of limousines.

What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?

“The Art of the Deal.” Kidding!!! As if!!!!!!!!

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?

Hero? So many. Nick Carraway. Lily Bart. Harriet the Spy. Antihero? Definitely Tom Ripley.

What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?

Voracious. Books were an escape from boredom and loneliness and also worries. I loved “The Wizard of Oz,” all the “Eloise” books, “Alice in Wonderland,” “Harriet the Spy.” I loved the whole “Betsy-Tacy” series. Generally I preferred fiction to nonfiction.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

What makes you so sure he knows how to read?

You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?

Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Marcel Proust. It would probably be incredibly awkward and embarrassing. I would be dumbstruck by my love and awe of them. They would probably be annoyed and wondering why I woke them from the dead and brought them to this lame dinner. On top of everything else, my cooking is terrible. Maybe their mutual irritation at me and their dislike of the food would be a conversation starter.

Mr. Cox, the estate’s executor, declined to be interviewed for this article. But many have been unable to resist making a quick mental inventory of Mr. Bergé’s holdings: the paintings, the furniture, the libraries and the cash; an auction of his and Mr. Saint Laurent’s personal collection fetched hundreds of millions in 2009.

Those who pictured Mr. Cox shuttlingluxuriously among the homes Mr. Bergé kept in Paris, Normandy, St.-Rèmy-de-Provence, Marrakesh and Tangier will be disappointed, according to Quito Fierro, the chief administrative officer of the Jardin Majorelle Foundation. The foundation is a subsidiary of the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation that operates, along with the museum in Marrakesh, the public Majorelle Garden and a museum of Berber culture there.

The vacation house Mr. Bergé built in Normandy was not his, Mr. Fierro said; he simply retained the right to use the house after selling it and Château Gabriel, on the same grounds, following Mr. Saint Laurent’s death.

And the other residences — including Villa Mabrouka in Tangier, which has been on and off the market in recent years with an asking price of around $10 million — will be sold to benefit the umbrella foundation, whose presidency has passed from Mr. Bergé to Mr. Cox, Mr. Fierro said.

No one should be worried about Mr. Cox’s housing, however. Villa Oasis, the lavish Orientalist fantasy where Mr. Bergé lived in Marrakesh, is part of the Majorelle Foundation, but is Mr. Cox’s in all but name, a perk that comes with the guardianship of Mr. Saint Laurent’s artistic legacy.

For all the clucking and tallying, Mr. Cox and Mr. Berge’s wedding was met with little more than a nod by those who track the movements of the forbidding and glamorous, if increasingly diminished, clan that surrounded Mr. Saint Laurent.

Christopher Gibbs, a neighbor in Tangier, where Mr. Cox has a residence of his own, called him “a saintly figure, which could not be said of Pierre.” Mr. Gibbs, a retired dealer in high-bohemian antiques who dressed the sets for the Mick Jagger film “Performance,” praised Mr. Cox for being “such a wonderful support to Pierre, through thick and thin, and for so many years. I weep for Madison having all this responsibility. It’s beyond the call of duty.”

Jane Kramer, in her takedown of Mr. Bergé in The New Yorker in 1994, put Mr. Bergé’s unsaintliness another way, writing, “He has a lugubrious, rather terrifying self-regard.” He appears “undisturbed by the tempering plain truths of self-reflection,” she wrote, noting that his wrath was “legendary.”

Mr. Bergé had more than one “L’Amour Fou” (crazy love), the name he gave the 2010 documentary about him and Mr. Saint Laurent. In published letters he wrote to Mr. Saint Laurent after the designer died, he made Mr. Cox’s place in the hierarchy of his heart clear.

“With you, Madison remains the most important relationship of my life.” He arrived “when alcohol and drugs had taken possession of you.”

“Thanks to Madison, probably, I weathered the storm,” Mr. Bergé continued. “He gave me what I needed: his youth, culture, courage, integrity, love.”

“I didn’t leave you,” Mr. Bergé went on to write. “I could have during this time with Madison, I almost did. Finally, it was he who’d had enough, who left.”

“You loved him, hated him, then loved him again.”

Maria Callas could not have sung the strangulated story of Mr. Bergé, Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Cox any better.

In 1976, nearly two decades after meeting, Mr. Bergé broke romantically from Mr. Saint Laurent. Still, jealousy and possessiveness ran high, and the men remained business partners.

Accounts of the Cox-Bergé introduction vary. Mr. Cox has placed it in Paris in 1978; Annabelle d’Huart, a jewelry designer and member of the old Saint Laurent tribe, puts their first meeting in New York a year earlier, when Mr. Cox was a student at Parsons. At the time, Mr. Bergé was involved with Joël Le Bon, who was in charge of the music for the Saint Laurent shows and worked for Interview magazine in Paris.

”I introduced Joël to Madison, they fell in love, and Madison followed Joël to Paris, transferring to Parsons there,” Ms. d’Huart said.

Mr. Bergé got to know Mr. Cox better during a trip they took with her and Mr. Le Bon. to the Aeolian Islands the following summer.

According to Mattia Bonetti, a furniture designer who knew Mr. Cox in Paris in the 1980s, “Madison was first with Joël, then Yves, then finally Pierre.”

After the holiday in the Aeolians, “Madison ascended quickly in the Saint Laurent clan,” Ms. d’Huart said. “Joël no longer measured up and was dropped. The clan was like a tank that rolled over you, then moved on, laughing loudly and shrugging, ‘Who cares?’ Joël died of AIDS, forgotten.”

Mr. Bonetti said that in the beginning, Mr. Cox and Mr. Bergé “saw each other, not in a hidden way, but separate from Yves, to avoid scenes.” Over dinner one night when Mr. Cox had stepped away from the table, Mr. Bonetti said Mr. Bergé asked him, “‘What do I have to do to keep him?’ I told him, ‘You have to give Madison everything, and I don’t mean materially, because otherwise he’s going to leave.’”

Mr. Bergé felt obliged to engage someone else for the garden at Gabriel, because of the tension that using Mr. Cox would have created with Mr. Saint Laurent. The job fell to a Louis Benech, who would later turn his hand to the Tuileries.

“I said to Pierre that I didn’t see the point of my working at Gabriel when he could hire his friend,” Mr. Benech recalled. “‘Too complicated,’” he said. “‘Period.’”

Peter Dunham, a decorator in Los Angeles, met Mr. Cox in Paris during his early years with Mr. Bergé. “Pierre really didn’t allow Madison to have friends,” Mr. Dunham said. “He lived a very controlled, gilded-cage existence.”

Jane Stubbs, an antiquarian bookseller, was commissioned by Mr. Bergé to create a Morocco-theme library for a guest room at Mabrouka. She remembered “arriving in Tangier with Madison and waiting at the luggage carousel. His phone rang. It was Pierre. ‘Where have you been? You were supposed to get in at 5:25.’ It was 5:27.”

The triangle collapsed during Christmas 1987, when, as Mr. Bergé wrote, Mr. Saint Laurent began hiding tumblers of whiskey from him behind the Jacques Grange taffeta curtains at Gabriel.

Mr. Cox retreated to New York, opening an office and remaking his life with Konstantin Kakanias, a cartoonist. Mr. Bergé took up with Robert Merloz, a young designer he backed with company money. Mr. Merloz’s collection flopped.

Christopher Mason, a musician and social chronicler, said that when Mr. Cox left him, “Pierre was flabbergasted. He couldn’t believe anyone would dare walk out on him.”

Mr. Cox also enjoyed, and was sometimes inconvenienced by, what might be called “amitiés amoureuses” (pararomantic friendships), with Ms. Stubbs and Marian McEvoy, the author of “Glue Gun Decor: How to Dress Up Your Home — from Pillows and Curtains to Sofas and Lampshades.”

Mr. Cox, with a B.F.A. in environmental design and an address book fortified by Mr. Bergé’s, has never lacked business. His clients include Michael Bloomberg, Marella Agnelli, Lauren Santo Domingo and Anne Bass, who let him loose on a thousand acres in Litchfield County, Conn.

At one point Nancy Novogrod, a former magazine editor, expressed interest in hiring Mr. Cox in Litchfield. But the message came back that he had given Ms. Bass an exclusive.","For Madison Cox, Widower of Pierre Bergé, C’est Compliqué",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/fashion/pierre-berge-madison-cox-yves-saint-laurent.html

Perched on the edge of Suttle Lake, a 20-minute drive from the tiny town of Sisters, the lodge was renovated last year by some of the team behind the Ace Hotel in Portland; the result, which reopened late last summer, emanates a sort of Wes Anderson Goes Glamping vibe.

The Boathouse also sports a cool-kid pedigree: its menu was designed by Joshua McFadden, the executive chef at and co-owner of Ava Gene’s and a founding partner at Tusk, two of Portland’s buzziest restaurants. “It would be so easy to put a world-class restaurant in that location, but for me it would feel like such an injustice,” Mr. McFadden said of the Suttle Lodge.

Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent — perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class’s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn’t disburse the money at all, “so as not to encourage capitalism.”

Of course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of “reparations.” And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?

If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they’re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country — and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?

Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India’s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.

Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader “net neutrality” decision, the government banned Facebook’s “Free Basics” plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company’s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.

Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What’s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group’s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.

In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn’t always at hand.

Traditionally, a small percentage of grapes in the region are dried after harvest until they became sweet and concentrated. They are then fermented into a sweet wine, Recioto della Valpolicella. The concentration of sugar in the dried grapes produces high alcohol levels in which yeast cannot survive — generally dying before fermentation is complete — leaving a sweet, unctuous wine.

Occasionally, though, the Recioto ferments until it is dry. This is Amarone, a powerful wine with alcohol levels that can surpass 16 percent. Even though it is considered dry, it can leave a profoundly sweet impression.

The popularity of Amarone has been widely documented. At Italian seafood temples like Marea in Midtown Manhattan, you can see diners relishing this heavy red wine with ethereal raw-fish dishes. To each their own, I suppose.

The powerful wake of Amarone has given rise to a new style of Valpolicella, known as Ripasso. Valpolicella itself tends to be light- to medium-bodied wine, fragrant but not opulent. The popularity of Amarone led to efforts to add muscle to Valpolicella, by employing Amarone-like techniques to its production.

In order to make Ripasso, grape skins left over from Amarone production or dried grapes are added to Valpolicella. The resulting maceration adds body, tannins, alcohol and intensity to the wine.

With the natural inclination to assume that more is better, it is tempting to think that Valpolicella Ripasso, with more flavor, intensity and body, is better than ordinary Valpolicella. Many people feel that way, and Ripassos can be fine wines. But I have always preferred the freshness and easy drinkability of plain old Valpolicella, which, like Beaujolais, has historically been a wine you could knock back without fear of heaviness, headache or hangover.

Nonetheless, the popularity of Ripasso has made itself felt. In the last 10 years, production of ordinary Valpolicella has declined to 18 million bottles a year, from 41 million, according to the Consorzio Tutela Vini Valpolicella, a trade association.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“Nowadays, the trend is to use most of the vintage Valpolicella to produce Ripasso,” Olga Bussinello, director of the consortium, wrote in an email.

Keeping all this in mind, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of Valpolicella from recent vintages. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, did his best to select only ordinary Valpolicellas for the tasting, but it’s not always easy to differentiate Valpolicella from Valpolicella Ripasso. The wine now has its own official designation, Ripasso della Valpolicella, but it is not always used.

For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Justin Timsit, who just recently left his post as wine director at Gramercy Tavern. Our second guest called in sick at the last minute. So, though we prefer a foursome, we tackled this tasting as a trio.

For our part, we all thought Bernie did pretty well in his selections. Of the 20 bottles, only one stood out as not a classic Valpolicella. This bottle, the 2012 Bussola Classico Superiore TB, was syrupy and 15.5 percent alcohol, as against the others, which ranged from 11.5 to 13.5 percent, more Amarone than Ripasso. Otherwise, we were impressed. As the production of these ordinary Valpolicellas has declined, the quality has risen.

“That’s a wine that takes me to that place,” Justin said, speaking of the Veneto region. “I appreciated their freshness and energy.”

Some of the wines seemed modern and highly polished, which made them less distinctive. But the best were quintessential Italian reds, balancing the flavors of sweet cherry fruit with a tart, earthy quality and a welcome bitterness that refreshed. These wines seemed light, almost delicate, yet they had a linear intensity, offering a progression of evolving sensations from first taste through last impression that lingered well after swallowing.

Photo

Those that we did not like so well seemed tarted up, not with the flavors of new oak barrels — as is so often the case in historic wine regions — but with richness, Ripasso-style, that thickened the texture. The lightness and linearity were lost. The richness seemed shapeless, arriving but not progressing.

Our all-around favorite was the 2016 Valpolicella Rio Albo from Ca’ Rugate, which was both sweet and savory, with depth, length and complexity. At $16, it was also our best value. Seven of our top 10, in fact, were under $20, indicating that the many Valpolicellas are good values.

The Ca’ Rugate was a simple Valpolicella rather than a Valpolicella Classico, a geographical indication. The Classicos come from the heart of the historic Valpolicella region, which is generally considered to have better potential than simple Valpolicella, which usually comes from areas into which the appellation expanded in the mid-20th century. That may be so, but five of our top 10 were simple Valpolicellas, which suggests that conscientious farming and careful production may currently be more important than location.

Our No. 3 wine, too, was a simple Valpolicella, the savory, floral 2015 Ca’ Fiui from Corte Sant’Alda, as was No. 7, the earthy, agile 2015 Acinum.

Our No. 2 bottle, the spicy, lively 2016 Il Buono from Le Albare, was a Valpolicella Classico. So was No. 4, the textbook sweet and bitter 2015 Secondo Marco and No. 6, the juicy 2013 Saseti from Monte Dall’Ora. And our No. 5 bottle, the smoky, spicy 2014 Marchesi Fumanelli, was a Valpolicella Classico Superiore, a category that must meet an aging requirement of at least one year.

What is the future of this easygoing wine? It’s hard to say. If you see any Valpolicellas on good Italian wine lists these days, they tend to be either Ripassos or very expensive wines from cult producers like Romano Dal Forno or Giuseppe Quintarelli. Wines like the bottles we tasted are rare in restaurants, though they are still on retail shelves.

The Valpolicella consortium acknowledges that Ripasso is the driving force in sales from this region of the Veneto. But trade association officials say they are taking steps to preserve what they call ordinary Valpolicella. By 2018, producers will be limited to making twice as much Ripasso as they make Amarone, and they will only be able to use Valpolicella Superiore wines. This, they hope, will ensure that some grapes are left over for Valpolicella as it has always been.

Recipe Pairing: Striped Bass with Fresh Figs

Without getting Proustian about this, there are dishes that persist. Late last fall, the main course at a pinot noir dinner at Bar Boulud, one of Daniel Boulud’s restaurants, was striped bass with fresh figs. A showstopper, the whole wild striped bass was swaddled in fresh fig leaves and stuffed with fresh black figs in a red-wine sauce. Not only was it unusual — I had never had fish with fresh figs before — but it was delectable. The brooding sauce bathed the velvet figs, and the earthy depth of the sauce made the already succulent fish a fine partner for some priceless bottles of red. For the Valpolicella pairing, I did not tackle a whole 10-pound fish, nor did I have the fig leaves. I winged it without a written recipe, and assembled a close copy that made an excellent match to those Valpolicellas. FLORENCE FABRICANT

A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.","This lack of progress is an “illustration of the partial failure of the energy transition,” said Artur Lenkowski, an energy analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. “The whole point of the energy transition was to lower greenhouse gas emissions.”

Now, Energiewende is at a crossroads. Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won a fourth term as Germany’s leader after elections last month, but her party lost sway. She must form a coalition with the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Liberals, parties that have diametrically opposing views, including on environmental policies.

How such a diverse group comes together will affect whether Germany reaches its goal for carbon emissions. It wants a cut of 40 percent, compared to 1990 levels, by 2020, and of 95 percent by 2050.

The clean energy movement has deep roots in Germany.

Alternative sources of electric power are flourishing in the Allgäu, a region of rolling pastures, pine forests and domed churches that is home to Ms. Zinnecker’s family-owned farm.

Photo

In Wildpoldsried, a village of 2,600 a short drive from the farm, around €40 million has been invested over the years — much of it by residents — into an array of renewable power sources and improvements in energy efficiency. The brightly painted, wood-trimmed houses are heated cheaply by generators fueled by methane gas from cow manure, and wind turbines nearly 500 feet tall provide electricity from the hillsides.

Günter Mögele, Wildpoldsried’s deputy mayor and energy coordinator, said that the village’s decision in the late 1990s to focus on renewable energy had paid off.

Overall, the village generates about seven times as much energy as it consumes, and the surplus is sold to the grid. The income from solar panels on public buildings is fed back into the public purse. It is often doled out to subsidize residents’ shifts to green power, and to reduce fees for the local music club and sports facility.

But renewable energy subsidies are financed through electric bills, meaning that Energiewende is a big part of the reason prices for consumers have doubled since 2000.

These big increases “are absolutely not O.K.,” said Thomas Engelke, team leader for construction and energy at the Federation of German Consumer Organizations, an umbrella organization of consumer groups.

The higher prices have had political consequences.

The far-right party Alternative for Germany, which won enough support in the recent elections to enter Parliament, has called for an “immediate exit” from Energiewende. The party, known by its German initials AfD, sees the program as a “burden” on German households, and many supporters have come into its fold in part because of the program’s mounting costs.

Julian Hermneuwöhner is one such voter. Mr. Hermneuwöhner, a 27-year-old computer science student, said his family paid an additional €800 a year because of Energiewende.

“But it hasn’t brought lower CO 2 emissions,” he said. “It’s frustrating that we’re paying so much more, because the country hasn’t gotten anything for it.”

As a clean energy pioneer, Germany has not always seen the results it desired from its heavy spending.

Photo

For instance, the country has focused on cleaning up electric power generation, with some success. About one-third of German electricity now comes from renewable sources, a fivefold increase since 2000. In the United States, that figure was about 15 percent last year. Britain generates about a quarter of its power from renewables, and France about 19 percent.

But that progress has been undone somewhat by the government’s decision to accelerate its phase out of nuclear power after the 2011 disaster in Fukushima, Japan. That has made the country more reliant on its sizable fleet of coal-fired power stations, which account for the bulk of emissions from electricity generation.

The country has yet to address the transport industry, where emissions have increased as the economy boomed and more cars and trucks hit the road. Unlike Britain and France, Germany has not set a date to end the sale of diesel and gasoline cars.

Recent political experience does not bode well for Germany. The so-called grand coalition between Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which governed from 2013 until the recent elections, was bogged down with so many competing interests that it was unable to push ahead on energy policy.

Advocates of Energiewende charge that Germany is in danger of falling behind rivals like China and the United States in the potentially vast, and fast-growing, business of developing and exporting clean-energy technologies. And without new direction, they say, the country will most likely fail to meet its carbon emissions targets.

How the government comes to terms with these problems will be crucial for the sector and for consumers.

Germany has already moved to bring subsidies under control. In particular, it has driven down costs by introducing an auction system for new renewables projects — though it is still on the hook for subsidy payments for the 20-year life of existing projects.

A bigger issue may be that Germany has already taken some of the easier steps in its energy transition by making industry more energy efficient and building up renewables.

Further progress will require taking on tougher targets. That would mean challenging the politically powerful auto and coal industries, including unions and companies, that have opposed plant shutdowns.

“Some of the low-hanging fruit might be gone now,” said Tim Boersma, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “It is becoming clear how challenging making this overall transition is.”","Germany’s Shift to Green Power Stalls, Despite Huge Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/energy-environment/german-renewable-energy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

对很多人来说，富兰克林研究所(Franklin Institute)的新展“始皇兵马俑”(Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor)将是唯一一个机会，能够一睹1974年在中国一个柿子园下面发现的大约8000个泥塑士兵和其他人物中的一小部分的风采。在大约2200年前，它们由秦始皇下令制作，属于一场持续了大约30年的大型公共工程项目。

尽管这10个兵马俑中部分已在其他地方展出过，但富兰克林研究所正在利用增强现实技术，以数字的方式再现这些雕塑原本拿着的武器和其他器具，提升观展体验。在被埋在三个大坑的漫长岁月里，随着土墙和屋顶的木料坍塌，这些武士起初携带的那些物件毁坏消失了。

这些东西和塑像的三维图像已经用摄影测量法制作出来了。这个过程是在拍摄了成千上万张照片的基础上进行的。

The Franklin Institute 数字保存团队为这些武士雕塑拍摄了数千张照片，以便通过数字方式对他们进行再现。该过程叫摄影测量法。

技术专家与策展人携手，用数字的方式再现这些武士手持的剑和长矛。他们对展出的两名非军人雕塑——一名文官和一名乐师——也进行了同样的处理，以体现他们应该拿着的或身边应该有的物品。

在订票或抵达博物馆时，游客可在智能手机上下载一款应用，然后通过该应用便能使用这项技术了。游客只需把手机放到固定在每一尊塑像上的解说展示牌上的二维“目标”前面，便可激活这些武士所携武器的数字图像。

Her work has been criticized as “disingenuous,” and it’s true that Ms. Kaur stays remarkably on brand.
Ms. Kaur too has been accused of writing about experiences that she hasn’t had herself.
This dynamic has cropped up recently with the writers Lang Leav (with whom Ms. Kaur shares a publisher) and Tao Lin.
Ms. Kaur’s work reminds us that the ordinary business and experience of millennial minority women is not to be dismissed.","“Milk and Honey” has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 25 languages. Over the last two years, it has spent 77 weeks on The New York Times Trade Paperback Best-Seller List. Her second book, “The Sun and Her Flowers,” was released this week and is No. 2 on Amazon’s best-seller list.

But Instagram is really where she publishes. Some of Ms. Kaur’s poems are just a line, like “i think my body knew you would not stay.” It lends itself to parody. Her themes don’t vary too much: heartache hurts, love heals, women are strong, loving yourself is key to most things. Her work has been criticized as “disingenuous,” and it’s true that Ms. Kaur stays remarkably on brand.

Ms. Kaur too has been accused of writing about experiences that she hasn’t had herself. Asked about this, she shrugged. “It’s so complicated,” she said. It’s also not, historically, a requirement for poetry. Writing poems is how she processes the news and the world around her, she said, and for what she hasn’t lived, she tries to understand.

The underlying message of all this criticism is that Ms. Kaur’s work isn’t “real literature.” The literary world doesn’t have a great track record of embracing or even acknowledging artists like Ms. Kaur, who are different in some notable way, but who attract an enormous and fervent audience.

This dynamic has cropped up recently with the writers Lang Leav (with whom Ms. Kaur shares a publisher) and Tao Lin. Like a Kathy Acker or even a Patti Smith before them, these writers also weren’t seen as important, largely because of their too-youthful or too-female readership.

“Critics might think that Kaur’s readership is young and female, so her work can’t be serious, which is obviously wrong,” said Matthew Hart, a professor of English and comparative literature Columbia University. “Her style doesn’t seem naïve.”

Art by women and art intended for women can be derided as common, popular and unsophisticated.

Jane Austen, Dr. Hart said, was “one of the most important figures in allowing us to get over the idea that the ordinary business of ordinary young women’s lives can’t be the topic of important art.”

But Austen died 200 years ago. Ms. Kaur’s work reminds us that the ordinary business and experience of millennial minority women is not to be dismissed.

I spoke with dozens of Ms. Kaur’s fans and critics, most of them young women. Those who dislike her work agree with enthusiasts that she’s addressing weighty issues like violence, sexual assault and trauma in a way that is admirable.

“We’re best friends and we’ve been apart for two years, but we’d send each other her poems on Instagram when one of us was feeling down or lonely,” said Katharina Gadow, 28, who attended Ms. Kaur’s reading with a friend who had just moved to New York.

For Shannon Donnelly, 24, “Milk and Honey” was “sometimes difficult to read” because she has struggled with depression and anxiety. Ultimately, reading the book was like “working through my pains with a therapist,” she said.

Ms. Kaur has “hit the nail on the head in every single way,” said Tiffany Praimnath, 19. “Guyanese culture is reminiscent of Indian culture to me, especially how men treat women, and I think because Rupi’s of Indian ancestry, that really resonated.”

Many fans told me they share her poems with friends via Instagram or screen shots sent as texts, as encouragement or as a way to let Ms. Kaur’s work speak for them. Ms. Kaur becomes permission and voice both, a reminder and a vehicle that they have every right to speak, even when they are made to feel like they should be silent. Organizations including the National Eating Disorders Association, Moms Can Code, and Curvy Girls Scoliosis all broadcast Ms. Kaur’s work on social media as encouragement, solidarity or motivation.

Two chapters of her new book were written after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. In them she tells the story of her family. Poems about her ancestors and her mother’s bravery in leaving Punjab read as thank-you notes.

“I wonder what it was like for my mom,” Ms. Kaur said. “How the hell did she pick up, move and do that all by herself?”

The gratitude she feels to her parents for working hard and giving her the opportunity to get an education will resonate with children of immigrants. It’s hard to ignore the power of such work in a moment when the White House pushes for mass deportations of people like Ms. Kaur’s family. Her father, Suchet Singh, arrived in Canada as a refugee in the early 1990s.

On Monday, when asked about Ms. Kaur’s work, her mother just smiled. Her father said that he also had no words to describe how proud he and his wife are of their daughter, but he did say: “She’s following her soul’s purpose.”

After stumbling upon Ms. Kaur’s work on Tumblr nearly three years ago, Rijoota Gupte, a fan of the writers Jhumpa Lahiri and Khaled Hosseini, couldn’t stop thinking about Ms. Kaur’s words.

“Rupi’s not like other writers, and that’s exactly why I like her,” she said. Her mother was beside her.

“She’s thought-provoking in a different way, and she opened my eyes to issues not normally talked about in Indian families — things like abuse, violence towards women, trauma,” Ms. Gupte said. “Her poems are important to South Asian women like me. She’s breaking into this industry that doesn’t represent people who look like her — who look like me.”",Rupi Kaur Is Kicking Down the Doors of Publishing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/fashion/rupi-kaur-poetry-the-sun-and-her-flowers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state regulators, has long opposed association health plans, saying they are bad for consumers because they can operate outside some state consumer-protection laws. In addition, the state regulators said this year in a letter to Congress, proposals to allow such purchasing groups “could actually increase the cost of insurance for many small businesses whose employees are not members of an association health plan.”

But Mr. Trump has presented such plans as a potential solution for millions of Americans. He stated his intentions on Sept. 27 as he left the White House for a trip to Indiana.

“I am considering an executive order on associations, and that will take care of a tremendous number of people with regard to health care,” Mr. Trump said then. “I’ll probably be signing a very major executive order where people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things, and buy their own health care. And that will be probably signed next week. It’s being finished now. It’s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people — millions of people.”

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he had been working with the Trump administration to clear the way for association health plans, which he said would allow more people to obtain good coverage at a lower cost.

“The health care debate is not over,” Mr. Paul said. “Conservatives are still fighting for free-market reforms to the health care system. I am excited to be working with President Trump on this initiative.”

“Association plans would let plumbers, carpenters, welders or any type of small business band together to get group health insurance,” Mr. Paul said recently, describing his vision. “Literally any group — your church, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union — any group of people who choose to do so could offer cheaper, better health insurance.”",Trump Poised to Sign Order Opening New Paths to Health Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-association-health-plans.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A nearby cafeteria had orange vinyl flooring, something that I hadn’t seen in years. There were also orange banquettes, giving the eating area a personalized, intimate feel, while retaining the eccentric color coordination. The nearby executive dining room had a bold blue design, with a stunning hexagonal wood ceiling and an excellent lakefront view.

The crown jewel of the nearby Research and Development building is its circular staircase, designed by the architect Kevin Roche, a prominent Saarinen collaborator. The staircase gets its structural support from thin rods that are anchored at the top and bottom, creating another “floating” effect. The hallways leading to offices are generally long and narrow, but remain vibrant spaces since the design enables frequent sightings of co-workers.

Walking out on a patio at the Research and Development building, the blazing sun was contributing to an unbearable heat index. However, I got a great overview of much of the G.M. center, one that further revealed its carefully planned, linear layout.

Photo

The center originally contained 25 buildings, which were mostly built of curtain wall construction, with beams exposed on the exterior and glazed brick that deviated from the standard industrial look. Currently, there are 38 buildings across 710 acres. From Engineering to Design to Research and Development, with other departments in between, the G.M. center continues to thrive.

“It is amazing that General Motors is using buildings more than 60 years later for the same purpose,” Ms. Skarsgard said. “The entrance canopies pull you into the buildings, and they’re simple, clean and inviting.”

Next year, the company is slated to expand the General Motors Design studios, constructing a new building that will surround the Design Dome, along with a new parking garage. I couldn’t see the interior of the silver-topped dome since it is still hosts internal events, but it has a storied history. Many G.M. vehicles have been tested, inspected and approved at the dome, featuring models as old as the 1957 Chevy Bel Air and 1963 Corvette Sting Ray. The column-free interior was designed to be a grand showroom during a time when American automotive companies dominated the market share.

Saarinen was accomplished by the time his first few buildings opened at the G.M. center. Here was evidence that he wasn’t resting on his laurels, that his vision had kept him on the path to his goals. Saarinen sought to design at the highest levels while retaining creative control, which is why one of his last projects resonated with me so deeply.

Drive roughly an hour west of Warren and you’ll arrive in Ann Arbor, filled with quirky shops and collegiate charm. Eero Saarinen temporarily served as a design consultant for the North Campus development at the University of Michigan there and designed the Earl V. Moore Building, which opened in 1964 and houses much of what is now the School of Music, Theater and Dance.

When I approached the building, I was struck by the peacefulness of the surrounding area. I had driven past the bustling main campus closer to South State Street, but the North Campus was much quieter. I walked through the William K. and Delores S. Brehm Pavilion, the modern addition to the Moore building, and noticed several undergraduates taking their instruments into performance spaces and auditoriums. In the Saarinen-designed section, the wooden doors, well-placed brickwork and large clocks signaled his imprint: they are hallmarks of his architectural style.

Through a door left slightly ajar, I could see the sun starting to set, and hear the crickets starting to chirp. The Moore building, on hilly terrain and overlooking a small pond, inspired me to meditate. Saarinen wanted to connect people to nature, and I was proof of that.

Eero Saarinen fell ill while his university building was being constructed, and passed away in 1961 at only 51 years old. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before his death and didn’t get to see the completion of the flight center, Dulles Airport, the Gateway Arch or the John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Ill., among his other high-profile projects.

Today, the Saarinen imprint in Michigan continues to be widely revered. His works will continue to be models for future architects and designers. Eero Saarinen gave the world visually-stunning works that influenced modern design and challenged conventional wisdom, a legacy that’s well worth exploring.

Pfizer said its prices would be just above its own manufacturing costs. Cipla said it would sell some pills for 50 cents and some infusions for $10, a fraction of what they cost in wealthy countries.

The price-cut agreement comes with a bonus: Top American oncologists will simplify complex cancer-treatment guidelines for underequipped African hospitals, and a corps of IBM programmers will build those guidelines into an online tool available to any oncologist with an internet connection.

SAN JUAN, P.R. — Like many other frivolous things on the island these days, the shiny motorcycles at the Planet Honda showroom have been pushed to the side.

In their place are dozens of folding chairs, and on Thursday morning, they were all filled with Puerto Ricans waiting to buy the most essential machines on the post-hurricane landscape: portable generators, to light their powerless homes.

María Aguilera, 57, a teacher, was waiting in the line that had formed outside the showroom Thursday morning. When the sun sets these days, she said, she relies on candles for light. And like everyone else in Puerto Rico — including Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló — Ms. Aguilera said she had no idea when the power grid might be restored.

“From the things I’ve seen with the infrastructure,” she said, “it could be months.”

Hurricane Maria’s near total destruction of the commonwealth’s electric power grid has transformed Puerto Rico into Generator Island. Running on gas or diesel, and ranging from lawn mower to moving-truck size, the generators are the only option for the roughly 90 percent of the island that has no access to the decimated grid. Generators now power big-box stores, high-rise apartment buildings, auto shops, fast-food restaurants, wastewater treatment plants and little country homes. And their low, incessant groan is the new drone note in the discordant symphony of post-storm Puerto Rican life.

The generators are a temporary fix that is raising health and safety concerns and highlighting the stark divisions of class in a place with a 45 percent poverty rate. They are also the only option for most Puerto Ricans for now, as the island struggles with restoring its electrical system — by far the most important and complex challenge the storm has presented.

In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Rosselló could not say when the system, which was infamously fragile before the storm, would be fully restored.

“There is no estimated date right now,” he said. “We have established, right at the beginning of this week, we want to have 10 percent of the energy generation in Puerto Rico. Now we’re up to 10.6 percent. And our expectation is, within the next month, to have 25 percent.”

Many big-box stores and hardware stores are selling out of generators for home use. Julito Ramírez, the Planet Honda general manager, said that his company was having a hard time keeping up with demand, selling 250 to 300 units per day. After ordering all of the generators he could find in the United States, he has turned to a cache he found in Canada.

“We are in that cycle of finding and bringing, and finding and bringing,” Mr. Ramírez said. The generator everyone wants, he said, is a $6,000 model that can run a home air-conditioning system. The biggest model he had in stock this week was a $2,300 machine that can run a refrigerator, some lights, a washing machine — but not an air conditioner.

For one customer, Victor Negrón, it would have to do. He said his old generator had given out two days earlier. “I’ve had to go to hotels to charge my phones,” said Mr. Negrón, 50, a health care executive. “We’ve lost all of the food in our refrigerator.”

The storm destroyed 85 percent of the island’s energy transmission and distribution system, and the fix could cost $5 billion, said Ricardo Ramos, chief executive of the beleaguered Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa. The public utility is saddled with $9 billion in debt and filed for bankruptcy in July. The Puerto Rican government also filed a form of bankruptcy in May.

The Trump administration has asked Congress to approve a $29 billion aid package for Puerto Rico, as well as for hurricane-damaged Florida and Texas. But in the days after September 20, when Hurricane Maria strafed Puerto Rico, Prepa’s money troubles made it “almost impossible” to pay the large contracts required to bring in other states’ power companies to help restore the grid, said José E. Sánchez, a director with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the head of the task force to restore power in Puerto Rico.

“It is not only personnel, but all the trucks and materials,” Mr. Sánchez said in an email. “That could cost millions of dollars.”

But Meena Dayak, a spokeswoman for the American Public Power Association, the trade group that coordinates the state-to-state mutual aid networks for public power utilities, said that Prepa never reached out to them for help.

“The way our mutual aid works is we can only go in if help has been requested,” she said over the phone on Friday.

Mr. Ramos, Prepa’s chief executive, said he did request help but when none came, he hired a Montana-based company, Whitefish Energy Holdings, to restore many of the power lines. Mr. Ramos said 200 subcontractors were already on the ground.

Andy Techmanski, chief executive of Whitefish, said that a shortage of housing for his crews meant that only 75 were on the island, and that clogged ports were making it a challenge to bring in heavy equipment.

He also said it would take six months or longer for all of Puerto Rico to have its power restored.

The rebuilding will be particularly difficult because many lines stretch across the island’s mountainous interior. There is also the question of whether Puerto Rico should modernize its rickety and outmoded system while it rebuilds. On Friday, the governor said that a modernization effort would “run parallel” with the effort to simply restore power. He said he has begun speaking with Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive, about ways to increase green energy options for Puerto Rico, which received just 2 percent of its power from renewable sources before the storm. (Mr. Musk said on Twitter Thursday that rebuilding the island’s grid with independent solar and battery systems “could be done.”)

But Mr. Sánchez said that the assignment from the Federal Emergency Management Authority is to repair the system only. “We are there to repair-replace, but not to augment,” he said.

As he waited to buy his generator, Mr. Negrón sympathized with the governor. The island needed a better power system, he said. But people did not want to wait. His mother, he said, “wants her electric now.”

In the meantime, the generators rumble on, though not without problems. A few blocks from the Honda store, the Hospital San Francisco has had two generators fail since the storm, resulting in the evacuation of patients, according to El Nuevo Dia, a local newspaper. In a visit to the hospital Thursday, the lights were on, and a worker said a backup generator was powering them. But hospital officials declined a request for comment.

Across town at the Costco, Juan Torres, an assistant manager, showed off the massive, truck-size generator that the business, like many here, had installed before the storm. Mr. Torres said it was burning 1,000 gallons of diesel per day.

But Mr. Torres said that home generators normally offered at the store were sold out.

Across the island, the Army Corps of Engineers has set up 34 huge generators so far, running everything from police departments to water pumping facilities to a Prepa office, according to Lisa Hunter, a spokeswoman for the Corps. Corps officials said on Friday that 177 other generators arrived late in the week, with some of them headed to the United States Virgin Islands.

Camilla Feibelman, a founder of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Sierra Club who currently runs the Rio Grande chapter, said that Facebook was full of complaints about the generator noise on the island these days.

More seriously, she said, generators can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning when misused — a common concern among officials in post-storm environments. Last month, three people in Orange County, Fla., died from carbon monoxide poisoning after running a generator inside their homes.

Adriana González, a Sierra Club organizer in Puerto Rico, said the high cost of a generator “creates a disparity” between rich and poor. In her neighborhood, she said, “you have one house illuminated, and then total darkness for like a block.”

Mr. Ramírez, the Honda store manager, said that some generators were stolen from the showroom in the days just after the storm. So the store now makes the sale in the showroom, then has customers pick up their generators from a warehouse a day later.

If nothing else, it is a good time to be a generator repairman like José Miguel Márquez, 35. Mr. Márquez said he was so busy these days that the biggest problem is finding time to deposit his checks at the bank.","Minus Electrical Grid, Puerto Rico Becomes Generator Island",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/puerto-rico-power-generators.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London.
Photo“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted.
“We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said.
“Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said.","With so many exhibits and monographs devoted to fashion photography and its leading practitioners, it’s hard to imagine that it wasn’t that long ago that the genre was seldom the focus of highbrow studies. Yet, that’s what Eugénie Shinkle discovered when she began researching it almost a decade ago.

“My fascination for fashion photography emerged because of my complete disbelief at how widely ignored the genre was in academia,” said Ms. Shinkle, a reader in photography at the University of Westminster, London. “Apart from a handful of exceptions, there was a real reluctance amongst scholars to engage with it in a serious way,” she said. “Unapologetically commercial, it had been reduced to ‘only advertising.’ And, until recently — that is until it started appearing in galleries — it was considered to be ephemeral. Because it wasn’t meant to last and because it wasn’t created with any kind of critical or artistic intent, people didn’t believe its history should be approached in that way.”

After publishing “Fashion as Photograph: Viewing and Reviewing Images of Fashion” in 2008, which examined why the genre deserves intellectual scrutiny, she’s now releasing “Fashion Photography: The Story in 180 Pictures,” a compendium of important figures who help chart the genre’s evolution. From Camille Silvy, a diplomat turned studio photographer in the 1850s, to the contemporary creative couple of Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes, who specialize in abstract still lives, the volume published by Aperture chronicles various movements and turning points.

“The history of fashion photography is the history of a growing confidence in its ability to comment explicitly on the wider world,” Ms. Shinkle noted. “Initially, it was reluctant to engage explicitly with politics, but since the end of the ’60s it has become more openly, overtly and unabashedly political.”

After World War II, photographers like Henry Clarke subtly alluded to the changing role of women in society by portraying them as “independent and in control,” writes Ms. Shinkle. Artists like William Klein parodied fashion conventions and encouraged his peers to engage in self-criticism. Even Richard Avedon proved to be a revelation: “I learned to appreciate his depth and talent by seeing how he was able to reinvent himself halfway through his career and noticing how ardently he campaigned for the use of models of color. Creatively, and politically, he’s one of the most important fashion photographers of the 20th century.”

By the ’90s, thanks in no small part to the nonconformist British magazine “The Face,” the grunge movement — which challenged gender norms, capitalism and the ideals of social respectability — appeared in mainstream publications and paved the way for today’s more cerebral work. Collier Schorr’s images, for example, question gender fluidity, notions of desire and how identity is constructed, while Chen Man speaks up creatively about China’s complexities.

Photo

Looking at the people in the volume, it also become more apparent how conservative the industry has been. Most photographers listed are Western-educated white men. This is due in part to the author’s and publisher’s decision to keep close reins on what was considered a primer. “We focused on the West because that’s where the major fashion houses and publications have historically been located,” Ms. Shinkle said. “I had to make that decision early on. Did I want to include more vernacular practices like that of Cameroonian photographer Samuel Fosso, who has been doing amazing fashion-inspired work since the ’70s? Or, did I want to restrict it to so-called pure fashion photography?”

In doing so, she revealed how difficult it has been for traditionally marginalized groups to be taken seriously. Case in point: Women, in the early 20th century, were rarely behind the camera. Yva, Madame D’Ora and Toni Frissell were trailblazers working “at a time when that was not what a well-bred women did, because photography was seen as a technical job.” To showcase them and highlight their technical prowess and unique perspectives is to revise history, which too often ignored them. Similarly, the inclusion of the Harlem Renaissance photographer James Van Der Zee, well known in the African-American community, but virtually unknown at the time outside of it, “points out how exclusive and white-centric the industry was in those years.”

While there’s now a more diverse roster, there’s still a long way to go. “Fashion photography is a most fantastic barometer of the time,” Ms. Shinkle said. “It’s representative and it popularizes certain tendencies in ways that no other type of photography can because it’s so ubiquitous.”

Correction: Sept. 27 2017:

An earlier version of this article misstated the academic title held by Ms. Shinkle. She is a reader in photography, not a professor of Photographic Theory and Criticism.

Classic deviled eggs, paired with ‘The One Where They Build a House’ (Season 2, Episode 2)

You’ll be forgiven if you don’t remember George Michael’s girlfriend Ann. (Yes. Her.) She was, to most of the Bluth family, offensively inoffensive, remarkably forgettable. She ate eggs in a way that charmed George Michael but put off his father, Michael, who had trouble remembering her or even noticing when she was in the room. The recipe for a “Mayon-egg” is simple: Just squirt a small packet of mayonnaise into your mouth, pop in a hard-boiled egg and slosh both around. For a more refined recipe — and one that your friends and family are unlikely to forget — I recommend our recipe for classic deviled eggs. Like Ann, there’s nothing fancy or surprising about this recipe: It’s just a good, reliable standby.

Pork with salted vegetable soup, paired with ‘S.O.B.s’ (Season 3, Episode 9)

Lindsay Bluth Fünke is, like a majority of her siblings, an entitled dilettante without much of an instinct for domesticity. Perhaps that’s why, when she finds a can of ham, she decides to put it in a pot of boiling water. It’s not soup, she tells her brother, it’s a more literal interpretation: “hot ham water.”

The results are mixed. Buster, the youngest and simplest Bluth sibling, assesses the dish this way: “So watery. And yet there’s a smack of ham to it.” If you’re looking for an elevated take on hot ham water, I recommend this recipe by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, which combines egg noodles, fresh pork (not canned) and so-called Shanghai cabbage (canned) with Chinese flavors.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges.
It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

Photo

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

Ms. Bloom, who said earlier this week that she was working only as an “adviser” to Mr. Weinstein, said she resigned from her role Saturday.
As the Times investigation revealed, however, no charges materialized after Mr. Weinstein paid off his latest accuser in a confidential settlement.
The allegations against Mr. Weinstein have come to light several years after similar stories concerning Mr. Cosby.
As The Daily Beast noted, Lena Dunham was one of the few who spoke out against Mr. Weinstein.","“The unfortunate reality of Hollywood is that if someone has money, then they can generally find some kind of audience of people who are interested in working with them,” said Kim Masters, the editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter. This was particularly true of Mr. Weinstein, who, she said, was known for having “the golden touch” that produced “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting,” “The King’s Speech” and “Shakespeare in Love.”

Ms. Masters had been chasing the Weinstein story for years. She said she had gotten near “the end zone” once, only to bump up against the ultimate silencer: fear.

“At the last minute, the source withdrew,” she told me.

She said she wanted to believe that times were changing, given the number of women who have put their names to the words that derailed the careers of Bill Cosby, who faced criminal charges that resulted in a mistrial this year, and Bill O’Reilly. But she also wondered aloud whether trouble had finally found Mr. Weinstein because he was no longer the rainmaker and hitmaker he had once been.

“This industry is passionate about causes,” Ms. Masters said, “but when it comes down to doing business, they’re definitely capable of holding their noses.”

With the knowledge that the Times article was heading toward publication, and with word of a similar piece in the works at The New Yorker, Mr. Weinstein assembled an all-star team of crisis-management experts and lawyers that included Lisa Bloom. Ms. Bloom, who said earlier this week that she was working only as an “adviser” to Mr. Weinstein, said she resigned from her role Saturday. She is known for her work representing alleged (and often confirmed) victims of sexual harassment, including those who took on Mr. O’Reilly.

Ms. Bloom shared one reason she may have been sympathetic to Mr. Weinstein on Twitter in April, when she wrote, “My book SUSPICION NATION is being made into a mini-series, produced by Harvey Weinstein and Jay Z!”

Mr. Weinstein has admitted to some inappropriate behavior, and Ms. Bloom has attributed his missteps to his status as a “dinosaur” who is now “learning new ways.”

Certainly, shamefully, there is a long tradition of disgusting harassment of women who try to make it in the movie business. (Jack L. Warner, a founder of Warner Bros. studios, was no saint.)

The image that Mr. Weinstein had concocted for himself — that of a classic Hollywood type, the hot-tempered but charming mogul — took a serious hit in 2015 when an aspiring actress, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her at his TriBeCa offices. The New York Police Department’s Special Victims Division investigated the matter, resulting in a lot of bad press and some hard questions from his board. As the Times investigation revealed, however, no charges materialized after Mr. Weinstein paid off his latest accuser in a confidential settlement.

Hollywood isn’t the only industry still abiding behavior that never had a rightful place in civilized society. Not at all. But it stands out because the industry often holds itself up as a force for moral good, its awards ceremonies filled with beribboned attendees.

As my colleagues who wrote the investigative article about Mr. Weinstein, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, noted, he was allegedly harassing women in five-star hotel rooms across the globe even as his company was distributing films like “The Hunting Ground,” a 2015 documentary about sexual assault on college campuses. He also helped endow a “Gloria Steinem” faculty chair at Rutgers; joined a national women’s march in Park City, Utah, in January; and was a big fund-raiser for and supporter of Hillary Clinton.

The same day that The Times broke the story about Mr. Weinstein, Bloomberg News reported that State Street, the bank behind the famous “fearless girl” statue staring down the Wall Street bull, paid $5 million to some 300 female executives after a federal audit determined it had paid them less than their white male counterparts. State Street disagreed with the audit. But as in the case of Mr. Weinstein, the face it presented to the world was woefully contradicted by the charges about its out-of-view behavior.

The allegations against Mr. Weinstein have come to light several years after similar stories concerning Mr. Cosby. The charges against the once-beloved comedian and sitcom star had been floating around for years. But they generally stayed hidden — and did not figure in the biography of Mr. Cosby by the former Newsweek editor Mark Whitaker, published shortly before his public image unraveled — because of what my predecessor, David Carr, described as Mr. Cosby’s “stalwart enablers” and “ferocious lawyers.”

Mr. Weinstein had his own enablers. He built his empire on a pile of positive press clippings that, before the internet era, could have reached the moon. Mr. Carr wrote in a 2001 New York magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein, of whom he was an astute observer: “As the keeper of star-making machinery, Weinstein has re-engineered the media process so that he lives beyond its downsides.”

Every now and then, glimpses of his nasty side spilled out, like when he placed the reporter Andrew Goldman in a headlock and dragged him out of a party in 2000. Someone who was involved in that altercation, Rebecca Traister, wrote in New York’s The Cut on Thursday that it didn’t get the media attention it deserved because “there were so many journalists on his payroll, working as consultants on movie projects, or as screenwriters, or for his magazine.”

Let’s hope that those in the know did not include members of the Los Angeles Press Club, which this year gave Mr. Weinstein its “Truthteller Award,” calling him an example of “integrity and social responsibility,” along with Jay-Z. (The mogul received the honor because of his producing “Time: The Kalief Browder Story,” a Spike TV documentary series about a 16-year-old who spent three years in Rikers Island awaiting a trial that never took place.)

The Press Club might want to rethink the award given that Mr. Weinstein has hired the emerging leader of anti-press jurisprudence, Charles Harder, who brought the case that put Gawker out of business last year.

And what about the eerie Hollywood silence? As The Daily Beast noted, Lena Dunham was one of the few who spoke out against Mr. Weinstein. It sure was a departure from the delight that greeted the charges against the conservative Mr. O’Reilly. Behind the scenes in Los Angeles, as Janice Min, a former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, told me, “I can guarantee the second that story hit yesterday, several men called their attorneys.”

There will be questions for those who knew what was going on but did nothing, for the agents who dispatched would-be stars to his hotel suites when they may have understood what the cost would be and for the editors and reporters who conveniently didn’t bother to look into the tales making the rounds.

I asked Ms. Min how many other Harveys were out there.

“No name comes up more than Harvey Weinstein in this sort of behavior,” she told me. But, she added, “I guarantee there are many more rocks to overturn.”

My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it’s supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don’t expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name.

Today, we’re no longer trusting machines just to do something, but to decide what to do and when to do it. The next generation will grow up in an age where it’s normal to be surrounded by autonomous agents, with or without cute names. The Alexas of the world will make a raft of decisions for my kids and others like them as they proceed through life — everything from whether to have mac and cheese or a green bowl for dinner to the perfect gift for a friend’s birthday to what to do to improve their mood or energy and even advice on whom they should date. In time, the question for them won’t be, “Should we trust robots?” but “Do we trust them too much?”

With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. “Alexa, what should I do today?” Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn’t long before she was trusting her with the big choices. “Alexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?”

In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn’t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses “machine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists” to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is “better” based on “current trends and what flatters you.”

The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon’s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.

It’s these kinds of intersections – like this small collision between robot “helpfulness” and a latent commercial agenda — that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not “Alexa.” She’s a corporate algorithm in a black box.

Grace doesn’t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future — preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer “people.”

Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: “Hey, Alexa, how old are you?” and “What are you?” Some thought the device had multiple personalities. “She doesn’t know the answer,” said one child, wisely. “Ask the other Alexa.”

Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.

How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?

Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn’t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear — and many more even important things in life — my job?

133,"['houston', 'album', 'main', 'reading', 'whitney', 'production', 'lifetime', 'houstons', 'mr', 'davis', 'music', 'clive', 'continue', 'ms']","“Every Little Step,” a recent book by Ms. Houston’s ex-husband, the R&B singer Bobby Brown, also takes the position that Ms. Houston’s sexuality was part of her struggle.
In it, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Manilow complained that he was turning into a milquetoast Andy Williams.
By that time, Mr. Griffith, the man who found Ms. Houston, had quit his job working for Mr. Davis.
“I said, ‘Whitney, are you pinching yourself?’ and she said ‘Yeah, Clive, I’m pinching myself,’” Mr. Davis said.
Afterward, said Ms. Houston’s former bodyguard David Roberts, speaking in “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” Ms. Houston descended further.","Ms. Houston was different.

Mr. Davis signed her in 1983 when she was just 19 years old, and he played an essential role on all but one album she recorded over the next 29 years.

He brought her songs and scouted producers. He introduced her at publicity events. He repeatedly extolled her supremacy over Mariah Carey.

At the peak of her life, she secured his place as an industry titan. In death, she haunts his legacy.

This past April, a laudatory documentary about him, “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” (based on his own memoir and available next week on Apple Music), opened the Tribeca Festival. A great party was given at Radio City Music Hall. Jennifer Hudson sauntered through the crowd singing a medley of Ms. Houston’s greatest hits.

Then came mixed reviews — and the debut at the festival of “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” a contrasting documentary that casts Ms. Houston as a victim of the music business’s most base inclinations. (It is currently airing on Showtime.)

Much like last year’s Academy Award-winning documentary “O.J.: Made in America,” it raises difficult questions about race and arrives at the conclusion that there was a psychological cost to being a black superstar whose image was created with the express purpose of maximum crossover.

Kenneth Reynolds, who worked at Arista, the label founded by Mr. Davis and on which Ms. Houston made her career, recounts how material that “was too black-sounding was sent back.” Kirk Whalum, who played saxophone on several of Ms. Houston’s tours, describes a woman who became devastated to learn that black people were calling her “White-ney” and a “sellout.”

Mr. Davis isn’t the principal villain in this other film.

There is much blame directed at Ms. Houston’s mother, the gospel singer Cissy Houston, and various members of the Houston clan, who had been on her payroll for many years.

But, still.

Another powerful component of this documentary is the on-camera testimony of more than a half-dozen colleagues of Ms. Houston’s, who say that the singer’s spiral into addiction had as much to do with her sexuality as it did with race.

Ms. Houston’s relationship with Robyn Crawford, an essential person in her camp from before Ms. Houston became famous until 1999, was the subject of speculation and gossip. Now, the narrative that the two were lovers had gained real currency, even without confirmation from Ms. Crawford.

Mr. Reynolds, who toured the country with Ms. Houston during the promotion of her debut album, described her lesbianism as “an open secret” at Arista during those early years.

“Every Little Step,” a recent book by Ms. Houston’s ex-husband, the R&B singer Bobby Brown, also takes the position that Ms. Houston’s sexuality was part of her struggle. Her marriage to him, he suggests, gave her the ability to reclaim her blackness while holding on to a basic image of straightness.

“They couldn’t let Whitney live the life she wanted to live; they insisted that she be perfect, that she be someone she wasn’t,” Mr. Brown writes. “That’s why they wanted Robyn out.”

Some people were circumspect about who “they” was. Mr. Brown wasn’t. He named them: “Clive Davis and her family.”

How Will I Know

“An artist can be extremely gifted and yet remain unsuccessful if he or she records the wrong music, or gets an image that confuses potential audiences.” That’s from “Clive: Inside the Music Business,” Mr. Davis’s 1974 memoir about his time at CBS Records.

Being out as lesbian or bisexual certainly would have confused audiences in 1985, said the actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell, who knew Ms. Houston and Ms. Crawford socially and said she had “no doubt” they were together and that what they had “was real.” (Ms. Crawford declined to speak for this article, and did not submit to an interview for “Whitney: Can I Be Me”).

Back then, Ms. O’Donnell said, “There was no Ellen. There was no ‘Will & Grace.’ Lois Smith was my publicist, and she was Whitney’s publicist. When I would go to a show or the Emmys with my girlfriend Kelly, Lois would literally sit between us. She wasn’t doing it to be mean to Kelly. She was trying to protect me.”

Among the first of Ms. Houston’s contemporaries to come out was the country singer K.D. Lang, who declared she was a lesbian in 1992. A few months later, Melissa Etheridge followed suit.

But it was another half a decade until Ellen DeGeneres and Ms. O’Donnell broke the news, and they waited until shortly before their television shows went off the air to do so.

That was how it happened back then with the biggest stars, if it happened at all. You did it when you had enough money to walk away from the machine, or you used a decline to propel yourself into a life of paid appearances at gay pride parades.

“Whitney was the first evidence I had that people were willing to acquiesce to whatever it was in order to hold on to an image that wouldn’t offend, because at the time, it meant you wouldn’t have a career in show business,” Ms. O’Donnell said. “None.”

The decision to come out was also hard for those in the music business who worked behind the scenes.

David Geffen, the veteran record label owner and manager, announced he was gay at an AIDS benefit in 1992. His friend Sandy Gallin, who managed Dolly Parton and Michael Jackson, followed in 1994, around the time the Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner left his wife for a man.

Yet it wasn’t until 2013 that Mr. Davis acknowledged what many had known for a while: that after two marriages and four children, he had a male partner.

The New York Times reviewer who panned his second memoir wrote: “Though we do hear about his failed first marriage, his second and its aftermath go M.I.A. for several hundred pages before he awkwardly cops to being ‘bisexual’ and in ‘a strong monogamous relationship for the last seven years’ with another man.”

Step by Step

Mr. Davis’s life is a story, and he’s a dazzling character in it. It’s his tinted glasses, snazzy suits and apparent fondness for telling tales again and again — life as a rolling press junket. That some of those stories do not track, are dated and appear false on their face matters little. He probably didn’t wind up as a co-writer of Air Supply’s “All Out of Love” by being principally concerned with the opinions of skeptics.

Most of Mr. Davis’s contemporaries who became label heads started as music men. Mr. Davis is a former lawyer and his corporate sensibilities poked through the material he released, particularly at Arista.

When Aretha Franklin traded in the analog soul sound and distinctly political edge of her work at Atlantic for the consumerist, synthetic pop of Arista , The Washington Post described her first album there by saying “The queen of soul seems to be striving for a new role — the queen of sap.” The effect was sad, but few could deny Mr. Davis had an ear.

Carly Simon also had a comeback with Arista. She adores Mr. Davis, who had some great advice for her over the years. But she also said, “His energy, his testosterone, all his hormones were ignited by having the biggest No. 1 records.” She added: “He is on the side of the winner at all costs, and the cost can be very high. The cost can be somebody’s career or somebody’s innateness.”

Mr. Davis grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, where he was a member of the high school honors society, which was called Arista. While he was in college at New York University, his parents died in close succession. It was devastating, but the loss turned out to be propulsive.

“Life can change on a dime,” he said.

After Harvard Law School, he worked at a law firm, then joined CBS Records (later Columbia) in 1960 as one of two in-house lawyers. At the time, its main business was classical music, Broadway cast albums and middle-of-the-road pop singers. But profits were dropping. Mr. Davis understood that the future was in rock ’n’ roll. Within seven years, at 35, he was running the label.

At the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, he heard Janis Joplin and described it as almost like finding religion. Yet when she came to Columbia’s offices and suggested that they seal the deal with a trip to bed, Mr. Davis demurred.

In 1968 she finished her first album, and Mr. Davis thought that its single “Piece of My Heart” was too long and didn’t repeat the chorus enough. He went into the studio and re-edited it for radio on his own. He played his version for Ms. Joplin and gently coaxed her into allowing the label to release it.

It went gold, the album sold more than a million copies, and the myth of the Great and Powerful Clive, a man with no musical training and supreme ears, was underway.

He was “devastated” when Joplin died in 1970. “Our fortunes were intertwined,” he writes in his first memoir. It was a “terrible loss.”

But it went beyond the personal. “It would be wrong to pretend I wasn’t upset over the commercial loss as well,” he adds in the memoir. “The music business is a business.”

Over the next few years, CBS (now called Columbia) signed Santana; Earth, Wind & Fire; Blood, Sweat & Tears; and Liza Minnelli. Mr. Davis entered into a promotion and distribution deal with Philadelphia International, which moved the company into R&B and disco, with great success.

Then, a reckoning followed when a Newark federal grand jury investigation was convened to look into the practice of industry payola. The Internal Revenue Service obtained financial records that showed that quarterly promotion checks sent by Columbia to Philadelphia International had been used to illegally supply money and drugs to radio programmers.

Mr. Davis also ended up in a muddle in which a mafia-acquainted head of artist relations dummied up false expense reports, included one for $18,000 for the Plaza Hotel bar mitzvah of Mr. Davis’s son Fred, billed as a party for Ms. Minnelli. Other violations included airfare for two of Mr. Davis’s pet beagles.

Mr. Davis was charged with six counts of tax evasion and pleaded guilty to one count. He maintains that he did nothing wrong, besides relying on someone who went too far on his unknowing behalf. “It was a witch hunt,” he said, and many agree.

Payola was never proven. But he was still fired.

In Fredric Dannen’s 1990 book, ‘“Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business,” Arthur Taylor — who dismissed Mr. Davis from his job — explained that the cause of the firing was that Mr. Davis had been offered the opportunity to come clean on the expense account issues and responded with lies.

“There’s something so strange about Clive Davis,” said Mr. Dannen, speaking now. “He has had one of the most remarkable careers in the music business, and yet so much about it is tainted. Not just by the payola thing, but by his need for attention. It may be that Clive’s greatest talent is his ability to distort reality.”

In My Business

Determined to rebuild his reputation, Mr. Davis took over a small label called Bell Records in 1974 and renamed it Arista. He signed Patti Smith and Lou Reed, but his principal success in the early years came from middle-of-the-road singers.

Photo

Enter: Barry Manilow and Melissa Manchester, both of whom sold loads of albums at their peak, yet subsequently seemed to lose part of their souls, as Mr. Davis relentlessly molded their images and their music to his liking.

“We could not find a comfortable way to communicate,” Ms. Manchester said. “As my albums progressed, I had to fight harder and harder to get a place for my songs, which was weird, because I’d come in thinking he liked what I did as a singer-songwriter, and he wanted me to be a vocalist for songs that I thought were rather bland and simply loud. He always wanted me to be current, and I always wanted to be timeless. It’s a different way of looking at the same picture.”

Mr. Manilow had similar issues. When he first started out, he wrote pop songs with contemplative lyrics about broken marriages. Then he met the label head who, Mr. Manilow said in a memoir, “looked more like a banker than a music man” and told him that his album was “nice” but needed hits. Mr. Davis started delivering him other people’s songs to sing.

“I Write the Songs,” despite the title, was one. Another was “Brandy,” later changed to “Mandy.” These cemented Mr. Manilow’s status as the grieving straight guy who couldn’t get over a lost love.

It was hard for Mr. Manilow to know what to think. He was a giant success, yet he was miserable. He wrote in his diary: “Why am I angry?”

In 1981, Mr. Manilow and Mr. Davis had a tense meeting. In it, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Manilow complained that he was turning into a milquetoast Andy Williams. Mr. Davis responded: “Well, if you were Irving Berlin, we would know it by now.”

So Mr. Manilow left the label, although not before someone handled the rumors of him being gay by saying that he was living with a female production assistant named Linda Allen.

Then, his first album with RCA bombed, and he returned. Mr. Manilow finally came out in 2017, many years after returning to Mr. Davis’s stable.

The sabbatical was fortuitous. “It helped him get a different perspective and cherish the partnership,” Mr. Davis said.

“There’s this eternal argument between the part of us that wants to be an artist and the part of us that wants to be a success,” Ms. Simon said. “The success part often wins.”

Same Script, Different Cast

Mr. Davis never liked being called a Svengali for what he did with Ms. Houston. He thought that sounded slithery. Still, it’s hard to describe their collaboration without leaving that impression.

They met in 1983 at the behest of Gerry Griffith, who worked in Arista’s A&R department.

Ms. Houston was born near housing projects in Newark. Her family moved to the more middle-class East Orange, N.J., when Cissy, Ms. Houston’s mother and a backup singer for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin, began enjoying success.

As a child, Whitney sang gospel with the New Hope Baptist Choir. She was unsure of herself, with a tendency to sing in the back. Cissy had some ambivalence about whether her daughter should become an entertainer, but she nevertheless told her that if she was going to sing, she’d better step up.

By 16, she was singing with Cissy on Chaka Khan’s disco masterpiece “Clouds.” Whitney may not have known then what the bargain of fame would feel like, but she knew where she was headed. “I was always going to be a star,” she later said.

So a showcase for Mr. Davis was set up.

Her performances that night were standards: “Home” from “The Wiz” and then “The Greatest Love of All.”

“They were knockouts,” Mr. Davis said. “She had the entire package.”

Ms. Houston was beautiful. She had great power as a singer. But beyond that, he said, she had a level of self-control that was remarkable.

If she did not have great ambitions to become a songwriter (a thing critics subsequently used to discount her artistry), Ms. Houston knew exactly what she was singing about. When she did runs, it was usually because the lyrics called for it.

Mr. Davis’s recollection is that he talked with Ms. Houston around that time about music, and she told him Lena Horne and Dionne Warwick (who was her cousin and already on Arista) were her favorite singers.

Later, Ms. Houston would say her favorites growing up were Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole, which is a big difference. Who knows which version of the story is true. Ms. Houston, like Mr. Davis, was never the world’s most reliable narrator.

Two weeks after Mr. Davis signed her, he went on “The Merv Griffin Show” and introduced his protégée to the world. She hadn’t recorded a song yet, but that was how much he believed in her. (Also: He loved going on television.)

Making her debut album took nearly two years. Mr. Davis said the idea back then was to build her appeal in both the pop and the R&B markets, but Mr. Reynolds said there was never any question which one was more important.

“Arista was a pop-oriented label,” Mr. Reynolds said. “That’s what the staff knew and that’s what Clive knew. That’s what he did best — and he did it better than most record executives. There was no platform for Aretha Franklin’s ‘Ain’t No Way’ on Arista. They needed Aretha Franklin doing ‘Who’s Zoomin’ Who?’ and Whitney Houston doing ‘Greatest Love of All’ and Billy Ocean doing ‘Caribbean Queen.’ Because the bigger the pop record, the more money you could make.”

And when “Whitney Houston” came out in 1985 and turned into the biggest-selling debut album in history, the principals involved did make money.

Three songs went No. 1 on the Hot 100. She won a Grammy in the pop category for “Saving All My Love for You” but lost in the R&B category for “You Give Good Love,” a clear indication of the success of the appeal to white audiences.

By that time, Mr. Griffith, the man who found Ms. Houston, had quit his job working for Mr. Davis. “He only saw the big numbers. That was just his mind-set,” Mr. Griffith said. “It’s like hiring our current president to run a label. That’s why I could not agree with everything he was doing. That’s why I left.” (Mr. Davis apparently felt more warmly about Mr. Griffith. He later hired him back.)

In 1987, Ms. Houston’s follow-up arrived and the first four singles all hit No. 1, making her the first artist in history to have had seven consecutive chart toppers. “I said, ‘Whitney, are you pinching yourself?’ and she said ‘Yeah, Clive, I’m pinching myself,’” Mr. Davis said.

It’s a story he loves to tell, but the tale was abbreviated.

The reviews for the follow-up album were brutal. Jon Pareles, in The New York Times, said it smacked of corporate perfectionism. The Los Angeles Times’s Robert Hilburn called it a “considerable disappointment.”

Behind the scenes, Ms. Houston was dealing with a family who increasingly depended on her and whose appetites turned out to be nearly bottomless.

She made her father her manager and bought her mother a house. They had divorced after their daughter was famous. She was taught to freebase cocaine in the late 1980s by her brother Michael.

It was Robyn Crawford who went to Cissy Houston’s house to say there was a problem with drugs.

Cissy, a Christian who still sang in church, had separate issues with the idea her daughter was gay. She wasn’t open to staging an intervention with Ms. Crawford, and decided to deal with her daughter’s problem on her own.

Mr. Davis seemed equally disinclined to address Ms. Houston’s sexuality or what effect hiding it may be having on her happiness or psychological health.

He said he has “no idea” whether Ms. Houston was gay. “We never discussed it,” he said, and went on to list the romances she’d supposedly had in the ’80s with Jermaine Jackson and Eddie Murphy.

“Oh, nonsense,” Mr. Dannen said. “Put that on the record. I remember going to a launch party for one of her albums when I was writing ‘Hit Men.’ It was all anybody could talk about. Clive didn’t know? Of course he knew.”

Rosie O’Donnell said: “For Clive Davis to claim ignorance about this is, I believe, a boldfaced lie.”

When asked about this, Mr. Davis said that any implication he “orchestrated” a cover-up around Ms. Houston’s sexuality or that he “did not want her to be herself” was “crazy.”

“I’m telling the truth,” he said. “Did I read that there was speculation? I did.”

“There was never a discussion between me and Whitney about any kind of romantic relationship with Robyn,” he said. “There was never an indication that there was.” Mr. Davis added that he first became aware there was a drug problem sometime around 2000.

All the Man That I Need

In April 1989, Ms. Houston and Ms. Crawford attended the Soul Train Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. When Houston’s name was announced among the nominees for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Single, female, a loud booing could be heard in the audience.

“I was there,” said the producer Kenny Edmonds, known as Babyface. “We talked about it because we were all a little shocked. She was very upset.”

That was the night she met Mr. Brown for the first time. He sat in front of her and also performed, gyrating on the stage while singing “My Prerogative,” the song that had turned him into the spokesman for recalcitrant youth — the sort who were no longer playing her records.

Ms. Houston flirted with him a little, then invited him to her 26th birthday party in New Jersey. Ms. Houston and Mr. Davis also hired Babyface and his partner L.A. Reid to work on her third album, “I’m Your Baby Tonight.”

“The irony is that if she was trying to go blacker, I don’t know that we were the guys to go to,” Mr. Edmonds said. “We were in the middle. But maybe that’s why Clive called us in the first place.”

In 1992, Ms. Houston and Mr. Brown were married in New Jersey.

The morning of the wedding, Mr. Brown walked into Ms. Houston’s bedroom, he writes in his memoir, hoping “for a quickie” with his bride-to-be.

He found her “hunched over a bureau, doing a line of coke.” So he joined in, thinking to himself what good fortune it was to have found someone like her. “She was classy and street at the same time,” he writes. Then came the ceremony, where the maid of honor was Ms. Crawford.

By now, Ms. Houston was promoting what would become her biggest commercial vehicle yet, “The Bodyguard,” a new movie she had just filmed with Kevin Costner.

It was to be a great event, America’s black sweetheart and Hollywood’s most famous white Republican (at least back then), falling in love on screen in what seemed like a marketing team’s decision to build a movie around as many demographics as possible.

Thanks in large part to Ms. Houston’s brilliant performance of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” for the film, the movie earned $411 million at the global box office.

Even the wedding to Mr. Brown became part of the film’s promotion plan, as Ms. Houston submitted — with Ms. Crawford — to interviews with ABC News and USA Today, where they explained that they had not been lovers but were simply best friends.

“I think once she’s married, she’ll feel a lot more complete,” Ms. Crawford said. “I think that’ll be a self phase where she’ll be doing something for her life.”

One might assume Ms. Crawford would have made an exit soon after the wedding. Instead, she remained for seven years as part of the management team, locked with Mr. Brown in what several people in “Whitney: Can I Be Me” describe as a battle for the ear of Ms. Houston. During that time, Mr. Davis receded somewhat from the picture.

Ms. Houston starred in films that grappled more directly with African-American issues but descended further into her own addiction. Whatever had led Ms. Houston to pick Mr. Brown, their addictions helped make it real. “It may have seemed dysfunctional, but that doesn’t say anything about whether they loved each other,” Mr. Edmonds said. “She loved him like crazy, and he loved her like crazy.”

She suffered an overdose during the making of the 1995 film “Waiting to Exhale.” Then she pulled out of big promotional appearances for “The Preacher’s Wife” because of “throat issues.”

Around that time, Ms. Houston gave a rare interview.

“Money doesn’t make you happy,” she said. “Fame certainly doesn’t make you happy. People will tell you that who are famous. You’ve got to find the happiness within yourself. You’ve got to know who you are before you step into this business, because if you’re trying to find it, you’ll probably wind up being somebody else that you probably don’t even like.”

In 1997, Mr. Davis’s patience ran out.

He wrote her a letter: “Dearest Whitney, you know my love for you goes beyond the professional nature of our relationship, which in and of itself is almost as long as the age you were when I met you. To put it succinctly, I am seriously concerned. I know that I have absolutely no right to reflect on anything but your professional recording career, so let me address that. You have not done a studio album in seven years. You have only recorded a total of seven pop songs during the last five years and those were chosen to integrate into the characters of two motion pictures. So insofar as your position as the number one contemporary recording artist in the world is concerned, you have been practically missing in action.”

Soon enough, Houston was back in the studio, working on “My Love Is Your Love,” an album that burst with collaborations with edgy producers like Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Rodney Jerkins, who delivered her a song about being in a messy marriage with a man who can’t stop cheating on her.

It got some of the best reviews of her career, but the tour was another story. The problem wasn’t the voice, but her marriage’s increasingly Mr. and Mrs. Smith-like quality.

The situation finally broke Ms. Crawford, who determined it was time to quit the family business. She ultimately settled down with Lisa Hintelmann, a former magazine editor who works as the director of talent and entertainment partnerships at Audible.

Afterward, said Ms. Houston’s former bodyguard David Roberts, speaking in “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” Ms. Houston descended further.

Exhale

The following year, Burt Bacharach fired her from a performance at the Oscars when Houston began singing the wrong song during rehearsal. She abruptly pulled out of her performance at Mr. Davis’s induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

In September 2001, she popped onstage at a tribute concert for Michael Jackson, looking so thin that the sounds of people gasping could actually be heard throughout the arena.

Mr. Davis tried to help.

After the Oscars debacle, he invited her to come stay at his weekend home. He gently brought up her drug use. She told him she had it under control, that it was her business.

After the Michael Jackson show, he wrote her another letter begging her to get treatment, telling her how he’d seen her on television and cried. She never responded.

By then, Mr. Davis had been pushed out of Arista by his corporate higher-ups at Bertelsmann and was setting up another new label. That left Houston behind.

Her 2002 album tanked. She gave a disastrous interview to Diane Sawyer in which Ms. Houston explained, in a moment that became notorious, that she did not smoke crack. “Crack is cheap!” she said. “I make too much money to ever smoke crack.”

She described Mr. Davis being removed at Arista as a tremendous source of pain. “That hurt,” she said. “A lot.”

They did reunite, and she got divorced and released an album, “I Look to You,” with Mr. Davis once again listed as executive producer. But the combination of cocaine and years of heavy cigarette smoking had taken their toll. With her fortune diminishing and her family ever dependent on her, she agreed to stage a tour. It was a disaster.

Yet Mr. Davis was pleased to see Ms. Houston when she arrived in Los Angeles in 2012, the week of the Grammys. The way he remembers it, she seemed sober as they chatted by the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he was staying.

She told him that she had finally quit smoking and would be ready to record again that summer. She also said she was swimming daily.

But later that week, Ms. Houston went out for a night on the town with her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, and left a nightclub with her leg bleeding, after an altercation with a woman she believed was making a move on Ray J, the man she was dating.

After she died, the coroner’s report described some of the items in her hotel room: prescription drugs, empty liquor bottles and a metal spoon covered in white powder.

Mr. Davis did memorialize her at his Grammy event, the show that infamously went on no matter what, bringing Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson to the stage to perform some of Ms. Houston’s songs.

Then he went to Newark for her funeral. In his eulogy, he rattled off all the record-breaking statistics of their 27-year collaboration, name checking five of her 11 No. 1 songs, five more Top 10 hits, four of her movies and one earth-shattering rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

Once again, but not for the last time, he told the story about how he’d asked her in 1987 whether she was pinching herself at her success.

Ms. Crawford didn’t speak that day. Instead, she published a remembrance on Esquire’s website. It left a lot out.

But she did include her diagnosis of what happened to Whitney Houston. “The record company, the band members, her family, her friends, me — she fed everybody,” she wrote. “Deep down inside that’s what made her tired.”",Production of a Lifetime: Whitney Houston and Clive Davis,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/style/whitney-houston-clive-davis-sexuality.html

The Rivera brothers, who led a trafficking organization called Los Cachiros, built a fortune as middlemen, moving cocaine from hidden airstrips northward to the Mexican cartels.

The brothers used violence to muscle out rivals and others, from at least 2003 when Devis Rivera was involved in the murder of a hospital security guard and, the next year, the killing of the man he had been guarding, a Honduran cartel leader.

By late 2009, Mr. Rivera testified that he and other traffickers felt threatened by Gen. Julián Arístides González Irías, the Honduran counternarcotics czar. The American embassy in Tegucigalpa once described General Arístides González as the “last (somewhat) best hope” to revive Honduras’s counternarcotics efforts, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks.

“The decision was made to kill him,” Mr. Rivera testified. General Arístides González was assassinated on Dec. 8, 2009 by a gunman on a motorcycle.

Mr. Rivera testified that the traffickers paid $200,000 to $300,000 for the killing, which was handled by a group of police officers.

That was around the same time, Mr. Rivera testified, that he and his brother bought a president.

Concerned about the possibility of extradition to the United States, Mr. Rivera said they paid more than $400,000 in bribes to President Porfirio Lobo, before and after his November 2009 election. At President Lobo’s home in early 2010, Mr. Rivera received the assurance he wanted.

“The president said to me to tell my brother not to worry,” Mr. Rivera recalled, “because during his four-year term nobody would get extradited.”

President Lobo also designated his son Fabio, who was once a juvenile court judge, “as a middleman who would be able to protect us, help us — the Cachiros,” Mr. Rivera said.

Fabio Lobo became a valuable ally. “I gave him a bribe almost every time I met with him,” Mr. Rivera said. “I knew that having him with me, everything would go well.”

One time, the president’s son, riding with his armed security detail in a convoy of blue Prado SUVs, escorted 1,000 kilograms of cocaine for the brothers through a police checkpoint.

He “lowered the windows a little bit and then started talking with the police officers,” Mr. Rivera recalled.

By Mr. Rivera’s account, the president’s son threw himself into his new role, asking to visit a backcountry airstrip to “feel the adrenaline — what you experience when you receive a plane loaded with drugs.”

“I’d do anything for you,” Fabio Lobo said in one recorded conversation. “I’ll go to the moon and back for you.”

With President Lobo’s patronage, the brothers invested in construction companies that competed for government contracts. In the fashion of Pablo Escobar, they opened a zoo, complete with tigers, jaguars, and lions. The brothers also developed relationships with one of the country’s most prominent families, the Rosenthals, who acted as their bankers and money launderers. They invested drug proceeds in cattle, with their beef later exported to the United States, and agriculture.

Brian H. Bieber, a lawyer for former President Lobo, said his client remains under investigation by the American authorities. He said that the situation has been frustrating for Mr. Lobo, who has been “loud and clear in his emphatic denial” of Mr. Rivera’s allegations.

“There is absolutely no credible evidence to support the allegations made by an admitted mass murderer and a convicted drug trafficker,” Mr. Bieber said, adding that the former president had “absolutely no” relationship with the Cachiros.

As President Lobo’s term neared its end in 2013, Mr. Rivera had new concerns.

The United States Treasury Department had announced sanctions against the Rivera brothers, and Honduran authorities began seizing their assets, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even their zoo.

“I was afraid for my life. I was afraid for my family,” Mr. Rivera testified. “I could get killed because I had worked with politicians, police officers.”

By December 2013, Mr. Rivera testified, he and his brother Javier had begun talking with the D.E.A. and prosecutors to try to strike a deal.","After 78 Killings, a Honduran Drug Lord Partners With the U.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/world/americas/after-78-killings-a-honduran-drug-lord-rivera-partners-with-us.html

While we do visit the Kerrigans’ small cluttered apartment and the Styleses’ grand home, Egan’s book is far less interested in domestic relationships than in those of the workplace. By the early 1940s, the stability of American urban domestic life had been under threat for years. Families had been strained by the economic dislocation of the Depression, by the ethnic, religious and class divisions stemming from large-scale immigration and, finally, by the war. Add to these generational forces of entropy the more timeless problems of pride, shame, ambition and wanderlust, and no family unit in Egan’s novel seems particularly secure. “Her life was a war life; the war was her life,” Egan writes of Anna at one point. “There had been another life before that — her family, the neighborhood — but everyone from that time had died, or moved, or grown up.”

Yet what stability the central characters fail to find at home, they discover at work. Eddie, Dexter and Anna all form profound bonds on the job — whether with fellow shipmates, henchmen or divers. While in their personal lives the three struggle with the limitations prescribed by their gender, class and family roles, their intimate professional units provide them with human connections that supersede prejudice and presumption. On the job, the three can ultimately be themselves.

Perhaps it is to be expected that a story of intertwined fates should be laden with secrets. Virtually all of the characters here have them. In the course of the novel, meetings take place that are never to be spoken of again. Money changes hands with provenance suppressed. Misrepresentations of paternity and identity are engineered right alongside the more mundane deceits that spring from infidelity and murder. As Dexter’s white-shoe banker of a father-in-law observes: “Every man has his secrets, his costs of doing business.” We could elaborate by noting that secrecy can also be the cost of having relationships. In this broader context, Egan nimbly explores two of the central paradoxes inherent in the keeping of secrets. First, while a secret is a piece of information that we bury, it can quickly become the prevailing force shaping our identity and governing our actions in the world. Second, while we fashion most secrets to preserve some form of liberty, they inevitably constrain us by inhibiting self-knowledge and self-proclamation.

But for all of their asymmetric influence, secrets are ultimately mortal. What is done cannot be undone through dissemblance. The hidden fact bides its time in obscurity waiting to be revealed by a slip of the tongue or a chance encounter. And in the context of Egan’s novel, it is only when secrets unravel that the business of personal liberty can begin.

“Manhattan Beach” is principally a novel of New York. As such, it inevitably pays tribute to the city’s iconography: its crowded tenements and highbrow retreats and quasi-legitimate nightclubs. But these familiar landmarks are not the focus of Egan’s narrative. Refreshingly, Egan and her characters turn their backs on a Manhattan interior defined by subways and skyscrapers, Broadway and Wall Street, to look outward to sea. After all, from New York’s founding until not long ago, the city was chiefly a port — busy with the daily movement of goods onto and off ships. In addition, because New York was America’s gateway for immigration, by 1940 a significant percentage of the city’s population had crossed the sea to get here. The very title of the novel, “Manhattan Beach,” points to this fact of history that in modern times seems almost oxymoronic. Egan also gestures to this paradox by choosing as her epigraph a quote from Herman Melville, who spent most of his life not on the island of Nantucket but on the island of Manhattan.

In the New York of Egan’s novel, freighters are docked the length of the West Side piers and battleships are being built in the Brooklyn Naval Yards. The local fisheries and oyster beds are still thriving. By extension, the book is teeming with those who earn their living on the water: sailors, stevedores, lobstermen, shipbuilders and that particular maritime specialist prized by the underworld, the boatman who sinks bodies to the bottom of the sea. Anna principally comes of age in the Naval Yards as one of the pioneering divers who performed underwater repairs and salvage. And it is in a remote boathouse at the far reaches of Manhattan Beach that the destinies of Anna, Eddie and Dexter ultimately come to fruition — albeit at three different moments in time.

The prevalence of the ocean in this story is not simply atmospheric; it is central to the symbolism. As the Melville epigraph affirms, “meditation and water are wedded for ever.” For Anna the sight of the sea provides an “electric mix of attraction and dread” while for Eddie it’s “an infinite hypnotic expanse” and for Dexter it’s “never the same on any two days, not if you really looked.” Egan really looks, and so do her characters. Turning their backs on the crowded constraints of their urban lives, all three look to the ocean as a realm that while inherently dangerous also promises the potential for personal discovery and an almost mystical liberty. This is a novel that deserves to join the canon of New York stories.","In ‘Manhattan Beach,’ Jennifer Egan Sets a Crime Story on the Waterfront",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/books/review/jennifer-egan-manhattan-beach.html

At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. “The decision to change is not easy — culturally or operationally,” he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past “are really no guarantee of future success” as the industry is reshaped.

An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. “Our vehicles will be smart and connected,” Mr. Hackett said.

By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.

As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.

Ford’s initiatives come as the industry’s incumbents are scrambling to match outsiders like Tesla, Google and Uber, who are making big advances in automotive technology. On Monday, General Motors presented a plan to introduce 20 all-electric models by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.

In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. “That’s not good enough,” Mr. Hackett said.

Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, joined Ford’s board in 2013 and its executive ranks last year. His predecessor as chief, Mark Fields, had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and a sagging stock price.

While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.

It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.

When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford’s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its “fitness” and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.

In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it in January after it met stiff opposition from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.

In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett’s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday’s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.’s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler’s are up 71 percent.

Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter that ended June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago. But the rise came mainly because of a big profit in its credit arm and a cut in its tax bill.

“The Four Tendencies: The Indispensable Personality Profiles That Reveal How to Make Your Life Better (and Other People’s Lives Better, Too),” out last month, is already a best seller. By mid-September, over one million people had taken Ms. Rubin’s online quiz, making her the queen of personality typing.

A colleague of mine took it and learned she is an Obliger, “which is totally messing up my career,” she said. She thinks I’m a Rebel because I’m squirrelly about deadlines, but the quiz deemed me an Upholder when I first took the test, and then a Questioner the second time around; a couple of days ago, I took the test again and came up an Obliger.

Now Obligers, Ms. Rubin writes, are the most challenging of the Tendencies, other than Rebels. This is because Obligers, pushed to their limits, will go rogue: quit their jobs, walk out on their marriages, abruptly end friendships. Obliger rebellion, she calls it. (Lateness, she writes, is a small but popular form of Obliger rebellion.)

“I would say you’re a Questioner,” Ms. Rubin told me, because among other things I balked at her quiz questions. She had phoned from Los Angeles, where she was on the first leg of her book tour, and was amusing herself by noting how her audiences were dividing themselves by Tendency. “We did a meet-up through the app,” she said, “and only one Rebel showed up in crowd of almost 100 people.” This was not because Rebels won’t R.S.V.P., she concluded, but because “they don’t like to be told they have to arrive between 5 and 7.”

But back to me.

Ms. Rubin said: “Maybe you aren’t meeting your deadlines because you aren’t convinced they are really true.” According to Ms. Rubin’s research, Questioners have other charming weaknesses in addition to a certain mulishness about deadlines. These include “crackpot potential” and an inability “to accept closure on matters that others considered settled if their questions aren’t answered.”

Also, they don’t like to wait in line.

“Questioners don’t like to be questioned,” Ms. Rubin, a proud Upholder, said.

Whatever happened to just being Type A?

Ms. Rubin was a Yale-educated lawyer who once clerked for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, before diving into the self-help business with her 2009 book, “The Happiness Project: Or, Why I spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun.”

The energetic Ms. Rubin, a member of four book groups who has said that she loves to take notes, “often for no apparent reason,” larded her memoir with insights and observations, nuggets from Nietzsche to Diana Vreeland (and the Duke of Wellington, whose advice is to urinate whenever you get the chance, a happiness booster we can perhaps all agree on), along with enough social science “data” to fill three Malcolm Gladwell books.

The book and its offspring — journals, calendars and coloring books — have been consistent best sellers, having sold close to three million copies, according to Ms. Rubin’s longtime agent, Christy Fletcher.

“It came out in the wake of ‘Eat, Pray, Love,” said Ms. Fletcher of “The Happiness Project,” “this idea that to find happiness you had to leave your husband and quit your job and eat, pray, love. What Gretchen realized is that most people don’t want to leave their husbands and their jobs, and what she provided was recipes for being happier in place. It created a lot of entry points for people. Everybody can make their bed. What we’ve learned is that this kind of advice couched in the language of one person’s very specific experience was more accessible to people than having the Dalai Lama or a Harvard professor tell you what the human path to happiness is.”

I would argue that Ms. Rubin’s exhaustive and exhausting methods — her rigorous list making and goal setting, her extreme research (speed-reading every parenting manual, say, since Dr. Spock, or the collected works of Plutarch, Montaigne and Adam Smith) — would make all but the most high-functioning humans feel like slackers. But maybe that’s the point: She strives, and you warm yourself in the afterglow of her efforts.

To fully grok Ms. Rubin’s newest oeuvre, I read “The Four Tendencies” and its prequel, “Better Than Before,” in which along with the typology she introduces a complex and confounding layer of additional sorting methods that I gamely, if lamely, tried to assume and address.

But if I was a Lark, a Procrastinator, an Underbuyer, a Simplicity Lover, a Finisher and a Familiarity Lover, as I apparently am according to my answers to the questions in chapter three of “Better,” what did that actually mean and did I have to answer all the other questions Ms. Rubin strewed at the end of that same chapter, and throughout the rest of the book?

In “Better,” Ms. Rubin does attempt to soothe her information-addled readers with a section called, “Desire, Ease and Excuses,” all of which, as she writes, “play a role in the Strategies of Abstaining, Convenience, Inconvenience, Safeguards, Loophole-Spotting, Distraction, Reward, Treats and Pairing,” but I had already grown contrary. Perhaps it was all the capital letters. Or was I exhibiting the hallmarks of my type?

Questioners, Ms. Rubin writes, follow “their own judgment — sometimes even when it flies in the face of experts who (allegedly) know more.”

Personality typing has long bubbled merrily atop the self-help soup. Self-improvement may be a distinctly American habit, from its founding, a national credo, but the father of psychological types was Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist, who laid them out in a book of the same name in 1921.

“It has a long and sordid history in psychology, especially pop psychology,” said Scott O. Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory College in an email. “Most people seem to love sorting themselves into discrete, mutually exclusive categories (e.g., I’m an extrovert, you’re an introvert; I’m a perceiver, you’re a judger). Managers, bosses, and administrators seem to love them too. None of this is terribly surprising. Decades of psychological research show that the human mind craves simplicity and prefers categories to dimensions when it comes to conceptualizing ourselves and others.”

On online dating profiles, some note their Myers-Briggs type, that hoary system based on Jung’s types and beloved by white-collar companies since the 1970s, as if it were a professional affiliation or a college degree.

“As swipe-based dating apps proliferate, the pressure is on to differentiate yourself in sound bites,” said Emily Listfield, a co-founder of Jyst, a dating-advice app. “One trend we see is people putting their personality types in their profiles as a shortcut to describing themselves. The problem is that most people have no idea what the acronyms stand for. ‘Likes long walks on the beach, looking for a woman who can wear jeans or a little black dress, E.N.F.P.’ leaves most people scratching their heads.”

Ms. Listfield recalled an inscrutable profile from a military veteran who proclaimed his score from two personality systems, Myers-Briggs and something called Kolbe, a business-performance classification that rates you in a very unsexy series of numbers.

(One yearns for simpler times: “Sultry Scorpio seeks Tempestuous Leo.”)

“This kind of neat categorization is highly appealing when one’s internal emotions and struggles are so messy,” said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School who has been researching wellness and self-help culture since the 1950s. “Isn’t it comforting to put yourself in a box that others occupy as well? Doesn’t that assure us of our normalcy? And unlike, say, trying to understand your problems through a clinical source like the D.S.M.” — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Baedeker of pathologies and a bucketing good read — “all of the categories tend to have some generally objectively positive traits. That is, you won’t arrive at the diagnosis that you’re a narcissist or a sociopath in a popular self-help book, in part because no one would buy that book.”

Self-help enthusiasts do buy an awful lot of books. A third to one half of all Americans will buy a self-help title in their lifetimes, said Christine Whelan, a professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, adding that at any given time there are more than 45,000 titles in print.

Last year, the entire self-help industry — books and products — was worth nearly $10 billion, according to Market Data Enterprises. A self-help author herself, Dr. Whelan wrote her Ph.D. thesis on the history of the self-improvement movement in the United States (and met Ms. Rubin, coincidentally, in the stacks of the main branch of the New York Public Library, where both had holed up to do their research).

“Since 1975, self-help books — nonfiction books that offer advice for behavior modification and make explicit promises for positive change — have doubled as a percentage of all book titles,” Dr. Whelan said. “Self-help offers us hope that we can take control of our lives. The more alienated we feel from what’s going on in the larger world, the more likely we are to seek to regain some sense of control. And what can you control? Yourself.”

Ms. Rubin, though, bristles at the term “self-help.” “I always think of my books as being self-helpful,” she said. “How do we achieve our aims in life? How do we make ourselves happier and more productive? What’s the category for that? I don’t know.”

She divides self-help authors into Astronomers (scholarly) and Astrologers (intuitive), placing herself firmly in the Astronomer camp.

Personality typologies seem to multiply with each publishing season, growing ever more baffling. Everett Jones, the reviews editor at Publishers Weekly, recalled “Reconcilable Differences: Connecting in Disconnected World,” out last June, whose authors rated people according to their communication styles, which they described as visual, auditory or kinesthetic. It was a confounding paradigm that created some unfortunate acronyms: VAK, VKA, KAV and so forth.

“Our reviewer found it too elaborate and indecipherable,” Mr. Jones said. “I think you need a story, something you can latch on to.”

Mr. Jones admired the archetypes in a coming book, “The Right and Wrong Stuff: How Brilliant Careers Are Made and Unmade,” out next January. These are five mind-sets that apparently are impediments to successful careers: Captain Fantastic, Solo Flyer, Version 1.0, One Trick Pony and Whirling Dervish. (To my mind, that’s a tad too much narrative, but I’m still recovering from the collected works of Ms. Rubin.)

Mary Ellen O’Neill, an editor at Workman Publishing, is wrapping up her edits on “Your Story Is Your Power: Free Your Feminine Voice,” out next March, a self-help title that uses methods including the Enneagram, another ’70s holdout, to figure out how you developed your worldview and how you can rid yourself of patriarchal and other cultural biases — second-wave feminism meets personality typing for the woke generation.

Remember Kingdomality? Neither do I. But in 2005, this mash-up of pop psychology and parable making presented in a business self-help book of the same name was poised to be a best-seller. Or so its publisher hoped, said Ms. O’Neill, the book’s editor, who was then at Hyperion. “The parable was that there was a king, and his kingdom was in disarray. If he could figure what everybody’s job should be, the kingdom would be in better order.”

There were eight questions, she said, that led you to one of 12 personality types. “It was fascinating because it was so accurate. It identified your personality to a T. Everyone at Hyperion took it. I was a Shepherd, which meant I was really good at keeping things organized and together. Here’s the funny thing. Each type had a logo that went with it. The Benevolent Ruler was a heart with a crown on top of it. And our head of sales, who was also deemed a Benevolent Ruler, happened to have a tattoo on her shoulder of a heart with a crown on it. That was how she saw herself. It was pretty great.”

Nonetheless, the book was published to the sound of crickets, Ms. O’Neill said.

“I have a feeling that Kingdomality was the end of the parable trend,” she said. “And it was a very goofy parable.”",Whatever Happened to Just Being Type A?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/style/personality-type-the-four-tendencies-gretchen-rubin.html

5) 9:30 A.M. Farm to Mouth

A morning trip to the trznice (markets) — sprawled across multiple squares behind the Cathedral of St. Nicholas — is a rite of passage. The search for the day’s most important meal begins with a tour of the indoor meat and fish sections. Then sidle up to the locals between the outdoor, umbrella-covered stalls bearing crates of seasonal and local fruits and vegetables. Don’t be shy — haggle for produce, honey, cheeses and nuts under the covered arcade.

6) 11 A.M. Ocean Views

Edibles aren’t Ljubljana’s only homegrown products. For longer-term keepsakes, cross the Triple Bridge and the city’s main piazza, Preseren Square. The internationally acclaimed Marjeta Groselj — look for the G above the door — has been designing one-of-a-kind, handmade leather clutches, purses and bags (500 euros on average) in the same shop for 51 years. After, head to Zoofa, a riverside boutique housing a cooperative of 12 Slovenian designers. A swirl of colors and fabrics, dresses, shirts and jewelry fills the minimalist white space with arched ceilings and hardwood floors.



7) 1 P.M. Local Genius

The architect Joze Plecnik, who died in 1957, still drives the city’s aesthetic. Dozens of landmarks found life on his design table, including the Triple Bridge and National Library. Learn about the enigmatic genius’s process with a tour of the Plecnik House (6 euros), where he lived and worked — pencil stubs, spectacles and packs of cigarettes remain in place — for nearly four decades. Then walk five minutes north to the Krakovo neighborhood for lunch at Pri Skofu. It doesn’t get any more local than this 25-year-old restaurant, where the owner, Maja Pitarevic, makes dishes like gnocchi with arugula and prosciutto (10 euros) from scratch and harvests salad ingredients from community gardens.

8) 4 P.M. Metelkova museums

Perhaps no place in Ljubljana epitomizes the city’s creative repurposing like the Metelkova district. Once a 19th-century Austro-Hungarian army barracks, over the last two decades the complex has found new life as the Museum Quarter. The Slovenian Ethnographic Museum, the National Museum of Slovenia and the Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkovashare a quad and provide a convenient way to embrace a far-reaching slate of permanent and rotating exhibitions. For a more unfettered cultural experience, Metelkova Mesto (city), behind the quarter, has driven the alternative scene in the capital for nearly 30 years and is a go-to spot to party. Today the graffiti-strewn collection of studios and bars hosts around 1,500 yearly events, ranging from lectures and workshops to D.J. soirees.

9) 7 P.M. Dinner and Shopping

Slovenia is small, about the size of Massachusetts, but has three wine-growing zones. Take a one-minute walk from Town Square, Mestni trg, for a pre-dinner tasting at Dobrote Dolenjske, where some 350 products, including liqueurs, cheeses and wine — line shelves from the southeast Posavska wine region. For dinner, continue up the brick-lined avenue as it winds past Stari trg (Old Square) to Gornji trg. Secure a table at Repete, a bistro that hosts live jazz sessions. Check the chalkboards for daily specials — like smoked trout on baby spinach and sour cherry pie for dessert — based on what the owners scored at the market. A dinner for two with a bottle of rosé from Sveti Martin, in southwest Slovenia, costs around 50 euros.

10) 11 P.M. Final Exam

Round out your wine education with a final exam at Wine Bar Suklje, where vaulted ceilings shelter some 300 labels (half from Slovenia), filling the bottom floor of a building constructed in 1619. Relax along the river and order a flight of favorites — the wine card changes monthly — or take a blind-tasting pop quiz to see how well your studies have progressed. If you need a cheat sheet, check out the menu’s rock-music-to-wine mood scale, complete with easy-to-read icons next to each bottle.

Whenever a mass shooting shocks America, people ask if tighter gun-control measures could have prevented the slaughter.

Gun violence researchers say that no law can eliminate the risk of mass shootings, which are unpredictable and represent a small minority of gun homicides over all. But there are a handful of policies that could reduce the likelihood of such events, or reduce the number of people killed when such shootings do occur. And several of them have strong public support.

These are findings from surveys we conducted a year ago about the recurring problem of gun violence in the United States. We asked dozens of researchers in criminology, law and public health to assess a range of policies often proposed to prevent gun deaths. We also conducted a national poll to measure public support for the same set of measures.

The policies in the upper right corner of our matrix are those that were deemed effective and popular. The most effective one, according to our experts, would be restricting gun sales to anyone found guilty of a violent crime. Under federal law, such limitations apply to those convicted of felonies or domestic violence crimes. That idea has not been debated much among federal policy makers.

Expanding background checks for gun purchasers to a wider range of gun sales was also judged effective and popular. It is an idea that was considered by Congress in 2013, but failed to win enough votes to become law. Some popular measures, like strengthening sentences for illegal gun possession, were deemed less effective. And some measures that experts thought could reduce deaths, such as banning all semiautomatic weapons, were less popular, though a majority of people in our survey still approved.

In general, the public was more accepting of measures limiting the types of people who could obtain weapons than of restrictions on the types of guns and accessories available on the market.

The attack at a Las Vegas concert on Sunday was unusual even among mass shootings. Stephen Paddock, the shooter, appeared to have used modified semiautomatic weapons that fired at the rapid pace of a machine gun. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has proposed legislation that would prohibit so-called bump stocks, the devices found on several of his guns. At least some Republicans in Congress have expressed openness to the idea.

We did not ask specifically about “bump stocks,” but we did ask about a broader set of gun modification restrictions that were part of a 1990s law known as the assault weapons ban, and about outlawing large-capacity ammunition magazines that enable rapid fire. Our experts thought both ideas could reduce the death toll from mass shootings, but they were not among the most popular ideas with the public.

Select Measures That May Help Prevent Mass Shootings NOTE: Starred measures have been passed by legislature or ballot initiative but have not yet been fully enacted.

SOURCE: Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence

When we developed our list of measures, we focused on policies that were not part of federal law. And we gathered ideas from advocates on the left and the right – some part of the mainstream political conversation, and some extremely unlikely to be considered.

No state has adopted more than a handful of the ideas our experts deemed to be effective, but some states have adopted more of our experts’ preferred measures than others. Nevada has adopted relatively few. In the accompanying table, we compared Nevada with California, which has been particularly aggressive about passing gun-control measures, and Mississippi, which is among the most permissive in its approach to firearms. The table omits policies that could be instituted only by the federal government.

What Has Nevada Done?

In 2016, Nevadans narrowly approved a ballot measure that called for instituting a universal background check for all gun purchases. Currently, people who buy guns from a federally licensed dealer must undergo a background check, but not those who buy guns from individuals, including at gun shows or through internet classified sites.

The ballot initiative has not yet been enacted. The governor and attorney general, who oppose the policy, have said it is unenforceable because the F.B.I. has not agreed to conduct the checks for the states, as specified in the measure.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

MONDAY PUZZLE — Happy Monday, all! Sam Ezersky here again. You may remember me from my “big break” two weeks ago or my diagramless in yesterday’s Magazine. Either way, I’ll be sticking around through Friday, and I promise I don’t bite. [Can confirm. — D.A.]

Let me start by sharing a little secret from my constructing perspective: A solid Monday puzzle is surprisingly hard to create. The theme should not only be exciting on its own, but must also appeal to solvers with widely varying backgrounds and skill levels. On top of this, the surrounding fill should not only be squeaky clean, but largely familiar. Thus, I’m always excited to see Bruce Haight’s byline early in the week, as I know he can produce a top-notch crossword given these criteria. Today’s offering was no disappointment.

Today’s Theme

Bruce has treated us to five, rhyming _ _ _ _ Y - _ _ _ _ Y phrases that cross at the middle letter:

17A/3D: “Useful” = HANDY-DANDY 19A/11D: “Snobbish” = HOITY-TOITY 39A/29D: “Sophisticated” = HOTSY-TOTSY 58A/48D: “Affectionate” = LOVEY-DOVEY 60A/51D: “Weak and indecisive” = NAMBY-PAMBY

Themes don’t get much more straightforward than this, but this is cute and well-crafted, especially since all answers are adjectival phrases as opposed to, say, HOKEY POKEY or LAFFY TAFFY.

It’s also a testament to how helpful the theme can be for getting toeholds elsewhere in the puzzle. Having trouble in the bottom-left corner, where there isn’t an easy three- or four-letter answer in sight? Well, if you’ve caught on to the theme in other areas of the grid, then filling in LOVEY/DOVEY shouldn’t be a problem, and boom! You may have just enough letters to grok answers like SILTS, SAY-SO and perhaps even HONEY-DO.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said.","Mr. James’s committee is among more than three dozen outfits that have started or reconfigured themselves since the election to try to harness the surge in anti-Trump activism. In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups — essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.

While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations — and with relatively meager overall budgets — they are beginning to attract attention from the left’s most generous benefactors.

“We’re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,” said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. “There may be groups that have been around that don’t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.”

The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.

But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall’s election.

The Democracy Alliance distributed a “resistance map” to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as Women’s March and Indivisible.

Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.

Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible. Mr. Soros has already donated to a host of nonprofit groups playing key roles in the anti-Trump movement, including the Center for Community Change, Color of Change and Local Progress.

Indivisible would “gladly” accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group’s revenue “because we want to maintain our impendence both from the funders and from the party.”

The group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.

“It’s not a secret that we would like to move the Democratic Party further left,” she said, adding that “the party will only get to where it needs to go if it has groups like ours pushing them to do the right thing.” She cited her group’s aggressive opposition to Republicans’ initial efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a time when she said Democratic congressional leaders “didn’t really have a strategy.”

Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven’t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank “has gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.”

The think tank, known as CAP, has engendered resentment from others on the left for casting itself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement and raising money off the resistance nomenclature. Within a few weeks of the election, CAP’s sister organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, was offering T-shirts emblazoned with the word “Resist” in exchange for donations of $40 or more. The campaign raised about $450,000 for ThinkProgress, the journalism arm of the action fund, which had its lawyers look into trademarking the iconography.

Daniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group’s legal team was merely exploring “a standard question” about whether to trademark the logo. “The immediate response was no — resistance belongs to everyone,” she said.

But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.

The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.

The leader of a group founded by Mr. Sanders called Our Revolution castigated the Democratic establishment as arrogant “dictators” who want to control the “terms of unity” after her group’s activists were met by barricades outside the Washington headquarters of the Democratic National Committee when they visited in July to deliver petitions supporting a liberal policy platform.

And Ms. Hunt-Hendrix has urged progressive donors to boycott Democratic establishment-aligned groups like the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who became a leading Clinton supporter and founded Media Matters and the opposition research outfit American Bridge.

Those groups represent a “neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party” that embraces “broken tactics” and an “uninspiring” agenda “more focused on defeating the right than on creating an economy and society that lifts up all people,” Ms. Hunt-Hendrix wrote in an op-ed article this year for Politico.

Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. “The idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,” he said.

Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.

“The resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,” Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, “These grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn’t seen in decades.” And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to “bring about progressive change and elect Democrats.”

Yet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines “to wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.” And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.

That doesn’t bother Dmitri Mehlhorn, a political adviser to Mr. Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who has brought a venture capital approach to politics, seeding a wide array of new groups on the left.

“The Democratic Party has been fractured,” Mr. Mehlhorn said. “We believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.”

Among Mr. Hoffman’s donations are at least $1 million each to two of the groups suing Mr. Trump’s campaign, his administration, businesses and associates — United to Protect Democracy, started this year by a former Obama White House lawyer, and Integrity First for America, which will be unveiled later this year by the pioneering New York trial lawyer Roberta A. Kaplan.

A Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said. “But when you’ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.”

He warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could “make it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.”","The ‘Resistance,’ Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/democrats-resistance-fundraising.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

53A: Since this puzzle was solving fairly straight, I wasn’t at sufficient goofball level to see how “become lightheaded” could mean GO BLONDE. I figured it out after a few crosses but I think this is also a total gem of a clue.

58A: The first challenge for some of us when encountering “Dress-up at a comic con” might be figuring out the ol’ comic con part. Is this term widely known at this point? New York’s goes back to 2006 and it looks like the San Diego Comic Convention started in 1971. The art of dressing as featured characters is COSPLAY, a term coined in Japan in the ’80s. I would say something about nothing new under the sun, as we’ve been playing masquerade as a species for millenniums, but these costumes are really something else. New York’s con is in less than a week, guys! Come to think of it, maybe Sam has sequestered himself in his sewing room.

23D: Like the above example, this clue, “Secondary personas in role-playing game lingo” called for some knowledge of the way the kids talk. I knew this had to be “avis,” in this case pronounced with a short a, cute and short for “avatars,” and I was wrong. This grid calls for ALTS, and uses a new clue for a chestnut entry.

37D: Who’s been on the cover of British Vogue more than anyone else? One of their brand new contributing editors, natch, and Naomi Campbell didn’t fit. KATE MOSS did.

39D: I couldn’t really wrap my head around the grammar and meaning of “Track prize” for the longest time. At first I was looking for a verb, something like following one’s dream. Then I switched to a trophy or some such award, and it took forever to realize that in this case track was a racetrack, and we were talking about horse races, which get run as STAKES. This seems to be a grande olde worde from when betting folks in the Middle Ages stuck their wager, maybe a fat chicken or cute child, onto a stick and tried their luck.

Constructor Notes

From Crack Teammate #1, M.L.G.:

My seed entry for this themeless was the RIJKSMUSEUM, a place I hope to see in person someday. It was inspired by my visit to a special exhibit at the Dayton Art Institute, Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art: Treasures from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. My first themeless grid with this seed entry was submitted in July of 2016. I received a rejection in August noting that Will really liked some of the grid fill including this seed entry, but there was too much crosswordese. I asked Jeff for his assistance in reworking the grid. He pointed out I had too many three letter entries. He noted it was best not to go above 12 for a themeless grid. After numerous back and forths using a grid of Jeff’s design we submitted a revised grid a few weeks later. We received an email in November accepting the revised grid. Jeff worked the NYT debut words COSPLAY, MAMA BIRD, BEER BRAT and GO BLONDE into the grid and my contribution in addition to RIJKSMUSEUM, was OBAMA ERA. I was surprised to see the clue we had for TOMY, “Big name in toys headquartered in Japan”, was replaced by the partial TO MY. I did like the edited change of clues for EARS and DJS to “Reception figures” as well as the clue change for HARRY from a name to “Badger”. I hope you’ve enjoyed your Saturday solving experience.

And, from Crack Teammate #2, J.C.:

I like trying multiple dozens of versions of every region within a themeless. Luckily, ML graciously puts up with my OCD about exploring the entire solution space. We saved so many versions that I didn’t remember which one we finally submitted. Thankfully, ML has a good eye for what’s the best trade-off between strong entries and gluey short ones. Looking back on it, I would have tried to open up the NW and SE corners, which feel more disconnected from the rest of the puzzle than I like. It did let us easily try many dozens of versions in each area, but with so few entries connecting everything up, hopefully solvers don’t get stumped on LAKSHMI or RIJKSMUSEUM.

“Ukraine, with the exception of the Baltic States, is the only post-Soviet republic which is not authoritarian,” said Serhii Plokhii, a Harvard professor and the author of a history of Ukraine. And unlike the three Baltic States, which enjoyed brief periods of independence between the First and Second World Wars, Ukraine has only an acute awareness of centuries of subjugation by outside powers, among them Poland, Austria and Russia, that left its people inherently wary of authority.

“What is Ukraine’s national idea? It is resistance to authority,” said Taras Chornovil, a former adviser to Mr. Yanukovych.

Ukraine’s painful history as a put-upon appendage has left it ill-equipped to curb unruly habits at odds with the rule-based, scandal-shy order of the European Union, which it aspires to join.

“Its attempts to stay democratic while building a nation are often messy, its oligarchs all powerful and, given the virtual absence of state control over media and oligarchic competition, post-Soviet corruption is out in the open,” Mr. Plokhii said.

Ukraine’s domestic intelligence service, or S.B.U., its powers of surveillance greatly enhanced by monitoring equipment provided by the United States after Mr. Yanukovych decamped to Russia, has added its own highly selective and distorted form of transparency by leaking information about alleged wrongdoing, often for political or financial gain.

Controlled by Mr. Poroshenko, the S.B.U. has become a tool in domestic political and business battles, with anti-corruption activists accusing it of working to undermine, not help, their cause.

While still politically influenced, Ukrainian law enforcement is no longer the swamp of incompetence and corruption it once was. It has been able to monitor Mr. Manafort’s former business associates and turn up evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 United States election, in part owing to American technical support.

The Central Intelligence Agency tore out a Russian-provided cellphone surveillance system, and put in American-supplied computers, said Viktoria Gorbuz, a former head of a liaison office at the S.B.U. that worked with foreign governments.

Ms. Gorbuz’s department translated telephone intercepts from the new system and forwarded them to the Americans. “This team would translate and immediately, 24 hours a day, be in full cooperation with our American colleagues,” she said.

It is unclear whether any phone intercepts relevant to the election meddling investigation have gone to the American authorities. But a Ukrainian law enforcement official has given journalists partial phone records of former associates of Mr. Manafort.

Dismantling Russian spy gear, however, proved far easier than purging Russian power, which has shadowed Ukraine constantly since it declared independence in 1991 but became far more aggressive in recent years.

Since March 2014 Ukraine has lost Crimea to Russian annexation and large chunks of its industrial heartland in the east to rebels backed by fighters and weapons from Russia.

Joy Behar: I started doing The New York Times puzzle right after college, when I found myself working a job that had a lot of down time. It was difficult at first, and still is, especially on Saturday, when the puzzle is very challenging. I found that if I stuck with it, I could finish it. This proved to be a good lesson for other chores and projects. In recent years, I found my name used in the puzzles. I figured they needed the vowels. Even so, it was a thrill. As far as construction, once we landed on a theme (comedians), it was not too difficult to come up with puns for comedians’ names. The grid’s restrictions didn’t allow as many names as I would have liked, but that’s life in the crossword world. The best part of doing the puzzle every day is that it provides a distraction like no other: From politics, the phone and the refrigerator. So thank you. Lynn Lempel: This collaboration was something of a blind date set up by Will, and it was all done via email. We both decided from Day 1 that the theme would be comedians, but it took a while to get from there to this puzzle. At first we thought of using names like (Lucille) BALL, (Bob) HOPE, and (Chris) ROCK that could be used in everyday phrases — and we batted around some possibilities. We also considered a few ideas that included revealers. But then, among ideas for those themes, Joy included PRYOR COMMITMENT … and I knew immediately that she’d come up with something different and perfect. She’d found our theme angle for sure, and her example was even 15 letters for a terrific central grid-spanner. After emailing back and forth, we decided on this set. Three of the five theme entries (PRINZE, PRYOR, and IDLE) were Joy’s ideas, and all but one of the theme clues were hers (all but BARR). Unfortunately, BARR HOPPING didn’t fit. A few names that didn’t work were Chaplin/chaplain, Marx/marks, and Bee/be. I did the grid, which Joy approved. And I wrote clues that she then went through and edited, preferring to make them more challenging. Will changed very few of them. If you guessed that Joy wrote the great clue for GO APE, you’d be right. Also the ones for RESCUE DOG and HELIX, just to name two that I especially liked. Working on this with Joy was great fun. Her emails were guaranteed to include some funny choices I never would have thought of. I loved the way the puzzle turned out. I hope all of you solvers do, too.

Thank you, Ms. Behar and Ms. Lempel, for such a lovely Tuesday puzzle. Truly hope to see more from you, whether it be on television or in print.

Ralphie May, a loud and large comedian known for his extensive touring and comedy specials on Netflix and other outlets, died on Friday in Las Vegas, where he had been in residence at Harrah’s casino. He was 45.

His publicist, Stacey Pokluda, said the cause was cardiac arrest. She said he had been treated for pneumonia and had canceled some shows over the past month.

Mr. May, born Ralph Duren May on Feb. 17, 1972, in Chattanooga, Tenn., was a 17-year-old student in Arkansas when he won a contest to open for Sam Kinison, who became a mentor of sorts. (Mr. Kinison also died young, at 38, in a car accident in 1992.) The experience led Mr. May to move to Houston to try comedy full time.

The answer is yes, at the level of ideological commitment — but not so much in practice. In the real life of liberalism, Hefnerism endures as the effective philosophy of many liberal men, for whom sexual individualism justifies using women because hey, we’re all cool consenting adults here, and caddishness blurs into predation when power differentials permit. Meanwhile, feminism struggles to find norms that check this kind of behavior, swinging between a facile sex-positivity and illiberal attempts to police the hookup scene.

Here it would be nice to say that cultural conservatism offers an alternative, one that welcomes female advancement while retaining useful ideas about sexual difference and restraint. I might have argued as much once. But in the age of Donald Trump and Bill O’Reilly, “pro-life” hypocrites in Congress and the alt-right online cesspool, the right is its own sort of cautionary tale.

So I’ll say something more modest: If liberals want to restrain the ogres in their midst, a few conservative ideas might be helpful.

First: Some modest limits on how men and women interact professionally are useful checks on predation. Many liberals were horrified by the revelation that for a time Mike Pence avoided one-on-one meetings with women not his wife. But one can find the Pence rules too sweeping and still recognize that life is easier for women if their male bosses don’t feel entitled to see them anywhere, anytime. It would not usher in the Republic of Gilead if it were understood that inviting your female subordinate to your hotel room, Weinstein-style, crosses a line in a way that a restaurant lunch does not.

Second: Consent alone is not a sufficient guide to ethics. Caddishness and predation can be a continuum. If you cheat on your wife you may be more likely to harass subordinates. Promiscuity can encourage predatory entitlement. Older rules of moral restraint were broader for a reason. If your culture’s code is libertine, don’t be surprised that worse things than libertinism flourish.

Third: You can’t ignore moral character when you make decisions about whom to vote for or work with or support. This was something conservatives used to argue in the Clinton years; under Trump, many have conveniently forgotten it. But it remains true. Yes, sometimes you have to work with a bad person or vote for a bad person or hold a fund-raiser with a bad person for the greater good. But not nearly as often as you think.

The truth is that while not everyone knew exactly how Harvey Weinstein treated women, everyone knew what kind of man he was. The women he harassed didn’t have the power to restrain him, but plenty of powerful people did.

The D.S.H. payments were subject to a federal cut after Congress failed to forestall reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to taper federal contributions as the number of insured patients rose. The reduction took effect on Sunday, the beginning of the federal fiscal year.

Although Senator Chuck Schumer has expressed optimism that Congress will reverse the cuts before the end of the year, Mr. Cuomo has been adamant that the state needs to prepare for worst-case scenarios, saying that the state’s public hospitals will lose $1.1 billion if the status quo holds.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said.","Mr. James’s committee is among more than three dozen outfits that have started or reconfigured themselves since the election to try to harness the surge in anti-Trump activism. In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups — essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.

While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations — and with relatively meager overall budgets — they are beginning to attract attention from the left’s most generous benefactors.

“We’re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,” said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. “There may be groups that have been around that don’t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.”

The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.

But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall’s election.

The Democracy Alliance distributed a “resistance map” to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as Women’s March and Indivisible.

Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.

Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible. Mr. Soros has already donated to a host of nonprofit groups playing key roles in the anti-Trump movement, including the Center for Community Change, Color of Change and Local Progress.

Indivisible would “gladly” accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group’s revenue “because we want to maintain our impendence both from the funders and from the party.”

The group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.

“It’s not a secret that we would like to move the Democratic Party further left,” she said, adding that “the party will only get to where it needs to go if it has groups like ours pushing them to do the right thing.” She cited her group’s aggressive opposition to Republicans’ initial efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a time when she said Democratic congressional leaders “didn’t really have a strategy.”

Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven’t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank “has gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.”

The think tank, known as CAP, has engendered resentment from others on the left for casting itself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement and raising money off the resistance nomenclature. Within a few weeks of the election, CAP’s sister organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, was offering T-shirts emblazoned with the word “Resist” in exchange for donations of $40 or more. The campaign raised about $450,000 for ThinkProgress, the journalism arm of the action fund, which had its lawyers look into trademarking the iconography.

Daniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group’s legal team was merely exploring “a standard question” about whether to trademark the logo. “The immediate response was no — resistance belongs to everyone,” she said.

But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.

The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.

The leader of a group founded by Mr. Sanders called Our Revolution castigated the Democratic establishment as arrogant “dictators” who want to control the “terms of unity” after her group’s activists were met by barricades outside the Washington headquarters of the Democratic National Committee when they visited in July to deliver petitions supporting a liberal policy platform.

And Ms. Hunt-Hendrix has urged progressive donors to boycott Democratic establishment-aligned groups like the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who became a leading Clinton supporter and founded Media Matters and the opposition research outfit American Bridge.

Those groups represent a “neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party” that embraces “broken tactics” and an “uninspiring” agenda “more focused on defeating the right than on creating an economy and society that lifts up all people,” Ms. Hunt-Hendrix wrote in an op-ed article this year for Politico.

Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. “The idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,” he said.

Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.

“The resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,” Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, “These grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn’t seen in decades.” And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to “bring about progressive change and elect Democrats.”

Yet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines “to wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.” And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.

That doesn’t bother Dmitri Mehlhorn, a political adviser to Mr. Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who has brought a venture capital approach to politics, seeding a wide array of new groups on the left.

“The Democratic Party has been fractured,” Mr. Mehlhorn said. “We believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.”

Among Mr. Hoffman’s donations are at least $1 million each to two of the groups suing Mr. Trump’s campaign, his administration, businesses and associates — United to Protect Democracy, started this year by a former Obama White House lawyer, and Integrity First for America, which will be unveiled later this year by the pioneering New York trial lawyer Roberta A. Kaplan.

A Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.

“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said. “But when you’ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.”

He warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could “make it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.”","The ‘Resistance,’ Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/democrats-resistance-fundraising.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there. What I really liked was the openness of the center, which gave Mr. Berry room to cross those center entries with ROBERT ALTMAN, METEOR SHOWERS and SENATOR ELECT.

“He took my head and put it on Joe’s neck,” said Mr. Rochford, who is 20 years Mr. Schmitt’s junior.","Joseph William Schmitt was born on Jan. 2, 1916, in O’Fallon, Ill. His father, Benjamin, was a city marshal who was killed in the line of duty only a few weeks after Joseph’s birth. His mother, the former Apollonia Berkel, raised him and his siblings with the help of extended family.

In the 1930s, his high school principal, knowing Joe was mechanically inclined, suggested he join the Army Air Corps. He first studied aircraft engines but, with World War II still in the future, found himself looking for more to do.

“It was kind of a slow period,” Mr. Schmitt said in an oral history. “I asked if I could go back to take a parachute riggers course and also an aircraft clothing repair course.”

That proved pivotal when, after leaving the service in 1939, he found his way into the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a forerunner of NASA. He started as an airplane mechanic, working on the 1947 flight in which Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, but was later put into its Space Task Group as the agency began thinking about manned spaceflights and what astronauts would need to wear.

As an equipment specialist, or a suit tech, Mr. Schmitt would accompany astronauts to the spacecraft and hook up the various connections that would keep them alive, monitor their health and enable them to communicate during flight. It was a job that above all required a high level of attentiveness.

“Joe was a perfectionist in many respects,” James W. McBarron II, his supervisor, recalled in a telephone interview.

Mr. Schmitt suited up John Glenn for the 1962 flight in which he became the first American to orbit the earth. The many missions he worked also included Apollo 11, the first lunar landing, and other Apollo missions, where a less-heralded part of the job — care of the suit after a flight — took on new significance.

“We vacuumed out all the moon dust,” Mr. Schmitt said in the oral history. “A lot of people at that time, contractors mostly, they would take some of that dust and try and give it to their friends.” Officials eventually clamped down on that practice, he said.

Mr. Schmitt married Elizabeth Ann Rayfield in 1939; she died in 2008. He is survived by a son, Joseph Michael; a daughter, Norma Jean Spencer; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

Mr. Schmitt accumulated an enviable collection of mementos, including a medal with Mr. Schmitt’s initials on it that Glenn gave him after taking it with him into space.

He also made a game-show appearance: He was a mystery challenger on “What’s My Line?” in May 1963, just days after he had suited up Gordon Cooper for the final Mercury mission. (The celebrity panel surmised that he was part of the space program but failed to guess his role.)

He also became an artistic footnote during his NASA career: That’s him kneeling on the left in “Grissom and Young,” a 1965 painting Norman Rockwell made of the Gemini astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young as they’re being suited up. But Mr. Rochford said Mr. Schmitt is actually in the painting one and a half times.

Rockwell took photographs of the astronauts to work from, pictures that Mr. Schmitt posed for in his role as suit tech. Later, Rockwell asked NASA to send him a spacesuit so he could get the details just right. Mr. Schmitt brought a suit to Rockwell’s studio in Massachusetts and, Mr. Rochford said, told the artist that there were actually two suit techs for the Gemini 3 flight: He had dressed Mr. Young, while Mr. Rochford had dressed Mr. Grissom. So Rockwell obtained a photo of Mr. Rochford’s face and put a second suit tech into the painting, on the right.

“He took my head and put it on Joe’s neck,” said Mr. Rochford, who is 20 years Mr. Schmitt’s junior. “He put a young head on an old body.”","Joseph Schmitt, 101, Spacesuit Technician for Early Astronauts, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/obituaries/joseph-schmitt-spacesuit-technician-for-early-astronauts-dies-at-101.html

Americans are deeply split along demographic lines, but there aren’t many demographic characteristics that embody America’s cultural divide better than gun ownership.

In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, the polling firm SurveyMonkey published a pair of maps from its 2016 presidential election exit polls. It showed the electoral maps for voters who said they had a gun in their home, and for those who said they did not.

In every state but Vermont – perhaps the most liberal state in the country, but one where many, including Bernie Sanders, support gun rights – voters who reported living in a gun-owning household overwhelmingly backed Donald J. Trump.

The opposite is true for voters who said they did not live in a home with a gun. In all but one state that could be measured, voters overwhelmingly preferred Hillary Clinton. (The exception was West Virginia; not enough data existed for Wyoming.)

Over all, gun-owning households (roughly a third in America) backed Mr. Trump by 63 percent to 31 percent, while households without guns backed Mrs. Clinton, 65 percent to 30 percent, according to SurveyMonkey data.

No other demographic characteristic created such a consistent geographic split.

Comparable to the Racial Divide

American politics is deeply divided by race, and the gap between white and nonwhite voters is similar to the gap between households with guns and those without. But Mrs. Clinton won white voters, often by a wide margin, in 10 states and Washington, D.C., worth 139 electoral votes in all. And Mr. Trump may have been competitive among nonwhite voters in a few conservative states, like Oklahoma. (The poll data among nonwhite voters is sparse in several small states and subject to a considerable margin of sampling error.)

Nonwhite voters White voters

The split among white voters without a college degree and the rest of the country is also distinct. But Mr. Trump would have probably won without white working-class voters in several states, particularly in the Great Plains, according to the SurveyMonkey data.

Everyone but working-class whites Working-class whites

This is not to say that gun ownership is a bigger divide in American politics than race or the combination of race and education, or a bigger driver of America’s political divide. After all, part of the reason gun ownership splits voters so starkly is because gun owners are more likely than Americans generally to be white, less educated and living in a rural area. Over all, 83 percent of gun household voters were white in 2016, according to the SurveyMonkey data.

But it might not be merely demographics. Mr. Trump appeared to fare better in the SurveyMonkey data among gun-owning households than non-gun-owning households even after considering the voters’ race and education. He won white voters without a degree who lived in gun-owning households by 74 percent to 21 percent. He even won college-educated white voters in gun-owning households, 60-34, and fared better among nonwhite voters in gun households, losing, 61-34. Mrs. Clinton won nonwhite voters over all, 75-21.

Even so, education, race and religion tend to do a better job of predicting an individual’s presidential vote choice. It is probably fair to say that gun ownership embodies America’s partisan divide more than it drives it.

The Urban-Rural Divide

Urban voters Rural voters

For that same reason, density also comes close to approximating the divide between households with guns and those without. Not only does it correlate with gun ownership, but it also correlates with race and education.

Marriage

Unmarried voters Married voters

Marriage rates are also correlated to today’s political divide. Unmarried adults are likelier to be young and nonwhite, and concentrated in urban areas. But it’s not as strongly tied to a political issue. In this respect, gun ownership is unique among the demographic or household characteristics considered so far.

Other categories that blur the line between demographics and issue politics – like religion, union membership and military service – don’t yield such a pronounced split.

Religious divisions

Non-evangelical voters Evangelical voters

Atheist or nothing in particular Protestant or Catholic voters

Seldom or never attend church Attend church at least once a week

Religiosity – how often someone goes to church – has been a strong predictor of party affiliation, with frequent churchgoers much more likely to be be Republicans. The political preferences of more religious Americans yield a deeply red map, with religious voters from just three (relatively large) states – California, New York and Maryland – preferring Mrs. Clinton. Nonwhite voters most likely represent a disproportionate share of Democratic-leaning religious voters in many of these states.

On the flip side of this relationship are the religious “nones,” a large and growing group of voters who are atheist or do not identify with a religion. These voters tend to be younger than the overall electorate, one reason they strongly preferred Mrs. Clinton in 2016.

By Marlon James

When I was 14, in 1984, I played Prince’s “Purple Rain” album so much that both parents would sing along, turning the whole house into a lyric-misreading protokaraoke. Their never getting the words was why I could play it in front of them, but I would never play the fifth song on the album, “Darling Nikki,” and it wasn’t because of the lyrics. This was perhaps Prince’s only song about sex that gave neither redemption nor relief, but I skipped to Side 2 because of the scream. The scream was mine, and I wasn’t about to share it.

There’s a story I can’t confirm that whenever Coltrane became overwhelmed by what he had to say, and frustrated that his sax could not say it, he would put it down and scream. The “Darling Nikki” scream was actually the third time Prince screamed on the record. But this time, the music dropped out, leaving nothing but this loud, unhinged, panicked, hopeless screech. It was the most electrifying seven seconds of my entire year.

In 1984, there was an awful lot for me to scream about, even if until “Darling Nikki,” I never knew screaming was an option. I knew I liked boys, and I knew I was going to hell for it, which was enough, but Earth wasn’t so hot either, trapped as I was in the endlessly repeatable boredom of suburbia, prefab houses, two cars, all the way down the street. Teenage boys think in teenage ways, and one of the few options for what I could do with my life was end it.

Or scream about it. The “Darling Nikki” scream defies paraphrasal. It was not cool; I was discovering an abyss in myself that somehow made me feel better for connecting with it. This was not easy in a house of six, but because I had few friends I was at home alone more than anybody else. And paradoxically, I discovered that screaming and volume did not have to be related. A lip-synced scream was loud enough. A whispered scream was better; a pillow-dampened scream was even better than that. It was strange how it made me feel afterward, not bolder or more at peace so much as more indifferent to taking a verbal punch, like the cool kids’ calling me homo.

Punks recognized this several years before: A scream was an invitation. We couldn’t all sing, but we could all scream, and in punk it wasn’t worthy if we couldn’t all do it. And because at 14, half of what you are experiencing you can’t even name, so what better way to respond than getting yourself alone and doing something equally nameless? But that was 1984. Why is a 46-year-old man still putting on “Darling Nikki” to karaoke a seven-second scream?

Because nowadays I find myself needing catharsis even more than antacid. On TV there’s much to scream about, but as with road rage, there’s no release. I play “Darling Nikki” loud enough to drown out my own voice. I ignore the song’s context, though its descent into psychosexual hell can apply to any personal or political torment. And when the music drops out and it’s just me and Prince, I let my voice rip so hard, even my eyes scream. This is 2017. There is more than enough to scream about.","Letters of Recommendation: ‘Twin Peaks,’ Screaming Karaoke and More",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/magazine/culture-issue-letters-of-recommendation-twin-peaks-get-out-screaming-karaoke.html

The biggest takeaway is counterintuitive: At all costs, resist. Many women are taught from an early age that the best chance of survival in an attack is to obey. Not true, says Kardian (who co-wrote the book with A. Clara Pistek). Get in the car, follow him to the deserted apartment, do what he wants — and you’re toast. Kardian is also a big believer in people not minding their own business. A third person barging into a situation that looks dicey is extremely likely to help avert a crime. So if you see someone who’s listening a little too closely to a woman’s room number at a hotel, tell her; if you think you saw someone slip something into her drink when she goes to the restroom, speak up. He cites a YouTube video called “Snack Man,” in which two people on a New York City subway are having a brawl because the woman thinks the man is following her. There are punches and kicks. And then some big dude eating chips just kind of sidles between them, continuing to eat, saying nothing … and the fight is over. Snack Man is my hero.

Laura Bates has written the book that you should give your teenage daughter this Christmas — or your teenage son, for that matter. GIRL UP: Kick Ass, Claim Your Woman Card, and Crush Everyday Sexism (Touchstone, paper, $16) is a manifesto for maintaining your sanity and dignity in today’s social media quagmire, where “suddenly our lives, our looks, our relationships, our meals and our cats are open to scrutiny.” (Bonus points: Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, is as funny and sex-positive as early Cynthia Heimel.) A bracing antidote to self-consciousness — Bates reminds us constantly that no one is scrutinizing us a tenth as much as we scrutinize ourselves — “Girl Up” offers practical steps to overcoming stereotypes and not letting the world define you. The chapter titles say it all: among them, “You Aren’t Your Body,” “Sluts, Unicorns, and Other Mythical Creatures,” “Porn ≠ Sex” and “The F-Word” — that word being “feminist.” The book is filled with tap-dancing vaginas, clever comebacks to ridiculous pickup lines and all sorts of handy translation guides, notably of tabloid-magazine language pertaining to women. For instance: “flaunts” means “has body part”; “shows off” means “has body part”; “goes makeup-free” means “is human.”

In a chart with two columns — “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do According to Magazines” vs. “Ten Things Every Girl Should Know How to Do in Real Life” — she compares the magazine imperative (“How to kiss in a way that communicates perfectly what you would and wouldn’t like to happen next”) with what would actually be useful: “How to use your words and have an actual conversation, in the event that your partner doesn’t, in fact, turn out to be a lip psychic.” All of us, and young women especially, need to maintain our humanity and kindness while not giving a hoot what other people think, as long as we’re not hurting anyone. And that’s what makes this book special. Well, that and the tap-dancing vaginas.

While Bates is empowering a young girl’s psyche, Tasneem Bhatia is here to give our health a boost. SUPER WOMAN RX: Discover the Secrets to Lasting Health, Your Perfect Weight, Energy, and Passion With Dr. Taz’s Power Type Plans (Rodale, $26.99) is a perfectly traditional self-help guide, which works on the premise that while everyone is a lovely individual snowflake, we all fall into certain emotional and physical categories, and if we figure out our category we can determine the best diet and fitness and psychic-energy plan to empower ourselves. In other words: Quizzes! I had to find out if I was a Gypsy Girl, a Boss Lady, a Savvy Chick, an Earth Mama or a Nightingale. Turns out I was a Savvy Chick, like the author, and I have to say that the ills Savvy Chicks are prone to (anxiety, migraines, infertility, eczema) are pretty much precisely the ones I’ve had. The solutions are quite involved but perfectly sensible. I also happen to be incapable of sticking to any regimen. But that doesn’t mean I won’t spend money on vitamins, probiotics and various warm broths while I try.

Speaking of quizzes, I took the pop quiz about car care at the beginning of Patrice Banks’s GIRLS AUTO CLINIC GLOVE BOX GUIDE (Touchstone, paper, $25) and scored my personal best: zero. I did not get a single answer right. I can’t be excused for being a car-less New Yorker, because I have actually owned a car. In most areas of life I am keen on understanding what I’m doing. But when it came to the car I somehow felt a penis was necessary to deal with it. And I am not alone, despite the fact that women are more frequently the purchasers of cars in a family. Explaining that a woman’s relationship to her car should be like a relationship to her partner — heavy on the communication and the commitment — Banks gives us the basics here: the parts, how they operate, what you can fix yourself, and perhaps most important, how not to be cheated (by knowing how much various repair jobs should cost). It’s simply written, it’s not condescending or cutesy, and it removes the mystery from something that many of us find a little scary. “Girls Auto Clinic” is not about how we feel about our cars; it’s about what we can learn to do. And that’s some pretty excellent roaring right there.",How to Fight and Fix Your Car Like a Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/review/claudia-chan-this-is-how-we-rise-self-help-women.html

Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.

Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.

Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime. Mr. Mueller is building cases against two of Mr. Trump’s former advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Michael T. Flynn. Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller’s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.

Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.

“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.

“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.

Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.

“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.

Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.

But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.

One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.

Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.

Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.

But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.

The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.

That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.

“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”","Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

In rock ’n’ roll’s energy and excitement, he recognized music’s future, especially as a fuel for adolescent rebellion.

“It’s easy to call rock ’n’ roll vulgar, but to adolescents it is a release,” he told The New York Times in 1965. “Rock ’n’ roll, if it is anything, is pure joy in sound.

“I willingly embrace vulgarity,” he continued. “I prefer vulgarity, that is, to the excessive refinement that has long stifled British society. Like St. Paul, I’m a convert, but my conversion was to rock ’n’ roll.”

A job as a trainee producer at the BBC led to his first experiment in transforming what he had seen onscreen into a live show. On “Six-Five Special,” which had its premiere in 1957 (it was named for its 6:05 p.m. start-time), he filled the studio floor with young fans bopping to the music. The formula worked: Millions watched. But he chafed at the BBC’s demands that he add sports and comedy segments.

Forced out by the network, Mr. Good resurfaced at its commercial rival, ITV, where he produced “Oh Boy!” with much greater freedom. Performers followed one another quickly, giving the show a breakneck pace. British rock stars like Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde and Billy Fury were said to have received their first national exposure there.

“The aim was hypnosis and excitement — blitzkrieg time!” Mr. Good said in “A Good Man … Is Hard to Find,” a 2005 documentary about his life made by Greg Wise. “Jumping up and down, the adrenaline, the wildness. Yes, the danger of it all!”

Nik Cohn, the British rock journalist, wrote that Mr. Good had an understanding of rock music’s importance that was rare at the time.

“Everyone else saw pop as a one-shot craze and rushed to cash in on it fast before sanity returned and everything returned to normal,” Mr. Cohn wrote in “Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom: The Golden Age of Rock” (1969). “By contrast, Good realized it clearly as a major phenomenon. I suppose he was the first pop intellectual.”

Mr. Good was born in West London on Aug. 7, 1931. His father, Bob, sold pianos at Harrods, where his mother, Amy, was a secretary. After serving in the Royal Air Force, Mr. Good graduated from Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied philology and was president of the drama society.

“Six-Five Special,” “Oh Boy!” and two other music shows in Britain did not end Mr. Good’s dreams of acting. He left for the United States, hoping to succeed in Hollywood. But he landed only a few parts, including one in “Father Goose” (1964), with Cary Grant, and another in “Clambake” (1967), with Elvis Presley.

One day in 1962, soon after moving to the United States, while lazing around in his pajamas, he had an epiphany.

“I saw this so-called special done by a bloke, Dick Clark, and I’d already come to the conclusion that Dick Clark’s shows were hopeless and I could do better,” he said in the documentary. Mr. Clark was, at the time, the host of the long-running “American Bandstand.”

“I said to myself, like the prodigal son in the pigpen, that I’d go back to my father’s house” — referring to Mr. Haley, whom he saw as his muse — “and I devised a show, filmed it, taped it and sent it around to the networks,” he said.

That was the pilot for “Shindig,” which was picked up by ABC, but not until 1964.

“Shindig” was unlike “Bandstand” or “The Ed Sullivan Show.” It had a fast rhythm, like “Oh Boy!,” with rapid cutting and extreme close-ups. The dancers frugged, swam and twisted furiously. The house band featured Glen Campbell, Billy Preston and Leon Russell. And the guests — among them Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, the Righteous Brothers, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Bobby Sherman, the Isley Brothers, Sam Cooke and the Everly Brothers — covered a broad musical range.

The Beatles, taped in Britain, were guests on the show several months after Mr. Good produced a special with them there. The Stones appeared several times, once with the bluesman Howlin’ Wolf, one of their idols.

NBC countered with its own pop music show, “Hullabaloo,” which made its debut a few months after “Shindig.”

Donna Loren, a featured singer on “Shindig,” described Mr. Good as “the Norman Lear of rock ’n’ roll” for his insistence on booking African-American artists, against the objections of at least one executive at ABC. She said Mr. Good had resisted efforts by the network to limit the number of black performers on the pilot.

Mr. Mallet, his former assistant producer, agreed. “He was insulted by it,” he said in a telephone interview, “because at least 50 percent of his favorite people were people like Little Richard.”

Mr. Good said in the documentary that he told ABC that he would limit the number of black artists on the show if the network sent him a memo outlining its rules. (He also threatened to send it if he got it to Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general.) He never got the memo.

He left “Shindig” after a year, exhausted by the demands of producing it but with something else in mind: a rock musical based on “Othello.” It became “Catch My Soul,” with William Marshall in the title role and Jerry Lee Lewis playing an unlikely Iago. When it played at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, Martin Bernheimer of The Los Angeles Times wrote that it was “an utterly brilliant and utterly maddening experience.”

Mr. Good also wrote the screenplay for the 1974 movie version.

In the early 1970s, Mr. Good moved to New Mexico with his family and continued to produce television programming for a few more years. But he had already begun to alter his life dramatically — mostly in service to his Roman Catholic faith.

Inspired by Rubens’s “The Descent From the Cross,” he learned to paint. And, after his divorce from the former Margit Tischer, he built a chapel beside his home in Cordova, N.M., where he lived alone and painted religious murals and icons.

One mural shows a wild-eyed, fanged devil — his head in the shape of a television set — playing an electric guitar.

In addition to his daughter, Mr. Good, who lived in Oxfordshire, is survived by another daughter, Andrea; a son, Alexander; 10 grandchildren; and a brother, Robert.

Mr. Good expressed regrets about the direction rock took in the post-“Shindig” years. He wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 1967 that the music had been “ironed into one vast, hairy, paisley-patterned uniformity.”

But Mr. Mallet said that his cheeky former boss remained dedicated to the era he helped to influence.

“His idea of heaven,” he said, “was Jerry Lee or Cliff Richard or Elvis giving it 100 percent.”","Jack Good, Who Put Rock ’n’ Roll on TV With ‘Shindig,’ Dies at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/obituaries/jack-good-who-put-rock-n-roll-on-tv-in-the-60s-dies-at-86.html

On June 3, three men carrying knives and wearing fake suicide bomb vests rammed their van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed several people in the nearby Borough Market, killing eight.

Two weeks later, a van driver plowed into a crowd of Muslims as they finished prayers at the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, leaving one dead.

In addition, a suicide bomber killed 22 people and wounded 59 others when he blew himself up near one of the exits of the Manchester Arena at the end of a concert in May by the American pop singer Ariana Grande.

Photo“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said.
But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia.
While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.
“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said.","More than 20 years after Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a bloody, year-long proxy war decried by Georgian authorities as illegal and a step towards “de facto annexation,” only four United Nations member states — Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru and Russia— recognize Abkhazia, a small territory on the eastern coast of the Black Sea bordering the Caucasus Mountains.

Abkhazia is a time capsule. Many buildings, constructed during its days as a Soviet republic, are pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1992 conflict. The economy is weak and dependent on tourism from Russian visitors. Young people with means attend college outside the territory — and stay there after graduation.

But Abkhazia — which, in the local language, means “land of the soul”— is more than its decay and its disputed political status, said the Russian photographer Ksenia Kuleshova. She began photographing there in 2015 as an undergraduate at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hanover, Germany, and has returned three times since to work on an ongoing project.

Photo

“My aim was not to concentrate on the war or the ruined buildings,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “I didn’t want to concentrate on the negative side. I wanted to find the soul.”

Ms. Kuleshova grew up hearing about Abkhazia from her parents, who vacationed there before the war and remembered it as “a beautiful country with mountains and tasty vegetables and fruits.” When she arrived in Sukhumi, the territory’s capital, for the first time three years ago, she found its appearance unsettling.

“You come there and you feel it’s another world, that this country slept for a while because they didn’t restore buildings after the war,” she said.

Photo

She overcame her shock and got to work, connecting with locals through a friend of her parents. She was looking, she said, for signs of joy, and she found them in abundance. She attended soccer games and horse races and parades, met folk dancers and socialites and zookeepers, and watched people play in the first big snowfall in Sukhumi in nearly eight years. Once, she went to three weddings in a day.

“I wanted to show something beautiful and I wanted to show that there’s happiness,” she said.

But there was no escaping history. While bullet holes are not the focus of her photos, they sometimes appear in the background. And in her conversations with Abkhazians, talk often turned to the war.

“It was a very cruel war and almost every family lost someone,” she said. “They can’t forget it.”

Photo

There has been some change in Abkhazia’s prospects recently. After years of stagnation, business along the Black Sea coast has picked up. Avtandil Gartskiya, Sukhumi’s tourism minister, told The New York Times in 2016 that 1.5 million foreign visitors were expected that year—up from 92,000 a decade earlier. But the vast majority of visitors are Russians, and they come to Abkhazia for cheap prices and Soviet nostalgia. While Abkhazians are happy for the economic boost, Ms. Kuleshova said, they are still waiting for the kind of development that could lead to a sustainable future.

“They want more tourists and they want more opportunities,” Ms. Kuleshova said. “But the main point is they want to be recognized by the world.”

I don’t cover live events much these days, because I mostly write longer, broader pieces. I work out of my house and from the road.

The game changer was the smartphone. It's not only my office phone. I can also use it to record interviews (its microphone is better than the one in my old Olympus, which is important in crowded, noisy places), take pictures and videos to help me remember the details of what I see, and even type or speak notes and interview answers into emails that I send myself.

I use it the way other people use their phones. I email, text, tweet, post to Instagram, get directions, set timers and alarms, change flights, check weather, update my calendar, map my jogs, and listen to podcasts and Spotify during long drives or plane rides. On assignment, I’ve had entire conversations with Google Translate, two of us passing my phone back and forth.

Besides being an all-in-one communication tool, the iPhone helps my writing. I take photographs of places I know I’ll want to describe in detail later — the inside of someone’s home, a rocky mountain summit, a piece of jewelry that a subject is wearing, the shape of the clouds and the color of the sky. I take videos of places, too, and narrate them as I shoot so that I can watch and listen later.

I get a lot of strange looks from people when I do these things.

What tech product are you currently obsessed with?

I often do stories overseas, and for the last couple of years, I have constantly connected with sources, interview subjects and my own family on my phone through WhatsApp, a brilliant messaging service that seems to be well known everywhere except the United States.

You’ve covered a lot of extreme sports. How has tech changed those sports and the way you report them?

There’s a truism in extreme sports that something didn’t happen unless it was caught on camera. People can climb the most remote mountains in the world, or surf the biggest wave or ski the steepest line, and someone else will be there to record it. And once it’s on camera, it usually hits Instagram and goes viral.

So many times, I’ve seen something amazing online, maybe something worth a story, only to realize that it has been “liked” 100,000 times already. So we tend to write about trends, not single events, and people, not just their accomplishments. We focus on the context, not the clip. That’s tough in a never-ending stream of clips.

How has tech been good or bad for sports in general?

You could write books on the topic, from athletes’ use of social media (increasingly skipping the filter of the traditional news media) to the in-game experience of fans (threatening to make the living room a more enjoyable place to watch a game than the arena).

More than anything, technology has brought the sports world into the “now.” I’m old enough to remember a world before ESPN, when the N.B.A. Finals were tape-delayed to late night and baseball had a “game of the week,” and that was the only game you could see. There were no sports highlights beyond your local news, and you hoped the late scores made the morning paper.

Now we can see almost any game on television, in a dozen sports from anywhere in the world, with a computer on our laps and a phone in our hands. We receive and give instant analysis through the world of social media. We can track statistics for our fantasy teams. We can tweet nasty messages to famous athletes and coaches who disappoint us. Like so many other parts of society, we’re probably watching sports more physically alone than ever, but more connected in other ways.

Is that good or bad? Just different. Part of me wishes I could recreate the simple times of attending a game the way I did with my parents. It was an era of hard bleachers and no video scoreboards, of tracking players through nothing but printed box scores, of using your imagination to fill in all the details of the sports world that were left mostly blank.

It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units.
ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months.
According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.
“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint.","Two levels of charging are typically available in residential settings. Level 1 is a standard AC outlet that provides between 1 and 1.5 kilowatts of electricity. It takes a Level 1 charger about 30 hours to fully charge the electric version of the Ford Focus, which has a range of 115 miles. Level 2 uses a professionally installed charger connected to a 240-volt AC outlet — the kind used by some large appliances — and delivers between 7 and 9 kilowatts, lowering the charge time to about 5.5 hours.

Some commercial charging locations offer more advanced technology, employing so-called fast chargers. These offer about 50 kilowatts of DC power, enabling the same Ford Focus to reach 90 miles of range in 30 minutes (battery chemistry causes charging to go more slowly after a battery is 80 percent full). The electric carmaker Tesla has a proprietary “supercharger” for its vehicles that provides 120 kilowatts of power, adding 300 miles of range in 75 minutes.

A new generation of charging points, the first of which are being installed in Europe this year, offer 350 kilowatts of power. Such a jump would slash charging times to 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the vehicle’s range, according to Charlie Yankitis, director of business development for the German manufacturer Bosch’s electric vehicle unit. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has hinted that charging at even faster rates was being studied.

Several companies are making big bets on the technology.

Electrify America, the Volkswagen subsidiary, is planning on installing such high-capacity chargers along highway corridors throughout the United States. It is investing $2 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and education nationwide, $800 million of which is earmarked for California alone.

By the end of 2020, Electrify America plans to have built 350 Level 2 charging sites in urban areas in California, like workplaces and apartment buildings. It will also build an unspecified number of fast chargers along roadways, each of which will have several charge units. A further 540 are to be built elsewhere in the country in that time.

ChargePoint, the largest installer of vehicle charging stations in the United States, plans to install 400-kilowatt sites in the coming months. But its chief executive, Pasquale Romano, did not specify how many.

Similar pushes are being made elsewhere. In Europe, the German automotive giants BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen have joined with Ford in a joint venture to install 350-kilowatt chargers across the Continent. They will start installing them this year, initially planning to get 400 fast-charging sites up and running, with “thousands” in place by 2020.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“We’re looking for similar solutions across the globe,” said Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of electrification and infrastructure.

There are, however, hurdles that need to be overcome.

For one, standards differ across manufacturers and regions. Today’s commercial chargers use three different kinds of plugs that are not entirely compatible. In practice, a Chevrolet, Nissan or Volkswagen cannot be charged at a Tesla charger. A Tesla, however, can use an adapter plug to charge at standard commercial stations, and Electrify America says its charging stations will be compatible with a variety of plugs.

Another issue: No vehicle on the road today is able to use the 350-kilowatt fast-charging stations. It is not a simple upgrade: High-speed charging requires thicker cables that won’t get too hot.

No automakers have indicated when they will sell cars equipped to accept such fast charges. Porsche’s Mission E electric vehicle is expected to be available by 2020, and will be able to charge to a 250-mile range in 15 minutes, according to the carmaker. Electrify America and ChargePoint say they expect vehicles capable of accepting 350-killowatt chargers to be available by 2019.

Utilities will also have to upgrade their infrastructure, a change for which California is already preparing.

Under the state’s zero emission regulations, every manufacturer must sell a certain number of emission-free vehicles, calculated as a proportion of overall sales. Consequently, California has become the hub for the mass installation of fast charging points. One of the state’s utility companies, Southern California Edison, estimates that 25 percent of its network must be upgraded to support new chargers.

“We hope we’ll be ready for fast charging when Electrify America is ready to install it,” said Caroline Choi, the utility’s senior vice president of regulatory affairs.

For now, the number of charging stations remains relatively low. According to the Department of Energy, there are just over 16,000 public electric vehicle charging points in the United States, offering about 44,000 individual outlets of varying charging speeds. By comparison, there are 120,000 gas stations nationwide, many of which have 10 or more pumps.

So customers will have to stick to charging an electric vehicle whenever it’s not being used, much as they already do with smartphones and tablets.

According to ChargePoint, 80 percent of vehicle charging is currently done at home, and industry executives argue that it’s wrong to think about charging electric cars in the way they envision filling up a gasoline or diesel vehicle.

“Electric vehicles are more like horses than gasoline cars,” said Mr. Romano of ChargePoint. They are like a horse that eats whenever you’re not riding it: “you refuel them when you’re doing something else.”","For Electric Car Owners, ‘Range Anxiety’ Gives Way to ‘Charging Time Trauma’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/automobiles/wheels/electric-cars-charging.html

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote.","To those among us fortunate enough to have known old-timers who regaled us with tales of tabloid derring-do, New York was once a place of outrageous characters both in front of and behind the camera. Like players in “The Front Page,” hordes of cigar-chomping, fedora-wearing men plied their trade as a contact sport that was not above recreating scenes or putting a prop or two — like a lonesome looking doll — into everyday moments of tragedy.

In this cast of characters, Weegee was the Dante of New York’s nighttime demimonde. His photos, of swells and speakeasies, crime and crowds, or perps and play, are a singular record of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s. And just when you thought you had seen all of his work, a new book, “Extra! Weegee,” features vintage prints — many previously unseen — that captures Weegee’s singular point of view.

Daniel Blau, the book’s editor, admitted that he had “never really liked Weegee.” Obviously, he has since come to his senses, putting together an impressive volume that captures the many sides of New York as it approached World War II. The images were found in the archives of the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a syndicate founded at the turn of the last century by Edward Willis Scripps. The photos — which had been taken for the association’s Acme Newspictures service — passed through the hands of several owners, and were discovered in storage in 2012 by Ryan Adams.

These prints, Mr. Blau wrote in the book, changed his mind, as he saw pictures vastly different from those he had encountered 30 years earlier in some badly reproduced volume. And in a nod to the current daily torrent of images, these photos had an air of mystery, he said, and the mark of a master.

Weegee, born Ascher Fellig in 1899 in what is now Ukraine, lived a spartan existence down by the old New York Police headquarters in Lower Manhattan. That’s not surprising, since his realm was the streets. And the images he shot revealed not just a knowledge of people and places, but an appreciation for the ironic, odd or absurd.

A car dangles off the roadway that encircles Grand Central Terminal, with a “ONE WAY” arrow pointing at it, while two men stand under an awning, not oblivious, but not impressed, either. In another, an overturned vehicle rests on its side, with a sign reading “SLOW DOWN” hovering behind it like an unheeded warning.

Working crowds, you have images of a sweaty, packed throng in Coney Island and people celebrating the end of World War II. A jubilant sailor is surrounded by four women, flanking a sign he held declaring: “$2,000 In Bank Now I’m Looking for a Wife,” with “18-40” added at the bottom. An image of gawkers at a murder scene is a collage of mostly children’s faces, some goofy, arrayed around one woman whose grief is etched on her face.

He also found the lighter side, showing teenaged bobbysoxers jitterbugging in the aisles of a theater, dogs and cats, and even a gorilla. The book is divided into chapters that all start with “EXTRA!” and are devoted to topics like Crime, Cool, Friends, Characters and more.

Of course, the main character on this sidewalk stage is Weegee himself. Mr. Blau deftly connects the man and his era to how we and Hollywood — to which Weegee decamped in 1947 to try his hand at acting — now perceive it.

“Our reference points to these mysterious words can be found in Hollywood entertainment such as ‘The Sopranos’ or ‘Boardwalk Empire,’” Mr. Blau wrote. “Weegee made these possible. He was a game changer — breaking new ground in both photography and photojournalism. Using a camera to tell a story as others used their pen or speech.”

Mr. Blau concludes that while Weegee may have left to be a movie actor, he had long been on that path.

“By then he had already made all the films he wanted,” he wrote. “All films made of a single frame. All telling a story in one take. Today I love these short films.”

The speed limit, just 25 miles an hour, helps reduce the risk if something goes wrong. And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.

Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.

Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage’s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver’s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage’s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.

Voyage’s introduction to the Villages comes as self-driving vehicles interact more and more with regular cars. Waymo, the driverless car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started a trial ride-hailing program in Phoenix this year with several hundred cars. The ride-hailing service Uber is also testing the technology in more than 200 cars with real passengers in Arizona and Pittsburgh.

Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an “only in Silicon Valley” story.

It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.

After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.

The company had a major selling point: Udacity’s chairman, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google’s driverless car project and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle research, was joining Voyage as chairman. He pushed the idea of starting in a retirement community.

It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.

Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor’s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn’t.

Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.

“The driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,” said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.

Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages’ residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.

For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots. If none are available, she turns around and goes home. She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were “slim and none.”

“From that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,” she said.

But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.

“We’d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, ‘Do you do self-driving car insurance?’” said Oliver Cameron, Voyage’s 29-year-old chief executive. “The answer was no.”

Working with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into “exotic insurance” policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.

The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data — any data — produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.

Another issue arose when Mr. Thrun had to leave the company because of a conflict of interest. He was also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, a flying car start-up backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo.

Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.

To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake — the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.

For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages. The cars — nicknamed Homer and Marge after the characters on “The Simpsons” — have often prompted questions from curious onlookers in the Villages.

Are you from Google? (No.)

How do I invest? (Flattering, but we’re not taking new investors now.)

Then, there were the skeptics who questioned whether driverless cars were safer. Mr. Cameron said the residents’ concerns were a welcome reality check from the hype of Silicon Valley. “It’s preparing us for the sorts of questions many millions have on their mind when it comes to the technology,” he said.

Ms. Jackson, who still drives regularly and shuttles friends to church, activities and other community events, said she could not distinguish between human driver and machine during her ride.

On the whiteboard, under the names of the injured, he wrote his brother’s name.

How a pair of 33-year-old twins wound up in the midst of one of the worst mass shootings in American history is a reflection of the incomprehensible scale of the tragedy. All hands were on deck, and since policing is a family business, it was not surprising that both brothers would be called into action.

But the brothers’ roles could hardly have been more different. One brother carried out careful plans he helped devise. The other had little to guide him but instinct, duty and fear.

“I think about it now and it sounds stupid, but I’m just like, you know what, if I am going to die I want to be helping people,” Casey Clarkson said in an interview Thursday, the day after he met President Trump during his visit to Las Vegas. “You just want to do something. You feel helpless.”

On Friday, police officials said they were still at a loss to explain why the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, had brought an arsenal of rifles up to his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, smashed out two windows and opened fire on the concert crowd, killing 58 and wounding nearly 500 before killing himself.

Local and federal officials sounded increasingly desperate for leads on Friday, announcing plans to erect billboards with the message, “If you know something, say something.”

The Clarkson brothers said they knew such an event could eventually happen. Every officer on the force has completed drills on worst-case scenarios, including gunfire coming from the towering casino resorts.

“The inevitable,” Casey Clarkson called it, but it was still surreal.

The twins’ mother, Brandi Lewis, was the first in the family to join the police department as an administrative manager, a civilian job she had for more than 20 years before recently retiring. As children, they loved hearing the stories their stepfather, Capt. Dave Lewis, brought home. Captain Lewis worked his way up the ranks and now runs the department’s crime lab.

As one of the top-ranked officers, Captain Lewis received a recorded call on Sunday night telling him of the active shooter. As he put on his uniform to head to the Mandalay Bay, he heard that two officers had been shot, and one in the neck, but not their names. (The other officer was shot in the arm and survived; additionally, an off-duty officer attending the concert was killed.)

The brothers are identical “mirror” twins — Casey, the older one by five minutes, is the more outgoing of the two, and left-handed; Branden, the more cerebral, is right-handed. As kids, their mother encouraged them to take up paintball, figuring it would offer them training they would need if they went into the military or law enforcement. They signed up for the police academy the moment they turned 21.

The brothers are often mistaken for one another, though because Casey spends much of his time lifting weights and Branden is recovering from back surgery, Casey is the beefier of the two now. He also is the only one with a bandage on his neck.

When he first heard the shots, he said, he asked his partner, Detective Tara Brosnahan: “What the hell was that?”

They walked down the street, and heard the shots again. “434,” Detective Brosnahan yelled into her police radio, using the official term for illegal gunfire. She was the first officer to alert the shooting.

Detective Clarkson started running along the perimeter of the concert area, larger than the size of two football fields. “It was all under attack,” he said.

He pushed fans down toward a waist-high brick wall. The bullets started falling toward his feet. He felt a couple whiz by.

With his pistol in his left hand — he does not recall unholstering it, saying it got there “like a magic trick” — he scurried behind a van, convinced a gunman could approach at any second. He did not know where the bullets were coming from, only that they kept coming.

As he stood over his partner, she told him: “Casey, you’re bleeding from the neck.”

Perhaps it was the adrenaline, but he felt nothing. “I kept thinking, how come I am not dead yet?” he said. There was work to do: “I figured I’d get light headed and would know I needed to stop then.”

The gunshots continued. Someone suggested escorting fans out two at a time. “No way,” Detective Clarkson said he replied. There were too many. People had to be ushered through fences five at a time.

There were bodies everywhere, and now people were looking at him, wondering if he was going to become one, too. His partner used her fingers to put pressure on the wound. They made their way to the concert’s medical tent, where a nurse told him the blood was not squirting out, but rather dribbling.

Somewhat relieved, the partners made their way to their police S.U.V., taking several other wounded people with them to the hospital. The injury, a wound about the size of a nickel, was sewn up with a few stitches. He said he still does not know if it came from a bullet or shrapnel.

At the command center, his brother tried to keep his mind off his twin by focusing on the momentous task at hand. “The command staff kept coming up to me and saying, ‘Hey Branden, are you OK, do you need to get out of here and go to the hospital?’” he said. “And I said, ‘Well, you know, my brother is O.K., there’s a lot of work to get done.”

Casey was soon released from the hospital, rejecting an offer of morphine so that he could be clear-minded and get back to the scene.

and was able to play basketball.","The former playground phenom could dunk the ball at age 11, when he was 6 feet 2 inches. He became one of the finest players in New York City high school basketball history, starring in Brooklyn and being named a first-team all-American. Growing into a 6-foot-8-inch frame, he possessed unusually large hands and a talent for bursting through defenses before slamming down a dunk.

But by the time he reached the grandest stage in basketball, the N.B.A., he was at an advanced age for a rookie and recovering from knee surgery.

By then, a basketball career that had held so much potential for greatness had been damaged by the suspicions — unsubstantiated — that he had been involved in a collegiate point-shaving scandal in the early 1960s.

Recovering from the setback proved to be an enormous emotional challenge.

“It was totally devastating,” Hawkins told NBA.com in 2009. “I was innocent, but no one would listen to me. Plus, coming from a poor family, no one even thought about trying to get a lawyer to fight it. We just weren’t that sophisticated.”

Other players in the league shared the view that he had been mistreated. When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992, Bob Lanier, the former Detroit Pistons center, who was part of that class, said Hawkins had “never got his just due,” adding, “because obviously the media wasn’t big then.”

Lanier marveled at Hawkins’s skills. Referring to Erving, he remarked how Hawkins “was doing these wild, swooping kind of moves before anyone knew about Dr. J.”

Hawkins had been recruited by numerous colleges before enrolling at the University of Iowa in 1961. But he never a played a game there.

College basketball at the time was engulfed in its second point-shaving scandal after players had received money from gamblers to affect the final score of games. Hawkins was questioned by the New York City authorities about possible connections with one of the fixers, but he was never accused of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he was banned from collegiate play and the N.B.A.

Hawkins played one season in the American Basketball League and two seasons with the Globetrotters and was a star in his two seasons in the American Basketball Association, which later merged with the N.B.A.

Hawkins’s path to the N.B.A. was buoyed in part by a 1969 article in Life magazine by David Wolf. “Evidence recently uncovered,” Mr. Wolf wrote, “indicates that Connie Hawkins never knowingly associated with gamblers, that he never introduced a player to a fixer, and that the only damaging statements about his involvement were made by Hawkins himself — as a terrified, semiliterate teenager who thought he’d go to jail unless he said what the D.A.’s detectives pressed him to say.”

On Hawkins’s behalf, Roslyn Litman, a civil liberties activist, along with her husband and law partner, S. David Litman, and another lawyer, Howard Specter, sued the N.B.A. on antitrust grounds, arguing that the league had in effect illegally banned Hawkins and deprived him of the “opportunity to earn a livelihood.”

They won. The league paid Hawkins a settlement of nearly $1.3 million and dropped the ban. Hawkins joined the N.B.A. in 1969 and became an instant star with the Suns.

Mr. Wolf recounted the Hawkins case in 1972 in the book “Foul!: The Connie Hawkins Story.” Jonathan B. Segal, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said it showed “how an underprivileged black man was victimized by a fat-cat, unfeeling Establishment.”

Cornelius Hawkins was born on July 17, 1942, in Brooklyn. He was introduced to basketball as a youngster in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn by a New York City police officer, Gene Smith, who helped run recreational programs at a Y.M.C.A.

His career at Boys High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant was capped by his being named a first-team high school all-American by Parade magazine in 1960.

“My model was Elgin Baylor,” he told The Times in 1992, recalling the forward known for his superb body control when playing with the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers. “My friends and I used to sneak into the old Madison Square Garden to see him play. Before Baylor, basketball was a more stand-up-and-shoot game.”

Hawkins averaged more than 24 points a game, sixth best in the N.B.A., in his first season with the Suns, and he was named to the all-N.B.A. first team.

He put up impressive numbers for several more years, but when his skills began to erode he was traded to the Lakers early in the 1973-74 season.

The Lakers dealt him to the Atlanta Hawks before the 1975-76 season, and after one season with them he retired, having averaged 16.5 points a game in his N.B.A. career.

Hawkins later worked in recreational programs for youth in Pittsburgh and was hired by the Suns as a community ambassador in 1992.

A list of survivors was not immediately available.

When Hawkins was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was asked about being denied an N.B.A. career for so long. He displayed no rancor.

“My attitude was that had I not played in the A.B.A., I wouldn’t have a job,” The Boston Globe quoted him as saying. “Had I not played with the Globetrotters, I would not have learned the experience and traveled around the world. Those things helped me out and gave me a different style of play once I got into the N.B.A.”

Asked whether induction gave him a sense of vindication, he responded: “My vindication was that I got into the N.B.A. and was able to play basketball. This was icing on the cake.”","Connie Hawkins, Electrifying N.B.A. Forward Banned in His Prime, Dies at 75",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/obituaries/connie-hawkins-dead.html

But here’s the challenge that rule-following Australia now finds itself confronting: What’s to be done with those who have a different experience, say in countries where rules are more negotiable, or those who simply want a less rigid society and more, well, encouragement of difference?

Our ethical conundrum was relatively minor (kangaroos have survived far worse than white bread), but there are bigger issues afoot that are testing Australia’s sense of when to hold the line and when to live and let live.

With same-sex marriage, for example, Australians are deciding whether the old rules of relationships should still be enforced, or loosened. The debate isn’t just about competing arguments of freedom or fairness, or about what the word marriage should really mean; it’s also about whether or not to change how Australians interact with each other.

That question affects immigration too. The elevation of rules restricting access drives the refugee policy that led to the detention centers on Manus and Nauru. It’s also what lets the country’s leaders pat each other on the back for Australia’s “multicultural society” even as they work to add additional rules that make it harder to obtain citizenship, and insist that immigrants exhibit “Australian values,” which mean just about anything that the establishment deems important.

Indeed, I’m often struck by the gap between white Australians who insist everyone is welcomed in Australia — no hyphenated identities here! — and the experience of immigrants or the children of immigrants who tell me the many ways they are treated as “other” and made to feel that their differences are unwelcome.

This is hardly unique to Australia; immigrants and expanding ideas of sexuality and gender are challenging societal norms all over the world. And yet what’s so interesting about the current moment in Australia are the ways that these forces — those defending the status quo, and challenging it — are colliding.

The debate over Australia’s refugee policies regularly brings out both supporters and critics, while outside the gaze of the Australian establishment, immigrant communities in places like Fairfield, one of Sydney’s most diverse western suburbs, are creating their own versions of “Australian values” every day.

Where, I often wonder, will Australia be in five or 10 years on its adherence to rules, and on these issues of sexuality and gender, and race and immigration?

With trust in government and media sharply declining in the country, will Australia become a messier or a more rigid democracy, with more bending of the rules or more conflict? Or will new compromises emerge?

At our cottages, my daughter found her own middle ground. When offered a slice of bread to feed the kangaroos, she declined, but without comment. She did not defend the rules to those who may not have seen the signs (they had walked in from another area), nor did she violate the rules herself.

Maybe, just maybe, there’s something to be learned in that?

Australia! And New Zealand

We often write about China and its role in Australia, but this week we dove into the case of a New Zealand lawmaker accused of being a spy for China, and what it says about China’s reach.

You also won’t want to miss our story about a Brisbane theater company that may or may not have “whitewashed” Lin-Manuel Miranda’s big musical hit before “Hamilton”; or our take on Elon Musk’s rocket announcement in South Australia; or this analysis of what the newly proposed media law could mean for Rupert Murdoch. And don’t miss this genre-bending article from the magazine’s culture issue about the Necks.

Hailing from Sydney, could they be ”the greatest trio on earth?”

Big Tech Comeuppance?

With Amazon about to open in Australia (I’ll have a story on that soon), it’s interesting to see the European Union trying to crack down and collect what it sees as unpaid taxes from big American tech companies, including the Jeff Bezos behemoth. This is a battle likely to kick up all over the world, including Australia.

Isabella Kwai suggests that we all give a listen to “Kind World” — a podcast from WBUR in Boston about people who have had their lives changed by small acts of kindness.

The segments are short, just a few minutes each, and will inject a touch of inspiration into your routine.

Of the six 14-letter entries, five have never appeared before. (THREE-CAR GARAGE is the exception and has appeared only once before, in a larger Sunday grid.)

17A: Many of the smaller entries have purposely vague clues as well. This is how you know your weekend has arrived. “Gross” can mean lots of things. Furthermore, EARN has a lot of senses beside “make, exclusive of deductions.”

22A: I was pretty sure “Cinnabon feature” was either “aroma” or SWIRL, so I waited for a crossing.

30A: O. HENRY’s “The Ransom of Red Chief” was a story published in “The Saturday Evening Post” and is about the kidnapping of a rich man’s child. He’s such a handful that the criminals wind up paying to have him taken back. This has become a very popular plotline over the past century.

53D: I can hear cries of “CTR, CTRL and DEL?” Have a little mercy on the “stack wrestler.”

Constructor Notes

Going to keep this short, because I honestly don’t remember much about this puzzle. I see from my files that it dates back to May 2015, a month before my high school graduation. That whole time period is a blur for me: My last AP tests, throwing my cap in the air, saying goodbye to old friends, feeling anxious about starting college, etc. Apparently I was making themelesses as well — not a huge surprise. Looking at the puzzle now, I’m pleased with how it turned out. I must have been trying to mix things up by doing triple stacks of 14s, and I like my choices of long entries (especially the wacky-looking MI CASA ES SU CASA at 1-Across). I also appreciate how relatively smooth and trivia-free the rest of the grid is. Might have gone for a little more zing were I building this puzzle today, but at the same time, the relative lack of crosswordese allows for a lot of nice cluing opportunities. Speaking of which, big ups to Will, Joel, and Sam for improving so many of the clues. Didn’t remember the originals, but looking back on them now, I feel their replacements are definitely better. Hope you enjoy — maybe it’s time for me to start solving my old puzzles!

For better and worse, some stand-ups are now treated like political oracles on social media. And during times of tragedy, late night talk show hosts regularly deliver solemn monologues. The day before I interviewed Ms. Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel unleashed a scathing broadside against the Graham-Cassidy health care bill that dominated the conversation about the legislation the next morning.

While Ms. Silverman is avoiding that kind of argumentative tactic in her own show, she saw his success as supporting her views about change. “He was not a political person at all until it affected his life,” she said of Mr. Kimmel, referring to his son, who was born in April with a heart ailment. (Mr. Kimmel and Ms. Silverman once dated.) “Sometimes, it takes a personal experience to get woke to things.”

Ms. Silverman, tall and poised, has a warm presence, listening to questions as intently as she answers them. She sometimes shifts between plain-spoken, even folksy slang and her old kewpie doll voice, code-switching between savvy and silly, gimlet-eyed and wide-eyed.

She grew up in Bedford, N.H., in one of few Jewish families in her neighborhood. Her mother ran a community theater and her father inherited the family clothing business, passing along his sense of humor. When Ms. Silverman was a toddler, he taught her how to say a string of curse words. “She’d sit on his lap — short black bangs, adorable round face — and say this, and we’d all laugh,” recalled her older sister Susan Silverman.

Ms. Silverman, whose childhood bedroom ceiling had “I love Steve Martin” written on it, was a comedy prodigy. She told jokes onstage for the first time at 15, and dropped out of college after freshman year at New York University to work clubs; by 22 she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live.” She lasted only a year, but sketch comedy and sitcoms were never the goal. “She was the rare stand-up back then who didn’t see it as a means,” said Sam Seder, who directed Ms. Silverman in her first film, “Who’s the Caboose?” “Stand-up was the end.”

When asked about her ambition in her first years of New York comedy, she said she wanted to sleep with everyone. “I was so excited about sex once I had it, and I lost my virginity to a comedian, so it was like in front of everyone,” she said. “I was attracted to funny people.” She speaks fondly of her formative days in New York clubs, but also said she now realizes what a “misogynistic culture” she dwelled in.

“I was told: You’re only a real comedian if your material can be said by a male comedian and it still worked,” she said, with exasperation. “I bought that. Looking back, it’s mind-blowing. I accepted talking about the female experience as hack.”

Ms. Silverman eventually pushed past that attitude, telling jokes about sex and dating whose innocent affect belied what she was really saying. Mr. Seder, who dated her in the early 1990s, recalls traveling to New Hampshire with her to perform a benefit given by her mother. On stage Ms. Silverman told a story about how in the middle of licking jelly off her boyfriend’s penis, she realized: “Oh my god, I’m turning into my mother.”

Photo

“I couldn’t believe she did that joke, not just in front of her mother, but her entire world,” Mr. Seder said. “But they laughed.”

Over the next decade, Ms. Silverman developed a reputation as a sharp joke writer and performer, but she burst on the national scene in 2001 after saying a racial slur for Chinese people on “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” that drew condemnation and an apology from the talk show. She debated Guy Aoki, of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans, on “Politically Incorrect.” “That whole Conan controversy made me famous,” she said. “I’m not proud of it but I have to admit it.”

In 2005, Ms. Silverman had a major breakthrough with “Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,” an influential Off Broadway show turned feature film where she made elegantly crafted jokes in the voice of a naïvely offensive Jewish woman. Building jokes about rape, the Holocaust, AIDS and race, she used what she calls her “unreliable narrator” character to distance herself from her material.

She received many glowing reviews, but a critique from A.O. Scott in The New York Times made her take a hard look at her act. It argued that her kind of ironic, transgressive humor flatters herself and her audience, playing it safe. “Looking back now, I was playing an ignorant character, but I also really was ignorant,” she said. “When A.O. Scott wrote that, it hit me hard. I just felt like it opened up my mind like a good hallucinogeni …”

Ms. Silverman paused, made a bewildered face and repeated the word “hallucinogenic” several times with slightly different pronunciations, tilting her head in a pantomime of confusion. Twice during the interview, she flamboyantly searched for the right way to say a word; she did it once in her test show, turning it into a self-deprecating verbal pratfall.

“I Love You, America” marries a long-running interest in scatological humor and stomping on taboos with a new, more politically conscious voice. In a video segment where she spends time with a family who never met a Jew before, she bonds with their young boy with the great unifier: a fart joke.

Unlike many veteran comics, Ms. Silverman does not lament that political correctness is ruining comedy, saying she no longer uses words like “retard”; on her test show, she brought up “micro-aggressions.”

“If you’re so scared of changing with the times, then you’re old,” she said. “There are comedians I love to pieces who roll their eyes. ‘Oh, another word I can’t say.’ You don’t know enough words?”

The presidential election was clearly a turning point for Ms. Silverman. On the night Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Silverman was walking her dog when her sister called. “She was sobbing, beside herself, like her guts were coming out,” Susan Silverman said, “but in that conversation, she said we have to start listening to each other and can’t go on like this in our own echo chambers.”

Ms. Silverman’s attitudes about ambition have changed too. She said she now puts her career first, adding that while she loves her current boyfriend — the British actor Michael Sheen — the relationship works because he lives an ocean away. “I’ve watched myself over many years give up a lot of things because I’m in relationships,” she said, describing herself as “oddly subservient” in romance. “I’m older now and I don’t want to do that. I want to make stuff that matters and put my whole self into it.”

Ms. Silverman has done more dramatic acting of late (see the current “Battle of the Sexes”) but after a few narrative pilots for television didn’t work out, she decided she wanted to try something closer to stand-up, a show where she plays herself, looks at the camera and talks to people who don’t necessarily agree with her. But it’s not easy.

She invited the conservative comic Dennis Miller to be a guest, but he turned her down. When she noticed that Ivanka Trump followed her on Twitter, she sent her a direct message, saying she has a chance to make a difference. No response, she said. (“I’ve given up on her since.”) And her forays into red state America for her show — she traveled to a small Texas town where President Trump won by 87 percent and spent a day with a family of Trump voters in a suburb outside New Orleans — have led to culture clashes.

In Louisiana, a female Trump voter complained that President Barack Obama gave away “handouts,” while her family talked about being on Medicaid. Ms. Silverman spends more time listening than fact-checking, which may not satisfy liberals who delight in seeing John Oliver or Samantha Bee eviscerate conservatives. At the same time, it’s hard to see Trump voters thinking this segment is for them either.

The most obviously commercial aspect of the show may be Ms. Silverman’s star power. A live-wire performer, she has a sly, teasing sensibility that has always been far too off-kilter to be blandly relatable. Whether she has enough room to roam will likely be crucial to the show’s success.

Reflecting on her interactions with the family in Louisiana, Ms. Silverman said that she had a good time and found agreement on some issues, like same-sex marriage. When asked if this visit made her more hopeful for change, Ms. Silverman weighed her words carefully. “What makes me hopeful is when you’re face to face you can still enjoy and respect each other,” she said. “Did we change minds? No.”

What’s important, she said, is accepting that you might not always be right. Years of therapy have helped her find the joy in realizing when she is wrong. “I am lucky because most people hate it,” she said. “I’ve dated guys who I love to death but they cannot say sorry. It would kill them to say sorry. To me, I love it. It makes the person I’m talking to feel so good. A total high.”

This was apparent in our interview when we disagreed over how to categorize “I Love You, America.” I saw it as a talk show. Ms. Silverman disagreed, associating that genre with topicality and a guest promoting projects. When I said it’s interesting that she resists the term, she responded sharply that it’s interesting that I want to pigeonhole the show. It was tense, but not for long.

She paused, than flashed a big smile. “O.K., I am a host,” she said. “I don’t care, whatever you want to call it.”

On the show, her guests are people who have undergone a change, and it’s clear that Ms. Silverman puts a premium on transformation (Megan Phelps-Roper, who left the Westboro Baptist Church, an ultraconservative group, will be a future guest).

And yet, does this calm prove that South Koreans really are as indifferent as we might seem? Has everyone really managed to transcend the fear of war? No, it is not so. Rather, the tension and terror that have accumulated for decades have burrowed deep inside us and show themselves in brief flashes even in humdrum conversation. Especially over the past few months, we have witnessed this tension gradually increasing, on the news day after day, and inside our own nervousness. People began to find out where the nearest air-raid shelter from their home and office is. Ahead of Chuseok, our harvest festival, some people even prepared gifts for their family — not the usual box of fruit, but “survival backpacks,” filled with a flashlight, a radio, medicine, biscuits. In train stations and airports, each time there is a news broadcast related to war, people gather in front of the television, watching the screen with tense faces. That’s how things are with us. We are worried. We are afraid of the direct possibility of North Korea, just over the border, testing a nuclear weapon again and of a radiation leak. We are afraid of a gradually escalating war of words becoming war in reality. Because there are days we still want to see arrive. Because there are loved ones beside us. Because there are 50 million people living in the south part of this peninsula, and the fact that there are 700,000 kindergartners among them is not a mere number to us.

One reason, even in these extreme circumstances, South Koreans are struggling to maintain a careful calm and equilibrium is that we feel more concretely than the rest of the world the existence of North Korea, too. Because we naturally distinguish between dictatorships and those who suffer under them, we try to respond to circumstances holistically, going beyond the dichotomy of good and evil. For whose sake is war waged? This type of longstanding question is staring us straight in the face right now, as a vividly felt actuality.

In researching my novel “Human Acts,” which deals with the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, when the military dictatorship turned to the armed forces to suppress student protests against martial law, I had to widen the field to include documents related not only to Gwangju but also to World War II, the Spanish Civil War, Bosnia and the massacres of Native Americans. Because what I ultimately wanted to focus on was not one particular time and place but the face of universal humanity that is revealed in the history of this world. I wanted to ask what it is that makes human beings harm others so brutally, and how we ought to understand those who never lose hold of their humanity in the face of violence. I wanted to grope toward a bridge spanning the yawning chasm between savagery and dignity. One of the many things I realized during my research is that in all wars and massacres there is a critical point at which human beings perceive certain other human beings as “subhuman” — because they have a different nationality, ethnicity, religion, ideology. This realization, too, came at the same time: The last line of defense by which human beings can remain human is the complete and true perception of another’s suffering, which wins out over all of these biases. And the fact that actual, practical volition and action, which goes beyond simple compassion for the suffering of others, is demanded of us at every moment.

The Korean War was a proxy war enacted on the Korean Peninsula by neighboring great powers. Millions of people were butchered over those three brutal years, and the former national territory was utterly destroyed. Only relatively recently has it come to light that in this tragic process were several instances of the American Army, officially our allies, massacring South Korean citizens. In the most well-known of these, the No Gun Ri Massacre, American soldiers drove hundreds of citizens, mainly women and children, under a stone bridge, then shot at them from both sides for several days, killing most of them. Why did it have to be like this? If they did not perceive the South Korean refugees as “subhuman,” if they had perceived the suffering of others completely and truly, as dignified human beings, would such a thing have been possible?

Now, nearly 70 years on, I am listening as hard as I can each day to what is being said on the news from America, and it sounds perilously familiar. “We have several scenarios.” “We will win.” “If war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, 20,000 South Koreans will be killed every day.” “Don’t worry, war won’t happen in America. Only on the Korean Peninsula.”

To the South Korean government, which speaks only of a solution of dialogue and peace in this situation of sharp confrontation, the president of the United States has said, “They only understand one thing.” It’s an accurate comment. Koreans really do understand only one thing. We understand that any solution that is not peace is meaningless and that “victory” is just an empty slogan, absurd and impossible. People who absolutely do not want another proxy war are living, here and now, on the Korean Peninsula.

When I think about the months to come, I remember the candlelight of last winter. Every Saturday, in cities across South Korea, hundreds of thousands of citizens gathered and sang together in protest against the corrupt government, holding candles in paper cups, shouting that the president should step down. I, too, was in the streets, holding up a flame of my own. At the time, we called it the “candlelight rally” or “candlelight demonstration”; we now call it our “candlelight revolution.”

We only wanted to change society through the quiet and peaceful tool of candlelight, and those who eventually made that into a reality — no, the tens of millions of human beings who have dignity, simply through having been born into this world as lives, weak and unsullied — carry on opening the doors of cafes and teahouses and hospitals and schools every day, going forward together one step at a time for the sake of a future that surges up afresh every moment.

Valedictions are few, and after a long and brilliant career, it is surely churlish to begrudge the need for one. But when Philip Roth revealed, in 2012, that he had written his last novel — with multiple interviews, the preparation of papers for his biographer and later a documentary — it was hard not to compare his exit style to that of his contemporary, Alice Munro. The Nobel laureate simply slipped her intention into her last story collection, “Dear Life,” writing in a preface to the final four “not quite stories” that they were “the first and last — and the closest — things I have to say about my own life.” What followed had the quality of something long distilled but freshly reconsidered. It was a return to origins, to the fox farm and the mother who wanted more, recounted with the ambiguity and the long-view-down-the-telescope temporal shifts characteristic of Munro’s work. If it was the end, it was a fitting one, the kind that makes you want to begin reading her all over again.

Film actors, preserved whole body at specific ages and available on instant download, have an especially complex relationship with public memory. Most of us do not know Daniel Day-Lewis, nor is he the sort of person to be photographed at the Malibu Country Mart, but we have an impression of him from his choice of characters and what he brings to them: a puckish charisma and a scene-devouring devotion to craft, but also, in his less adrenalized performances, something finer. I will remember especially his Cecil Vyse, the pompous, pince-nezed aesthete wrongly engaged to Lucy Honeychurch in “A Room With a View,” the Merchant Ivory adaptation of E.M. Forster’s novel, and the vulnerability he found in a comic and deeply coded character.

Forster himself stopped publishing novels at the peak of his career, after “A Passage to India” came out, in 1924. Only 45, he must have been weary, one can’t help but think, of all the coding. He died in 1970, leaving behind the manuscript for “Maurice,” a love story between two men. “Publishable — but worth it?” read a note found attached to the manuscript. The novel, with its happy ending, found its own a year later.

WRITING IS THE MOST private performance of all, and while we respect the productive literary recluse, the Pynchons and Dickinsons, we are troubled by those who seem to crumble under the weight of their own success, such as Harper Lee, who never finished a book after “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Art doesn’t come without great effort, and it’s easy to underestimate the burden of expectation. Stephen King has found retirement so relaxing he’s written more than a dozen novels since he announced he would stop in 2002.

For some authors of the 20th century, narrating a self was a mode of survival. I think of Edna O’Brien’s extraordinary 2012 memoir, “Country Girl,” which is both a celebration of a life vibrantly lived, filled with legendary love affairs and photographs of her backlit in diaphanous skirts — and also a horror story about the personal costs involved in pursuing her work. It ends with the image of a room “readying itself for a last banquet,” a promise she’s lived up to, publishing a novel at 84, as well as an edition of her collected stories, reminding us, not that we needed to be reminded, of her greatness.

To announce a retirement is on some level a way of stage-managing one’s own legacy; it’s not unlike attending your wake and getting to hear what everyone has to say. Of course, many retirements don’t stick. Generally there are no hard feelings about this, because the only thing we love more than a “new voice” is a comeback, especially when it’s someone like David Lynch, returning for more “Twin Peaks” wizardry after 10 years without a feature film. Some retirements are transparently hiatuses-as-publicity-stunts — Quentin Tarantino, Jay-Z — while others are a blatant critique of the industry the leave-takers have made their career in, like Steven Soderbergh, who has turned to less studio-dependent projects.

For women in Hollywood, retirement is rarely of their own choosing. Here I think of the Amy Schumer sketch in which Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette toast Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s “last f-able day,” sending her off in a rowboat with a cigar. That they are, in fact, the exceptions who have managed to keep working made it easier to laugh.

To flee the spotlight at the height of one’s powers takes a certain kind of courage. Even Greta Garbo, that genius of myth creation, a recluse at 36 in the wake of “Two-Faced Woman,” the 1941 film she referred to as “my grave,” seemed to find retirement a little lonely.

In the art world, pulling a Garbo may be especially risky. It can fall a little flat, as when Marcel Duchamp gave up art for chess, only to baffle everyone with “Étant Donnés,” an elaborate secret final piece two decades in the making that involved a heavy antique door and a diorama of a nude holding a lamp sprawled on a bed of twigs. Lee Lozano broke into the 1960s New York art scene with phallocentric paintings of tools and machinery, but began to withdraw in 1970, the year of her solo show at the Whitney — rare for a woman artist of her time — retiring for good with “Dropout Piece.” “Artist, critic, dealer and museum friends, in fact, almost everybody: I still smell on your bad breath the other people’s rules you swallowed whole so long ago,” she had written in her journal. She faded into obscurity. The influential contemporary sculptor and installation artist Cady Noland, who effectively dropped out of the art world in 1999, has taken to writing disclaimers that she does not approve of the exhibition of her work when it occasionally appears in galleries and at art fairs. Disavowal is the purest commentary, but it’s not a very satisfying one.

And yet creativity isn’t always in infinite supply. Some rage on against the dying of the light, like Iris Murdoch or Willem de Kooning, despite diminishing returns. For every Lucian Freud, who painted his pending mortality into his late portraits of friends, creating masterpieces through his 80s, there’s a Norman Mailer, the author who claimed that the inner lives of great novelists were comparable to those of heavyweight boxing champions, and perhaps himself went a few rounds too many.

Perhaps we could all take a page from our master of solitude, Annie Dillard, who stopped writing in the last decade and took up painting when she no longer could carry the book around in her head, as she told David Remnick in a 2016 interview: “We’re here under conditions, and you either accept them or fight them, but the conditions aren’t going to change at all . . . so you might as well accept them.”

Art freezes time. Day-Lewis’s repressed Edwardian, Munro’s young women too smart for their own good. Immortality is, perhaps, what every artist wants. To be told that those who reflect our existence are merely human reminds us that we are, too.",What Does It Mean When an Artist Retires?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/t-magazine/art/artist-retire.html

But it was a long road to stardom for Mr. Petty, literally.

It all started with the “greatest trip of my life,” as Mr. Petty described it to Mr. Zanes, referring to a cross-country road-trip from Gainesville to Los Angeles in 1974. With him was the bass player Danny Roberts of Mr. Petty’s band Mudcrutch, and their roadie, Keith McAllister. The band had gotten as big as it could back in Florida. A look at the city that became his home, and the places that defined him, allows you to chart his journey from struggling musician to rock star.

Soon after his arrival, Mr. Petty found himself in a telephone booth outside of Ben Frank’s diner at 8585 Sunset Boulevard — now the West Hollywood location of Mel’s Drive-In — sifting through a phone book looking for record companies. As luck would have it, he spotted a piece of paper on the ground with a list of 25 local record labels, with addresses and phone numbers, most likely left behind by another rock ‘n’ roll dreamer.

“The thing about L.A. was that it was exactly what I hoped it would be,” Mr. Petty said. “We drove down the streets and everywhere you looked were signs for record companies. MGM, RCA, Capitol, A&M. It was obvious that we had come to the right place.”

Mudcrutch ended up signing with Shelter Records, whose Los Angeles offices were based in a large, one-story building at 5112 Hollywood Boulevard, which now houses apartments and a Lebanese restaurant. Mr. Petty and his crew spent countless hours there hanging out and listening to music.

Of the surviving landmark recording industry buildings of Mr. Petty’s early days, the Capitol Records Building is the most recognizable. It is a designated Historic-Cultural Monument — a short drive away from where Shelter Records once existed — at 1750 Vine Street. (While Mr. Petty was never on the Capitol Records label, EMI-Capitol did end up with the Shelter Records catalog in 1993, though Mr. Petty retained the rights to his music.)

From the Capitol Records Building, you’re a 10-minute walk from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted in 1999 and fans have been flocking there to pay tribute since hearing of Mr. Petty’s passing.

After signing with Shelter Records, the label put Mr. Petty and the boys up at the Hollywood Premiere Motel, a less-than-glamorous accommodation still operating at 5333 Hollywood Boulevard. Mr. Petty described it as “really a hooker place” in the book “Conversations With Tom Petty.” It’s also where his wife, Jane, informed him that she was pregnant with their first child. If you want a hint of a struggling musician’s life, you can book a room there for $90 a night on Booking.com or simply save some money and snap a picture in front.

The band moved on to two rental homes in the San Fernando Valley. Each had a swimming pool but the group slept on mattresses on the floor and had no furniture other than the lawn furniture from the backyard.

After the release of the unsuccessful single “Depot Street,” the group continued recording at the mansion of musician Leon Russell, the hitmaker who was a founder of Shelter Records, and Mr. Petty would house-sit for him. He would later have his own Encino mansion, which was notoriously burned down by an arsonist in 1987.

But Mr. Petty was still a long way from being able to afford his own mansion. In fact, Shelter Records dropped Mudcrutch from its label while they were still working on music in Mr. Russell’s house.

Mr. Petty would stay on the Shelter payroll, but soon found himself back in a cramped hotel, this time at The Winona Motel (5131 Hollywood Boulevard), which is now the Hollywood Inn Express North (not to be mistaken for a Holiday Inn Express). It’s close to Mr. Petty’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

“I’d gone from living in a rock star’s mansion to a motel room. Which, for some reason, didn’t bother me,” Mr. Petty said of that time. “I didn’t need much. Shelter was across the street, and my whole social world was there.”

At around this time, Mr. Petty’s daughter, Adria, was born in a hospital in Burbank in November 1974. Shortly after, Jane and Adria would move back to Florida to be closer to family while Mr. Petty tried to pick up the pieces of his music career.

“I’d put so much into Mudcrutch, and now it was just dust,” Mr. Petty said. “I had nothing, absolutely nothing to show for years of work.”

But things started to change as Mr. Petty continued to work with Mr. Russell, who took a liking to his work. Before he knew it, he was meeting Mr. Russell’s famous friends like Brian Wilson and working with George Harrison and Ringo Starr at Sound City Studios (15456 Cabrito Road.).

The studio, which reopened in 2017 after being closed for several years, was the subject of the 2013 documentary “Sound City,” produced and directed by Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. Several renowned albums were recorded in the studio, including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’s “Damn the Torpedoes” (1979), Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush” (1970) and Nirvana’s “Nevermind” (1991).

By the end of 1975, Mr. Petty got back together with several members of Mudcrutch to form Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Their first album, self-titled, slowly climbed the charts, and songs like “Breakdown” and “American Girl” would become FM radio staples. The album eventually reached gold status in the United States, and Mr. Petty was well on his way to stardom.

Though he was now ensconced in Los Angeles, Mr. Petty harkened back to his Florida era in a famous lyric in “American Girl,” referencing Route 441, a highway that runs through the state:

It was kind of cold that night She stood alone on her balcony She could hear the cars roll by Out on 441 Like waves crashin’ in the beach

Years later, his 1989 hit “Free Fallin’,” the opening track from “Full Moon Fever,” would serve as sort of a tour of his adopted city: “It’s a long day, livin’ in Reseda”; “all the vampires, walkin’ through the Valley / move west down Ventura Boulevard”; “I wanna glide down over Mulholland...”

By the mid-70s, Mr. Petty had enough cash to buy a red Camaro, which he used to pick up Bruce Springsteen, who called him “around the time he drove off the lot,” according to Mr. Zanes’s book, for a cruise down Sunset Boulevard. Mr. Petty was in a much different position than he was just a few years earlier when he was riding down the same street hunting for his first recording contract.

They picked up several eight-tracks from Tower Records at 8801 Sunset Boulevard, one of the better-known locations of the famed music retailer that ceased operating in 2006. (The guitar maker Gibson Brands took over the space in 2014.)

“They drove until they listened to every song on every one of them. The Stones’ “12 x 5” was among the tapes. When “Congratulations” came on, Springsteen raised his arms to the heavens and said, ‘You can take me now!’ Petty loved that. He liked knowing another man out there who went to the same church,” Mr. Zanes wrote.",Tom Petty’s ‘Greatest Trip’ Was to Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/travel/tom-petty-los-angeles-florida-gainesville.html

The last one was an assault with an explosive device on a train at the Parsons Green subway station that injured at least 30.

In March, five people were killed and at least 40 more injured when a knife-wielding assailant in a sport utility vehicle ran over pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. He then got out and stabbed a police officer outside the Parliament building.

On June 3, three men carrying knives and wearing fake suicide bomb vests rammed their van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed several people in the nearby Borough Market, killing eight.

Two weeks later, a van driver plowed into a crowd of Muslims as they finished prayers at the Finsbury Park Mosque in north London, leaving one dead.

In addition, a suicide bomber killed 22 people and wounded 59 others when he blew himself up near one of the exits of the Manchester Arena at the end of a concert in May by the American pop singer Ariana Grande.

Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October.
They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying.
“Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook.
I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled.","Trees can live without us, but we cannot live without trees.

With a history dating back to the dinosaurs, trees are the planet’s documentarians, watching us cycle through life while providing oxygen, shade and shelter. Trees, the oldest of which, according to Peter Wohlleben’s “The Hidden Life of Trees,” has 9,500 years, are a critical part of the human experience. We rely on them, from their deep roots to fluttering leaves.

But — at least when we’re not cutting them down — how do we influence trees? Diane Cook and Len Jenshel present some answers in their new book, “Wise Trees,” which will be published by Abrams in October. Traveling to more than 70 locations, they found trees that represent “landscapes of complexity where nature and humanity converge.” In other words, trees with stories, like the young sycamore that witnessed the Civil War, or the elm that survived the Oklahoma City bombing. These photos show how events have shaped trees, their energy, and sometimes, literally, the shape of their limbs.

“Forty-million trees are being lost every day,” said Mr. Jenshel. “We love the environment and wanted to do something that would make people think differently about trees.”

Though Mr. Jenshel and Ms. Cook — who are married, collaborate on all their projects and frequently finish each other’s sentences — have a long history of photographing trees, a much more personal seed for their project was planted in the spring of 2012. They were in Japan documenting a nighttime cherry tree ritual when Ms. Cook learned that her father was dying. Struggling to process the information, she found herself watching the fragile petals of the cherry blossoms slowly drift to the ground, one by one.

“We did what the Japanese have been doing for centuries,” said Ms. Cook. “To take in that beauty, appreciate its ephemeral nature, and know that life does go on.”

Her father died soon after, but a new project was born, influenced by the cherry blossoms and a National Geographic magazine commission. “Taking that strength from the trees, we had this idea of looking at wise trees around the world,” said Ms. Cook. “And the importance trees have had throughout history in so many cultures.”

After the Sept. 11 attacks, search and rescue workers were looking for human remains among the rubble, when they found part of a Callery pear tree, which traditionally is the first tree to bloom in spring and the last to change leaves in autumn. Though its trunk was scorched and many branches missing, the tree had survived the attacks. Now a symbol of strength and survival, the pear tree was nursed back to health at a Bronx nursery and, nearly a decade later, replanted at the World Trade Center memorial.

Other trees have been a part of unspeakable cruelties. From 1846 to 1870, in Goliad, Tex., an oak known as “The Hanging Tree,” provided shade for court sessions and branches for lynching.

“It’s not always a happy story,” said Ms. Cook.

One of the rain or monkeypod trees in Cambodia (imported from South or Central America), was isolated from the others as “The Killing Tree.” In 1975 when Pol Pot’s murderous rule started, the tree was used to bash children’s heads while their mothers were forced to watch.

“It took us days to recover from that experience of photographing that tree,” said Ms. Cook. “That left the deepest scar on us.”

Other trees seem to travel, and quite far. It is not clear how the adansonia gregorii (or boab) tree got to Western Australia. Perhaps it was the result of seeds dropped from the fruits by early migrants. It was a good thing, though, for the local aboriginals who used the tree as a spiritual home and lifeline, since it can hold up to 26 gallons of water.

In India, from the ancient tree deities to current bodhis of enlightenment, most trees are seen as sacred. In a Varanasi sweet shop, they found a neem tree, said to cure all ailments. Long after they shot the photo, Ms. Cook noticed her spouse’s anxiety.

“Len kept saying, ‘I don’t think we got the picture. I need to go back to that tree,’” Ms. Cook recalled. “I totally knew it was about the sweets.”

I was given a visa to North Korea, as were three other New York Times journalists. The U.S. State Department promptly gave us an exemption from the travel ban to North Korea and issued special passports good for a single trip here.

Far more than when I previously visited, North Korea is galvanizing its people to expect a nuclear war with the United States. High school students march in the streets in military uniform every day to denounce America. Posters and billboards along the public roads show missiles destroying the U.S. Capitol and shredding the American flag. In fact, images of missiles are everywhere — in a kindergarten playground, at a dolphin show, on state television. This military mobilization is accompanied by the ubiquitous assumption that North Korea could not only survive a nuclear conflict, but also win it.

“If we have to go to war, we won’t hesitate to totally destroy the United States,” explained Mun Hyok-myong, a 38-year-old teacher visiting an amusement park.

Ryang Song-chol, a 41-year-old factory worker, looked surprised when I asked if his country could survive a war with America. “We would certainly win,” he said.

These interviews were conducted in the presence of two Foreign Ministry officials, but even if they weren’t, there is no chance that ordinary people would speak freely to a foreign reporter. This is perhaps the most tightly controlled country in the world, so such quotes should be seen as reflecting a government script — in this case, a disturbingly jingoistic one.

On past trips (my last was in 2005), we journalists stayed at hotels in the capital and were free to walk around on our own, but this time the Foreign Ministry housed us at its own guarded Kobangsan Guest House east of the capital. At first I thought this was simply to restrict us, but increasingly I saw signs of something more interesting and menacing: The Foreign Ministry was also protecting us from hard-liners in the military or in the security services.

“Someone might hear you are from America,” and there could be trouble, one official explained.

Hard-liners seem to have gained greater power this year, especially after Trump’s threat to “totally destroy” North Korea, and we were told that military officers sometimes mock their own country’s diplomats for being wimpish “American cronies.”

Foreign Ministry officials escorted us every time we left the compound, probably both to keep us out of mischief and to protect us from the security agencies.

Yes, all this has been a little discomfiting.

The upshot is that I have felt more constraint than on past visits to North Korea, and considerably more tension. Before, I had been able to see senior generals, but this time the military flatly refused to consider my interview requests. The security forces also refused my request to meet the three Americans whom they still detain, one for two years now, without consular access.

A basic problem is that hard-liners seem ascendant in both Washington and Pyongyang.

In Washington, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is advocating a diplomatic resolution to conflict with North Korea — but Trump undercut him on Twitter last Sunday and said Tillerson was “wasting his time.” Trump’s policy toward North Korea is founded on false assumptions that the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, will give up his nuclear weapons, that China can save the day and that military options are real.

In Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, which is full of wide streets and monumental buildings, officials also express little interest in the kind of tough compromises that would be necessary to resolve the crisis.

“The situation on the Korean Peninsula is on the eve of the breakout of nuclear war,” Choe, the Foreign Ministry official, told me. “We can survive” such a war, he added, and he and other officials said that it was not the right time for talks with the U.S.

The North Koreans insist that the U.S. make the first move and drop its sanctions and “hostile attitude” — which won’t happen. And the U.S. is equally unrealistic in insisting that North Korea give up its entire nuclear program.

I told Choe that my visit gave me a sense of déjà vu, reminding me of a trip to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq on the eve of the American invasion. The difference is that a war here would be not just a regional disaster but a nuclear cataclysm.

Choe was unimpressed by my warning. He said that Iraq and Libya had made the mistake of giving up their nuclear programs; in each case, America then ousted the regime. He added that the lesson was obvious, so North Korea will never negotiate away its nuclear warheads.

Still, for all the shadow of possible war, North Korea has had some positive changes. The famine is over (although malnutrition still leaves one in four children stunted), the economy has developed and government officials are far more open and savvy than a generation ago.

Officials used to deny that there was ever any crime in North Korea — but now they freely concede that this country has thieves, that young women sometimes become pregnant before marriage, that inevitably there’s a measure of corruption. (They do deny that North Korea has any gay people.)

North Korea is no longer hermetically sealed, and South Korean pop music and soap operas are smuggled in on flash drives and DVDs from China (watching them is a serious criminal offense). There is also an intranet — a rigidly controlled domestic version of the internet — and students learn English from about the third grade. At the best schools, like Pyongyang No. 1 Secondary School, the students are extraordinarily bright and they conversed with us in fluent English, with far more sophistication than on my first visit to the same school in 1989.

Yet this is still North Korea. I asked these kids if they had ever heard of Beyoncé or the Beatles; none had. I asked if they had heard of Facebook. One had, because computer software sometimes referred to it, but he didn’t know what it was.

Radios or televisions that might get foreign broadcasts are illegal, and there is no access to the internet except for foreigners and senior officials. When I arrived at the airport, my luggage was closely searched for pernicious publications, and even my phone was examined.

After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.
“You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.
When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.
She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.","An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.

During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.

In a statement to The Times on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”

He added that he was working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence to “deal with this issue head on.”

Lisa Bloom, a lawyer advising Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement that “he denies many of the accusations as patently false.” In comments to The Times earlier this week, Mr. Weinstein said that many claims in Ms. O’Connor’s memo were “off base” and that they had parted on good terms.

He and his representatives declined to comment on any of the settlements, including providing information about who paid them. But Mr. Weinstein said that in addressing employee concerns about workplace issues, “my motto is to keep the peace.”

Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”

Though Ms. O’Connor had been writing only about a two-year period, her memo echoed other women’s complaints. Mr. Weinstein required her to have casting discussions with aspiring actresses after they had private appointments in his hotel room, she said, her description matching those of other former employees. She suspected that she and other female Weinstein employees, she wrote, were being used to facilitate liaisons with “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.”

The allegations piled up even as Mr. Weinstein helped define popular culture. He has collected six best-picture Oscars and turned out a number of touchstones, from the films “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting” to the television show “Project Runway.” In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards.

In 2015, the year Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, his company distributed “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about campus sexual assault. A longtime Democratic donor, he hosted a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton in his Manhattan home last year. He employed Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of former President Barack Obama, as an intern this year, and recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name. During the Sundance Film Festival in January, when Park City, Utah, held its version of nationwide women’s marches, Mr. Weinstein joined the parade.

“From the outside, it seemed golden — the Oscars, the success, the remarkable cultural impact,” said Mark Gill, former president of Miramax Los Angeles when the company was owned by Disney. “But behind the scenes, it was a mess, and this was the biggest mess of all,” he added, referring to Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women.

Dozens of Mr. Weinstein’s former and current employees, from assistants to top executives, said they knew of inappropriate conduct while they worked for him. Only a handful said they ever confronted him.

Mr. Weinstein enforced a code of silence; employees of the Weinstein Company have contracts saying they will not criticize it or its leaders in a way that could harm its “business reputation” or “any employee’s personal reputation,” a recent document shows. And most of the women accepting payouts agreed to confidentiality clauses prohibiting them from speaking about the deals or the events that led to them.

Charles Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Weinstein, said it was not unusual to enter into settlements to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. He added, “It’s not evidence of anything.”

I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished.  From Lauren O’Connor‘s memo

At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.

In the wake of Ms. O’Connor’s 2015 memo, some Weinstein Company board members and executives, including Mr. Weinstein’s brother and longtime partner, Bob, 62, were alarmed about the allegations, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the end, though, board members were assured there was no need to investigate. After reaching a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, Ms. O’Connor withdrew her complaint and thanked him for the career opportunity he had given her.

“The parties made peace very quickly,” Ms. Bloom said.

Through her lawyer, Nicole Page, Ms. O’Connor declined to be interviewed. In the memo, she explained how unnerved she was by what she witnessed or encountered while a literary scout and production executive at the company. “I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,” Ms. O’Connor wrote. “But remaining silent is causing me great distress.”

In speaking out about her hotel episode, Ms. Judd said in a recent interview, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.”

A Common Narrative

Ms. Nestor, a law and business school student, accepted Mr. Weinstein’s breakfast invitation at the Peninsula because she did not want to miss an opportunity, she later told colleagues. After she arrived, he offered to help her career while boasting about a series of famous actresses he claimed to have slept with, according to accounts that colleagues compiled after hearing her story and then sent on to company executives.

“She said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour,” one internal document said. Ms. Nestor, who declined to comment for this article, refused his bargain, the records noted. “She was disappointed that he met with her and did not seem to be interested in her résumé or skill set.” The young woman chose not to report the episode to human resources personnel, but the allegations came to management’s attention through other employees.

Across the years and continents, accounts of Mr. Weinstein’s conduct share a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein, who has been married for most of three decades, sometimes seemed to have different interests. His home base was New York, but his rolling headquarters were luxury hotels: the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the Savoy in London, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc near the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Stein Eriksen Lodge near the Sundance Film Festival.

Working for Mr. Weinstein could mean getting him out of bed in the morning and doing “turndown duty” late at night, preparing him for sleep. Like the colleague cited in Ms. O’Connor’s memo, some junior employees required to perform those tasks said they were disturbing.

In interviews, eight women described varying behavior by Mr. Weinstein: appearing nearly or fully naked in front of them, requiring them to be present while he bathed or repeatedly asking for a massage or initiating one himself. The women, typically in their early or middle 20s and hoping to get a toehold in the film industry, said he could switch course quickly — meetings and clipboards one moment, intimate comments the next. One woman advised a peer to wear a parka when summoned for duty as a layer of protection against unwelcome advances.

Laura Madden, a former employee who said Mr. Weinstein prodded her for massages at hotels in Dublin and London beginning in 1991, said he had a way of making anyone who objected feel like an outlier. “It was so manipulative,” she said in an interview. “You constantly question yourself — am I the one who is the problem?”

“I don’t know anything about that,” Mr. Weinstein said.

Most women who told The Times that they experienced misconduct by Mr. Weinstein had never met one another. They range in age from early 20s to late 40s and live in different cities. Some said they did not report the behavior because there were no witnesses and they feared retaliation by Mr. Weinstein. Others said they felt embarrassed. But most confided in co-workers.

Ms. Madden later told Karen Katz, a friend and colleague in the acquisitions department, about Mr. Weinstein’s overtures, including a time she locked herself in the bathroom of his hotel room, sobbing. “We were so young at the time,” said Ms. Katz, now a documentary filmmaker. “We did not understand how wrong it was or how Laura should deal with it.”

Others in the London office said the same. “I was pretty disturbed and angry,” said Sallie Hodges, another former employee, recalling the accounts she heard from colleagues. “That’s kind of the way things were.”

The human resources operation was considered weak in New York and worse in London, so some employees banded together in solidarity. “If a female executive was asked to go to a meeting solo, she and a colleague would generally double up” so as not to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, recalled Mr. Gill, the former president of Miramax Los Angeles.

Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.

But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?

“It wasn’t a secret to the inner circle,” said Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s assistant in the early 1990s. She supervised a young woman who left the company abruptly after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein and who later received a settlement, according to several former employees.

Speaking up could have been costly. A job with Mr. Weinstein was a privileged perch at the nexus of money, fame and art, and plenty of his former assistants have risen high in Hollywood. He could be charming and generous: gift baskets, flowers, personal or career help and cash. At the Cannes Film Festival, according to several former colleagues, he sometimes handed out thousands of dollars as impromptu bonuses.

Mr. Weinstein was a volcanic personality, though, given to fits of rage and personal lashings of male and female employees alike. When a female guest of his had to wait for a hotel room upgrade, he yelled that Ms. O’Connor would be better off marrying a “fat, rich Jewish” man because she was probably just good for “being a wife” and “making babies,” she wrote in her memo. (He added some expletives, she said.) His treatment of women was sometimes written off as just another form of toxicity, according to multiple former employees.

In the fall of 1998, a 25-year-old London assistant named Zelda Perkins confronted Mr. Weinstein. According to former colleagues, she and several co-workers had been regularly subjected to inappropriate requests or comments in hotel rooms, and she was particularly concerned about the treatment of another woman in the office. She told Mr. Weinstein that he had to stop, according to the former colleagues, and that she would go public or initiate legal action unless he changed his behavior.

Steve Hutensky, one of Miramax’s entertainment lawyers, was dispatched to London to negotiate a settlement with Ms. Perkins and her lawyer. He declined to comment for this article.

Ms. Perkins, now a theater producer in London, also declined to comment for this article, saying that she could not discuss her work at Miramax or whether she had entered into any agreements.

Months after the settlement, Mr. Weinstein triumphed at the Oscars, with “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare in Love” winning 10 awards. A few years later, Mr. Weinstein, who had produced a series of British-themed movies, was made a Commander of the British Empire, an honorary title just short of knighthood.

‘Coercive Bargaining’

For actors, a meeting with Mr. Weinstein could yield dazzling rewards: scripts, parts, award campaigns, magazine coverage, influence on lucrative endorsement deals. He knew how to blast small films to box office success, and deliver polished dramas like “The King’s Speech” and popular attractions like the “Scary Movie” franchise. Mr. Weinstein’s films helped define femininity, sex and romance, from Catherine Zeta-Jones in “Chicago” to Jennifer Lawrence in “Silver Linings Playbook.”

But movies were also his private leverage. When Mr. Weinstein invited Ms. Judd to breakfast in Beverly Hills, she had been shooting the thriller “Kiss the Girls” all night, but the meeting seemed too important to miss. After arriving at the hotel lobby, she was surprised to learn that they would be talking in his suite; she decided to order cereal, she said, so the food would come quickly and she could leave.

Mr. Weinstein soon issued invitation after invitation, she said. Could he give her a massage? When she refused, he suggested a shoulder rub. She rejected that too, she recalled. He steered her toward a closet, asking her to help pick out his clothing for the day, and then toward the bathroom. Would she watch him take a shower? she remembered him saying.

“I said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,” Ms. Judd said. “It was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.”

To get out of the room, she said, she quipped that if Mr. Weinstein wanted to touch her, she would first have to win an Oscar in one of his movies. She recalled feeling “panicky, trapped,” she said in the interview. “There’s a lot on the line, the cachet that came with Miramax.”

Not long afterward, she related what had happened to her mother, the singer Naomi Judd, who confirmed their conversation to a Times reporter. Years later, Ashley Judd appeared in two Weinstein films without incident, she said. In 2015, she shared an account of the episode in the hotel room with “Variety” without naming the man involved.

In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a previously undisclosed settlement with Rose McGowan, then a 23-year-old-actress, after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. The $100,000 settlement was “not to be construed as an admission” by Mr. Weinstein, but intended to “avoid litigation and buy peace,” according to the legal document, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. McGowan had just appeared in the slasher film “Scream” and would later star in the television show “Charmed.” She declined to comment.

Increased Scrutiny

Just months before Ms. O’Connor wrote her memo, a young female employee quit after complaining of being forced to arrange what she believed to be assignations for Mr. Weinstein, according to two people familiar with her departure. The woman, who asked not to be identified to protect her privacy, said a nondisclosure agreement prevented her from commenting.

Soon, complaints about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior prompted the board of his company to take notice.

In March 2015, Mr. Weinstein had invited Ambra Battilana, an Italian model and aspiring actress, to his TriBeCa office on a Friday evening to discuss her career. Within hours, she called the police. Ms. Battilana told them that Mr. Weinstein had grabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt, the police report says.

The claims were taken up by the New York Police Department’s Special Victims Squad and splashed across the pages of tabloids, along with reports that the woman had worked with investigators to secretly record a confession from Mr. Weinstein. The Manhattan district attorney’s office later declined to bring charges.

But Mr. Weinstein made a payment to Ms. Battilana, according to people familiar with the settlement, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the confidential agreement.

The public nature of the episode concerned some executives and board members of the Weinstein Company. (Harvey and Bob Weinstein together own 42 percent of the privately held business.) When several board members pressed Mr. Weinstein about it, he insisted that the woman had set him up, colleagues recalled.

Ms. Battilana had testified in court proceedings against associates of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy who are accused of procuring women for alleged sex parties, and the Italian news media also reported that, years ago Ms. Battilana accused a septuagenarian boyfriend of sexual harassment, a complaint that was apparently dismissed. Ms. Battilana did not respond to requests for comment. Her lawyer, Mauro Rufini, could not be reached for comment.

After the episode, Lance Maerov, a board member, said he successfully pushed for a code of behavior for the company that included detailed language about sexual harassment.

Then Ms. O’Connor’s memo hit, with page after page of detailed accusations. In describing the experiences of women at the company, including her own, she wrote, “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”

She was a valued employee — Mr. Weinstein described her as “fantastic,” “a great person,” “a brilliant executive” — so the complaint rattled top executives, including Bob Weinstein. When the board was notified of it by email, Mr. Maerov insisted that an outside lawyer determine whether the allegations were true, he said in an interview.

But the inquiry never happened. Mr. Weinstein had reached a settlement with Ms. O’Connor, and there was no longer anything to investigate.

“Because this matter has been resolved and no further action is required, I withdraw my complaint,” Ms. O’Connor wrote in an email to the head of human resources six days after sending her memo. She also wrote a letter to Mr. Weinstein thanking him for the opportunity to learn about the entertainment industry.",Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I have been writing about North Korea since 1992, when President George H. W. Bush’s administration held the United States’ first meeting with Pyongyang since the Korean War to discuss what was then an incipient nuclear program. I had long wanted to visit. What made it possible now is that North Korea, the world’s least transparent country, has decided to embark on a charm offensive, inviting major American news organizations on separate visits this year to learn more about its economic and political goals.

Our trip has not been without some risk, given the way the American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in Pyongyang after allegedly trying to steal a poster, fell into a coma under circumstances that remain mysterious and died days after being returned to the United States. While I and the other Times journalists were invited by the Foreign Ministry (The Times paid all expenses), the diplomats don’t control the security services, and our attempts to report have been a balance between trying to get the most authentic information we can (a struggle) and not running afoul of security. Two government minders accompanied us except when we were in our rooms.

We were allowed to visit a silk factory, the science and technology complex (computers are connected to an internal intranet, not the internet), an elite high school and an anti-American war museum, as well as an amusement park, restaurants and a dolphinarium — evidence of Kim Jong-un’s efforts to allow citizens of Pyongyang, where the elite live, opportunities for fun. Our requests to see the three remaining American detainees were refused. Despite such controls, there have been some moments of spontaneous humanity. After dinner one night, a senior official led me briefly in ballroom dancing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant.

I most wanted to learn whether the North Koreans were open to nuclear talks with the United States and what it might take to get a deal. In the 1990s, the two sides reached an agreement that froze the North’s plutonium program for eight years and made progress on missile limits. But these initiatives fell apart in the George W. Bush administration, and today North Korea has at least 20 nuclear weapons and missiles that may soon be able to reach the continental United States, a level of technological prowess that Mr. Trump has said he won’t tolerate.

In Mr. Choe’s telling, North Korea was driven to become a nuclear power in self-defense against America’s “nuclear blackmail,” sanctions, history of confrontation, and affront to the sovereignty and dignity of the state. The North must establish “a balance of power” to hold Washington at bay, finally replace the Korean War armistice with a permanent peace treaty and focus attention on economic development, he said. Therein seemed to be the answer to my question of whether and under what circumstances the North would be open to talks. Only when Washington makes a “bold decision” to end its military exercises with South Korea, halt sanctions and cease moves that diplomatically isolate North Korea can a dialogue between the two countries bear fruit, he added.

Our interviews have persuaded me that it is also imperative for Washington to ease up on the rhetoric. Mr. Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month crossed a line for many North Koreans because it made the fight deeply personal, disparaging Mr. Kim as “rocket man” and threatening to “totally destroy North Korea,” a country of 26 million people.

The Trump administration insists there can be no talks until the North halts missile and nuclear tests for an unspecified period. Hence, stalemate, and a dangerous one. Allowing the shouting match and muscle-flexing on both sides to gather momentum can come to no good.",Seeing the North Korean Stalemate From the Other Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/north-korea-stalemate.html

Read the latest on the Las Vegas shooting with Friday’s live updates.

The night began as a celebration. Thousands gathered in Las Vegas for one last night of song at a long-awaited country music festival. They had driven in from towns all over California. They had flown in from Alaska, Tennessee, West Virginia. They were teachers, police officers, secretaries, retirees.

Many had planned for weeks, even months, this weekend of relaxation. Some came with elaborate plans amid the music: a reunion with old friends, a wedding anniversary, even a marriage proposal.

Then came gunfire — sudden and rapid and seemingly endless. When it was over, 58 people had been killed and hundreds more injured, making the attack at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history.

The victims included 36 women and 22 men. The oldest was 67, the youngest 20. Here are their stories.

Hannah Ahlers

Hannah Ahlers, 34 and a mother of three, grew up listening to country music and was a huge fan. She went to the concert on Sunday with her husband, Brian Ahlers, whom she had met in high school. They had been married 17 years, and lived in Beaumont, Calif.

Her brother, Lance Miller, confirmed Ms. Ahlers’s death. Her family described her as having “loved life and people.”

“She was our sunshine,” they said in a statement.

She was a homemaker, an active member in her children’s schools and community, and was very involved with extracurricular activities, including her daughter’s volleyball team.

“She wasn’t too good for anybody,” Mr. Ahlers said. “Beautiful, inside and out.”

Heather Alvarado

Heather Alvarado, a wife and mother of three from Utah, had traveled with her family to attend the concert in Las Vegas.

“It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Heather Warino Alvarado, wife of Cedar City firefighter Albert Alvarado,” Sgt. Jerry Womack, a spokesman for the police department in Cedar City, Utah, said in a statement.

A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ms. Alvarado’s family described the 35-year-old as a wife, mother, sister, friend and “so much more.” She was “always the first to help out,” the page said, and “anyone she comes across she makes them feel like family.”

Dorene Anderson

Dorene Anderson, 49, of Anchorage loved ice hockey.

Or at least she loved the Alaska Aces, a minor league team whose fans were known for ringing cowbells painted with the Aces insignia to show their support during games.

“Dorene was our treasurer of the cowbell crew this past year and a wonderful, generous person who was a friend to many,” wrote Marie English, a fellow fan, on the fan club’s Facebook page.

She was also “the most amazing wife, mother and person this world ever had,” her husband, John Anderson, wrote in a statement issued by his employer, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation.

He and his family members, Mr. Anderson wrote, are grieving.

So are Aces fans, who are holding a candlelight vigil for Ms. Anderson on Tuesday at the Sullivan Arena, where the Aces (who are moving to Maine) have played. “We ask you wear an Aces jersey, cowbell crew shirt, or anything cowboys-related,” read a post on the fan page. “Bring your cowbell.”

Carrie Barnette

With a small inheritance from her grandparents, whom she had helped care for during long illnesses, Carrie Barnette, 34, last year bought a home in Riverside, Calif. It was a personal milestone for the Disney food service employee.

A music festival aficionado of sorts, she had posted video of parts of this country music concert to Facebook, and noted that she was having more fun in Las Vegas than she had at Stagecoach, a California festival.

“That was Carrie,” a cousin, Janice Chambers, said. “She just liked to go out and do things.”

“We mourn a wonderful member of the Disney family: Carrie Barnette,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert Iger, said on Twitter on Monday night.

Ms. Barnette worked as a cook at the Pacific Wharf Cafe, a waterfront restaurant at a Disney park in Anaheim, and was the proud owner of a basset hound, Lucy.

“O.K. everybody I just entered Lucy in this,” she posted on Facebook last month, of a calendar contest to raise money for a local animal shelter. “I really hope she can win and make the cover.”

Jack Beaton

In the last photo that Jack Beaton posted on his Facebook page on Sunday evening, his companions can be seen lounging on the grass, holding beers and smiling at the camera, lights from the country music festival twinkling in the background.

“Day Three Route 91 Vegas!” he wrote in the caption.

Hours later, Mr. Beaton, of Bakersfield, Calif., was killed while shielding his wife, Laurie, from gunfire, his family said.

His father-in-law, Jerry Cook, told BakersfieldNow.com that Mr. Beaton had covered his wife’s body with his own, and was shot. “He told her he loved her,” he said. “Laurie could tell he was slipping. She told him she loved him and she would see him in heaven.”

Mr. Beaton, 54, was gregarious and always helping other people; a family man who adored driving his truck with his hat on sideways, Mr. Cook said.

Mr. Beaton’s son, Jake, paid tribute to his father on Facebook. “Lost my best friend,” he wrote. “I love you so much more than you could ever imagine. Please watch over our family. You will forever be remembered as our hero!”

Steve Berger

Whatever Steve Berger did, he always seemed to be at the top of his game.

He was an all-star high school basketball player in Wauwatosa, Wis., his father, Richard Berger, told MPR News, and went on to play for St. Olaf College in Minnesota. In 2007, his friend Josh Decker brought him to EFS Advisors, a company in Cambridge, Minn., where he would spend the last 10 years and earn accolades from Mpls.St.Paul Magazine and Twin Cities Business.

As a financial adviser, “Steve was able to touch thousands of lives, enhancing the ability of his clients to retire earlier and/or in a better financial position,” the company said in a statement.

Mr. Berger had three children, between the ages 8 and 15, and was in Las Vegas to celebrate his 44th birthday. The week before, he and his father had spoken about his bet on the Wisconsin-Northwestern football game, his father told The Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“I said, ‘Steve, be careful,’” his father recalled.

Candice Bowers

On Sunday night, Candice Bowers, 40, was taking a rare weekend away from her home and responsibilities in Orange County, Calif., listening to music with a friend at the Jason Aldean concert.

When the gunfire began, Ms. Bowers and her friend dove under a table, then became separated in the chaos, her grandmother, Patricia Zacker, told The Orange County Register. Ms. Bowers leaves behind three children and a large extended family, relatives said.

“Candice left this world doing what she loved, dancing to country music among loved ones,” a GoFundMe page begun for her children said. “She will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.”

Denise Salmon Burditus

Photo

Whenever Tony Burditus was away from Denise Salmon Burditus, his wife of 32 years, she sent him selfies, nearly always featuring one of her big, broad smiles.

“I can’t say enough — her smile,” Mr. Burditus, of Martinsburg, W.Va., said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “If I was out of town or something I would get a selfie, on her way to the gym, or on her way to school. I would get a huge smile,” he said.

“If I didn’t get it, I would text her back and she would send me one back with a smile.”

That same smile beamed from a photo she and her husband took together in front of the music festival stage, not long before the shooting. She posted the photograph on Facebook.

As the shooting began, Mr. Burditus said the couple mistook the sound as pyrotechnics. “We stood there for a second and she asked me if it was gunfire and I told her, ‘No.’ And then it was during the second burst that we knew,” Mr. Burditus said. They tried to get away.

“I was leading her through the crowd,” he said. But she was shot, and Mr. Burditus said he “immediately knew her wound was fatal. She was unconscious from the time she was struck.” Ms. Burditus was 50.

Sandy Casey

Over the course of a carefree weekend in Las Vegas, they kept bumping into one another around the festival: at least a half dozen teachers, principals and school psychologists who worked for the Manhattan Beach School District in Southern California, taking a brief escape from their responsibilities to listen to live music.

The school district said on Monday that Sandy Casey, 34, a special-education teacher originally from Vermont, was killed in the shooting. The other staff members from the district were physically unharmed.

Ms. Casey taught middle school and had worked for the district for nine years, an energetic person who delighted in her students, the superintendent, Mike Matthews, said.

“She was a person who brings light wherever she is,” he said. “She has a classroom full of light and hope and caring.”

Ms. Casey’s fiancé, Chris Willemse, an instructional assistant for the district, was with Ms. Casey in Las Vegas. He wrote on Facebook: “As I sit and mourn such a beautiful life gone too fast, all I can say is look up and watch the birds fly high and free today, as that’s where I feel you smiling down upon all of us. I love you baby girl! Love you to pieces!”

Andrea Castilla

It seemed like the Route 91 Harvest Festival would be the perfect place for Andrea Castilla, a sales associate at Sephora in Huntington Beach, Calif., to celebrate her 28th birthday. Her sister, Athena, would be there with her fiancé, and Andrea and her boyfriend, Derek Miller, decided to join them.

And there was to be a surprise, according to People.com: Mr. Miller had been planning to propose.

He never had the chance. Ms. Castilla was killed in the attack, according to a text message from her aunt, Marina Castilla Parker, who posted photos to Facebook of Ms. Castilla beaming at the festival with her sister and their partners.

In an interview with People, Athena Castilla said she and her fiancé tried to keep Ms. Castilla from being stepped on after she fell. Athena said that strangers had helped put Andrea into the back of a truck for the drive to the hospital.

“I was holding onto her head and trying to keep her from losing so much blood, talking to her, kissing her, telling her she was going to make it,” Athena Castilla said. “We all did our best to help her get through it. We did the best we could.”

Denise Cohen

Denise Cohen was never bored, or boring. Ms. Cohen, 58, was the “life of the party,” her younger sister, Kristal Vogel, said: “the first one to be out and the last one to go to bed.”

She loved to be outdoors, whether on a beach or at a festival like Route 91, which she attended with her boyfriend, Derrick Taylor, who also died. She was particularly excited to see Jason Aldean, whom Ms. Vogel had seen live a few days before. “‘I can’t wait to see Jason Aldean’ — that’s all I heard all weekend,” Ms. Vogel said.

Ms. Cohen had two sons, both in their 30s, and lived in Carpinteria, Calif., near Santa Barbara. She had recently started working for Team HOA, a division of McFarland Financial that focused on homeowner association accounting.

Austin Davis

Austin Davis, 29, a pipe fitter from Riverside, Calif., made the trip to Las Vegas with Thomas Day Jr., a softball buddy who also died.

The two played “fast-pitch softball” together, Berta Garcia, the coed director for USA Softball of Southern California, told The Riverside Press-Enterprise. “Tom kind of guided him.”

A member of the United Association, the union representing pipe fitters, Mr. Davis “had a swing like no other,” another softball friend said.

After the shooting, Mr. Davis’ girlfriend, Aubree Hennigan, had posted urgent pleas for help on social media as she and his parents sought news of his whereabouts. Before receiving confirmation of his death, she wrote on Facebook: “My everything … Please come home to us.”

A “Homerun Derby” was being planned, in honor of Mr. Davis and Mr. Day. “I will be there for my man and I would love to see everyone,” Ms. Hennigan wrote.

Thomas Day Jr.

Thomas Day Jr., 54, was a contractor who worked in a branch of his father’s home-building business in Corona, Calif. He had traveled to Las Vegas to attend the concert with three of his grown children and a group of friends.

His father, Thomas Day Sr., said he received a call from his grandson late on Sunday: The three adult children and the friends were in hiding, the grandson said, but Mr. Day had been shot in the head.

The elder Mr. Day, who lives in Las Vegas, said his son, who was divorced, was a “great dad” who often attended concerts with his children.

He had not been able to see the body or bury his son. “They still have him,” he said.

Christiana Duarte

Christiana Duarte, 22, had a gorgeous singing voice. And she was much like her parents, a family friend, Danette Meyers, said. “She was very giving,” Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte had gone to the country music festival with her brother’s girlfriend, Ariel Romero. Both women were shot, Ms. Meyers said. Ms. Romero had been through surgery and was expected to recover, Ms. Meyers said.

Ms. Duarte’s father, Michael, is a longtime employee of the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office, where he has regularly consoled the victims of crimes and their families, she said. Now his own family was wrestling with loss.

“I can’t tell you how this has hit all of us,” Ms. Meyers said. “This is just unbelievable. This senseless, violent act is just killing us all.”

After the first round of shots, Stacee Etcheber’s husband, Vincent, told her to run, he told family members. An off-duty officer with the San Francisco Police Department, he stayed behind to try to help.

Then the second round came.

Mr. Etcheber’s father, Jean, who was babysitting the couple’s two children, 10 and 12, at their Novato, Calif., home, said the family was given confirmation of Ms. Etcheber’s death on Monday night.

Ms. Etcheber, 50, was a hairdresser whose Facebook profile picture shows her working on her beach handstand next to her daughter.

“Please pray for our family during this difficult time,” Ms. Etcheber’s brother-in-law, Al Etcheber, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday morning.

Brian Fraser

Brian Fraser, 39, was in his element at the Jason Aldean concert on Sunday night, his family said. He had just moved closer to the stage in the hopes that his favorite song, “Dirt Road Anthem,” was coming soon.

Moments later, he was fatally shot. His companions — his wife, Stephanie, and other family members and friends — survived.

“A bigger-than-life man taken far too soon,” his sisters-in-law wrote on a GoFundMe page. “Brian was a rock of love and support to his family.”

A vice president of sales for Greenpath, a mortgage firm, Mr. Fraser lived in La Palma, Calif., and graduated from California Polytechnic State University.

“Brian Fraser impacted everyone who crossed his path with his infectious positive energy, his tenacious will to succeed, and his willingness to help others,” his employer said in a statement.

Keri Galvan

Keri Galvan, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., had three children, and they were her world. On her Instagram page, she called herself a “super tired super mama of 3.” On Facebook, she posted a photograph of herself standing next to a new Lexus S.U.V., and wrote: “New baby to accommodate allllllllll the babies.”

“They always went to Disneyland together,” Isaac Galvan, her father-in-law, said. “She was just a great mother.”

The children are 10, 4 and 2, according to a GoFundMe page set up by Ms. Galvan’s sister, Lindsey Poole.

Ms. Galvan, 31, who had worked for a decade as a server at Mastro’s Steakhouse in Thousand Oaks, attended the music festival in Las Vegas with her husband, Justin Galvan, and some of their friends.

“Her days started and ended with doing everything in her power to be a wonderful mother,” Ms. Poole said.

Dana Gardner

Dana Gardner, the deputy recorder of San Bernardino County, Calif., began working for the county 26 years ago as a document clerk, a county spokesman, David Wert, said in an email. Ms. Gardner, 52, was “known for her ‘can-do’ attitude and vibrant energy,” Bob Dutton, the county’s assessor, recorder and clerk, wrote on Facebook.

“Everybody here is still in shock,” Mr. Dutton told The San Bernardino Sun. “They’re waiting for her to walk through the door.”

In a Facebook message, Kayla Gardner, Dana Gardner’s daughter, said: “She spent our whole childhood making sacrifices and doing anything and everything she could for us.”

She added later, “As we got older and became adults, for the first time in her life she stopped worrying about taking care of us and started to take care of herself. She started traveling, spending time with her friends, and enjoying her life the way she wanted. As her children, it was so enjoyable to see her so vibrant and full of life, and that is how we will always remember her.”

Angela Gomez

Photo

When the daughter of Angela Gomez’s cheerleading coach died four years ago, Ms. Gomez was quick to appear at the coach’s door to offer her sympathies. In an interview with The Press-Enterprise, her coach from Riverside Polytechnic High School, Lupe Avila, recalled Ms. Gomez, 20, as “one of the most genuine and loyal people you could ever meet.”

Ms. Gomez, a nursing student from Riverside, Calif. who was known as Angie, was in Las Vegas with her boyfriend when the shooting began.

Rocio Guillen

Rocio Guillen and her fiancé, Christopher Jaksha, left their two children with Mr. Jaksha’s parents for some rare time alone: a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate a friend’s birthday.

Each night they were away, they made video calls to say good night, blowing kisses at Sophia, 17 months, and Austin, who was born in August, said Mr. Jaksha’s mother, Donna.

“We Facetimed all weekend,” Ms. Jaksha said. “We would say ‘Look, it’s mommy and daddy. Look at the cowboy hats.’”

Ms. Guillen, 40, was shot in the thigh as she ran from the shooting with Mr. Jaksha. She was placed in a police car, and an officer applied a tourniquet, but she did not survive.

The couple met when they worked at a Chili’s restaurant as managers. They shared a home in Eastvale, Calif., and both worked at California Pizza Kitchen restaurants nearby as they planned for their wedding. Ms. Guillen has two sons from a previous marriage, according to Ms. Jaksha. “I already considered her to be my daughter-in-law,” Ms. Jaksha said.

Charleston Hartfield

Photo

Charleston Hartfield, 34, an off-duty Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer, had written a book not long ago. “Memoirs of a Public Servant,” was published in July and focused on his day-to-day work, his time on the force and his interactions on the streets of Las Vegas.

“Every time you talked to him, your life would be better,” Stan King, a friend whose son played football on a team, the Henderson Cowboys, that Officer Hartfield had coached. “You wished you were 10 percent of what that guy was.”

Officer Hartfield, who had served on the police force for 11 years, was memorialized in a candlelight vigil attended by hundreds.

Fellow officers and friends remembered the man they called Charlie or Coach Chucky, or even, occasionally, “Captain America” as knowledgeable and experienced, a patriot and a wit.

“I know that none of us here really planned on saying goodbye to Charlie so soon, but I’m glad we get to send him off in our way, not somebody else’s way,” said Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association.

Chris Hazencomb

Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, Calif., had a modest birthday celebration with his mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, 69, last Wednesday. They ran errands, picked up fried chicken, and, as they did every Wednesday, watched an episode of “The Little Couple” that Mr. Hazencomb had recorded the previous day.

The mother and son had always lived together, and worked in tandem to care for Mr. Hazencomb’s father, who was ill for a decade before he died. Mr. Hazencomb had something to look forward to, as well: The Route 91 Harvest music festival, which he was attending with his best friend’s wife. (The best friend, it turned out, hated country music.)

Ms. Hazencomb got the news Sunday night. Mr. Hazencomb had been shot in the head. Ms. Hazencomb rushed to Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas, leaving Camarillo at 3 a.m. Mr. Hazencomb was on a ventilator, Ms. Hazencomb said, and officials told her he would not survive.

“He looked like he was sleeping,” Ms. Hazencomb said. Members of her extended family gathered in the hospital room. After getting last rites from the Catholic Church, he was taken off life support.

Ms. Hazencomb said her son had died shielding his best friend’s wife from bullets. “He’d give you the shirt off his back,” Ms. Hazencomb said.

Jennifer Irvine

Jennifer Irvine, 42, built her own legal practice in San Diego, specializing in family law. But there was also time for hobbies like snowboarding and Taekwondo — and for her friends and country music.

“She did go to a lot of concerts,” Jason Irvine, Jennifer’s brother, said, as he waited at the Las Vegas Convention Center to pick up her belongings.

Ms. Irvine had attended the festival in Las Vegas with a group of girlfriends, some of whom had posted pictures of their group, wearing jean shorts and cowboy boots, grinning in front of the festival banner.

“She was there with three other friends who were able to leave when it started, but unfortunately Jennifer was not one of those who was able to leave,” Mr. Irvine said.

Nicol Kimura

Nicol Kimura, 38, of Placentia, Calif., was part of a close-knit group of 16 friends who always spent time together, said Ryan Miller, one of the people in the group. To the children of those friends, Ms. Kimura was simply Auntie Nicol, he said — a playmate who was eager to host tea parties, color with them and craft.

“Just a beaming light,” Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview.

Seven of the friends went to the concert in Las Vegas; they had already been to several other concerts this year, but they were especially excited to attend the weekend’s Route 91 Harvest Festival, Mr. Miller said.

The group of friends was together when shots first rang out, Mr. Miller said. Soon, everyone had hit the ground.

As the gunfire continued, another friend, about 20 feet away, yelled out that Ms. Kimura had been hurt; she was bleeding from her side.

“We couldn’t pull her to safety,” Mr. Miller said.

Jessica Klymchuk

Jessica Klymchuk, 34, from the province of Alberta in Canada, had been visiting Las Vegas with her boyfriend, The Globe and Mail reported. She was a school librarian, a bus driver and the mother of four children.

Carly Kreibaum

Late Sunday afternoon, Carly Kreibaum’s Facebook page showed the smiling proof of a girls’ weekend in full swing: a picture of Ms. Kreibaum with two friends at the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas — a cafe, canal and gondolas in the background.

At the concert that evening, Ms. Kreibaum, 33, a mother of two from Sutherland, Iowa, was fatally shot, a family member said. Her friends survived.

Back in northwest Iowa, her small community of 600 has been in mourning for Ms. Kreibaum, who studied art education at Wayne State College in Nebraska and worked at Walmart.

She lived with her husband, Chris, and their children, Dalten and Cambri, on a farm just outside town, according to The Des Moines Register.

On Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Kreibaum thanked family and friends for their support, saying he was en route to Las Vegas. A local church set up a fund for donations for the Kreibaum family, and on Wednesday evening, it opened up the church, inviting those who wanted to talk, pray or deal with their grief.

Rhonda LeRocque

When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Rhonda LeRocque flew down with other members of her church to help the victims.

At home in Tewksbury, Mass., her sister told The Boston Globe, she showed the same kindness and devotion to her husband, Jason, and their 6-year-old daughter. The three were together at the Route 91 festival when the shooting began.

Ms. LeRocque, 42, was active in her local Jehovah’s Witnesses church and worked for the design company IDEO, which confirmed her death in a Facebook post.

“For more than 10 years she cared for her work family at IDEO Cambridge with the same warmth, love and devotion she showed everyone in her life,” the company wrote. “Nobody helped us build community quite like Rhonda.”

Victor Link

When Victor Link, of Orange County, Calif., was struck by gunfire, he had his own rescue crew right beside him.

“Rob, his best friend, who is a firefighter and a paramedic, picked my son up and carried him to a safer place and tried to resuscitate him,” Mr. Link’s father, Loyd, said on Tuesday. “But it didn’t happen.”

Mr. Link, 55, worked in the financial services industry and lived with his partner, Lynne Gonzales. He had a son, Christian, from a previous marriage, his father said.

“My son took a bullet to the chest,” he said.

Jordan McIldoon

Jordan McIldoon, 22, a mechanic from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, was among the dead, a family member said. His parents described him to CBC News in Canada as outdoorsy, about to begin trade school, and on the trip to Las Vegas with his girlfriend. They were expecting him to return home on Monday evening.

“We only had one child,” they told CBC News. “We just don’t know what to do.”

Kelsey Meadows

Photo

There were two Ms. Meadows who were well known in the halls of Taft Union High School in Taft, Calif.: Stacy, who has worked at the school for 35 years, and Kelsey, her daughter, a substitute teacher.

Kelsey Meadows, who was 28, was killed in the shooting, leaving behind her parents, brother and sister-in-law, “along with an entire community that loved and respected her,” the school said in a statement.

The younger Ms. Meadows graduated from Taft Union High School in 2007 and returned in 2012 to work there as a teacher — alongside her mother, who worked in information technology. “Kelsey was smart, compassionate and kind,” Mary Alice Finn, the principal, said in an email. “She had a sweet spirit and a love for children.”

Brad Meadows, her brother, informed friends of her death on Facebook “with an absolutely shattered heart,” he wrote.

Calla Medig

Photo

Calla Medig could not stop chattering to her co-workers at Moxie’s Grill and Bar, a restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta, where she was a bartender and server, about her upcoming trip to Las Vegas.

“I even gave her a hard time because I don’t like country music,” said her boss, Scott Collingwood. “I told her, ‘You’re going to be out there two-stepping. And she said, ‘There’s nothing wrong with two-stepping!’”

Ms. Medig, 28, was a warm and funny presence in the restaurant, where she had worked for two years.

She was so dependable and levelheaded that when Mr. Collingwood couldn’t reach her by phone, text or Facebook in the aftermath of the shooting on Sunday night, he immediately feared the worst.

“Calla is super responsible,” he said. “I just knew.”

Ms. Medig was scheduled to fly back home on Wednesday. Thursday was important to her. It was to have been her first day at the restaurant after being promoted to manager.

Sonny Melton

When Sonny Melton and his wife, Heather Gulish Melton, heard the sound of gunshots in Las Vegas on Sunday night, he grabbed her and began to run.

“I felt him get shot in the back,” Ms. Gulish Melton told WCYB, a television station in northeast Tennessee. “I want everyone to know what a kindhearted, loving man he was, but at this point, I can barely breathe.”

Mr. Melton, 29, was described in Facebook tributes as a kind spirit, a registered nurse who worked for much of 2016 in the surgical unit at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital in Jackson, Tenn.

“He was a very kind, compassionate, genuine person who lived life to the fullest, and he took great care of our patients,” said Amy Garner, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Union University, a college in Jackson, Tenn., said Mr. Melton was a 2015 graduate of the school and worked in the emergency department at Henry County Medical Center.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Melton and his wife had been married only a year and had traveled from Tennessee for the music festival.

“When the bullets began raining down from above, Sonny shielded her from danger, selflessly giving up his life to save hers,” Ms. Sanders said on Monday.

Pati Mestas

Photo

Not long before the shooting began, Pati Mestas posted a video on Facebook. It showed her jumping up and down in front of the stage at the Route 91 festival, having made her way up to the front of the crowd.

“That was the type of person she was,” her cousin Tom Smith said. “If you could do it and if it wasn’t wrong, she would do it.”

Ms. Mestas, 67, was partly retired from her job as a deli manager at a Shell convenience store in Corona, Calif., and was spending all the time she could with her three children, eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild, Mr. Smith said. He saw her in March, he recalled, and she had never seemed so happy.

“When she did something, she did it 100 percent,” Mr. Smith said. “She was faithful to her family, to her friends, a very strong Christian, and she couldn’t get enough out of life.”

Austin Meyer

Austin Meyer, 24, hoped to own an auto repair shop, his sister, Veronica Meyer, told KSBW, a television news station in Monterey, Calif.

Mr. Meyer had recently moved from his home near Monterey to Reno, Nev. to earn a degree in transportation technologies at Truckee Meadows Community College.

He was a fan of Bobby Bones and the Raging Idiots, one of the acts performing at the Route 91 festival, which he attended with his fiancée, Dana Getreu.

“He was a wonderful young man and my future son-in-law,” Ms. Getreu’s father, Gary Getreu, said in a statement released by the college. “The loss and grief his family and mine feel at this time is beyond belief.”

Adrian Murfitt

Photo

Adrian Murfitt, 35, had been working 16-hour days all summer as a commercial salmon fisherman in his home state of Alaska. It was time for a break.

He gathered up two of his childhood friends and booked tickets for a country music festival, just as he had done last year, according to his sister, Shannon Gothard.

“He had such a great time when he went before, and he wanted to treat himself for a successful fishing season,” Ms. Gothard said from Anchorage.

Mr. Murfitt was an Alaskan to the core. Since he was a toddler, he loved playing hockey, she said; he could fix almost anything mechanical; he was devoted to his dog, Paxson, a Western Siberian Laika.

Ms. Gothard said the family had pieced together her brother’s last minutes from Brian MacKinnon, a friend who was with him at the concert on Sunday night. “He was just having a good time, enjoying himself and got shot in the neck,” she said of her brother. A woman standing next to Mr. Murfitt was shot in the head, Mr. MacKinnon told the family. He watched as medics tried to resuscitate Mr. Murfitt, though the medics told Mr. MacKinnon to leave the scene for his own safety.

“Sadly, he died in my arms,” Mr. MacKinnon wrote on Facebook. “I don’t really know what else to say at this time. I’m really sorry.”

Rachael Parker

Rachael Parker, a police records technician from Manhattan Beach, Calif., was off duty when she was shot. She died in the hospital, the Manhattan Beach Police Department confirmed in a statement.

She was 33 and had worked at the department for 10 years.

Jennifer Parks

Photo

As children growing up in California, they were always together, so close that their names seemed to run together into one: Jenny-and-Bobby.

“She said, ‘I am going to marry Bobby,’” said Jennifer Parks’s aunt, Rhonda Boyle. “I guess she always had a little crush on him.”

They became high school sweethearts and later married. And they were together on Sunday night in Las Vegas, when Ms. Parks, 36, was fatally shot while attending the concert with her husband, Bobby Parks. Mr. Parks was wounded in the arm and a finger, her family said.

The Westside Union School District, where she worked, said Ms. Parks “will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning and to taking on whatever new projects came her way.”

Ms. Parks was a mother of two, a kindergarten teacher and a volleyball coach in Lancaster, Calif.

“She had a heart of gold,” Ms. Boyle said.

Carrie Parsons

Carrie Parsons, 31, a manager at the Seattle office of the employment firm Ajilon, was on a “girls trip” to the festival, a friend, Laura Cooper, told KOMO, a local television news station.

Ms. Parsons had posted photographs on social media and wrote “Night made,” after the performance of Eric Church, her favorite country music artist, KOMO reported.

Lisa Patterson

Photo

Lisa Patterson was determined that her three children, now 19, 17 and 8, would grow up to be fearless.

She pushed them to take part in school plays so that they would be confident taking risks. She drove them to softball practice so that they would learn teamwork. She made sure they performed community service, while juggling her own volunteer work and helping to run her husband’s small hardwood flooring business, without the aid of a housekeeper or nanny.

The trip to Las Vegas, with a group of mom friends from her church, was a departure for Ms. Patterson, 46, of Lomita, Calif., who was typically too occupied to take time out for herself. But her love of all types of music was well known to her friends and family, who would often be induced to sing with her in the car, loud enough to provoke looks from others sitting in traffic nearby.

The children, said her close friend, Deborah Beckman, learned to simply smile back.

“She has brought them up to really stand on their two feet,” Ms. Beckman said. “And I thank God because I think that will help them to be able to deal with it.”

John Phippen

Photo

When the gunfire began on Sunday night, John Phippen, and his son, Travis, followed the same urgent instinct: to try to save people.

John Phippen, 56, who ran a home remodeling company in Santa Clarita, Calif., and Travis, 24, an emergency medical technician, covered the bodies of strangers with their own. They crawled toward the wounded and used belts as tourniquets to try to stop their bleeding, his son said in a local television news interview.

Then John Phippen was shot.

“I got over there as fast as I could and I put my arm around him,” Travis Phippen said.

With the help of a bystander, they got John Phippen away from the area, but he did not survive.

“He told me that he loved me and he wanted everybody to know how much he loved them,” the younger Mr. Phippen said.

Melissa Ramirez

Photo

Melissa Ramirez, 26, grew up in California’s Antelope Valley amid a big and close-knit extended family that she often visited on weekends when she attended college, at California State University, Bakersfield.

Her love of country music drew her to the festival in Las Vegas, her cousin, Fabiola Farnetti, said on Tuesday. When the two were in high school, they spent summers working alongside Ms. Ramirez’s parents selling fruit and vegetables for a local farm company at flea markets in the area.

The daughter of Mexican immigrants who became United States citizens, Ms. Ramirez majored in business and had recently received a promotion at the car insurance company where she worked, her cousin said.

“She always helped her parents, and just wanted to be there,” Ms. Farnetti said.

The family had held out hope that she had survived the shooting, but her father identified her remains at the Las Vegas morgue early on Tuesday.

On her Instagram account, she posted photographs of her dog, a boxer, her young niece and, most recently, from her trip to Las Vegas.

Jordyn Rivera

Jordyn Rivera, 21, a health care management student at California State University, San Bernardino, spent part of last summer in London for the school’s study abroad program.

“We will remember and treasure her for her warmth, optimism, energy and kindness,” the university’s president, Tomas Morales, wrote in an email on Tuesday to employees and students.

A member of the health education honor society, Eta Sigma Gamma, Ms. Rivera was “a total sweetheart with piercing eyes & a beautiful smile,” a fellow student, Natasha Lavera, wrote on Facebook.

Ms. Rivera, of La Verne, Calif., had traveled to the concert with her mother, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

She would have graduated next year.

Quinton Robbins

An aunt of Quinton Robbins, 20, who worked as a recreation assistant for the city of Henderson, Nev., wrote on Facebook that her nephew was among the dead.

“I can’t say enough good about this sweet soul,” the aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, wrote of Mr. Robbins. “Everyone who met him loved him. His contagious laugh and smile.”

Outside of his job with the city of Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, Mr. Robbins coached flag football for 5-year-olds, his brother’s flag football team and softball teams. He also coached basketball along with his uncle at a high school, and was finishing certification to be a full-time coach for the Clark County School District.

Mr. Robbins had been thrilled to score tickets to the music festival. “He was a big country music fan and he and his girlfriend were excited to go,” said James DiNicola, Mr. Robbins’s friend and colleague at the Henderson recreational department. “It was a last-minute thing.”

Cameron Robinson

Photo

Cameron Robinson, 28, had taken Monday off from his job as a management analyst for the city of Las Vegas to attend the country music festival with his boyfriend, Bobby Eardley.

The creator of a smartphone app that eased navigation for attendees of the city government’s annual conferences, Mr. Robinson was a frequent volunteer at city events, and had been given a promotion last summer, according to Brad Jerbic, the city attorney for Las Vegas and a family friend.

“He was driven, but not so driven that he didn’t know how to enjoy life,” Mr. Jerbic said.

Mr. Robinson was shot in the neck, Mr. Jerbic said. He died shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday night, in Mr. Eardley’s arms.

Tara Roe Smith

Tara Roe Smith, 34, of Alberta, an educational assistant, was separated from her husband during the attack, according to The Edmonton Journal.

“Tara was an aide in my granddaughter’s preschool class,” wrote Viola Anderson, a resident of Okotoks, where Ms. Roe Smith lived, on a GoFundMe page set up by a friend. “She will be missed.”

The mother of two young sons, she grew up in Manitoba, where the community is “heartbroken,” a family friend told CTV Manitoba.

“It is with sadness, shock, and grief that we confirm the loss of a Foothills School Division staff member,” John Bailey, superintendent of the school district where Ms. Roe Smith worked, wrote in a statement posted on the district’s website. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected by this unimaginable attack.”

Lisa Romero-Muniz

Photo

Last year, Lisa Romero-Muniz’s husband, Chris, forgot their wedding anniversary. This year he was determined to make it up to her.

So he made a grand gesture, planning a four-day weekend in Las Vegas and buying tickets to see her favorite country singer, Jason Aldean. Mr. Muniz, who worked long hours at a refinery, and Ms. Romero-Muniz, 48 and a high school secretary in Gallup, N.M., left on Thursday for Las Vegas, more than a six-hour drive away.

“She was beyond excited,” said Rosie Fernandez, her friend and supervisor at the high school where they worked. “For her husband to remember her anniversary and do all of that, this was a big thing for her.”

Ms. Romero-Muniz’s death, confirmed by officials at the school where she worked, left her colleagues and community shaken, her co-workers said.

Born and raised in the small city of Gallup, she was a mother of three grown children and a secretary at Miyamura High School, where she was responsible for disciplining students who got into trouble. Ms. Romero-Muniz had a warm personality and a big laugh, always teasing her co-workers, Ms. Fernandez said.

“We were known as the two loudmouths of the office,” Ms. Fernandez said. “She knew 90 percent of the kids at this school. She would talk to them like she was talking to her own children. I’d hear her saying, ‘I know you can do better than this.’”

On Monday morning, administrators put up posters around the school so that students could write on them how they were feeling. A candlelight memorial is planned for Monday evening.

Christopher Roybal

Photo

Christopher Roybal went to the concert with his mother, Debby Allen, to celebrate his 29th birthday.

The two had become separated at the event, Ms. Allen told local television stations, and when the gunfire started, she ran but then tried to return to the festival grounds to look for him.

“I just kept saying, ‘My son, my son, where is my son?’” Ms. Allen said. “This guy wouldn’t let me go back in. He goes: ‘You have to run away from the gunfire, not towards the gunfire.’”

Mr. Roybal had recently moved to Denver from Colorado Springs, where he was the general manager at a Crunch gym, which announced his death on its Facebook page.

He was a Navy veteran who had served stints in Afghanistan. In a Facebook post in July, he had recalled the emotions of battle: “The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you’ve taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit.”

Brett Schwanbeck

Photo

Growing up in Arizona with five siblings, Brett Schwanbeck, 61, was a brother who loved to joke around and have fun. He had the most beautiful smile ever, his sister, Robin Martin, said. “He was very, very full of life,” she said.

Mr. Schwanbeck had gone to the Route 91 festival with his fiancée, Anna Orozco, who he had been planning to marry in January. Photographs of the couple on Facebook show them posing on the concert grounds, the gleaming Mandalay Bay resort in the background.

Mr. Schwanbeck, a retired truck driver who lived in Bullhead City, Ariz., had met Ms. Orozco in high school in Ash Fork. Their romance blossomed much later.

Ms. Martin said she tried to speak to her brother after the shooting while he was on life support in the hospital, hoping that he could hear her.

“Family meant everything to him,” she said.

Bailey Schweitzer

At Infinity Communications and Consulting, the Bakersfield, Calif., company where Bailey Schweitzer worked as a receptionist, Ms. Schweitzer “was always the ray of sunshine in our office on a cloudy day,” Fred Brakeman, the company’s president, said. “No one could possibly have a bad day when Bailey was around. If you have ever called or visited our office, she was the perky one that helped direct you to the staff member you needed.”

Before graduating, Ms. Schweitzer was a cheerleader at Centennial High School in Bakersfield and a frequent volunteer at the Bakersfield Speedway, which her family owned, The Bakersfield Californian reported. A co-worker, Katelynn Cleveland, told the newspaper that Ms. Schweitzer, 20, had been looking forward to the Route 91 music festival for weeks.

Laura Shipp

The staff at the Chili’s restaurant in Arroyo Market Square in Las Vegas knew it was Friday when Laura Shipp, 50, took her seat by the bar and ordered her favorites: Smoked wings and a Presidente Margarita.

“Like clockwork she would be there Friday night, first seat at the bar,” said Chris Atkinson, a manager at the restaurant, over a Facebook message.

The wings were not the only draw. Ms. Shipp’s son, Corey, 23, a marine reservist, was a bartender and server there, and she liked to be around him. She was so well-liked, Mr. Atkinson said, that he and Corey’s other friends took to calling her “Mama Shipp.” And Corey Shipp liked having her around.

“These two seemed like, even if they weren’t family, they would still be best friends,” Mr. Atkinson said.

Corey Shipp moved to Las Vegas first, and Laura Shipp followed. “Corey was her only and Laura was his only,” said Steve Shipp, 47, Ms. Shipp’s brother, who confirmed her death.

They loved the Dodgers and country music, which is what brought them to the festival. Corey Shipp was not harmed, but he could not find his mother despite a frantic search that involved many members of the Chili’s staff.

“It took about 28, to 30 hours, just even to figure out that she had passed,” Mr. Shipp, the brother, said.

Erick Silva

Photo

The security staff working at the Route 91 festival were the first to help, and Erick Silva, 21, of Las Vegas was one of them. Mr. Silva, who was assigned to a position near the front of the stage, began trying to help audience members escape over a barricade.

As he worked to usher others away, he was shot, and was later pronounced dead in the hospital, Jay Purves, the Nevada vice president of Mr. Silva’s employer, Contemporary Services Corp., said in an email.

Two other C.S.C. employees were also shot, but they survived, Mr. Purves said. “Watching the many video clips on YouTube and social media, you see our men and women in the yellow shirts jumping right into the middle of the chaos as it started to help those who were shot.”

Mr. Silva worked long hours on the job. “When he wasn’t helping me, he would always go where he was needed the most to help out in any way possible,” James Garrett, a co-worker, wrote in a Facebook tribute.

“He never complained about anything.”

The company will name one of its training centers after Mr. Silva, Mr. Purves said.

Susan Smith

Susan Smith, 53, was a lover of country music, a devoted mother to a son and daughter, a wife and a popular office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley, Calif.

“A wonderful person,” said her father, Tom Rementer, through tears.

She had gone to Las Vegas with friends. They survived the shooting.

A year ago, Brennan Stewart posted on Facebook a video of himself performing the country song “You Should Be Here.” It has gone viral in recent days. Grieving families and friends — and not just his — have seen it as a touchstone after the Route 91 shooting.

In his original post on Oct. 4, 2016, Mr. Stewart wrote that he had taken a “slower approach” to the song, written by the musician Cole Swindell in 2015 after the death of his father. “Thoughts on this one!?” Mr. Stewart asked.

“Solid performance. Rest in peace, Brennan,” read one of dozens of recent replie+s on the old thread.

A tribute to the love of country music that propelled Mr. Stewart, 30, of Las Vegas, and so many others to the music festival, the video has been shared over a thousand times.

“This is one of those moments that’s got your name written all over it,” Mr. Brennan sings. “You know that if I had just one wish, it’d be that you didn’t have to miss this.”

“You should be here.”

Derrick Taylor

A California corrections officer in charge of inmates who volunteer to fight forest fires, Derrick Taylor, 56, of Oxnard, Calif., had been stationed in the northern tip of the state last month, where a fire had been burning for weeks.

He made it home just in time to leave for the trip he had planned with his girlfriend, Denise Cohen, to attend the music festival in Las Vegas. The couple both died in the attack. In his job and in his personal relationships, Mr. Taylor, his younger son Kyle, 31, said, was kind, generous — and honest.

When he was in college, the younger Mr. Taylor recalled, his father sometimes called to make sure he was in class. He also insisted that his grandchildren leave video games behind while he escorted them to the park or on hikes. Friends the younger Mr. Taylor had not heard from since high school contacted him after hearing about his father’s death. They remembered him as a kind of “second dad.”

“He was someone who cares enough to hold you accountable,” Mr. Taylor said, “for who you could be and who you should be.”

Neysa Tonks

Neysa Tonks, 46 and a mother of three from Las Vegas, had brought “so much joy, fun and laughter” to her workplace, according to her employer, Technologent.

Her father, Chris Davis, told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that Ms. Tonks was a devoted parent to her sons, Kaden, Braxton and Greysen, and a generous member of her community, every year delivering hundreds of backpacks with supplies to people who needed them.

Michelle Vo

Michelle Vo was one of those people who didn’t waste time.

In the last few months, she was a whirlwind of new hobbies — paddle boarding, golf, even surfing, said a close friend, Casey Lubin. She had already been all over Europe and Southeast Asia. Next on her list was Iceland — she was determined to travel there by herself.

Ms. Vo and Ms. Lubin had met through a mutual friend. “He was like, ‘You have to meet this girl, the two of you are meant to be friends,’” Ms. Lubin said. “She’s like a shark. She’s a go-getter. She’s so inspiring.”

Ms. Vo, 32 and an insurance agent from Los Angeles, was by herself at the concert on Sunday when she befriended a stranger, Kody Robertson, of Ohio. Ms. Vo was standing next to Mr. Robertson when she was shot.

Kurt Von Tillow

Kurt Von Tillow, 55, was “the most patriotic person you’ve ever met,” his brother-in-law, Mark Carson, told KCRA, a local NBC News station for Cameron Park, Calif., the small town in the Sierra foothills near Sacramento where Mr. Von Tillow lived.

Mr. Von Tillow had traveled to Las Vegas for the concert with family members. His wife and daughter escaped unharmed, Mr. Carson said. Mr. Von Tillow’s sister was shot in the thigh and his niece in an ankle. Both were expected to recover.

Mr. Von Tillow’s wife told family members she was herded out of the area by the authorities amid the chaos of the shooting scene, Mr. Carson said. “That was probably the hardest part for her — having to leave him there,” he said.

On Monday, friends and family gathered at the Cameron Park Country Club, where Mr. Von Tillow was a member. At his home, family members set up a memorial with an American flag, and played the national anthem.

“Guarantee you, he’s covered in red, white and blue right now, with a Coors Light in his hand, smiling with his family and listening to some music,” Mr. Carson told the television station.

Bill Wolfe Jr.

Bill Wolfe Jr., a wrestling and Little League coach in Shippensburg, Pa., went to Las Vegas with his wife, Robyn, to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Only Robyn came home.

“It is with the most of broken hearts, the families of Bill Wolfe Jr. and his wife Robyn share that Bill has been confirmed to be among the deceased as a result of the mass attack in Las Vegas,” the Shippensburg Police Department said on Facebook. “Please continue to hold our entire family as well as those affected across the nation in your unending prayers.”

Mr. Wolfe, 42 and a coach at Shippensburg Greyhound Wrestling, was also an employee of the engineering consulting firm Dewberry and a former president of the Shippensburg Wrestling Booster Club.

“He was just a good guy,” the current president of the booster club, Cory Forrester, told Penn Live. “He was a go-to kind of guy, a guy you could depend on, a kind of guy you could be proud to be around.”",The Victims of Las Vegas: Remembering Their Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/vegas-victims-names.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Finally, a lieutenant came up to him and said, “Hey, your brother is O.K.”

“And I’m like, O.K., cool,” he said.

“And my stomach dropped and I’m like, ‘Oh my god.’”

On the whiteboard, under the names of the injured, he wrote his brother’s name.

How a pair of 33-year-old twins wound up in the midst of one of the worst mass shootings in American history is a reflection of the incomprehensible scale of the tragedy. All hands were on deck, and since policing is a family business, it was not surprising that both brothers would be called into action.

But the brothers’ roles could hardly have been more different. One brother carried out careful plans he helped devise. The other had little to guide him but instinct, duty and fear.

“I think about it now and it sounds stupid, but I’m just like, you know what, if I am going to die I want to be helping people,” Casey Clarkson said in an interview Thursday, the day after he met President Trump during his visit to Las Vegas. “You just want to do something. You feel helpless.”

On Friday, police officials said they were still at a loss to explain why the gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, had brought an arsenal of rifles up to his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, smashed out two windows and opened fire on the concert crowd, killing 58 and wounding nearly 500 before killing himself.

Local and federal officials sounded increasingly desperate for leads on Friday, announcing plans to erect billboards with the message, “If you know something, say something.”

The Clarkson brothers said they knew such an event could eventually happen. Every officer on the force has completed drills on worst-case scenarios, including gunfire coming from the towering casino resorts.

“The inevitable,” Casey Clarkson called it, but it was still surreal.

The twins’ mother, Brandi Lewis, was the first in the family to join the police department as an administrative manager, a civilian job she had for more than 20 years before recently retiring. As children, they loved hearing the stories their stepfather, Capt. Dave Lewis, brought home. Captain Lewis worked his way up the ranks and now runs the department’s crime lab.

As one of the top-ranked officers, Captain Lewis received a recorded call on Sunday night telling him of the active shooter. As he put on his uniform to head to the Mandalay Bay, he heard that two officers had been shot, and one in the neck, but not their names. (The other officer was shot in the arm and survived; additionally, an off-duty officer attending the concert was killed.)

The brothers are identical “mirror” twins — Casey, the older one by five minutes, is the more outgoing of the two, and left-handed; Branden, the more cerebral, is right-handed. As kids, their mother encouraged them to take up paintball, figuring it would offer them training they would need if they went into the military or law enforcement. They signed up for the police academy the moment they turned 21.

The brothers are often mistaken for one another, though because Casey spends much of his time lifting weights and Branden is recovering from back surgery, Casey is the beefier of the two now. He also is the only one with a bandage on his neck.

When he first heard the shots, he said, he asked his partner, Detective Tara Brosnahan: “What the hell was that?”

They walked down the street, and heard the shots again. “434,” Detective Brosnahan yelled into her police radio, using the official term for illegal gunfire. She was the first officer to alert the shooting.

Detective Clarkson started running along the perimeter of the concert area, larger than the size of two football fields. “It was all under attack,” he said.

He pushed fans down toward a waist-high brick wall. The bullets started falling toward his feet. He felt a couple whiz by.

With his pistol in his left hand — he does not recall unholstering it, saying it got there “like a magic trick” — he scurried behind a van, convinced a gunman could approach at any second. He did not know where the bullets were coming from, only that they kept coming.

As he stood over his partner, she told him: “Casey, you’re bleeding from the neck.”

Perhaps it was the adrenaline, but he felt nothing. “I kept thinking, how come I am not dead yet?” he said. There was work to do: “I figured I’d get light headed and would know I needed to stop then.”

The gunshots continued. Someone suggested escorting fans out two at a time. “No way,” Detective Clarkson said he replied. There were too many. People had to be ushered through fences five at a time.

There were bodies everywhere, and now people were looking at him, wondering if he was going to become one, too. His partner used her fingers to put pressure on the wound. They made their way to the concert’s medical tent, where a nurse told him the blood was not squirting out, but rather dribbling.

Somewhat relieved, the partners made their way to their police S.U.V., taking several other wounded people with them to the hospital. The injury, a wound about the size of a nickel, was sewn up with a few stitches. He said he still does not know if it came from a bullet or shrapnel.

At the command center, his brother tried to keep his mind off his twin by focusing on the momentous task at hand. “The command staff kept coming up to me and saying, ‘Hey Branden, are you OK, do you need to get out of here and go to the hospital?’” he said. “And I said, ‘Well, you know, my brother is O.K., there’s a lot of work to get done.”

Casey was soon released from the hospital, rejecting an offer of morphine so that he could be clear-minded and get back to the scene.

He went first to the command post. When he appeared, the place fell silent. The brothers hugged.

And then, Branden said, he told his twin: “I’m glad you’re O.K., but we’re really busy. I’m going to need you to check in with the staging area because you’ve got to get redeployed.”",‘My Stomach Dropped’: Harrowing Night for Twin Brothers of the Las Vegas Police,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/vegas-police-casey-clarkson.html

Ms. Kaur’s work reminds us that the ordinary business and experience of millennial minority women is not to be dismissed.","“Milk and Honey” has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 25 languages. Over the last two years, it has spent 77 weeks on The New York Times Trade Paperback Best-Seller List. Her second book, “The Sun and Her Flowers,” was released this week and is No. 2 on Amazon’s best-seller list.

But Instagram is really where she publishes. Some of Ms. Kaur’s poems are just a line, like “i think my body knew you would not stay.” It lends itself to parody. Her themes don’t vary too much: heartache hurts, love heals, women are strong, loving yourself is key to most things. Her work has been criticized as “disingenuous,” and it’s true that Ms. Kaur stays remarkably on brand.

Ms. Kaur too has been accused of writing about experiences that she hasn’t had herself. Asked about this, she shrugged. “It’s so complicated,” she said. It’s also not, historically, a requirement for poetry. Writing poems is how she processes the news and the world around her, she said, and for what she hasn’t lived, she tries to understand.

The underlying message of all this criticism is that Ms. Kaur’s work isn’t “real literature.” The literary world doesn’t have a great track record of embracing or even acknowledging artists like Ms. Kaur, who are different in some notable way, but who attract an enormous and fervent audience.

This dynamic has cropped up recently with the writers Lang Leav (with whom Ms. Kaur shares a publisher) and Tao Lin. Like a Kathy Acker or even a Patti Smith before them, these writers also weren’t seen as important, largely because of their too-youthful or too-female readership.

“Critics might think that Kaur’s readership is young and female, so her work can’t be serious, which is obviously wrong,” said Matthew Hart, a professor of English and comparative literature Columbia University. “Her style doesn’t seem naïve.”

Art by women and art intended for women can be derided as common, popular and unsophisticated.

Jane Austen, Dr. Hart said, was “one of the most important figures in allowing us to get over the idea that the ordinary business of ordinary young women’s lives can’t be the topic of important art.”

But Austen died 200 years ago. Ms. Kaur’s work reminds us that the ordinary business and experience of millennial minority women is not to be dismissed.

I spoke with dozens of Ms. Kaur’s fans and critics, most of them young women. Those who dislike her work agree with enthusiasts that she’s addressing weighty issues like violence, sexual assault and trauma in a way that is admirable.

“We’re best friends and we’ve been apart for two years, but we’d send each other her poems on Instagram when one of us was feeling down or lonely,” said Katharina Gadow, 28, who attended Ms. Kaur’s reading with a friend who had just moved to New York.

For Shannon Donnelly, 24, “Milk and Honey” was “sometimes difficult to read” because she has struggled with depression and anxiety. Ultimately, reading the book was like “working through my pains with a therapist,” she said.

Ms. Kaur has “hit the nail on the head in every single way,” said Tiffany Praimnath, 19. “Guyanese culture is reminiscent of Indian culture to me, especially how men treat women, and I think because Rupi’s of Indian ancestry, that really resonated.”

Many fans told me they share her poems with friends via Instagram or screen shots sent as texts, as encouragement or as a way to let Ms. Kaur’s work speak for them. Ms. Kaur becomes permission and voice both, a reminder and a vehicle that they have every right to speak, even when they are made to feel like they should be silent. Organizations including the National Eating Disorders Association, Moms Can Code, and Curvy Girls Scoliosis all broadcast Ms. Kaur’s work on social media as encouragement, solidarity or motivation.

Two chapters of her new book were written after Donald J. Trump’s inauguration. In them she tells the story of her family. Poems about her ancestors and her mother’s bravery in leaving Punjab read as thank-you notes.

“I wonder what it was like for my mom,” Ms. Kaur said. “How the hell did she pick up, move and do that all by herself?”

The gratitude she feels to her parents for working hard and giving her the opportunity to get an education will resonate with children of immigrants. It’s hard to ignore the power of such work in a moment when the White House pushes for mass deportations of people like Ms. Kaur’s family. Her father, Suchet Singh, arrived in Canada as a refugee in the early 1990s.

On Monday, when asked about Ms. Kaur’s work, her mother just smiled. Her father said that he also had no words to describe how proud he and his wife are of their daughter, but he did say: “She’s following her soul’s purpose.”

After stumbling upon Ms. Kaur’s work on Tumblr nearly three years ago, Rijoota Gupte, a fan of the writers Jhumpa Lahiri and Khaled Hosseini, couldn’t stop thinking about Ms. Kaur’s words.

“Rupi’s not like other writers, and that’s exactly why I like her,” she said. Her mother was beside her.

“She’s thought-provoking in a different way, and she opened my eyes to issues not normally talked about in Indian families — things like abuse, violence towards women, trauma,” Ms. Gupte said. “Her poems are important to South Asian women like me.

The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen.","When it came to guns, Mr. Michel said, “he was not a novice.”

The son of a bank robber and a secretary, Mr. Paddock grew up lower middle class in Southern California in the 1960s. From an early age, he focused on gaining complete control over his life and not having to rely on anyone. He cycled through a series of jobs he thought would make him rich, Eric Paddock said.

“He went to work for the I.R.S. because he thought that’s where the money was, but it turned out the money wasn’t there,” the younger Mr. Paddock said. “He went to the aerospace industry but the money wasn’t there either. He went to real estate and that’s where the money was.”

Stephen Paddock began buying and refurbishing properties in economically depressed areas around Los Angeles, teaching himself how to put in plumbing and install air-conditioning. By the late 1980s, “we had cash flow,” said Eric Paddock, who added that he had given his life savings to his older brother to invest and eventually became a partner in his company, because “that’s the kind of guy he was. I knew he would succeed.”

“He helped make my mother and I affluent enough to be retired in comfort,” he said.

With success came a rigidity and uncompromising attitude, along with two failed marriages, both short and childless. Stephen Paddock started gambling. Some who met him described him as arrogant, with a strong sense of superiority. People in his life bent to his will, even his mother and brother. He went out of his way for no one.

“He acted like everybody worked for him and that he was above others,” said John Weinreich, 48, a former executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, where he saw Mr. Paddock frequently from 2012 to 2014. When Mr. Paddock wanted food while he was gambling, he wanted it immediately and would order with more than one server if the meal did not arrive quickly enough.

Mr. Weinreich said he would get irritated and “uppity about it.”

Mr. Paddock was uncompromising but he was also smart.

“I would liken him to a chess player: very analytical and a numbers guy,” Mr. Weinreich said. “He seemed to be working at a higher level mentally than most people I run into in gambling.”

Mr. Paddock cherished his solitude, his brother said. In 2003, he got his pilot’s license after training in the Los Angeles area, eventually taking the extra step to get an instrument rating so that he could legally fly in cloudy conditions with limited visibility. He bought cookie-cutter houses in Texas and Nevada towns with small airports so that he could park his planes. He was utterly unremarkable.

“This guy paid on time every time and did not cause any problems at any time,” said Lt. Brian Parrish, the spokesman for the Police Department in Mesquite, Tex., where he rented a hangar for $285 a month from 2007 through 2009. He also stored planes at the small airport in Henderson, Nev., from 2002 to 2010, an airport spokesman said, though it is not clear he ever lived at the local addresses to which they had been registered.

Even in death, Mr. Paddock seemed to stay true to his ways. He remained in control, answerable to no one but himself. He was ensconced in a carpeted hotel suite. He was wearing gloves, as he often did to protect his sensitive skin. He shot himself before the police broke into his room. A piece of paper with numbers written on it lay on a table near his body.

“If Steve decided it was time for Steve to go, Steve got up and left,” Eric Paddock said. “He did what he wanted to do when he wanted to do it.”

The ‘Most Boring’ Son

Mr. Paddock was the oldest, and least angry, of four boys growing up in the 1950s, said another brother, Patrick Benjamin Paddock II, 60, an engineer in Tucson. Stephen Paddock was born in Iowa, the home state of their mother, Irene Hudson.

“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” Patrick Paddock said. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”

Their father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, also known as Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was mostly absent, living a life of crime even before the boys were born. A 1969 newspaper story described him as a “glib, smooth talking ‘confidence man,’ who is egotistic and arrogant.”

His rap sheet was long and included writing bad checks, stealing cars and robbing banks. He was on the F.B.I.’s most wanted list. The agency described him as an avid bridge player, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 245 pounds, who “has been diagnosed as being psychopathic, with possible suicidal tendencies.”

Stephen Paddock learned resourcefulness and self-reliance from an early age. In 1960, when he was 7, his father went to prison for a series of bank robberies and the family moved to Southern California.

The boys’ mother raised them alone on a secretary’s salary, the younger Patrick Paddock said. The brothers would fight over who would get the whole milk. Powdered milk, less tasty but cheaper, was the norm. Their mother never explained where their father was.

“She kept that secret from the family,” Patrick Paddock said.

Stephen Paddock graduated from John H. Francis Polytechnic Senior High School in the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, according to a Los Angeles Unified School District official. Richard Alarcon, a former Los Angeles city councilman, who lived near the Paddocks, said their neighborhood was working class, with a Japanese community center and tidy ranch houses bought with money from the G.I. Bill.

Mr. Alarcon took a science class with Mr. Paddock and remembered him as smart but with “a kind of irreverence. He didn’t always stay between the lines.”

He recalled a competition to build a bridge of balsa wood, without staples or glue. Mr. Paddock cheated, he said, using glue and extra wood.

“Everybody could see that he had cheated, but he just sort of laughed it off,” Mr. Alarcon said. “He had that funny quirky smile on his face like he didn’t care. He wanted to have the strongest bridge and he didn’t care what it took.”

A Knack for Making Money

Mr. Paddock spent his 20s and 30s trying to escape the unpredictability of poverty. He worked nights at an airport while going to the California State University, Northridge, his brother Eric said, and then at jobs with the Internal Revenue Service and as an auditor of defense contracts. But it was real estate that ultimately lifted Mr. Paddock to financial freedom.

In 1987, he bought a 30-unit building at 1256 W. 29th Street in Los Angeles, near the University of Southern California, according to property records. His brother Eric Paddock said the buildings they bought were not “Taj Mahals, but they were nice safe places.”

Crucially, they were excellent investments: Stephen Paddock more than doubled his money on his California holdings, which included at least six multifamily residences, according to property records. He made money in Texas, too. In 2012, he sold a 110-unit building in Mesquite, outside Dallas, for $8.3 million.

He was a good landlord. He kept the rents low, responded promptly to his tenants’ complaints, learned all their names and made sure they were happy. When one reliable tenant complained about a rent increase, he took half off the difference. He designed the ownership structure so his family would profit and installed his mother in a tidy house just behind the apartment complex in Mesquite, Tex.

Mr. Paddock had an apartment in the complex, but he mostly lived elsewhere. He had been married twice, but the apartment looked like a bachelor pad, said Todd Franks, a real estate broker in Dallas. “What you would expect from a 25-year-old single guy.”

To Mr. Franks, Mr. Paddock stood out because it was unusual for the landlord of a property that size to pay such close attention to the day-to-day running of his complex.

“He was frustrated by people who did stupid things,” Mr. Franks said.

He was also willing to fight to defend what was his. During the riots in Los Angeles in the 1990s, he went to the roof of an apartment complex he owned in a flak jacket and armed with a gun, waiting for the rioters, Mr. Franks said.

Though Mr. Paddock might have adopted an accommodating attitude toward his tenants and dressed casually — Mr. Franks remembered him regularly wearing sandals and a sweatsuit — Mr. Paddock was focused and astute when he made deals.

“He was a tough negotiator,” Mr. Franks said. “He wanted his price. His terms. He was a very savvy businessman.”

The House Advantage

By the 2000s, with both of his marriages long over, casinos became Mr. Paddock’s habitat. He liked being waited on, seeing shows and eating good food.

“He likes it when people go, ‘Oh, Mr. Paddock, can I get you a big bowl of the best shrimp anybody had ever eaten on the planet and a big glass of our best port?” Eric Paddock said.

Gambling made him feel important, if not social.

“You could tell that being in that high-limit gambling environment would lift him up,’’ said Mr. Weinreich, the Atlantis casino host in Reno. “He liked everyone doting on him.”

He sometimes called for company, inviting his brother Eric and his children for a free weekend in a luxury suite. But mostly he stayed alone.

A couple of years ago, Mr. Paddock stayed in one Las Vegas hotel gambling for four months straight, said a gaming industry analyst here who was briefed on Mr. Paddock’s gambling history.

The analyst described him as a midlevel high roller, capable of losing $100,000 in one session, which could extend over several days. He said Mr. Paddock may have lost that amount at the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas within the last few months.

Playing a slot machine can be mindless and is usually a guaranteed win for the casino. That is not what Mr. Paddock played. His game, video poker, requires some skill. Players have to know the history of a particular machine. They can do that by reading a pay table, which tells them what each possible winning hand pays out.

One of the ways that video poker players get an advantage is to play casino promotions, which essentially pay out bonuses to winners, said Richard Munchkin, author of “Gambling Wizards: Conversations With the World’s Greatest Gamblers.” A gambler like Mr. Paddock will often “lock” a machine, meaning he or she monopolizes it and makes sure no one else uses it during a gambling session.

For one casino promotion, Mr. Paddock showed up two hours early, locked two machines and played them for 14 hours straight, Mr. Munchkin said, based on information he had compiled from other gamblers who were there at the time. The promotion lasted 12 hours, he said, “but he wanted to play for two hours before anybody got those machines. He knew they were the best machines based on pay tables.”

Mr. Paddock “knew the house advantage down to a tenth of a percent,” he said.

As for the mystery of why Mr. Paddock would go on a shooting rampage at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and then kill himself, most in the gambling industry do not believe it had anything to do with money.

He was in good standing with MGM Properties, the owner of the Mandalay and the Bellagio, according to a person familiar with his gambling history. He had a $100,000 credit limit, the person said, but never used the full amount.

The Absent Neighbor

Mr. Paddock spent so much time in casinos that he was mostly a ghost in the neighborhoods where he had homes.

Colleen Maas, a neighbor of Mr. Paddock’s in Reno, said she had not seen him once in a year and a half, despite walking her dog three times a day and going to line dancing events with his girlfriend, Ms. Danley, at the community center.

He did travel. On his 60th birthday, April 9, 2013, he flew to the Philippines on Japan Airlines and stayed for five days, according to a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration. The family of Ms. Danley, his girlfriend, lived there and she was visiting the country at the time. The couple went again for his birthday the following year.

When he did appear at his Reno home, he could be curt. Another neighbor, John McKay, recalled a day when he was hanging Christmas lights on a railing in his front yard when Mr. Paddock walked by. Mr. McKay said hello and yelled out, “Merry Christmas!” Mr. Paddock kept walking. “He said nothing,” Mr. McKay said. “Not a word. No eye contact.”

Even more baffling, when Mr. McKay tried to strike up a conversation with Mr. Paddock about Donald Trump during the election campaign, he got no response.

“Almost everyone has a reaction to Trump,” said Mr. McKay’s wife, Darlene.

Ms. McKay said that she would usually get up early each morning to watch the sunrise and, when Mr. Paddock was at his home, she would see him dressed in his gym clothes walking to the community center for a workout. Ms. McKay recalled something peculiar: “He always walked across the street and would never pass in front of our house.”

Mr. McKay said that he rarely saw a window or a door open at the house. One day he saw Mr. Paddock’s garage door open, and noticed a large safe inside.

It is not clear what set Mr. Paddock on his path to destruction. As early as 2010, he could no longer fly his planes. His medical certificate expired, according to Federal Aviation Administration records, and there are no indications that he renewed it.

Mr. Paddock bought his last house in Mesquite, Nev., a retirement community of 18,000 people about 90 minutes from Las Vegas that attracts golfers and gamblers from around the country. He seems to have paid in cash, according to property records, and, as he did with other houses, spent very little time there.

His neighbors added personal touches to their yards — decorative pots, plants of all colors and sizes. Mr. Paddock’s house was unadorned. One of the few things neighbors remembered about him was the solid-panel fence he erected. The message was clear: Mr. Paddock was a man who did not want to be seen. On Thursday, investigators had left. A tiny paint-splattered easel, its brush drawer open and empty, stood in the back yard.

Ms. Danley worked in Mesquite. She took a job booking sports bets at a local casino called the Virgin River, where gamblers sat together in rows watching horse races and waitresses circled in tight black skirts.

Several days a week, she attended morning mass at a local Catholic church, said Leo McGinty, 80, a fellow parishioner who knew her from the casino.

Ms. Danley dressed smartly and modestly, he said. She usually sat alone.",Who Was Stephen Paddock? The Mystery of a Nondescript ‘Numbers Guy’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/stephen-paddock-vegas.html

This is impeccable casting. Mr. Gosling’s ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it — his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa — makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time. He is also, in 2017, something close to what Harrison Ford was 35 years ago: the contemporary embodiment of Hollywood’s venerable ideal of masculine cool, a guy whose toughness will turn out to be the protective shell encasing a tender soul.

At first, of course, we must take that sensitivity on faith. K does his grim job thoroughly and without complaint, showing the weary, cynical patience of an old-time shamus. His commander (Robin Wright) is a human who believes that everything depends on policing the border between her kind and K’s. The whole point of “Blade Runner,” though, is that such boundaries are always blurred and porous. K comes home each night from work to the company of Joi (Ana de Armas), his devoted girlfriend, who happens to be a commercially produced artificial intelligence application.

We are prepared to acknowledge the pathos and the paradox of her condition, which is a version of K’s own. The idea that synthetic humans harbor feelings, desires and dreams — that they are mirrors of us, that we are replicas of them — has long been a staple of speculative cinema. “Blade Runner 2049” does not wander as deep into this ontological thicket as, say, Steven Spielberg’s “A.I.” or Spike Jonze’s “Her,” but like those movies it uses the conceit of the suffering cyborg as ethical and emotional ballast, a spur to the audience’s curiosity as well as our compassion. A political theme also asserts itself: These replicants are an enslaved labor force; their exploitation is the fuel on which this civilization runs.

There is a something to think about here, a fair amount to feel and even more to see. Mr. Villeneuve has conspired with the cinematographer, Roger A. Deakins; the production designer, Dennis Gassner; and the special effects team to create zones of strangeness that occasionally rise to the level of sublimity. The movies Mr. Villeneuve has directed — his recent English-language features include “Sicario,” “Prisoners” and “Arrival” — are full of violence and psychological intensity, but what distinguishes them from other high-end genre spectacles is an unnerving calm, as if he were exploring and trying to synthesize the human and mechanical sides of his own sensibility.

Movies are by their nature hybrids of technology and sentiment, machines for the delivery of human emotion. The first “Blade Runner” approached this as a philosophical problem and an artistic challenge. Mr. Scott used imagery borrowed from old Hollywood, German Expressionism and the nascent art of music video to create a dazzlingly artificial environment where authenticity was out of the question. Except, of course, that it was the question: How do we know what is real, ourselves included?

“I know what’s real,” says the hero of that movie when — at long last! — he shows up in this one. K finds Deckard, the original Blade Runner (Mr. Ford, as if I needed to tell you), in an abandoned Las Vegas casino, surrounded by shimmering bottles of whiskey and primitive 3-D projections of Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Mr. Gosling, suddenly overmatched in the masculine cool department, acquits himself well enough, and Mr. Ford does exactly what you expect him to do.

Which is not something I’m going to explain, at least as far as it relates to the story. The studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics not to reveal plot points. That’s fair enough, but it’s also evidence of how imaginatively impoverished big-budget movies have become. Like any great movie, Mr. Scott’s “Blade Runner” cannot be spoiled. It repays repeated viewing because its mysteries are too deep to be solved and don’t depend on the sequence of events. Mr. Villeneuve’s film, by contrast, is a carefully engineered narrative puzzle, and its power dissipates as the pieces snap into place. As sumptuous and surprising as it is from one scene to the next, it lacks the creative excess, the intriguing opacity and the haunting residue of its predecessor.

As such, “Blade Runner 2049” stands in relation to “Blade Runner” almost exactly as K stands in relation to Deckard before the two meet: as a more docile, less rebellious “improvement,” tweaked and retrofitted to meet consumer demand. And the customers are likely to be satisfied. But now and then — when K and Deckard are knocking around the old gambling palace; when K visits an enigmatic mind-technician played by Carla Juri — you get an inkling that something else might have been possible. Something freer, more romantic, more heroic, less determined by the corporate program.

Then again: Who knows at this point if that sense of loss, of lost possibility, is even real? It might be nothing more than an artificially implanted memory.

218,"['wrote', 'life', 'vietnam', 'leroy', 'im', 'work', 'letters', 'professional', 'days', 'words', 'war', 'photographing']","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio.
Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges.
It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.
While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists.
“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967.","Catherine Leroy was 21 when she arrived in Vietnam in 1966 with only a hundred dollars, a Leica M2 and a limited professional portfolio. Over the next three years covering the war, she built an exceptional body of work: surviving and documenting a capture by the North Vietnamese Army, parachuting in combat operations with the 173rd Airborne, and being published on the covers of major magazines, including Life and Paris Match.

She was also the only female photojournalist then working in Vietnam, after the death of Dickey Chapelle, who was killed by a grenade in 1965.

Ms. Leroy wrote over 100 letters home during her three years in Vietnam, one almost every 10 days, and they show how she was processing her experiences and navigating professional challenges. They are candid and revealing, attesting to her resiliency, exposing insecurities, and showing her in moments of triumph, despair, optimism or courage.

Photo

Despite her many strong images, Ms. Leroy had remained relatively unknown, partly because she wasn’t a self-promoter, and partly because women photographers have often been excluded from the medium’s history, especially war photography. Now a selection of those letters are featured on a new website, accompanied by some of her archive and details from her life. It will be followed by the documentary “Cathy at War” by the writer and filmmaker Jacques Menasche.

Most of the letters are to her mother, Denise, focusing at first on topics that read like holiday postcards – gifts she hoped to send home, people she met, her tan. To her father, Jean, she wrote mostly about business — publications that bought her work, logistics and future plans. She frequently reassures them, noting in one letter to her mother that “if anything happens to me, you’ll be informed within 24 hours. So don’t worry if I sometimes leave you without any news.”

Her tone changed over time. In the early letters, she was unsure whether she should stay or go home, even as she felt less insecure about her technical skills. She spoke of the relationships she was forming with the military and about daily life. On Sept. 4, 1966, a few months after her initial arrival, she wrote to her mother:

I celebrated my 22nd birthday at the Da Nang press office in the company of lots of Marines. I had left Saigon a few days earlier with an AP reporter for an operation near the DMZ. On this occasion he opened a bottle of French champagne when we got back. I only got back last night, Saturday, very tired…I’m getting an iron reputation with the marines. I’m very proud of it. I’m leaving tomorrow, Tuesday, morning for the Delta. Subject: a village a few days from the election. The war seems to be calming down, as always happens just before political events. The Delta is the key region. I’ll stay there two or three days. After that, I don’t know. I’m preparing a few photos of me taken in various locations and will send them to you. I haven’t forgotten your wig, I’ll take care of it too. Don’t be angry with me. I’m always away: back in Saigon for two days, get something cleaned, tidy up, wash, everything is dirty.

As her confidence grew, she wrote about her professional successes. But the letters also showed low moments, like being unable to get the pictures she wanted in the field or leaving an envelope of her best prints in a taxi after fending off a robbery attempt from the driver.

The letters testify to the challenges women encountered in the field. While there were female journalists in Vietnam, Ms. Leroy was the only woman photographer after Chapelle’s death, and faced resistance from the military and male journalists. Robert Pledge, president of the board of the Catherine Leroy Fund, a not-for-profit organization in Paris dedicated to her work, said many prominent photojournalists questioned why a young woman wanted to cover war.

Photo

She wrote about how people were nice when they first thought she was an unintimidating, five-foot-tall, pigtailed girl. But when they realized she was a serious photographer, their opinions changed. “Many were very, very negative and very nasty with her,” said Mr. Pledge, who is also co-founder and director of Contact Press Images.

Writing to her father on May 13, 1967, after noting her successes in being published in leading magazines, she marveled how “I’m getting telegrams from people who I didn’t know existed for years, while at the same time I’m hated more than ever by known and unknown enemies in Saigon, American civilians, as well as servicemen in Saigon.”

One photographer told Mr. Pledge that the male photographers “were really nasty chauvinistic pigs.” That same photographer, who now is a filmmaker, called her late in life to apologize.

Still, she found the opportunities available to her in Vietnam surpassed anything back home in France. Like parachuting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade — the 85th jump she had taken in her life, after receiving her parachuting license as a teenager.

“I am the first woman to jump in Vietnam during this first operational jump by American parachutists since the war began,” she wrote to her father on Feb. 23, 1967. “I’m very proud to have jumped with the Americans here, it’s a big professional success in every way. I now know that I will be able to work in the United Sates one day without too much problem.” She wrote how she planned to submit her work to major competitions. “I’ve always thought I should succeed because I never gave in,” she continued.

Many consider Ms. Leroy as the most daring of all photographers in Vietnam, and she most likely spent the most time in combat because she needed the money. Being broke meant traveling with soldiers, sharing rations and sleeping in the countryside.

As Mr. Pledge noted, “If Robert Capa was saying that it’s not good enough because it’s not close enough — she was very close.”

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

Was Moore’s appeal to Bannon the fact that as recently as last December, he was still promoting the lie that Barack Obama was born abroad?

In Mississippi they’re trying to persuade Chris McDaniel to wage a Republican primary battle against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent up for re-election next year. I’m not entirely sure what Wicker’s crimes against populism are, but I can tell you a bit about McDaniel, who’s a real charmer. After the Women’s March in late January, he wrote a Facebook post that asked: “If they can afford all those piercings, tattoos, body paintings, signs and plane tickets, then why do they want us to pay for their birth control?” Their birth control? There’s some male involvement in unwanted pregnancies and some male investment in preventing them, especially if the male, like McDaniel, is assertively anti-abortion.

On a radio show that he once hosted, McDaniel mocked the idea of learning any Spanish by volunteering his own translations of “mamacita.” “I think it basically means, ‘Hey, hot mama,’ ” he said. “Or, you know, ‘You’re a fine-looking young thing.’ ” He’s a nasty-sounding old thing, which is another way of saying that he’s catnip to the likes of Bannon.

Other Republicans in the Senate who are up for re-election, on Bannon’s hit list and in serious danger of defeat in their primaries include Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Their colleague Bob Corker of Tennessee pre-empted that kind of ordeal by deciding to retire at the end of this term, and Tennessee’s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, resisted entreaties to enter the race and tussle with furious Bannonites.

And so the G.O.P., hardly a paragon of sanity over recent years, is looking loonier than ever. “The formula is to be more aggressive, more outrageous, don’t back down from crazy statements,” one longtime Republican strategist told me. He’s aghast at the fault lines that he sees opening, for instance between Republicans with an appropriate wariness toward Trump and those who demand unwavering fealty to him.

The latter camp includes Nick Ayers, who is Mike Pence’s chief of staff. According to an audiotape obtained by Politico, he recently urged major Republican donors to “purge” Trump-bucking lawmakers by denying them any money and instead funding Republican challengers.

For Democrats aiming to capture the Senate and House majorities, this is in one sense great news. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes elections for The Cook Political Report, told me that “Republicans’ two toughest Senate races — Nevada and Arizona — are winnable with the incumbents but are going to be very, very rough if the Bannon-backed candidates are the nominees.”

In addition, Duffy said, “You look at Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi — nominating the wrong candidate could potentially put those races in play for Democrats.”

So is Bannon miscalculating horribly and simply out of his gourd? No. He’s not thinking in the conventional terms of Republicans versus Democrats; he’s thinking that “any disruption is a good thing, and that the best way to get what he wants — a white-centered, nationalist America — is to blow up the establishment,” the Republican strategist said. Other Republican operatives concurred.

If Bannon can bend the G.O.P. in its current form to that vision, great. If he can’t, then he might as well destroy it to make room for something else. If Democrats grab the reins of power in the meantime, so be it. He’ll sow and enjoy as much mayhem as he can along the way, and somehow deems that preferable to the status quo.

Moore, McDaniel and Grimm aren’t perfect ideological companions, but they’re chaos candidates, and if they manage to get to Congress and the G.O.P. maintains its majorities there, heaven help us all. Just think about what they’ll inject into the formal debate on Capitol Hill; just think about how much further they’ll warp it. It could make the Tea Party’s ascent in 2010 seem tame.

Think about this, too: Moore was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for failing to abide by federal orders. When they came into conflict with his conscience, meaning his extremely conservative interpretation of Christianity, he prioritized the latter. You could call that a triumph of principle. You could also call it a collapse of civic responsibility and respect for the system.

Under the guise of protecting religious freedom and moral sensibilities, the Trump administration is making it harder for women to get access to birth control. On Friday, it rolled back an Obama-era rule requiring most employers to provide their employees with birth control coverage without co-payments. The mandate, established under the Affordable Care Act, has helped millions of women avoid unwanted pregnancy by eliminating out-of-pockets costs for contraception.

Under new rules, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury and Labor will make it easier for employers to deny contraception coverage if they have a “religious or moral objection” to doing so. Further, the departments have made it harder for women who are denied birth control coverage to get no-cost contraception directly from insurance companies, under a process established by the previous administration.

If that were not bad enough, officials made the changes effective immediately. The administration claimed, absurdly, that the rule had to be issued quickly because the normal process of seeking public comment before acting would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” It used other specious arguments to justify its decision — asserting, for instance, that coverage of contraception could lead to more “risky sexual behavior” among some teenagers and young women.

These regulatory rollbacks will almost surely reverse years of progress. The percentage of reproductive-age women who faced out-of-pocket costs for oral contraceptives, for example, fell to less than 4 percent by 2014 from more than 20 percent just two years earlier, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. One study estimates that women are saving about $1.4 billion on the pill. The mandate to cover birth control is also very popular; 68 percent of people say they support it.

The Obama administration, knowing that right-wing groups would seize on any pretext to limit access to birth control and other reproductive health services, carefully exempted churches, mosques and other houses of worship from the mandate. Later, under pressure from religious nonprofit organizations, officials also created a process that allowed those groups to opt out of paying for birth control coverage. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that closely held for-profit companies could also deny contraceptive coverage to employees on religious grounds, in a case brought by Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts retailer.

The new Trump rules go much further than the Hobby Lobby ruling by effectively allowing any business, university or other organization to opt out, without having to notify the government that it is doing so. That puts hundreds of thousands of women at risk of losing benefits. Under the system created by the Obama administration, when an employer chose not to pay for birth control, employees were provided coverage directly by insurance companies at no cost to the beneficiary. That system will now become optional for employers.

The Trump administration says, with no evidence whatsoever, that its new rules will have no effect on “over 99.9 percent of the 165 million women in the United States.” It further argues that low-income women will still be able to get subsidized or free contraception through community health programs and government health programs. Left unsaid is that the administration has made no secret of its desire to substantially cut government spending on programs like these. Several public interest groups, like the Center for Reproductive Rights, the National Women’s Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union, say they plan to challenge the Trump rules in court.

His success as a businessman showed the rotten side of capitalism — the side that exploits appetites for money, that feeds leech-like on our vices, that dissolves family and religion while promising that consumption will fill the void they leave behind.

The social liberalism he championed was the rotten and self-interested sort, a liberalism of male and upper-class privilege, in which the strong and beautiful and rich take their pleasure at the expense of the vulnerable and poor and not-yet-born.

The online future his career anticipated was the rotten side of the internet — the realms of onanism and custom-tailored erotica, where the male vanity and entitlement he indulged has curdled into resentment and misogyny.

And his appreciation of male-female difference was rotten, too — the leering predatory sort of appreciation, the Cosby-Clinton-Trump sort, the sort that nicknames quaaludes “thigh openers” and expects the girls to laugh, the sort that prefers breast implants to female intellect and rents the charms of youth to escape the realities of age.

No doubt what Hefner offered America somebody else would have offered in his place, and the changes he helped hasten would have come rushing in without him.

But in every way that mattered he made those changes worse, our culture coarser and crueler and more sterile than liberalism or feminism or freedom of speech required. And in every way that mattered his life story proved that we were wrong to listen to him, because at the end of the long slide lay only a degraded, priapic senility, or the desperate gaiety of Prince Prospero’s court with the Red Death at the door.

Now that death has taken him, we should examine our own sins. Liberals should ask why their crusade for freedom and equality found itself with such a captain, and what his legacy says about their cause. Conservatives should ask how their crusade for faith and family and community ended up so Hefnerian itself — with a conservative news network that seems to have been run on Playboy Mansion principles and a conservative party that just elected a playboy as our president.

You can find these questions being asked, but they are counterpoints and minor themes.

The cake needs no embellishment to make it more welcoming than it already is, but I’ll sometimes brush a little warmed marmalade across the top to give it a gloss; it’s a fillip, but the cake is worth the extra attention.","Photo

Over the years, and almost without meaning to, I have become an obsessive collector — not of objects but of recipes. I have accumulated boxes’ and files’ worth. I search for them casually in print and online, and relentlessly, determinedly and often shamelessly when I’m out, whether close to home or traveling. I eavesdrop as I wait in line at the market, and sometimes, if I think there’s the possibility of nabbing something special, I’ll muster the courage to wriggle into the conversation. I ask shopkeepers how they prepare whatever it is they sell, which is how I came to cook a turkey at a temperature so low I feared it wouldn’t be ready to eat until the next day (its slow-roasted skin was burnished and its meat moist). I take notes when I taste something I like in a restaurant and then spend days in my kitchen trying to recreate it. And sometimes recipes just come to me, by mail, by good luck or through the front door, which is how my first visiting cake arrived.

The cake, protected by a tea towel and nestled in a basket, was given to me by its baker, Ingela Helgesson, a woman I’d talked with now and then at a local farm store in Connecticut. Ingela was searching for the perfect kitchen sink, and I invited her to come see mine; the cake was her unnecessary — but much appreciated — thanks. It was a butter cake, round and low, a few sliced almonds baked into its golden top. It was both unassuming and immensely inviting, but it was the story of the cake that I loved most. Ingela’s mother, who taught her to make the cake in their native Sweden, said it came together so speedily that you could start mixing the batter the moment you spied visitors coming up the walk. By the time they were settled in your home, the cake would be ready to serve.

The name charmed me. It evoked images of pilgrims as well as of potlucks, of picnics in town and country, of weekends with friends and treats to tide you over on long trips.

Fifteen years later, I’ve christened dozens of “visiting cakes” of my own devising, no matter if I’ve taken them far away or left them in the kitchen to be enjoyed for days. My visiting cakes might be Bundt cakes, simple yet often fanciful, with swirls, stripes and crenelations molded into the pans they are baked in. They might be sheet cakes that can be cut into squares, or rounds, like Ingela’s, which make nice wedges. But most often they’re compact loaves, sometimes squat, sometimes flat and many times crowned, their centers cracked in volcanic fault lines.

What separates a visiting cake from all other cakes is its sturdiness — it’s built to be wrapped, packed and bundled, to travel and to retain its goodness for at least the span of a long weekend. This often precludes frostings and fussy decorations and means that the cake’s clarion qualities are its flavor and its texture, which tips toward moist, firm and easily sliceable, like poundcakes (which make fine visiting cakes). What all the cakes have in common is that they are meant to be shared. The joy of community is implicit in their name.

My lemon-spice visiting cake is one I bake regularly. Among its virtues are the quickness with which it’s made; the need for only a whisk to blend the batter; the fact that, like many spice cakes, it’s good when you make it and even better a day or two later, when the spices have had time to find their way into the cake; and that it is both homely and beautiful — its golden honey color and solid shape promise comfort and satisfaction. The cake needs no embellishment to make it more welcoming than it already is, but I’ll sometimes brush a little warmed marmalade across the top to give it a gloss; it’s a fillip, but the cake is worth the extra attention.",A Cake You Can Take With You Anywhere,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/magazine/a-cake-you-can-take-with-you-anywhere.html

Volkswagen installed software in its diesel cars to fool regulators into thinking the engines were meeting emissions standards. The software detected when it was being tested, and only then did it turn on the antipollution system. The Wisconsin district map is a similarly audacious piece of engineering.

When the overall Republican vote share in the state is 50 percent or more, the authors of the paper show, the map behaves much like an unbiased one. But when the map is tested by an electorate that leans Democratic, its special features kick in, maintaining a healthy Republican majority against the popular headwind. To gain control of the State Assembly, the authors estimate, Wisconsin Democrats would have to beat Republicans by 8 to 10 points, a margin rarely achieved in statewide elections by either party in this evenly split state. As a mathematician, I’m impressed. As a Wisconsin voter, I feel a little ill.

Republican legislators argue that any Wisconsin map will look biased, because Democratic voters tend to congregate in big cities like Milwaukee and Madison. That packs the Democratic half of the state into a small cluster of districts. “Why are you gerrymandering yourselves?” they ask.

They’re partly right. The clustering of Democrats in cities does indeed give the Republicans an edge. But it’s a much smaller advantage than the turbo-boost the current map provides, as the Duke paper demonstrates. The main tool in the Duke paper is a method called the “Markov chain Monte Carlo” algorithm. Starting from the current Wisconsin district map, it makes a sequence of random changes, swapping wards from one district to an adjacent one, carrying out a “random walk” through the set of all possible maps. Completely unconstrained changes would create crazy-looking districts, so it weights its changes in favor of traditional districting criteria.

Few if any of these maps provide the Republicans the firewall against a Democratic electorate that the Wisconsin district map does. In other words, the map is an “outlier” — so far outside the ordinary run of things that it can’t be mistaken for a map without partisan purpose. It’s an outlier in another way, too: Research by the political scientist Jowei Chen suggests that the Wisconsin district map does much worse on traditional districting criteria than neutral maps do, despite the Wisconsin Constitution’s requirement that districts be “in as compact form as practicable.”

Outlier detection is a critical part of data analysis, and mathematicians have gotten really good at it by now. That’s the good news about advanced computation: You can use it to make electoral mischief, but you can also use it to detect and measure that mischief. It’s not math versus democracy; it’s math versus math, with democracy at stake.

If the Supreme Court sides with the three-judge panel that blocked the Wisconsin map, some liberals foresee an end to gerrymandering, while some conservatives imagine a districting process that is the purview of legislatures being completely usurped by the courts. Both sides of Gill v. Whitford agree: This is a momentous case with major implications for American democracy.

But what if it’s not? The panel’s standards for determining impermissible gerrymandering are hard to meet except in the most egregious cases. Judges empowered by an anti-gerrymandering precedent from the Supreme Court will blunt the worst cases, but won’t end gerrymandering. There will be many cases, maybe most of them, where it’s impossible, no matter how much math you do, to tell the difference between innocuous decision making and a scheme — like Wisconsin’s — designed to protect one party from voters who might prefer the other.",How Computers Turned Gerrymandering Into a Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/sunday/computers-gerrymandering-wisconsin.html

HGTV programs like “Tiny House, Big Living,” which have helped popularize the movement, often gloss over this not-so-tiny detail. But the many Facebook pages and websites devoted to tiny-house culture are obsessed with it: Online discussions are dominated by requests, if not outright pleas, for tips on how and where to find tiny-house-friendly locations.

Zoning regulations in most places — especially densely developed regions like the New York metro area — typically do not allow full-time living in temporary structures like R.V.s or movable tiny houses. Most tiny homes are built on wheeled trailers that can be towed. Unlike R.V.s, however, tiny houses are generally not wheeled for touring, so much as for flexibility of location.

Zoning also commonly specifies a minimum home or lot size that is too large and expensive for a lifestyle geared toward affordability. Residential building codes can also present a problem for tiny houses built on foundations.

As a result, “easily upwards of 90 percent of tiny-house owners are living illegally, when it comes to zoning,” said Andrew Morrison, a professional builder and tiny-house advocate in Oregon who travels the world teaching seminars on tiny-house construction.

“A very small minority live in R.V. parks, though they usually have a limit on how long you can stay,” he said. “A friend or family’s backyard, or land in the country, is much more common.”

For some, flouting zoning restrictions is an accepted, even celebrated, aspect of a culture that rejects the American appetite for big houses, rampant consumption and excess stuff. “It’s one of the last things we have where you can kind of stick it to the man,” Marcus Stoltzfus, a co-owner of Liberation Tiny Homes, near Lancaster, Pa., said with a smile.

In the right setting, illicit tiny-house dwellers can usually get away with it. “If it’s off the road and you’re on good terms with your neighbors, you probably won’t have an issue,” said Dave Cramer, an owner of Hudson River Tiny Homes, in the Albany area.

But with the tiny-living craze having lasted well past the fad stage, pressure is growing for municipalities to embrace tiny houses as legal residences. And more tiny-house building companies are popping up, anticipating just such a shift.

“The way they’re legalizing it, it’s coming from West to East,” said Tori Pond, who opened a tiny-home company called Craft & Sprout with her husband, Ken, in Greenwich, Conn, last year. “It’s a matter of when, not if.”

So far, advocates have made the most progress in changing ordinances governing so-called accessory dwelling units and backyard cottages. Some high-cost municipalities, including Fresno, Calif., and Nantucket, Mass., now allow tiny houses to share land with existing homes.

“It’s a spirit of cooperation,” Mr. Morrison said. “It’s a simple way to bring in affordable housing that doesn’t cost the municipality anything.”

Advocates hope the movement will gain more ground in coming years now that the International Code Council has approved a model code for tiny houses for inclusion in its International Residential Code, the most widely recognized residential building code in the country. Mr. Morrison, who led the effort to write the code, said it should alleviate both safety and aesthetic concerns for those states and municipalities that adopt it.

“There’s a fear that people are going to end up living in shanty shacks,” he said. “We don’t want that either. We want people to be safe in their houses, and in something they can afford.”

For the time being, however, finding a place to live long-term in a tiny house requires creativity, flexibility and considerable networking.

For Amy Garner and John McCarthy, it was a conversation over coffee with a well-connected architect that led them to the ideal location for their 340-square-foot tiny house in New Haven: waterside, at a marina on the Quinnipiac River.

For about $400 a month, including utility hookups, the couple enjoy up-close views of the river through the glass front of their Traveler XL, a high-end tiny home made by Escape Traveler. The spot alongside the docks has made their home a favorite hangout for friends, despite the close quarters, and it is only about a mile from their business, a Pilates studio.

“It’s perfect,” said Ms. Garner, 30. “You wake up in the morning, and the sun reflects off the water, and you get this twinkle effect on the bedroom ceiling.”

They have been there since April without issue, other than the occasional curious passers-by. And now they have a like-minded neighbor: A woman living in an Airstream, an aluminum-sided travel trailer, recently moved in behind them.

Lisa Cohen and Richard Ratcliff, who met last spring while hiking the Appalachian Trail, are hoping for similar stability while they finish converting a school bus they bought on eBay into a tiny house. Finding a place to park it within reasonable commuting distance of Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, N.Y., where Ms. Cohen is a graduate student, was no easy feat.

Photo

“We asked a few farms, a gardening center and a flea market,” Ms. Cohen, 27, said in an email. “Everyone was kind and said they would think it over, but then would either not answer calls or said ‘no’ in the end.”

Eventually the couple found a restaurant owner in Dutchess County willing to let them park off to the side of his lot for $150 a month. (They asked that the restaurant not be identified.) Settled there for about a month now, they have access to electricity and well water. The train ride to Sarah Lawrence takes Ms. Cohen about 90 minutes, with three transfers, but she is appreciative of the spot, which she deemed preferable to “ending up in Walmart parking lots.”

Brianna Welch, 25, starts graduate school at the University of Vermont in January, and hopes to move from her Bronx apartment to the Burlington area in a 340-square-foot tiny house being built by Craft & Sprout. She and her husband, Chris Murphy, a 24-year-old software product manager, are actively hunting for land to rent, hoping to get settled before the first snow.

As of last week, they had no promising prospects. A year-round R.V. campground they looked into is already booked for the winter. Someone offered to rent them a building lot, but that particular town would require them to install a septic system, at a cost of about $18,000, and pay an $8,000 impact fee. As they look for farmland to rent, the couple are tapping sites like Tiny House Hosting, on Facebook, for connections.

“I think it’s going to be through our network that we find someone who knows someone who has land,” Ms. Welch said. “We knew this would be the hardest part, but I didn’t think it would be this hard.”

Finding a site in rural towns is often easier, because of the likelihood of looser zoning and enforcement. In Lodi, N.Y., for example, Eleanor Liebson, an occupational therapist, is hoping to start a tiny-house community on a portion of the 100-plus acres she owns near Finger Lakes National Forest. “There’s the potential because there’s no zoning in our town,” she said. “We can do it.”

The downside to remote sites, however, is the absence of readily available utility hookups. Seth Porges, a science and technology journalist, found that out after he bought a 180-square-foot tiny house last February. He put the house on rented farmland in the Hudson Valley to use as an Airbnb rental, and imagined it would be an off-the-grid experience.

The house had a solar energy system, 50-gallon water tanks and a dry-flush toilet. But he quickly realized that the solar power supply was not nearly robust enough, especially when the air-conditioner was on. And the water supply lasted only a few days before it had to be replenished.

“People think they’ll throw their house on a cheap piece of land and that’s the end of it,” said Mr. Porges, who lives in a regular house in a nearby town. “They don’t realize all the logistical challenges they’re going to face.”

He wound up hiring an electrician to lay heavy-gauge extension cords connecting the tiny house to a power supply elsewhere on the farm. And he invested in hoses specially designed for potable water to run downhill to his house from a spigot. But come winter, he expects those hoses will freeze, once again necessitating the use of the water tanks.

As for the dry-flush toilet, it functions as expected, essentially “shrink-wrapping your waste,” Mr. Porges said. But the disposable cartridges are fairly expensive: He calculates the cost at about $1 per flush. Other bathroom options for tiny homes include composting and incineration toilets.

For Kerri L. Richardson, a clutter-clearing coach and the author of “What Your Clutter is Trying to Tell You,” the hassles of tiny-house living are more appealing than the headaches of being tied to a traditional single-family home. She and her wife, Melissa Silk, sold their 2,200-square-foot home in Newburyport, Mass., about three years ago and have been gradually downsizing ever since. They are currently renting a 500-square-foot apartment in Groton, Conn., while building a 240-square-foot tiny home on a trailer.

“The roots that we had planted felt more like shackles,” said Ms. Richardson, 46. “It takes some courage to go against that societal template of life, but we decided we wanted to have more experiences and less things.”

As they both are able to work remotely, their plan is to tow their house up to northern New England later this fall – although they haven’t yet found a place to park it. While they’re not entirely averse to living under the radar, they would prefer to find a town where they can live aboveboard, Ms. Richardson said.

And if all else fails, they have a fallback: a year-round R.V. park they heard about in New Hampshire. “That’s our last choice,” Ms. Richardson said. “But if we have to, we will do it.”",Where Can You Park a Tiny Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/realestate/where-can-you-park-a-tiny-home.html

Even the most ephemeral street art is not usually this fleeting: Minutes after the work is finished in the metallic glint of dawn, passers-by stop, stare — then carry bits of it away, until the whole thing collapses. The act of creation has been briefer than a spring shower; destruction comes even more swiftly. Soon, all that is left is a scattering of petals and twisted stems, curled on the ground like punctuation marks. Photos of the piece survive on social media, of course, as most things now do — a cascade of orchids and echinacea, nature sculpted into a gloriously unnatural state — but even the images are haunted by the specter of wilt; it’s built in.

Guerrilla flower “flashes” — such as those by the married Melbourne-based duo called Loose Leaf, whose giant wreaths appear suspended in air amid the city’s alleyways like portholes to another dimension, as well as those by the Manhattan florist Lewis Miller, who has, under cover of night, turned the city’s bedraggled mascots, the waist-high metal mesh garbage cans, into giant vases — are taking the most evanescent of the decorative arts into places it has rarely gone. Unlike graffiti, which is meant to leave its mark on mostly urban environments for as long as possible, these installations attempt not to defy but to chronicle nature’s mutability.

Fashion designers, including Alexander Wang, whose show last month was staged with impromptu aplomb from a tour bus that made stops in Manhattan and Brooklyn, have always sought to create a sense of spontaneity and surprise with their work, but clothing can never feel as deliciously impermanent as flowers. These short-lived botanical street installations seem both an embrace and a rebuke of earlier, earthier “happenings” wrought in quicksilver mediums. The 1960s Fluxus artists at least left behind a series of tiny attaché cases filled with objects (games, bottles with plastic droppers, custom-lettered cards, sets of rocks) to commemorate their events; at Carole Goodden and Gordon Matta-Clark’s Food, the 1970s SoHo restaurant-cum-art installation, diners were once given a necklace made of their entrees’ scrubbed bones to wear home. But blossoms leave behind no trace.

Photo

Perhaps that is why flora is increasingly an expansive medium for artists; no other material so explicitly blurs the line between fine art and decoration that was created in the early 20th century, and which left floral art on one side of the divide and sculpture on the other. The latter got to call itself high art, fine art; the former had to settle for the diminutive label of “decorative.” These days, though, such distinctions seem quaint and out of touch. One has only to see the work of the London-based Rebecca Louise Law, who created an upside-down meadow floating from the ceiling of a structure at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2015, and that of Tokyo’s Azuma Makoto, who has made botanical sculptures suspended in ice for the likes of Dries Van Noten, to recognize this truth.

But the provocative beauty of such sculptural, large-scale creations tends to be confined to galleries or exclusive events — which is, to Geoffroy Mottart, a shame. Over the last two years, the artist has adorned more than 20 historical statues around Brussels with elaborate beards and wigs made completely of flowers, giving new life to monuments that may have become invisible in the landscape. He has made it his mission to use flowers as a “connection between people and their history.” Charlie Lawler and Wona Bae of Loose Leaf consider guerrilla installations a celebratory way to recycle leftover blooms from private floral commissions; they incorporate foraged materials, including sticks and roadside vines, into the wreaths as well. Tina Libby, a freelance florist in Philadelphia who has been adorning stone statues and garbage cans since April, uses donated surplus from local flower shops. But these works aren’t meant to merely delight: Earlier this year, the Iran-born, Brooklyn-based brothers who call themselves Icy and Sot wove blossoms into barbed wire atop a cement wall in Miami as a commentary on current immigration struggles.

Photo

For Miller, who is inspired by the superabundance of Rousseau’s paintings as well as by the linear juxtapositions of cubism, the flower flashes are simply “guttural.” The works — which he constructs with a three-person team in fewer than 15 minutes at first daylight in various downtown N.Y.C. locations, including the foot of the Washington Square Arch and near a traffic light on West 14th Street — force him to abandon the perfectionism endemic to his craft. It wasn’t an easy leap — when he began making his pop-up pieces in October 2016, his first impulse was to create a perfect arrangement in the studio and plop it into the cans. Then he realized that he had to get away from all that fussing, to transcend his workaday occupation of “making rich people’s lives more beautiful.” The point was to throw together an arrangement on the spot, on a street corner; to force a collage of compromises. Getting too fancy or self-conscious would annihilate the joy.

That those who wander by the renegade installations feel comfortable taking handfuls of blooms, thus destroying the effect, delights Miller. The works are, in some way, a twist on Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s melancholic, often restaged “Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)” from 1991, in which gallery-goers are encouraged to take a piece of wrapped candy from a giant pile, enacting the wasting away of the artist’s partner from complications due to AIDS.

In this modern retelling — in yet another era when spontaneous beauty can remedy despair, if only briefly — a garbage pail becomes a geyser of roses, an explosion of dahlias, a shooting plume of lilies and irises. And in the blink of an eye, the cans once again hold only trash.

Some of the most skilled cooks I know — people who confidently roast, grill and fry — balk at the notion of braising. They think it’s more mysterious or fussy than other cooking methods. The opposite is true: Braising is extremely flexible, and it follows a formula.

There is an art to it. But since a good braise is so utterly, deliciously succulent, learning how is painless.

You need only to understand the process. It involves gently simmering vegetables, fish, fowl or meat (or a combination) with a small amount of liquid, usually in a covered pot. Braising chicken is a good place to start, and it’s a lot easier than you think.

Indisputably, the best part of the bird for this project is the thigh: It is the most succulent cut. Though a whole chicken chopped in pieces can be braised, skip the heartache of overcooked breast meat and stick to thighs; your fellow diners will thank you.

A chicken thigh is nearly impossible to overcook. There is forgiveness — 10 minutes longer in the oven simply means a little more tenderness. Thighs can also be cooked ahead and successfully reheated, often gaining juiciness and depth in the process. I am not, however, referring to skinless, boneless thighs. You want skin-on, bone-in meat.

The schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, said Monday that, in response to last week’s fatal stabbing at a school in the Bronx, the Education Department would focus its training for teachers on how to defuse behavior crises and make sure that bullying was reported.

Last Wednesday, Abel Cedeno, an 18-year-old student at the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, brought a switchblade to school and stabbed two classmates, killing one, Matthew McCree, 15, and leaving another, Ariane Laboy, 16, seriously wounded. The police have said that Mr. Cedeno told them that he had been bullied since the start of school, though not by Mr. McCree and Mr. Laboy, who were said to be throwing pencil bits and balled up paper at him during class. Parents have said that the school’s administration failed to address complaints about bullying.

On Monday, in a conversation about school safety with invited parent leaders from throughout the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Ms. Fariña emphasized that crime in schools was at its lowest level on record and said they were making investments in mental health programs in schools and in so-called restorative justice, which replaces punitive approaches to behavioral problems with discussion and mediation.

“Even though we’re all feeling a lot of pain right now, we know that these approaches are taking us on the right path,” Mr. de Blasio said.

Ms. Fariña said that all schools would use time on Mondays designated for teacher professional development to discuss bullying and de-escalation techniques for at least three weeks. A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Toya Holness, said the department would share more information with schools this week and that the training would start this month.

In response to a parent who asked if the department would consider hiring more school psychologists, Ms. Fariña said that she would instruct superintendents to examine whether the schools they oversee needed more resources or needed to share resources differently with other schools.

“Certainly we are looking at more guidance counselors,” she said.

Some parents in the room said they believed that schools were not doing enough to confront bullying or more generally to address disorder. One parent asked if staff who were in the classroom at the School for Wildlife Conservation when the stabbing took place would be disciplined. A teacher and an aide were present during the altercation, the police said. But a student who witnessed the attack said they did not take action.","After Stabbing, Teachers Will Get Training on Defusing Behavior Issues",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/nyregion/after-stabbing-training-for-teachers-behavior-problems.html

An explosion at a gas station in the African nation of Ghana killed at least one person and injured several others, according to government officials and news reports.

Officials told local news outlets that a fire broke out at a gas station in the capital, Accra, and then spread to another station. Videos on social media showed giant balls of flames that set the night sky aglow.

Abu Ramadan, an official with the National Disaster Management Organization, told JoyNews late on Saturday that at least one person had been killed. He cautioned that emergency responders had not been able to access a convenience store at the gas station and said it was unclear whether anyone was inside.

He said 10 people had been injured in the chaos of people fleeing.

The deputy information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, said a “significant number of persons” were affected by the explosion and “a few” had died.

“There was some panic and we all just moved away from the scene,” George Agbey, who was near the explosion, told The Associated Press. “It was like refugees moving away from a war-torn zone.”

Firefighters were working to extinguish the blaze, which apparently engulfed at least one fuel tanker. By late Saturday, officials said the fire was about 95 percent contained and no longer posed a threat.

On Twitter, Accra city officials warned of an explosion in the Legon and Madina areas around 7:30 p.m. local time. Broadcast news reports showed scenes of destruction and some flames as onlookers milled about.

AOL Instant Messenger, the chat program that connected a generation to their classmates and crushes while guiding them through the early days of digital socializing, will shut down on Dec. 15, its parent company announced on Friday.

Released in 1997, the program had largely faded into obscurity over the last decade, replaced by text messages, Google Chat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and on and on we go. But at its height, AIM, as it was known, served as the social center for teenagers and young adults, the scene of deeply resonant memories and the place where people learned how to interact online.

“AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,” Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath, the parent company of AOL, said in a statement on Friday.

The news of its official demise was met with cries of nostalgia, especially from those who were coming of age as AIM rose to prominence. For many people now in their 20s and 30s, learning to talk online coincided with learning to communicate like an adult, said Caroline Moss, 29, a writer and editor in New York who for years paid tribute to AIM with the parody Twitter account @YourAwayMessage.

Friedman, a clinical psychologist in St. Louis. “In difficult times, when life begins to feel out of control or when faced with an emotional dilemma, working on something that has finite answers can provide a sense of security.”

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

But it was a long road to stardom for Mr. Petty, literally.

It all started with the “greatest trip of my life,” as Mr. Petty described it to Mr. Zanes, referring to a cross-country road-trip from Gainesville to Los Angeles in 1974. With him was the bass player Danny Roberts of Mr. Petty’s band Mudcrutch, and their roadie, Keith McAllister. The band had gotten as big as it could back in Florida. A look at the city that became his home, and the places that defined him, allows you to chart his journey from struggling musician to rock star.

Soon after his arrival, Mr. Petty found himself in a telephone booth outside of Ben Frank’s diner at 8585 Sunset Boulevard — now the West Hollywood location of Mel’s Drive-In — sifting through a phone book looking for record companies. As luck would have it, he spotted a piece of paper on the ground with a list of 25 local record labels, with addresses and phone numbers, most likely left behind by another rock ‘n’ roll dreamer.

“The thing about L.A. was that it was exactly what I hoped it would be,” Mr. Petty said. “We drove down the streets and everywhere you looked were signs for record companies. MGM, RCA, Capitol, A&M. It was obvious that we had come to the right place.”

Mudcrutch ended up signing with Shelter Records, whose Los Angeles offices were based in a large, one-story building at 5112 Hollywood Boulevard, which now houses apartments and a Lebanese restaurant. Mr. Petty and his crew spent countless hours there hanging out and listening to music.

Of the surviving landmark recording industry buildings of Mr. Petty’s early days, the Capitol Records Building is the most recognizable. It is a designated Historic-Cultural Monument — a short drive away from where Shelter Records once existed — at 1750 Vine Street. (While Mr. Petty was never on the Capitol Records label, EMI-Capitol did end up with the Shelter Records catalog in 1993, though Mr. Petty retained the rights to his music.)

From the Capitol Records Building, you’re a 10-minute walk from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted in 1999 and fans have been flocking there to pay tribute since hearing of Mr. Petty’s passing.

After signing with Shelter Records, the label put Mr. Petty and the boys up at the Hollywood Premiere Motel, a less-than-glamorous accommodation still operating at 5333 Hollywood Boulevard. Mr. Petty described it as “really a hooker place” in the book “Conversations With Tom Petty.” It’s also where his wife, Jane, informed him that she was pregnant with their first child. If you want a hint of a struggling musician’s life, you can book a room there for $90 a night on Booking.com or simply save some money and snap a picture in front.

The band moved on to two rental homes in the San Fernando Valley. Each had a swimming pool but the group slept on mattresses on the floor and had no furniture other than the lawn furniture from the backyard.

After the release of the unsuccessful single “Depot Street,” the group continued recording at the mansion of musician Leon Russell, the hitmaker who was a founder of Shelter Records, and Mr. Petty would house-sit for him. He would later have his own Encino mansion, which was notoriously burned down by an arsonist in 1987.

But Mr. Petty was still a long way from being able to afford his own mansion. In fact, Shelter Records dropped Mudcrutch from its label while they were still working on music in Mr. Russell’s house.

Mr. Petty would stay on the Shelter payroll, but soon found himself back in a cramped hotel, this time at The Winona Motel (5131 Hollywood Boulevard), which is now the Hollywood Inn Express North (not to be mistaken for a Holiday Inn Express). It’s close to Mr. Petty’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

“I’d gone from living in a rock star’s mansion to a motel room. Which, for some reason, didn’t bother me,” Mr. Petty said of that time. “I didn’t need much. Shelter was across the street, and my whole social world was there.”

At around this time, Mr. Petty’s daughter, Adria, was born in a hospital in Burbank in November 1974. Shortly after, Jane and Adria would move back to Florida to be closer to family while Mr. Petty tried to pick up the pieces of his music career.

“I’d put so much into Mudcrutch, and now it was just dust,” Mr. Petty said. “I had nothing, absolutely nothing to show for years of work.”

But things started to change as Mr. Petty continued to work with Mr. Russell, who took a liking to his work. Before he knew it, he was meeting Mr. Russell’s famous friends like Brian Wilson and working with George Harrison and Ringo Starr at Sound City Studios (15456 Cabrito Road.).

The studio, which reopened in 2017 after being closed for several years, was the subject of the 2013 documentary “Sound City,” produced and directed by Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. Several renowned albums were recorded in the studio, including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’s “Damn the Torpedoes” (1979), Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush” (1970) and Nirvana’s “Nevermind” (1991).

By the end of 1975, Mr. Petty got back together with several members of Mudcrutch to form Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Their first album, self-titled, slowly climbed the charts, and songs like “Breakdown” and “American Girl” would become FM radio staples. The album eventually reached gold status in the United States, and Mr. Petty was well on his way to stardom.

Though he was now ensconced in Los Angeles, Mr. Petty harkened back to his Florida era in a famous lyric in “American Girl,” referencing Route 441, a highway that runs through the state:

It was kind of cold that night She stood alone on her balcony She could hear the cars roll by Out on 441 Like waves crashin’ in the beach

Years later, his 1989 hit “Free Fallin’,” the opening track from “Full Moon Fever,” would serve as sort of a tour of his adopted city: “It’s a long day, livin’ in Reseda”; “all the vampires, walkin’ through the Valley / move west down Ventura Boulevard”; “I wanna glide down over Mulholland...”

By the mid-70s, Mr. Petty had enough cash to buy a red Camaro, which he used to pick up Bruce Springsteen, who called him “around the time he drove off the lot,” according to Mr. Zanes’s book, for a cruise down Sunset Boulevard. Mr. Petty was in a much different position than he was just a few years earlier when he was riding down the same street hunting for his first recording contract.

They picked up several eight-tracks from Tower Records at 8801 Sunset Boulevard, one of the better-known locations of the famed music retailer that ceased operating in 2006. (The guitar maker Gibson Brands took over the space in 2014.)

“They drove until they listened to every song on every one of them. The Stones’ “12 x 5” was among the tapes. When “Congratulations” came on, Springsteen raised his arms to the heavens and said, ‘You can take me now!’ Petty loved that. He liked knowing another man out there who went to the same church,” Mr. Zanes wrote.",Tom Petty’s ‘Greatest Trip’ Was to Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/travel/tom-petty-los-angeles-florida-gainesville.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, representing state regulators, has long opposed association health plans, saying they are bad for consumers because they can operate outside some state consumer-protection laws. In addition, the state regulators said this year in a letter to Congress, proposals to allow such purchasing groups “could actually increase the cost of insurance for many small businesses whose employees are not members of an association health plan.”

But Mr. Trump has presented such plans as a potential solution for millions of Americans. He stated his intentions on Sept. 27 as he left the White House for a trip to Indiana.

“I am considering an executive order on associations, and that will take care of a tremendous number of people with regard to health care,” Mr. Trump said then. “I’ll probably be signing a very major executive order where people can go out, cross state lines, do lots of things, and buy their own health care. And that will be probably signed next week. It’s being finished now. It’s going to cover a lot of territory and a lot of people — millions of people.”

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he had been working with the Trump administration to clear the way for association health plans, which he said would allow more people to obtain good coverage at a lower cost.

“The health care debate is not over,” Mr. Paul said. “Conservatives are still fighting for free-market reforms to the health care system. I am excited to be working with President Trump on this initiative.”

“Association plans would let plumbers, carpenters, welders or any type of small business band together to get group health insurance,” Mr. Paul said recently, describing his vision. “Literally any group — your church, the National Rifle Association, the American Civil Liberties Union — any group of people who choose to do so could offer cheaper, better health insurance.”",Trump Poised to Sign Order Opening New Paths to Health Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-association-health-plans.html

The disrupted Norman Rockwell idyll, and the theme of families dividing, would recur in his early movies: a shark disrupting an American beach summer in “Jaws,” the single-parent family in “E.T.,” the father chasing U.F.O.s in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.”

This sensibility made him mainstream, but that jeopardized his artistic cred, especially coming up in the raging-bull 1970s. Even George Lucas of “Star Wars” fancied himself a rebel. Mr. Spielberg didn’t define himself in opposition to anything. He won respect gradually, through the force of his craft.

Mr. Spielberg’s craving for assimilation extended to his Jewish heritage. He recalls being mortified as a child when his grandfather would call him by his Hebrew name — “Shmuel!” — in front of his friends. “He didn’t want to be Jewish,” his sister Anne Spielberg says, “because it made us different from everybody.” In part, “Schindler’s List” was his way of coming to terms with his identity.

Ms. Lacy created “American Masters” for PBS, and “Spielberg” is in that mold, bringing in dozens of celebrities, critics and colleagues and nearly 30 hours of interviews with Mr. Spielberg. At almost two and a half hours, it’s a vast survey, though it accelerates for the later, elder-statesman part of the director’s career. (“A.I.,” “Minority Report” and “War of the Worlds” are grouped as his dystopian sci-fi trilogy; “Amistad,” “Lincoln” and “Bridge of Spies” under civic order and the rule of law.)

“Spielberg” is laudatory but not unreservedly so. It brings up the critique that he watered down the lesbian sexual elements in his adaptation of Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple” — a film he made in part to prove his seriousness — and Mr. Spielberg recognizes that he was the wrong director to address those themes.

Ms. Lacy doesn’t stint on discussion of technique or clips from Mr. Spielberg’s films; a reel of them early in the documentary reminds you how many images he’s added to our visual vocabulary.

But the first movie scene you see in “Spielberg” is a stunning desert vista from “Lawrence of Arabia,” a screening of which almost drove the young Mr. Spielberg to give up directing. Before Ms. Lacy shows you Mr. Spielberg’s movies, she shows you the movies through his eyes.

For all its sweep, “Spielberg” the documentary succeeds most distinctively where Mr. Spielberg the director has: accessing the child in its subject. Talking about his penchant for suspense, Mr. Spielberg remembers how he used to trap his sisters in a closet with a skull that he’d dripped gory-looking candle wax on. It sounds like a pretty rotten trick, but talking about it now, Mr. Spielberg gets animated.

No one is supposed to worry in Norway.

The Nordic model has been meticulously engineered to provide universal living standards that are bountiful by global norms.

Workers enjoy five weeks of paid vacation a year. Everyone receives health care under a government-furnished program. Universities are free. When babies arrive, parents divvy up a year of shared maternity and paternity leave.

All of this is affirmed by a deep social consensus and underwritten by stupendous oil wealth.

Yet even in Norway, global forces are exposing growing numbers of workers to new forms of competition that limit pay. Immigrants from Eastern Europe are taking jobs. Temporary positions are increasing.

In theory, Norwegian workers are insulated from such forces. Under Norway’s elaborate system of wage negotiation, unions, which represent more than half of the country’s work force, negotiate with employers’ associations to hash out a general tariff to cover pay across industries. As companies become more productive and profitable, workers capture a proportionate share of the spoils.

Employers are supposed to pay temporary workers at the same scale as their permanent employees. In reality, fledgling companies have captured slices of the construction industry, employing Eastern Europeans at sharply lower wages. Some firms pay temporary workers standard wages but then have them work overtime without extra compensation. Unions complain that enforcement patchy.

“Both the Norwegian employer and the Polish worker would rather have low paid jobs,” said Jan-Erik Stostad, general secretary of Samak, an association of national unions and social democratic political parties. “They have a common interest in trying to circumvent the regulations.”

Union leaders, aware that companies must cut expenses or risk losing work, have reluctantly signed off on employers hiring growing numbers of temporary workers who can be dismissed with little cost or fuss.

“Shop stewards are hard pressed in the competition, and they say, ‘If we don’t use them then the other companies will win the contracts,” said Peter Vellesen, head of Oslo Bygningsarbeiderforening, a union that represents bricklayers, construction workers and painters. “If the company loses the competition, he will lose his work.”

Last year, companies from Spain and Italy won many of the contracts to build tunnels south of Oslo, bringing in lower-wage workers from those countries.

Mr. Vellesen’s union has been organizing immigrants, and Eastern Europeans now comprise one-third of its roughly 1,700 members. But the trends can be seen in paychecks.

From 2003 to 2012, Norwegian construction workers saw smaller wage increases than the national average in every year except two, according to an analysis of government data by Roger Bjornstad, chief economist at the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions.

When Mr. Karlsson, the painter, came to Norway from his native Sweden in the mid-1990s, virtually everyone in the trade was a full-time worker. Recently, while painting the offices of a government ministry, he encountered Albanian workers. He was making about 180 kroner per hour, or about $23, under his union scale. The Albanians told him they were being paid barely a third of that.

“The boss could call them, and 20 guys would be standing outside ready to work,” Mr. Karlsson said. “They work extra hours without overtime. They work weekends. They have no vacations. It’s hard for a company that’s running a legitimate business to compete.”

He emphasized that he favored open borders. “I have no problem with Eastern Europeans coming,” he said. “But they should have the same rights as the rest of us, so all of us can compete on equal terms.”

Even in specialized, higher-paying industries, Norwegian wage increases have slowed, as unions and employers cooperate toward improving the fortunes of their companies.

That is a pronounced contrast from past decades, when Norway tallied up the profits from oil exports while handing out wage raises that reached 6 percent a year.

As the global financial crisis unfolded in 2008, sending a potent shock through Europe, Norway’s high wages left businesses in the country facing a competitive disadvantage. That was especially true as mass unemployment tore across Italy, Portugal and Spain, depressing wages across the continent. And especially as German labor unions assented to low pay to maintain the country’s export dominance.

Starting in mid-2014, a precipitous descent in global oil prices ravaged Norway’s energy industry and the country’s broader manufacturing trades. That year, Norwegian wages increased by only 1 percent after accounting for inflation, and by only a half percent the next year. In 2016, wages declined in real terms by more than 1 percent.

Peder Hansen did not relish the idea of a smaller pay raise, but neither was he terribly bothered.

Mr. Hansen works at a nickel refinery in Kristiansand, a city tucked into the nooks and crannies along Norway’s southern coast. His plant is part of Glencore, the mammoth Anglo-Swiss mining firm. He sits at a computer terminal, controlling machinery.

Much of what the refinery produces is destined for factories in Japan that use the nickel to make cars and electronics. Lately, nickel prices have been weak, limiting revenue. This year, Mr. Hansen’s union accepted an increase of about 2.5 percent — a tad above inflation.

“If they were to increase our wages too much, the company would lose customers,” Mr. Hansen says. “It’s as simple as that.”

He exudes faith that his company’s fortunes will be shared with him, because he has lived it. At 24, he earns 630,000 kroner a year, with overtime, or more than $80,000. He owns a two-story house in Kristiansand, and he has two cars, an Audi and an electric Volkswagen. The lives of company executives seem not far removed from his own.

“The C.E.O. of the plant is a humble person,” he said. “You can say ‘Hi.’”

But for some workers, the plunge in oil prices has tested faith in the Norwegian bargain.

In Arendal, a coastal town of wooden houses clustered around a harbor, Bandak, a local employer, succumbed to the crisis. The company made equipment connecting oil pipelines. As orders grew scarce in late 2014, a series of layoffs commenced. Workers ultimately agreed to a 5 percent pay cut to spare their jobs.

“We wanted to keep all of our employees, so we stuck together,” said Hanne Mogster, the former human resources director. “There was a lot of trust.”

But the company soon descended into bankruptcy. And that was that for the 75 remaining workers.

Per Harald Torjussen, who worked on Bandak’s assembly line, managed to find a job at a nearby factory at slightly better pay.

Still, his confidence has been shaken.

“It feels a lot less secure,” Mr. Torjussen says. “We may be approaching what it’s like in the U.S. and the U.K.”","Global Economy’s Stubborn Reality: Plenty of Work, Not Enough Pay",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/unemployment-wages-economy.html

An albino with pale skin and hair, Sunny is treated as an outcast by superstitious locals who call her a witch. But once she discovers her powers, she becomes friends with three other Leopard children, learning to cast spells, read Nsibidi and move between the physical world and spirit realm.

Like her protagonist, Ms. Okorafor, 43, grew up straddling two worlds, never really fitting into either. The daughter of Nigerian immigrants, she was raised in Illinois, but spent holidays with her extended family in Nigeria.

“Nigeria is my muse,” said Ms. Okorafor, who lives in a suburb of Chicago. “The idea of the world being a magical place, a mystical place, is normal there.”

Over the last decade or so, Ms. Okorafor has published a dozen science fiction and fantasy novels, and has emerged as one of the genre’s most innovative and visionary writers. Her stories, which are often set in West Africa, use the framework of fantasy to explore weighty social issues: racial and gender inequality, political violence, the destruction of the environment, genocide and corruption. She’s won virtually every major science fiction and fantasy award, including the Hugo, the Nebula and the World Fantasy Award, as well as the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa.

Now, after developing a cult following, Ms. Okorafor’s gritty, unconventional fantasies are catching on with a much larger, mainstream audience. Her novel, “Who Fears Death,” which is set in a postapocalyptic Africa, has been optioned as a series by HBO, with George R. R. Martin signed on as an executive producer. She’s writing a three-issue arc of Marvel Comics’s Black Panther series, as well as a Marvel comic based on her character Ngozi, a Nigerian teenage girl who is “bonded to the alien symbiotic organism Venom.”

In a genre that has long been dominated by white men and Western mythological tropes, Ms. Okorafor’s stories, which feature young black girls in starring roles as superheroes and saviors of humanity, have been hailed as groundbreaking. Her fan base includes some of the genre’s biggest names, titans like Rick Riordan, Mr. Martin, Ursula K. Le Guin and Neil Gaiman.

“The sheer joy of something like the ‘Akata’ series is the feeling that I simply have not read this before, and that is so rare,” Mr. Gaiman said in an interview. “It’s fantasy, yet it comes from a cultural place that isn’t the stuff we’ve already seen 1,000 times before.”

There’s a long literary strain of science fiction and fantasy that draws on African and African-American folklore, from masters like Ben Okri and Octavia Butler, and a deep tradition of magical realism in African-American literature. But until fairly recently, those stories have often been relegated to the fringes of science fiction and fantasy. The most popular fantasy franchises of the past few decades, from “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” to Mr. Riordan’s Greek mythology-based “Percy Jackson” series, have for the most part been rooted in European myths and legends, as are some of the genre’s canonical texts, like C. S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia” and J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.”

That’s starting to change, as Ms. Okorafor and other African-American speculative fiction writers have risen to prominence, demonstrating that there’s an enormous appetite for fantasy stories that feature diverse characters and settings and tackle contemporary social issues. N. K. Jemisin’s “Broken Earth” fantasy trilogy, which takes place on a continent plagued by catastrophic earthquakes, has sold around 400,000 copies in English worldwide, won the Hugo Award for best novel two years in a row, and is being adapted into a TNT television series.

There’s a flood of new and forthcoming fantasy fiction that draws on African mythology, culture and folklore. The Man Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James is writing an epic fantasy trilogy that draws on ancient African myths and stories, and features bounty hunters, queens, witches, shape-shifters and monsters.

This month, Razorbill will publish “Beasts Made of Night,” a young adult fantasy novel by the Nigerian-American writer Tochi Onyebuchi. The novel takes place in a gritty, dangerous city of Kos, where so-called sin eaters make a living devouring rich people’s sins, absolving them. Mr. Onyebuchi, who has a law degree from Columbia University, envisioned the story as a parable about corruption and inequality in the criminal justice system.

Next March, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers will release Tomi Adeyemi’s debut novel “Children of Blood and Bone,” the first of a young adult trilogy set in a mythical country inspired by West Africa. Holt paid seven figures for the series, and Fox 2000 acquired film rights. Ms. Adeyemi, 24, whose parents moved to the United States from Nigeria, said she wanted to write a fantasy series that drew on her cultural heritage, particularly the gods and goddesses of the Yoruba religion, but that also explored themes like racial and social injustice. “It’s an allegory for the modern black experience through the lens of an epic African fantasy,” she said in an interview.

Lately, Ms. Okorafor is finding herself in increasingly high demand. She recently finished a new novel, “Remote Control,” a fantasy set in near-future Ghana, and just signed a deal to write the third book in her Akata series. She’s also working on a graphic novel, set in a Brooklyn tenement that houses both African immigrants and aliens from outer space.

Ms. Okorafor’s rise as a fantasy novelist came about somewhat by accident. Growing up in an immigrant family, she never thought she could make a living by writing. “As is the case with a lot of Nigerians, and immigrant families in general, there were only three career options: doctor, lawyer and engineer,” she said. “And failure.”

She excelled at sports and science, and was fascinated by insects; she planned to be an entomologist, she said. Then, when she was 19 she had back surgery for scoliosis, and woke up paralyzed from the waist down. Imprisoned in her own body and terrified, she started writing short stories to keep her mind occupied. She recovered over the summer, and when she returned to college, took a creative-writing class. Her path was set.

But when she published her debut novel 12 years ago, she struggled to find an audience. Her first book, a young adult fantasy titled “Zahrah the Windseeker,” sold fewer than 1,000 hardcover copies, according to NPD BookScan. “It was science fiction and fantasy from a Nigerian point of view, and you had this unique book that needed help and got no help,” she said.

Since then, her ascent hasn’t always been smooth. She was stunned when an early cover design for her second young adult novel, “The Shadow Speaker,” featured a white girl, even though the heroine is Nigerian. After she complained to her publisher, the cover was changed. More recently, in what should have been a triumphant moment, Ms. Okorafor’s name was omitted from some headlines announcing the HBO series based on “Who Fears Death,” while Mr. Martin was promoted as an executive producer.

Her “Akata” novels have been met with some resistance in Nigeria, particularly among religious conservatives who say she is glorifying superstition and witchcraft. “They can read ‘Harry Potter’ and be fine with it, but ‘Akata Witch’ is evil,” she said.

At the same time, she understands the apprehension. For some Nigerians, the creatures in her books are not just fantastical beasts — they evoke real beliefs and traditions. While describing her research, Ms. Okorafor listed some of the strange beings in her Akata series that come from Nigerian folklore: tungwas, which are floating balls of flesh, hair, bone and teeth that spontaneously explode; Mami Wata, a mermaid-like water spirit; Udide, a huge talking spider deity that smells like a house on fire; Ekwensu, a powerful and destructive goddess composed of tightly packed palm frond leaves.

It’s somewhat surprising, she admits, that as a celebrated fantasy writer, she often doesn’t have to rely on her own imagination for her wildest inventions.

Dozens of couples danced beside a large painting of a flowering flamboyant tree, and as a five-man band — with a guitar, bass, drum, accordion, and a grooved wooden instrument called a güiro — struck up a merengue, he took her hands. Like the night, they were no longer young; he was 62 and wore orthopedic shoes. But they could dance.

“It’s in our blood,” said Mr. López.

El Deportivo is a social club, one of the neighborhood’s last. Its official name is Centro Cultural Deportivo Dominicano de Nueva York. It was created by domino players in 1966 and still serves mainly as a gathering spot for domino players — as well as fans of table tennis, pool, bingo, softball and bowling. “Deporte” means “sport.”

For a long time, the club was for members only. But as the old Dominican social scene began to be squeezed out by gentrification, about 15 years ago, club members voted to open its almost-hidden door to the public. The club began holding salsa nights on Fridays in its cavernous space on Amsterdam and 163rd Street (it was once a post office), live bands and karaoke on Saturdays, and traditional son dancing on Sundays.

“It’s the best place to relax and be in your culture,” said Mr. López, an assistant to Congressman Adriano Espaillat, who represents Upper Manhattan and part of the Bronx. And in what would have seemed like an impossibility not so long ago, El Deportivo has become one of the last places in Washington Heights for old-fashioned Dominican dancing.

Once, it would have been hard to find a louder place than Washington Heights on a Saturday night. As recently as the 1990s, there were endless domino matches on the sidewalks, boomboxes and parked cars blasting salsa and merengue on every corner, people pouring out of bars and restaurants that turned into dance clubs after hours. Now it’s quieter. On the avenues around Broadway a few men sat smoking hookah pipes that Saturday; there was a single domino match outside a bodega; a boutique was open late for a pop-up Wax ’N’ Sip, where women mixed pink Champagne with hair removal. Otherwise, the streets were calm.

Rising rents have pushed out the last of the raucous restaurants, and in their place are storefront churches, or nothing at all. Night life has moved further uptown, to the northern tip of Manhattan, where swanky clubs and lounges around Dyckman Street cater to a younger Latino crowd.

“It’s harder to find my music,” said Juan Moreno, an El Deportivo regular.

During the week, he works as a parking attendant in Midtown Manhattan. But on Saturday, Mr. Moreno, 51, wore a red suit, white leather shoes and a gold chain with a Che Guevara medallion. Though he lives nearby in Inwood he is still known as “El Cibaeño,” or the man from Cibao, a northern region in the Dominican Republic.

Dancing, he said, is “therapy.” “It’s how we get rid of the stress of the workweek.” That is, he said, real dancing. None of this reggaeton and urban Latin club-mix stuff. No “Despacito.” “Merengue,” he said, “bachata, son dominicano.”

More than 720,000 people in New York City identify as Dominican, according to the most recent figures from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey from 2015. There are more Dominicans in New York City than there are people in Seattle. Decades ago, Washington Heights was known as Santo Domingo Heights and Plátano Heights, home to the majority of the city’s Dominicans. But no longer. Only 23 percent of Dominicans live in Manhattan; 47 percent reside in the Bronx.

Yet when the weekend rolls around, some return to their first home in the city, reuniting at El Deportivo. The social club has about 300 members, or socios, most of them now middle-aged and middle-class. On the first Saturday of the month, there’s a live band, and members bring guests to dance; the cover charge typically goes to fund trips for the club’s sports teams.

That week, the $10 tickets sold at the door went to the table tennis team.

Cecilia Peña, who cleans houses during the week, handed out silver mixing bowls filled with ice and bottles of Corona and Dewar’s from behind a bar — the club’s version of bottle service. Above the bar, a big trophy case was filled with the spoils of bowling and softball tournaments past.

The remnants of a birthday party were spread across one table, and a mylar balloon was still tied to a chair. Men with close-shorn beards milled about in flat-billed caps and baggy suits of every hue.

In the women’s bathroom, women in flowing, off-the-shoulder blouses and skintight pants splashed water on their faces. They passed around a blue bottle of a Victoria’s Secret perfume called Very Sexy Now. They struggled with zippers.

“Less mangú,” or mashed plantains, said one, giving diet advice: “Less rice and beans.”

“Basically,” another woman said, “don’t eat anything Dominican.” Everyone laughed.

Around the dance floor, conversations were kept brief. “No drugs, no trouble,” said Enrique Acevedo, a labor organizer, shouting over the music, as he listed the club’s attributes. Had he had a little to drink? “A little? A lot! But I’m not driving!”

“A bailar! A bailar!” he said, herding a group onto the dance floor. Get dancing!

Dominicans first came to New York in large numbers in the 1960s, after the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the country as a dictator for three decades. After the Trujillo years, social clubs sprouted up everywhere in the Dominican Republic, and newly arrived Dominicans started creating social clubs in New York, too.

El Deportivo was founded 51 years ago by a group of men who played dominoes in their Washington Heights apartments, and as the population exploded over the next decades, the club became known as “La Embajada Dominicana” — the Dominican embassy — said its spokesman, Félix Grant. (Like a real embassy, the club has a formal structure, down to a designated spokesman.) It was a place to take English classes, meet with immigration lawyers to get papers in order, and even to meet future spouses, as Mr. Grant did, 30 years ago.

At El Deportivo, dancing was for a long time an unofficial activity, just as it was all over the neighborhood, where combos played merengue in parks or even on the median along Broadway, creating impromptu dance parties, or what was called a ven tú, or a come-on-over.

It was in the 1980s and early ’90s that the dancing moved indoors. Washington Heights sits at a nexus of highways — the New Jersey Turnpike, the New York State Thruway, the F.D.R. Drive, the Henry Hudson — and in those decades, it became a pick-up spot for dealers of crack cocaine region-wide. As drug gangs like the Wild Cowboys and the Jheri Curls waged a turf war, and violence engulfed the neighborhood, social clubs became safe havens, screening movies and boxing matches, welcoming the combos that once played on the streets.

Social clubs peppered the neighborhood, representing different hometowns in the Dominican Republic, named after national martyrs and heroes. Now few remain. “Clubs began to disappear because of Happy Land,” said Mr. Grant, referring to a fire at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx in 1990 that killed 87 people, one of the deadliest fires in the city’s history. After the fire, Mayor David N. Dinkins ordered police to close down social clubs, which could reopen only if they were brought up to code.

Locked out of their club, members of El Deportivo staged a protest outside. “The members started playing dominoes day after day until they got permission from the city to go back inside,” said Mr. Grant.

“They said, ‘You can’t close our club.’”

Berkis Cruz-Eusebio, 51, is a career and employment specialist at Hostos Community College. On Saturday, she joined girlfriends at El Deportivo, where she is a guest, not a member. They sat at a table unofficially reserved for the club’s head of sports, a few rows from the pista de baile, the dance floor. The talk was of whether they would raise enough money to send the table tennis team on a trip to the island, and, as usual, about their families. “About why our husbands wouldn’t come, or the kids,” said Ms. Cruz-Eusebio, who had left her two adult children and husband of 30 years at home in Fordham Heights, in the Bronx.

She went around the table. “Carmen is a retired teacher, she was a teacher for 20 years, and Gladys is a housewife who watches her grandkids,” she said. One woman marketed medical insurance, another sold Avon cosmetics. She knew some from weekends at the club and others since high school. Like many people there that night, Ms. Cruz-Eusebio began her American life in Washington Heights, arriving from Santo Domingo as a teenager. Her first years, in the mid 1980s, were a “total cultural shock,” she said. “People were shot in bodegas, elevators,” Ms. Cruz-Eusebio recalled. “Witnesses were killed.”

Ms. Cruz-Eusebio’s father had been a major-league baseball player, and before long she was recruited by El Deportivo’s softball coach to pitch for the girls’ team. Pitching and playing second base beat dodging catcalling men on the street, and hiding out at home, she said. “For me, it was a relief to find a refuge, because Washington Heights was completely problematic.”

Ms. Cruz-Eusebio, who became the first in her family to go to college, recalled that in her teenage years she “didn’t have much of a night life,” but at El Deportivo she found something familiar: couples dancing to the lilting melodies of Dominican son, the old-fashioned dance her grandparents had taught her. “It was wholesome,” she said.

And so, although she had once worked hard to leave her troubled neighborhood behind, she kept coming back — to dance. “They say Dominicans are born with music inside,” she said. She stood up from the table and headed to the dance floor. Sparkling in a silver tunic, she lifted her arms and waved them from side to side.

“We don’t walk, we dance.”

On a weekday afternoon, the tiled floor, no longer a pista de baile, was covered with little tables. Men sat playing dominoes and talking, paper coffee cups in hand. It was quiet enough to hear a television, which was tuned to NY1 Noticias, and the fluorescent lights revealed things that had been half-hidden in the dim light of Saturday night: charts with members’ dominoes rankings on the walls, paintings of the scowling founding fathers of the Dominican Republic.

Luis Francisco Veras, a club member known as El Sonerito, sat in a fedora and a candy-striped shirt. He held a yellowed newspaper clipping that showed him dancing with a woman, in 2013, when he took the top prize in a son competition.

Son is African-infused music that evolved about a century ago in the Caribbean and was made famous by the Cuban group Buena Vista Social Club. It is considered the foundation of several genres, including salsa. “To be a good salsero,” Mr. Veras said, “you must first be a good sonero.”

Mr. Veras, 65, was one of 10 children. He learned to dance in Santiago, the birthplace of Dominican son. When he arrived in New York two decades ago, he said, there was just one bar in Harlem to dance son. Then the social clubs opened their doors. Today, he said, there are several places to go. “But El Deportivo is the heart.”

He lives near Yankee Stadium with his wife, a psychologist. He’s retired, but when he still worked at a barbershop near Columbia University, his clients, including professors and students, used to come watch him dance. “It’s very picturesque,” he said, explaining that the suit of a sonero is as important as his step. “A sonero who doesn’t dress like a sonero doesn’t shine.”

His cellphone rang. The ringtone was “El Carretero,” by Guillermo Portabales.

On Saturdays, he said, he arrives at El Deportivo early, and begins the night with a whiskey. He comes with his friend Manuel Cordero, a.k.a. Pachén, at 91 the elder statesman of the soneros. When they dance, the women gather around. “They flirt with us. A lot of women want to dance with us,” Mr. Veras said. Age doesn’t matter. “Everyone wants to dance with the best dancer.”

El Deportivo has moved many times over the years. About two decades ago, its members bought their current building, and from there, they have watched as their local competitors in dominoes and table tennis and softball have dwindled, displaced to the Bronx or disappearing altogether, said Mr. Grant, the club’s spokesman.

Snyder, the author of “Crossing Broadway: Washington Heights and the Promise of New York City,” said social clubs were among the forces that had helped stabilize the neighborhood, before police cracked down on drug-related crime. “It’s very ironic,” he said. “Having stayed and won back their neighborhood from poverty and crime, they now face losing it to economic inequality and gentrification.”

El Deportivo is in no immediate danger, but one of the topics that frequently comes up at the club is what will happen in a generation, when older residents of the neighborhood, and the soneros, are gone. It may depend on winning over a new generation to the old charms.

It was nearly 2 a.m. when Jonathan Jourdain pushed through the door of El Deportivo and, still half-dancing, stepped out onto Amsterdam Avenue. Except for a tobacco shop and a fried chicken joint across the street, the block was dark. Saturday night was winding down.

Mr. Jourdain, 43, wore slacks and a billowy black-and-white shirt, damp with sweat. The next day was Dominican Father’s Day, and he had spent the evening with his father, Bienvenido Jourdain. They had sat at a table in the corner with El Cibaeño and his group, and had cocktails.

“My dad reminisces when he hears these old classic songs, and it rubs off on you,” he said. He didn’t grow up listening to his father’s music, he didn’t know the words. As a second-generation kid in the South Bronx, he heard Spanish at home, but it never caught on, he said. “My Spanish is, as Celia Cruz would say, ‘Not very good-looking.’

“My Dominicanism kicked in later in life. I was brought up as a hip-hop kid.”

He was working as an Amtrak police officer in the early 2000s when he went to the Dominican Republic with the New York Dominican Officers Organization. At dance clubs in Santiago, he heard fast, exhilarating merengue and típico, and was hooked. “I don’t know how to explain it to you,” said Mr. Jourdain. “The music, it just clicked.”

After a friend invited him to El Deportivo, he started coming every weekend. “At bars, people don’t look at you, they don’t shake your hand,” he said. When the club members decided to allow in 50 new members, Mr. Jourdain was encouraged to join. He went up for a vote and paid about $200 (applicants must also submit fingerprints and a letter of good conduct from the police). Now he gets discounts on drinks, a key to the door, and more important, he said, “the prestige of being a socio.”

And, of course, all the dancing he could ever want. “I have learned to dance,” he said, “very, very well.”

People were beginning to trickle out, though the party was still going. A group had gathered at the curb, waiting for a soup vendor, who comes around to feed them at the end of the night, and for the cars that would take them to homes all over the city.

“Time to tuck dad in,” Mr. Jourdain said. “We try to get home early. I don’t want to hear mom’s mouth.”",The Dominican Dance Party That Refuses to Die,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/06/nyregion/saturday-night.html

If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case.
“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.
Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them.
“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.","But American officials have appeared powerless to secure their release, and it has become increasingly clear that the detainees are potential bargaining chips in a long-running effort by Turkey to force the American government to extradite Mr. Gulen.

Mr. Erdogan himself seemed to confirm the suspicion last month, when he told a gathering of police officers in Ankara that he would hand over an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, once the United States gave him Mr. Gulen.

“They say, ‘Give us this certain pastor,’” he said, recounting his meeting with American officials. “You have another pastor in your hands; give him to us,” he railed.

If Mr. Gulen were handed over, the president said, he would sort out Mr. Brunson’s judicial case. “Give him to us and we will put yours through the judiciary; we will give him to you,” Mr. Erdogan said.

At the same time, Turkish officials have repeatedly insisted that the detainees are charged with serious crimes of terrorism and trying to overthrow the state, and that if they are not guilty, the courts will release them in due course.

A presidential aide said in a recent interview that the government had been surprised by the scale of the Gulen network, and believed it had infiltrated nearly every major institution of power. The aide added that the authorities now faced an enormous task to dismantle it. He spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the protocol of his position.

More than 50,000 Turks have been imprisoned and 150,000 more have been suspended from their jobs since the attempted coup in July 2016, which killed 249 people. The crackdown has stretched far beyond the immediate culprits and has swept up people with vague links to the Gulen movement.

The Americans are among them. For the families of the detainees, the drama has shifted from the surreal to deep dread.

Serkan Golge, 37, the NASA scientist of Turkish decent, was arrested in the first frenzy of suspicion and police activity after the coup attempt as he was vacationing in the sleepy southern town of Hatay.

Tipped off by a relative, the police arrested Mr. Golge outside his parent’s house as the family was leaving for the airport to return home to Houston.

At first, his relatives thought it was a bad dream. A year later, as a lengthy prison sentence appears imminent, they are in despair.

“His case is getting worse,” his wife, Kubra Golge, said tearfully in an interview as she cuddled her two small sons. “The lawyer said he no longer knows how to defend the case.”

Since then, she and her two sons, 7 and 19 months, all American citizens, have been barred from leaving the country.

The main evidence against her husband, she says, is the account he held at Bank Asya, a financial institution said to be owned by the Gulen movement, and a dollar bill found in his younger brother’s bedroom that is supposedly a secret sign of membership in the movement.

As the government has begun prosecuting hundreds of Turkish citizens on charges of instigating the coup, the pressure on the Americans and other foreigners has only hardened.

The missionary, Mr. Brunson, lived and raised a family for 23 years in the seaside city of Izmir before he was detained last October and accused of links to the Gulen movement. This summer, he was indicted on new charges of espionage, trying to overthrow the state and acting against the Constitution.

In a recent interview, a presidential adviser defended Mr. Brunson’s continued detention, saying that new evidence must have come to light to merit the additional charges.

But Ihsan Ozbek, the chairman of the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, a fellow pastor and a friend of Mr. Brunson’s, dismissed the accusations.

“Andrew was a normal American Christian; he is not a spy,” he said. “I know him; I know his wife and kids. It’s very sad.”

He suggested, as Western officials have, that foreigners like Mr. Brunson, an evangelical Christian missionary, were being held as hostages for political reasons by Turkey. The new charges came soon after the White House intervention.

A NATO member and a long-term ally of the United States, Turkey would never have dared to arrest Americans in earlier times, said Clyde Forsberg, an American professor who was detained in August last year.

“I was arrested because I was an American,” he said by telephone from the Kyrgyz Republic, where he now lives. “The only reason I was released was because I got lucky. It was very early in the game.”

Accused of aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, Professor Forsberg was released after four days in jail for lack of evidence, and he immediately left the country. The case against him is still pending, and he could have ended up incarcerated for months like Mr. Brunson, he said.

“He is still in prison, and that could have been me,” he said, complaining that United States officials had done little to help.

But appeals by American officials, including Mr. Trump, may have only persuaded the Turkish president that he was holding valuable assets that could be used as leverage over the United States.

Mr. Erdogan has also expressed anger at American court cases brought against his personal bodyguards, who are charged with attacking protesters in Washington in May, and a case against a former minister of Turkey and three others charged with conspiring to violate sanctions against Iran.

Perhaps the most high-profile case may be that of Mr. Brunson. The American vice president, who shares Mr. Brunson’s faith, has shown particular interest in his fate. So have the nearly 80 members of Congress who signed a letter to Mr. Erdogan in February asking him to release the missionary and saying he had been unjustly detained.

“There appears to be no evidence to substantiate the charges against him for membership in an armed terrorist organization,” the letter said.

Most of the other Americans detained hold dual citizenship in Turkey, and United States officials have even less ability to help them. Turkish law regards them as Turkish citizens and ignores their rights as Americans.

United States consular staff members have been given only limited access to the Americans in Turkish prisons and have not been able to visit the Turkish-Americans, such as Mr. Golge, at all.

Among them are Ismail Kul, a chemistry professor from Widener University in Pennsylvania, and his brother Mustafa Kul, a real estate agent. They were arrested in August 2016 at their home in Bursa during their summer vacation. They are accused of being members of the Gulen movement and playing a part in the failed coup.

At his trial, which is continuing, Ismail Kul admitted knowing Mr. Gulen but exposed the shakiness of the government’s charges when he explained that it was a member of Mr. Erdogan’s own ruling Justice and Development Party, Ahmet Aydin, the deputy chairman of Parliament, who first took him to meet the cleric.

“In 2010 I met Ahmet Aydin at a culture festival in Philadelphia,” Mr. Kul told the court, the nationalist daily newspaper Sozcu reported in January. “I had breakfast with him and his detail. They told me that they will see Gulen and suggested that I accompany them. That’s how I met Fethullah Gulen. After that, I visited Gulen four or five times.”

The United States Embassy in Turkey has expressed dismay that even local employees working at United States consulates have been swept up.

It issued a statement on Thursday saying that it was “deeply disturbed” at the arrest of a locally employed staff member in Istanbul. He was identified as Metin Topuz by the Turkish state news media, which said he was accused of having ties to Gulen members, spying and attempting to overthrow the government.

“We believe these allegations to be wholly without merit,” the United States Embassy statement said.

The spokesman for Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, Huseyin Muftuoglu, confirmed that Mr. Topuz had been detained on terror charges Sept. 25, but contended that he was neither a staff member of the American Consulate nor entitled to diplomatic or consular immunity.

Another United States Consulate employee, Hamza Ulucay, who had worked for 36 years in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was detained in February and accused of having contacts with the Gulen movement and the outlawed Kurdish movement, the PKK.

Ms. Golge, 33, the wife of the detained NASA scientist, remains deeply shaken over the trial of her husband, who is expected to be sentenced this month. She describes the shock of his arrest as being like an amputation.

Her American life is gone. She lives with her husband’s parents and visits the prison once a week for a 45-minute chat on a phone through a glass window.

At NASA, her husband was put on unpaid leave. Unable to keep up their mortgage payments, she is selling their house in Houston.

Her husband is resigned, Ms. Golge said. “He is very sad,” she added. “He says, ‘I feel a lot of pain in my heart, but I know it is going to pass.’”

For better and worse, some stand-ups are now treated like political oracles on social media. And during times of tragedy, late night talk show hosts regularly deliver solemn monologues. The day before I interviewed Ms. Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel unleashed a scathing broadside against the Graham-Cassidy health care bill that dominated the conversation about the legislation the next morning.

While Ms. Silverman is avoiding that kind of argumentative tactic in her own show, she saw his success as supporting her views about change. “He was not a political person at all until it affected his life,” she said of Mr. Kimmel, referring to his son, who was born in April with a heart ailment. (Mr. Kimmel and Ms. Silverman once dated.) “Sometimes, it takes a personal experience to get woke to things.”

Ms. Silverman, tall and poised, has a warm presence, listening to questions as intently as she answers them. She sometimes shifts between plain-spoken, even folksy slang and her old kewpie doll voice, code-switching between savvy and silly, gimlet-eyed and wide-eyed.

She grew up in Bedford, N.H., in one of few Jewish families in her neighborhood. Her mother ran a community theater and her father inherited the family clothing business, passing along his sense of humor. When Ms. Silverman was a toddler, he taught her how to say a string of curse words. “She’d sit on his lap — short black bangs, adorable round face — and say this, and we’d all laugh,” recalled her older sister Susan Silverman.

Ms. Silverman, whose childhood bedroom ceiling had “I love Steve Martin” written on it, was a comedy prodigy. She told jokes onstage for the first time at 15, and dropped out of college after freshman year at New York University to work clubs; by 22 she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live.” She lasted only a year, but sketch comedy and sitcoms were never the goal. “She was the rare stand-up back then who didn’t see it as a means,” said Sam Seder, who directed Ms. Silverman in her first film, “Who’s the Caboose?” “Stand-up was the end.”

When asked about her ambition in her first years of New York comedy, she said she wanted to sleep with everyone. “I was so excited about sex once I had it, and I lost my virginity to a comedian, so it was like in front of everyone,” she said. “I was attracted to funny people.” She speaks fondly of her formative days in New York clubs, but also said she now realizes what a “misogynistic culture” she dwelled in.

“I was told: You’re only a real comedian if your material can be said by a male comedian and it still worked,” she said, with exasperation. “I bought that. Looking back, it’s mind-blowing. I accepted talking about the female experience as hack.”

Ms. Silverman eventually pushed past that attitude, telling jokes about sex and dating whose innocent affect belied what she was really saying. Mr. Seder, who dated her in the early 1990s, recalls traveling to New Hampshire with her to perform a benefit given by her mother. On stage Ms. Silverman told a story about how in the middle of licking jelly off her boyfriend’s penis, she realized: “Oh my god, I’m turning into my mother.”

Photo

“I couldn’t believe she did that joke, not just in front of her mother, but her entire world,” Mr. Seder said. “But they laughed.”

Over the next decade, Ms. Silverman developed a reputation as a sharp joke writer and performer, but she burst on the national scene in 2001 after saying a racial slur for Chinese people on “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” that drew condemnation and an apology from the talk show. She debated Guy Aoki, of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans, on “Politically Incorrect.” “That whole Conan controversy made me famous,” she said. “I’m not proud of it but I have to admit it.”

In 2005, Ms. Silverman had a major breakthrough with “Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,” an influential Off Broadway show turned feature film where she made elegantly crafted jokes in the voice of a naïvely offensive Jewish woman. Building jokes about rape, the Holocaust, AIDS and race, she used what she calls her “unreliable narrator” character to distance herself from her material.

She received many glowing reviews, but a critique from A.O. Scott in The New York Times made her take a hard look at her act. It argued that her kind of ironic, transgressive humor flatters herself and her audience, playing it safe. “Looking back now, I was playing an ignorant character, but I also really was ignorant,” she said. “When A.O. Scott wrote that, it hit me hard. I just felt like it opened up my mind like a good hallucinogeni …”

Ms. Silverman paused, made a bewildered face and repeated the word “hallucinogenic” several times with slightly different pronunciations, tilting her head in a pantomime of confusion. Twice during the interview, she flamboyantly searched for the right way to say a word; she did it once in her test show, turning it into a self-deprecating verbal pratfall.

“I Love You, America” marries a long-running interest in scatological humor and stomping on taboos with a new, more politically conscious voice. In a video segment where she spends time with a family who never met a Jew before, she bonds with their young boy with the great unifier: a fart joke.

Unlike many veteran comics, Ms. Silverman does not lament that political correctness is ruining comedy, saying she no longer uses words like “retard”; on her test show, she brought up “micro-aggressions.”

“If you’re so scared of changing with the times, then you’re old,” she said. “There are comedians I love to pieces who roll their eyes. ‘Oh, another word I can’t say.’ You don’t know enough words?”

The presidential election was clearly a turning point for Ms. Silverman. On the night Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Silverman was walking her dog when her sister called. “She was sobbing, beside herself, like her guts were coming out,” Susan Silverman said, “but in that conversation, she said we have to start listening to each other and can’t go on like this in our own echo chambers.”

Ms. Silverman’s attitudes about ambition have changed too. She said she now puts her career first, adding that while she loves her current boyfriend — the British actor Michael Sheen — the relationship works because he lives an ocean away. “I’ve watched myself over many years give up a lot of things because I’m in relationships,” she said, describing herself as “oddly subservient” in romance. “I’m older now and I don’t want to do that. I want to make stuff that matters and put my whole self into it.”

Ms. Silverman has done more dramatic acting of late (see the current “Battle of the Sexes”) but after a few narrative pilots for television didn’t work out, she decided she wanted to try something closer to stand-up, a show where she plays herself, looks at the camera and talks to people who don’t necessarily agree with her. But it’s not easy.

She invited the conservative comic Dennis Miller to be a guest, but he turned her down. When she noticed that Ivanka Trump followed her on Twitter, she sent her a direct message, saying she has a chance to make a difference. No response, she said. (“I’ve given up on her since.”) And her forays into red state America for her show — she traveled to a small Texas town where President Trump won by 87 percent and spent a day with a family of Trump voters in a suburb outside New Orleans — have led to culture clashes.

In Louisiana, a female Trump voter complained that President Barack Obama gave away “handouts,” while her family talked about being on Medicaid. Ms. Silverman spends more time listening than fact-checking, which may not satisfy liberals who delight in seeing John Oliver or Samantha Bee eviscerate conservatives. At the same time, it’s hard to see Trump voters thinking this segment is for them either.

The most obviously commercial aspect of the show may be Ms. Silverman’s star power. A live-wire performer, she has a sly, teasing sensibility that has always been far too off-kilter to be blandly relatable. Whether she has enough room to roam will likely be crucial to the show’s success.

Reflecting on her interactions with the family in Louisiana, Ms. Silverman said that she had a good time and found agreement on some issues, like same-sex marriage. When asked if this visit made her more hopeful for change, Ms. Silverman weighed her words carefully. “What makes me hopeful is when you’re face to face you can still enjoy and respect each other,” she said. “Did we change minds? No.”

What’s important, she said, is accepting that you might not always be right. Years of therapy have helped her find the joy in realizing when she is wrong. “I am lucky because most people hate it,” she said. “I’ve dated guys who I love to death but they cannot say sorry. It would kill them to say sorry. To me, I love it. It makes the person I’m talking to feel so good. A total high.”

This was apparent in our interview when we disagreed over how to categorize “I Love You, America.” I saw it as a talk show. Ms. Silverman disagreed, associating that genre with topicality and a guest promoting projects. When I said it’s interesting that she resists the term, she responded sharply that it’s interesting that I want to pigeonhole the show. It was tense, but not for long.

She paused, than flashed a big smile. “O.K., I am a host,” she said. “I don’t care, whatever you want to call it.”

On the show, her guests are people who have undergone a change, and it’s clear that Ms. Silverman puts a premium on transformation (Megan Phelps-Roper, who left the Westboro Baptist Church, an ultraconservative group, will be a future guest).

Making dosas at home is not hard, but there is a learning curve.

The batter required a trip to an Indian grocery for ingredients, then 24 hours to soak, grind and ferment. But it was easier than making bread dough since I didn’t have to knead.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — TGIF, everyone! What a way to kick off the weekend; Damon Gulczynski has returned for his seventh themeless puzzle this year, and like all the rest of his work, it’s chock-full of pizazz.

Themelesses by their nature have numerous longer entries, and they show off overall vocabulary as opposed to an interesting theme, with a few fun nuggets of surrounding fill. However, there are many different styles to actually creating a themeless that should be noted. Some constructions are focused on a formidable-looking grid that has super smooth fill and a low word count. Other grids are less open, yet their longer answers are much flashier and thus allow the solver to overlook any dull, shorter fill.

Today, Mr. Gulczynski presents us with a hybrid of this concept: at 70 words total, he hasn’t quite reached the maximum allowed for a themeless (72), and yet the grid doesn’t appear very open. However, every answer of eight or more letters ranges from good to phenomenal: PHALANGE, I DARE NOT, GARY HART, SODA JERK, TELEKINESIS, OVER THE HUMP, HOVERBOARDS, IT’S NO BIGGIE, GIVE ME A RING, PABLO NERUDA, GENDER-BINARY and JOLLY RANCHER. That’s a ton of juicy fill.

As I said above, with so many marquee entries, the shorter fill usually suffers. But today? I pored over this grid post-solve, as I do when working with Will and Joel on submissions, and I couldn’t find more than three — maybe five, if I’m being super nitpicky — subpar answers. Can you guess which ones they were?

To have a puzzle be both so smooth and so exciting is near impossible, though Mr. Gulczynski makes it look easy. Let’s take a look at the cluing:

Chan School of Public Health, examined the relationship between plant-based diets of varying quality and the risk of developing coronary heart disease among more than 200,000 health professionals. The participants, who started the study free of chronic disease, were followed for more than two decades, submitting their dietary patterns to the researchers every two years.

Based on their responses on food-frequency questionnaires, the participants’ diets were characterized by the team as an overall plant-based diet that emphasized plant foods over animal foods; a healthful plant-based diet emphasizing healthful plant foods; or an unhealthful plant-based diet. Any of the diets could have included various amounts of animal products.

Healthful plant foods like whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, as well as vegetable oils, coffee and tea, received a positive score, while less-healthful plant foods like juices, sweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes and fries, and sweets along with animal foods were assigned a negative rating.

The more closely the participants adhered to a healthful plant-based diet, the less likely they were to develop heart disease in the course of the study. Those with the least healthful plant-based diet were, on average, 32 percent more likely to be given diagnoses of heart disease. In a prior study, the researchers found a similar reduction in the risk of Type 2 diabetes of a healthful plant-based diet.

The team, led by Ambika Satija of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, concluded that “not all plant foods are necessarily beneficial for health.”

Interestingly, the Harvard finding was nearly identical to one from an 11-year European study that found a 32 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease among vegetarians than among nonvegetarians, although no health-based rating was given to the quality of the participants’ vegetarian diets.

The more detailed Harvard study, which examined gradations of adherence to a plant-based diet, found that “even a slightly lower intake of animal foods combined with a higher intake of healthy plant foods” was associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease.

In other words, you don’t have to become a strict vegetarian to protect your heart. Simply reducing your dependence on animal foods, and especially avoiding those high in fat, is helpful. In fact, “a diet that emphasized both healthy plant and healthy animal foods” was associated with a coronary risk only slightly higher than a diet based almost entirely on healthy plant foods, the researchers found.

On the other hand, overdoing “less healthy plant foods” and less healthy animal foods like red and processed meats, the study showed, significantly increased the risk of developing heart disease.

The Harvard findings lend further support to the most recently released Dietary Guidelines for Americans that urge people to consume large amounts of “high-quality plant foods,” the researchers noted. They added that the recommended diet “would also be environmentally sustainable” because plant-based food systems require fewer resources than those that rely heavily on animal foods.

Thus, the more plant foods and the fewer animal foods you eat, the lower your carbon footprint and the less you would contribute to animal suffering. But to be truly beneficial, the plant foods you choose must be rich in nutrients.

Although most Americans rely heavily on animal foods for needed protein, it’s not difficult to get quality protein on a vegetarian diet that contains dairy foods and eggs. Pescatarians, who add fish to such a diet, get a nutritious bonus of healthful omega-3 fatty acids along with high-quality protein from fish and shellfish.

Those choosing a strict vegan diet — one devoid of all foods from animals — face a greater challenge because the protein in plants is not complete and must be balanced by consuming complementary sources, like beans and grains. A sandwich of almond butter or peanut butter on whole-grain bread is totally vegan and an excellent example of balanced protein in a high-quality plant-based diet. Vegans also must supplement their diet with vitamin B-12.

Short of becoming a vegan, you can improve your diet, protect your health and add variety to your meals by a few simple dietary adjustments. For example, as Dr. Hena Patel and Dr. Kim Allan Williams Sr., cardiologists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, suggested in a commentary on the Harvard study, you might choose one day a week to be meatless and gradually add more meatless days while adding one or more new plant-based recipes each week.

I bet you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how much more delicious and varied your meals will be.","Good Vegan, Bad Vegan",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/well/eat/good-vegan-bad-vegan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

I have been writing about North Korea since 1992, when President George H. W. Bush’s administration held the United States’ first meeting with Pyongyang since the Korean War to discuss what was then an incipient nuclear program. I had long wanted to visit. What made it possible now is that North Korea, the world’s least transparent country, has decided to embark on a charm offensive, inviting major American news organizations on separate visits this year to learn more about its economic and political goals.

Our trip has not been without some risk, given the way the American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in Pyongyang after allegedly trying to steal a poster, fell into a coma under circumstances that remain mysterious and died days after being returned to the United States. While I and the other Times journalists were invited by the Foreign Ministry (The Times paid all expenses), the diplomats don’t control the security services, and our attempts to report have been a balance between trying to get the most authentic information we can (a struggle) and not running afoul of security. Two government minders accompanied us except when we were in our rooms.

We were allowed to visit a silk factory, the science and technology complex (computers are connected to an internal intranet, not the internet), an elite high school and an anti-American war museum, as well as an amusement park, restaurants and a dolphinarium — evidence of Kim Jong-un’s efforts to allow citizens of Pyongyang, where the elite live, opportunities for fun. Our requests to see the three remaining American detainees were refused. Despite such controls, there have been some moments of spontaneous humanity. After dinner one night, a senior official led me briefly in ballroom dancing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant.

I most wanted to learn whether the North Koreans were open to nuclear talks with the United States and what it might take to get a deal. In the 1990s, the two sides reached an agreement that froze the North’s plutonium program for eight years and made progress on missile limits. But these initiatives fell apart in the George W. Bush administration, and today North Korea has at least 20 nuclear weapons and missiles that may soon be able to reach the continental United States, a level of technological prowess that Mr. Trump has said he won’t tolerate.

In Mr. Choe’s telling, North Korea was driven to become a nuclear power in self-defense against America’s “nuclear blackmail,” sanctions, history of confrontation, and affront to the sovereignty and dignity of the state. The North must establish “a balance of power” to hold Washington at bay, finally replace the Korean War armistice with a permanent peace treaty and focus attention on economic development, he said. Therein seemed to be the answer to my question of whether and under what circumstances the North would be open to talks. Only when Washington makes a “bold decision” to end its military exercises with South Korea, halt sanctions and cease moves that diplomatically isolate North Korea can a dialogue between the two countries bear fruit, he added.

Our interviews have persuaded me that it is also imperative for Washington to ease up on the rhetoric. Mr. Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month crossed a line for many North Koreans because it made the fight deeply personal, disparaging Mr. Kim as “rocket man” and threatening to “totally destroy North Korea,” a country of 26 million people.

The Trump administration insists there can be no talks until the North halts missile and nuclear tests for an unspecified period. Hence, stalemate, and a dangerous one. Allowing the shouting match and muscle-flexing on both sides to gather momentum can come to no good.",Seeing the North Korean Stalemate From the Other Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/north-korea-stalemate.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

Photo

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Photo

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

Lin-Manuel Miranda, ‘Almost Like Praying’

Most of the lyrics to “Almost Like Praying,” the benefit single for Puerto Rican hurricane relief organized by Lin-Manuel Miranda , are the names of towns in Puerto Rico, passionately sung and rapped by a multigenerational assembly of 20 American and Latin-American musicians including Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Luis Fonsi, Juan Luis Guerra, Rubén Blades, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Ednita Nazario, Fat Joe and Rita Moreno. The music is multigenerational, too, bridging reggaeton, salsa and Broadway, with Mr. Miranda singing lines from the “West Side Story” song named, like the hurricane, “Maria.” JON PARELES

Kehlani, ‘Honey’

“Honey” is a quietly lilting acoustic number from Kehlani, a singer who’s thrived in more processed, 1990s-referencing environments. But here she’s calm and grounded — in her singing at least. The lyrics tell a different story: “I’m a beautiful wreck/A colorful mess, but I’m funny/Oh, I’m a heartbreak vet.” JON CARAMANICA

Big K.R.I.T., ‘Keep the Devil Off (Take 1)’

The kinship between rapping, preaching and the shouts of soul and gospel singers has always been clear, but it’s rarely so upfront as it is in “Keep the Devil Off (Take 1)” by Big K.R.I.T., the longtime Mississippi rapper who has recorded his share of both high-living boasts and pointed social commentary . “Keep the Devil Off (Take 1),” produced by Big K.R.I.T., is from an album due Oct. 27, “4EVA Is a Mighty Long Time.” The song rides a sweaty funk-gospel groove revved up by jabbing, swooping organ chords, a wah-wah guitar and fervent women’s call-and-response vocals. Big K.R.I.T., hortatory and percussive, exults in his rise “from the bottom of the map to the top of the mountain,” while he warns, “What good those riches if you’re six feet under?” J.P.

The Breeders, ‘Wait in the Car’

“Wait in the car!” Kim Deal snarls on the Breeders’ first song in 24 years to feature all four members of the lineup that played on its 1993 breakout album, “Last Splash.” “I got business.” The bassist Josephine Wiggs and the drummer Jim Macpherson returned to the fold with Ms. Deal and her sister Kelley for a “Last Splash” anniversary tour and spun the reunion into new music (7-inch records will be available on the band’s fall tour). It sounds less like the spacier explorations of the Deals’ 2008 album “Mountain Battles” and more like the crispy rock of the band’s 1990 debut, “Pod.” Bonus points for including the lyric “Μeοw meow meow meow meow.” CARYN GANZ

Bermuda Triangle, ‘Suzanne’

Brittany Howard, a vocal powerhouse in Alabama Shakes, eases off in “Suzanne” with her latest project Bermuda Triangle, a trio with Becca Mancari and Jesse Lafser. It’s a lament about a frustrating triangle: “You love Suzanne and I love you,” Ms. Howard observes. “She don’t want you but I do/She makes us lonely together.” It starts like a casual demo — a syncopated guitar and Ms. Howard’s breathiest croon, joined in the second verse by a drum machine and harmony vocals — but wanders into surprisingly murky territory before it’s over. J.P.

Charlie Puth, ‘How Long’

The unraveling of Charlie Puth continues anon. The once tightly controlled pop-soul singer is maturing with a robust second act full of bruises. Following his sinister thumper “Attention” comes “How Long,” a sweet song that masks pulsing sadness at every turn. J.C.

Sarah Elizabeth Charles, ‘Zombie’

Ms. Charles, a young singer of full-throated poise, started writing the material for “Free of Form” in 2014, after the death of Eric Garner at the hands of New York City police. That album, out Friday and co-produced with the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah , is laden with introspection and calls to conscience, but rarely weighted down. With help from her backing trio, Scope, words of indignation and warning come wrapped in a hazy indeterminacy. Covering the Cranberries’ “Zombie,” she sounds the alarm on a dichotomy you’ll recognize: The fleeting scroll of brutal imagery and ideas that plays upon our minds can leave us feeling withdrawn — even disembodied. “When the violence causes silence/We must be mistaken,” she sings. On the soaring chorus, she funnels the philosophy down to a challenge: “What’s in your head/In your head, zombie?” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Jazmine Sullivan and Bryson Tiller, ‘Insecure’

There’s now a music video for “Insecure,” a duet about pathological jealousy that was first heard on Issa Rae ’s HBO series of the same name. Over a slow track full of silences, Jazmine Sullivan complains about being distrusted and relentlessly interrogated, singing, “I’m your lady not a slave.” Bryson Tiller responds, “Control freak? I tell you that’s better than no freak.” The video mostly promotes the show, but it also points up the syllabic rush of the verses, while the song suggests things won’t end happily: “I won’t take that no more,” Ms. Sullivan warns. J.P.

Schnellertollermeier, ‘Rights (Part 1)’

Here's a rapid, nervous Minimalist evolution, from quick staccato picking and percussion tapping, to the emergence of a guitar riff, to a full-band insistence on a stomping 7/4 riff. The trio of the guitarist Manuel Troller, the bassist Andi Schnellmann and the drummer David Meier have learned well from groups like the Necks , from Australia, and made music that's more methodical and ominous. In “Rights (Part 1),” after the riff takes over, there’s a wrenching key change, a swerve and pullback and a reminder of the opening, which seems to be eons in the past after all that pounding and blasting. J.P.

Anat Cohen Tentet, ‘Anat’s Doina’

Anat Cohen can easily get by on the sanguine grace of her clarinet playing, and the way her succinct and joyful compositions elevate it. But a new album, “Happy Song,” features a 10-piece band playing the wily arrangements of Oded Lev-Ari, a fellow Israeli jazz musician. He gives the music a different kind of depth and coagulation. On “Anat’s Doina,” a klezmer-inspired suite written by Ms. Cohen, the distant electric guitar, vibraphone and accordion evoke the chatter of an urban scene, and the resonance of a fable.

It happened again last fall against the Cleveland Indians: two road losses, then a season-ending dud at Fenway.

If the Red Sox lose on Sunday, they will have finished eight of their last nine seasons without a single playoff victory. The shining exception, of course, was 2013, when they won the World Series. Just two players from this postseason roster — Pedroia and shortstop Xander Bogaerts — were also on that one.

“I don’t think, roster-wise, we probably had the best team going into that postseason,” Bogaerts said. “I know a lot of people didn’t pick us, but in the end, we did it. We did it as a team.”

He added that those Red Sox faced a two-games-to-one World Series deficit in St. Louis but rallied to win the next three.

“That was one of the hardest things to overcome, and we did it,” Bogaerts said. “It’s nothing that big, like that time.”

So much has changed in just four years, especially with Boston’s offense. Those Red Sox led the majors in on-base plus slugging percentage. These Red Sox finished 22nd in O.P.S., at .736, far below even the sad and broken Mets. The nine other playoff teams held the top nine spots in that statistic.

“Everything will be all right,” he said, referring to the wrist, not the team’s chances. Those hinge largely on Doug Fister, the journeyman right-hander who lost to the Astros last Friday. Fister has a strong playoff track record, but his earned run average was 4.88 this season. The Red Sox plucked him off the roster of the Class AAA Salt Lake Bees, an Angels affiliate, in June.

They spent far more for their other starters. They traded gems from their farm system in deals for Sale and Pomeranz. In 2014, they traded the October stalwart Jon Lester to Oakland for Yoenis Cespedes, then flipped Cespedes to Detroit for Rick Porcello. They signed David Price in free agency for seven years and $217 million.

So where do they stand now? Sale and Pomeranz — neither of whom had ever started in the playoffs before — combined to allow 11 runs and 14 hits in seven innings against the Astros. Price and Porcello have pitched in relief, Price because elbow trouble limits his workload, and Porcello because his rough season (11-17, 4.65) has knocked him from the rotation’s top three.

These games have gone so miserably that Craig Kimbrel, the All-Star closer who strikes out nearly half of all hitters, was reduced to mop-up duty on Friday, just to stay sharp. He held the deficit at seven with a scoreless eighth inning.

The Red Sox scored in the top of the ninth, but thankfully, nobody cited that as a show of character, or a willingness to fight to the end. It would have rung hollow, anyway, because the facts are clear: The Red Sox have had a nice season, with another A.L. East title. But their hitters cannot keep up with the Astros, and their pitchers cannot stop them.

“Every single game, 1 through 9, everybody can do damage, everybody can go deep,” said Houston’s Carlos Correa, whose first-inning homer started the party on Friday. “There’s no holes in our lineup.”

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

Pork with salted vegetable soup, paired with ‘S.O.B.s’ (Season 3, Episode 9)

Lindsay Bluth Fünke is, like a majority of her siblings, an entitled dilettante without much of an instinct for domesticity. Perhaps that’s why, when she finds a can of ham, she decides to put it in a pot of boiling water. It’s not soup, she tells her brother, it’s a more literal interpretation: “hot ham water.”

The results are mixed. Buster, the youngest and simplest Bluth sibling, assesses the dish this way: “So watery. And yet there’s a smack of ham to it.” If you’re looking for an elevated take on hot ham water, I recommend this recipe by Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, which combines egg noodles, fresh pork (not canned) and so-called Shanghai cabbage (canned) with Chinese flavors.

Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.

Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.

Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime. Mr. Mueller is building cases against two of Mr. Trump’s former advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Michael T. Flynn. Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller’s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.

Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.

“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.

“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.

Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.

Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.

“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.

Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.

But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.

One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.

Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.

But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.

The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.

That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.

“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”","Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html

Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.

Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Photo

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Photo

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro.

“The depth of [his] knowledge of this world of rock ‘n’ roll, experimental thought, anti-consumerism and political possibility is wild — it’s like the role was built for him,” Ms. Chavkin said by email. “He’ll just pause things for a moment to tell a story about this singer or that band, and it’s (happily) completely in line with this play. And the younger cast members, who are early-to-mid 20s, as well as myself and Sarah, just eat it up.”

‘The Epicenter of Everything’

Decades of karate and “knuckle push-ups” have kept Mr. Kelly compact and lean, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. When I saw him this spring in “Everybody,” he popped out of a seat a few rows behind me with a beard that made him look like an elfin Santa Claus. A few months later, clean-shaven and in an electric-blue suit, he was still a ball of energy. (A smaller beard is back.)

And his multifaceted intellectual interests were apparent in the first 15 minutes of an interview: He referenced Godard, Eisenstein and Artaud, the Polish experimentalist Jerzy Grotowski and the Chinese director Chen Shi-Zheng, with whom he studied Asian theater techniques.

It’s this voracious appetite that has kept him grounded, so to speak, in New York, rather than trying to parlay his Hollywood connections into a larger film career. He’d rather spend his time mastering karate in preparation for the Shakespearean generals he still hopes to play, or practicing mandolin with his 8-year-old daughter, a budding actress and violinist.

Mr. Kelly is a Detroit native; as a freshman at Wayne State University in 1969, one of his first drama instructors was a graduate student named Jeffrey Tambor. After graduating from the University of Detroit, he followed a friend to New York, taking a $25-a-night job at Max’s Kansas City, what he calls “the epicenter of everything.”

He soaked in the budding Manhattan art world, wrote his own plays and jammed with his band in a bedroom that is now the rehearsal room of New York Theater Workshop.

“My generation — late ‘60s, early ’70s — was very influenced by rock ‘n’ roll and circus techniques and bizarre theatrical things, because everything was getting more theatrical,” he said. “I think punk was a reaction to that.”

Photo

He continues to challenge limits, getting the chance to play mandolin in the Dublin-set musical “Once,” which had a long, acclaimed Broadway run.

After all, he pointed out, “Shakespeare’s actors could do everything: They played instruments, they fenced, they danced, and they said those words.”

Ayn Rand Meets David Lynch

The director Walter Hill cast Mr. Kelly in his first screen role, as the villain Luther in “The Warriors,” the cult classic that imagines a New York City divided among rival gangs. Mr. Kelly, at the film’s climax, improvised its most famous line, the one quoted by Ol’ Dirty Bastard on the Wu-Tang Clan’s 1993 debut album: “Warriors! Come out to play!” (“I think he’s dissonant in there,” he said of the rapper’s intonation.)

From there, he supplemented a steady stream of film and TV gigs — “48 HRS,” “Miami Vice,” “Moonlighting” — with headier stage commitments: “Woyzeck,” “Twelfth Night,” “Tartuffe.”

“I’ve always appreciated kind of genre cinema — action films, things like that,” he said of his appreciation for “one-scene wonders” like the actors Eli Wallach or Bruce Dern. “Because you can kind of sneak in poetics and comments on the world.”

Photo

Poetics and “Commando”? Mr. Kelly’s ease moving between high- and lowbrow creative worlds has given him a certain respect for all the roles he is given. There is no reason, in his mind, not to imbue a smaller TV role with the same motivations used for a Greek classic onstage.

“What’s the greatest idea? Why are we doing these things? Why are we doing this play?” Mr. Kelly said. “Forgive me if it sounds pretentious, but it’s Martin Heidegger: Language is being. ‘Language is the house of being, and we are the caretakers of being.’ If it’s cinematic language, or it’s literal poetry, that’s what gets me going.”

Mr. Kelly’s love for that cinematic language put him in David Lynch’s orbit when he was cast in the director’s 1990 film “Wild at Heart.” That role led to another in a TV series Mr. Lynch was planning: “Twin Peaks.”

“I was an actor who didn’t want to do television,” Mr. Kelly said. “Laura Dern and Nic Cage convinced me, they were the ones that said, ‘You should do this, it’s going to be something very special.’ ”

Mr. Lynch wrote Mr. Kelly into the story as the cheese-obsessed, sociopathic entrepreneur Jerry Horne. It was a small role, but the actor found a way to make it culturally significant.

“I based Jerry Horne on Ayn Rand, ‘Atlas Shrugged’ — this idea of the virtue of selfishness — and the National Enquirer version of the Kennedy brothers,” Mr. Kelly said. “If you read that and believed every bad thing about the Kennedy brothers that was in there, that’s what I tried to do.”

The show took off in 1990, but Mr. Kelly didn’t wait around for his Hollywood break: He had a Greek drama to do in Boston.

“My agent said, ‘Are you nuts? This is the hottest thing on television!’” Mr. Kelly recalled, laughing. “I didn’t have a television, so I had to go to the sports bars in Boston and ask them, whenever it was on, I can’t remember when it was on, Thursday night, I think, if they could switch to ‘Twin Peaks.’”

In Showtime’s recent 18-hour “Twin Peaks” return, his moments as Jerry Horne, now an edible-marijuana magnate too high on his own supply, were part of the absurdist glue that held the plot together.

Mr. Kelly’s countless bit parts have taught him, in Ms. Chavkin’s words, “to vibrate on his own plane.”

“We get taught there’s a way a ‘hero’ looks,’’ she explained. “Then there’s the ‘side story’ of the strange guy, which I think tends to be much more interesting.”","David Patrick Kelly, a Character Actor Vibrating on His Own Plane",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/theater/david-patrick-kelly-actor-twin-peaks.html

He visibly swelled with self-satisfaction, as he did weeks later, down in Alabama, celebrating the insurgent Senate candidacy of Roy Moore.

Was Moore’s appeal to Bannon the fact that as recently as last December, he was still promoting the lie that Barack Obama was born abroad? Was it his freak-out over homosexuality, which he has likened to bestiality? Or was it the overarching reality that Moore, like Grimm, makes Republican congressional leaders’ skin crawl? For Bannon, Moore is an instrument of torture, and after he won the Republican primary less than two weeks ago, Bannon and his allies made clear that the scheming and dark fun had only just begun.

In Mississippi they’re trying to persuade Chris McDaniel to wage a Republican primary battle against Senator Roger Wicker, an incumbent up for re-election next year. I’m not entirely sure what Wicker’s crimes against populism are, but I can tell you a bit about McDaniel, who’s a real charmer. After the Women’s March in late January, he wrote a Facebook post that asked: “If they can afford all those piercings, tattoos, body paintings, signs and plane tickets, then why do they want us to pay for their birth control?” Their birth control? There’s some male involvement in unwanted pregnancies and some male investment in preventing them, especially if the male, like McDaniel, is assertively anti-abortion.

On a radio show that he once hosted, McDaniel mocked the idea of learning any Spanish by volunteering his own translations of “mamacita.” “I think it basically means, ‘Hey, hot mama,’ ” he said. “Or, you know, ‘You’re a fine-looking young thing.’ ” He’s a nasty-sounding old thing, which is another way of saying that he’s catnip to the likes of Bannon.

Other Republicans in the Senate who are up for re-election, on Bannon’s hit list and in serious danger of defeat in their primaries include Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Their colleague Bob Corker of Tennessee pre-empted that kind of ordeal by deciding to retire at the end of this term, and Tennessee’s Republican governor, Bill Haslam, resisted entreaties to enter the race and tussle with furious Bannonites.

And so the G.O.P., hardly a paragon of sanity over recent years, is looking loonier than ever. “The formula is to be more aggressive, more outrageous, don’t back down from crazy statements,” one longtime Republican strategist told me. He’s aghast at the fault lines that he sees opening, for instance between Republicans with an appropriate wariness toward Trump and those who demand unwavering fealty to him.

The latter camp includes Nick Ayers, who is Mike Pence’s chief of staff. According to an audiotape obtained by Politico, he recently urged major Republican donors to “purge” Trump-bucking lawmakers by denying them any money and instead funding Republican challengers.

For Democrats aiming to capture the Senate and House majorities, this is in one sense great news. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes elections for The Cook Political Report, told me that “Republicans’ two toughest Senate races — Nevada and Arizona — are winnable with the incumbents but are going to be very, very rough if the Bannon-backed candidates are the nominees.”

In addition, Duffy said, “You look at Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi — nominating the wrong candidate could potentially put those races in play for Democrats.”

So is Bannon miscalculating horribly and simply out of his gourd? No. He’s not thinking in the conventional terms of Republicans versus Democrats; he’s thinking that “any disruption is a good thing, and that the best way to get what he wants — a white-centered, nationalist America — is to blow up the establishment,” the Republican strategist said. Other Republican operatives concurred.

If Bannon can bend the G.O.P. in its current form to that vision, great. If he can’t, then he might as well destroy it to make room for something else. If Democrats grab the reins of power in the meantime, so be it. He’ll sow and enjoy as much mayhem as he can along the way, and somehow deems that preferable to the status quo.

Moore, McDaniel and Grimm aren’t perfect ideological companions, but they’re chaos candidates, and if they manage to get to Congress and the G.O.P. maintains its majorities there, heaven help us all. Just think about what they’ll inject into the formal debate on Capitol Hill; just think about how much further they’ll warp it. It could make the Tea Party’s ascent in 2010 seem tame.

Think about this, too: Moore was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for failing to abide by federal orders. When they came into conflict with his conscience, meaning his extremely conservative interpretation of Christianity, he prioritized the latter. You could call that a triumph of principle. You could also call it a collapse of civic responsibility and respect for the system.

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

Photo

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

Photo

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

I always have my iPhone, my battered Olympus digital recorder, a small spiral notebook and a pocketful of pens taken from cheap hotels. (I figure the hotels owe me for all the free advertising I have given them over the years.) I’m learning I can have nothing but an iPhone and I’m fine.

I don’t cover live events much these days, because I mostly write longer, broader pieces. I work out of my house and from the road. When I do go to games, or when I sit to do serious research and write, it’s on a Times-issued MacBook Air. It’s what I’m using right now, typing this into a Google Doc.

The game changer was the smartphone. It's not only my office phone. I can also use it to record interviews (its microphone is better than the one in my old Olympus, which is important in crowded, noisy places), take pictures and videos to help me remember the details of what I see, and even type or speak notes and interview answers into emails that I send myself.

I use it the way other people use their phones. I email, text, tweet, post to Instagram, get directions, set timers and alarms, change flights, check weather, update my calendar, map my jogs, and listen to podcasts and Spotify during long drives or plane rides. On assignment, I’ve had entire conversations with Google Translate, two of us passing my phone back and forth.

Besides being an all-in-one communication tool, the iPhone helps my writing. I take photographs of places I know I’ll want to describe in detail later — the inside of someone’s home, a rocky mountain summit, a piece of jewelry that a subject is wearing, the shape of the clouds and the color of the sky. I take videos of places, too, and narrate them as I shoot so that I can watch and listen later.

I get a lot of strange looks from people when I do these things.

What tech product are you currently obsessed with?

I often do stories overseas, and for the last couple of years, I have constantly connected with sources, interview subjects and my own family on my phone through WhatsApp, a brilliant messaging service that seems to be well known everywhere except the United States.

I use it to text, but also to trade photographs, short videos and voice messages, instantly. And you can call from it, even use it for face-to-face video conversations, free if you’re on Wi-Fi.

You’ve covered a lot of extreme sports. How has tech changed those sports and the way you report them?

There’s a truism in extreme sports that something didn’t happen unless it was caught on camera. People can climb the most remote mountains in the world, or surf the biggest wave or ski the steepest line, and someone else will be there to record it. And once it’s on camera, it usually hits Instagram and goes viral.

So many times, I’ve seen something amazing online, maybe something worth a story, only to realize that it has been “liked” 100,000 times already. So we tend to write about trends, not single events, and people, not just their accomplishments. We focus on the context, not the clip. That’s tough in a never-ending stream of clips.

How has tech been good or bad for sports in general?

You could write books on the topic, from athletes’ use of social media (increasingly skipping the filter of the traditional news media) to the in-game experience of fans (threatening to make the living room a more enjoyable place to watch a game than the arena).

More than anything, technology has brought the sports world into the “now.” I’m old enough to remember a world before ESPN, when the N.B.A. Finals were tape-delayed to late night and baseball had a “game of the week,” and that was the only game you could see. There were no sports highlights beyond your local news, and you hoped the late scores made the morning paper.

Now we can see almost any game on television, in a dozen sports from anywhere in the world, with a computer on our laps and a phone in our hands. We receive and give instant analysis through the world of social media. We can track statistics for our fantasy teams. We can tweet nasty messages to famous athletes and coaches who disappoint us. Like so many other parts of society, we’re probably watching sports more physically alone than ever, but more connected in other ways.

Is that good or bad? Just different. Part of me wishes I could recreate the simple times of attending a game the way I did with my parents. It was an era of hard bleachers and no video scoreboards, of tracking players through nothing but printed box scores, of using your imagination to fill in all the details of the sports world that were left mostly blank.

In 2001, nearly four decades later, scientists scaled the rock, a third-of-a-mile-high, and discovered a small group of living tree lobsters dining on tea tree at night. It turned out they were not extinct.

But some scientists worried these tree lobsters might actually be a distinct species because they looked mysteriously different from the preserved Lord Howe tree lobsters. Their legs were skinnier with smaller spines and the little stubs sticking out from the abdomen called cerci were slightly off. They were darker. It wasn’t clear if they’d always been on Ball’s Pyramid or if birds, mistaking them for nesting material, carried them there. The two islands were never connected by land, and the insects couldn’t swim.

The researchers collected living specimens to create a new population of tree lobsters that could be reintroduced to the wild if the ones on Ball’s Pyramid ever disappeared. Now thousands of living descendants and eggs from the Ball’s Pyramid couple are held in zoos and museums around the world.

Photo

But more recently, Dr. Mikheyev and his colleagues managed to reveal that the genetic differences between Lorde Howe and Ball’s Pyramid insects were within the range of the same species. This meant that they had to make sense of stick bugs’ massive genome — about a quarter bigger than the human genome. They did this by comparing genetic samples from living Ball’s Pyramid tree lobsters with material extracted from Lord Howe specimens preserved in museums. Age, inbreeding, environment or diet might explain their new look.

The finding could make it possible to restore the insects to their former home on Lord Howe island.

But rats remain a problem on the island, where they have killed off five bird species and around a dozen invertebrates, and still threaten 70 other species.

Following years of research and debate, the Lord Howe Island Board decided in September to go ahead with a rat eradication program. Beginning in mid-2018, helicopters will drop cereal laced with rat poison onto the island.

If all goes to plan, threatened or endangered species like ground lizards, snails and the Little Mountain Palm could then recover on this World Heritage site.

The tree lobsters may be able to return, too. Confirming their identity was important because the consequences of introducing a new species mistaken for an old one to Lord Howe Island were unpredictable.

Return candidates must also be chosen. Would they come directly from Ball’s Pyramid, or their captive bred descendants? Ideally, the most genetically diverse tree lobsters have the best shot at recolonization. This means more genetic analysis.

AOL Instant Messenger, the chat program that connected a generation to their classmates and crushes while guiding them through the early days of digital socializing, will shut down on Dec. 15, its parent company announced on Friday.

Released in 1997, the program had largely faded into obscurity over the last decade, replaced by text messages, Google Chat, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and on and on we go. But at its height, AIM, as it was known, served as the social center for teenagers and young adults, the scene of deeply resonant memories and the place where people learned how to interact online.

“AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,” Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath, the parent company of AOL, said in a statement on Friday.

The news of its official demise was met with cries of nostalgia, especially from those who were coming of age as AIM rose to prominence. For many people now in their 20s and 30s, learning to talk online coincided with learning to communicate like an adult, said Caroline Moss, 29, a writer and editor in New York who for years paid tribute to AIM with the parody Twitter account @YourAwayMessage.

“I was a little bit more nervous about this one because we haven’t had a hurricane since Katrina,” said Ms. Moran’s 26-year-old daughter, Destiny, an employee of the casino. “It’s like PTSD.”

In New Orleans, where Katrina exacted a horrendous toll when its waters overwhelmed the flawed levee system and left the city underwater for weeks, officials began to sound a note of cautious optimism by early Saturday evening, even as they acknowledged that circumstances could change. Officials lifted the city’s short-lived curfew around 9:30 p.m.

“This is the Goldilocks of storms,” Col. Michael Clancy, the commander of the New Orleans District for the Army Corps of Engineers, said. “Big enough to bring us in here on a Saturday night, not big enough to cause a lot of damage.”

The strength of the city’s improved hurricane defense system, he predicted, “is going to make this a minimal event, at least behind the levee.”

After amassing power in the Gulf, Hurricane Nate raced toward land and was lashing coastal cities with rain by late afternoon. Some areas were expected to receive 4 to 6 inches of rainfall as the storm passed through, although forecasters said that a “life threatening” storm surge — an abnormal rise in water levels of up to several feet — and wind were likely to cause the biggest problems.

Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said on Saturday afternoon that Nate was moving at “an extremely fast rate” of 26 miles an hour, which he said was “almost unheard-of for a storm of this type.”

Even though its speed would limit the amount of time it could deluge any single place, Mr. Edwards said, “this is a very dangerous storm nonetheless.”

“It has proven to be very deadly in Honduras and Nicaragua and that area,” Mr. Edwards said. “We have to make sure we are not taking it lightly.” At least 22 storm-related deaths have been reported in Central America.

At the 17th Street Canal between New Orleans and Metairie, La., workers from the Army Corps of Engineers lowered a set of enormous gates at the mouth of the canal. On Friday, divers checked the beds that the gates rest on to make sure that they would be able to close.

In 2005, there were no gates there or at the three other major canals in New Orleans. Katrina’s surge pushed water from Lake Pontchartrain into the canals. When levees along those canals breached, much of the city was inundated, and stayed underwater for weeks, until the breaches could be closed and the neighborhoods pumped dry. The corps later acknowledged the hurricane protection system it built was “a system in name only.”

Now the corps is building permanent pumping stations at the very end of these canals. Until then, a structure of gates and temporary pumps has been built to protect nearby neighborhoods.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans said at a news conference Saturday that he expected the city’s pump system to function effectively. Of the 120 pumps, 108 were working. “We have plenty enough to deal with the potential rain,” he said. “Everything that we can see, we think we can handle.”

The city could be without power for as long as a week, officials said. As for the question of how protective the city’s $14.6 billion system of levees, flood walls and gates would be against Nate, Mr. Landrieu expressed cautious optimism. “There is limited or no risk for storm surge in the city of New Orleans,” he added.

In the afternoon, as Nate’s outer bands hit New Orleans, rain pounded the streets, pushed by heavy gusts. Pedestrians took off running or huddled under overhangs.

Nia Johnson, 23, who lives on Alvar Street a few dozen blocks from the Mississippi River, said she and her family had planned to pile into the car and drive to Lafayette, La., because the streets of her area “always flood.” The power would almost certainly go out because of the high winds, she said, leaving them unable to cook for days.

Many of the larger chain establishments in the French Quarter had closed. But along Bourbon Street, the daiquiri and pizza-slice joints were open, and music spilled out of bars like the Beach, where customers wearing fleur-de-lis-covered ponchos were drinking and watching college football.

Bridesmaids tried to stay dry in front of Arnaud’s restaurant, where a Rolls-Royce waited for the bride and groom. Around the corner, a wedding party was out on a second-floor balcony despite the splitting rain.

The storm nevertheless ground other parts of the central Gulf coast to a halt. The popular resort town of Orange Beach, Ala., was empty except for ominous red flags whipping in the breeze; the casino city of Biloxi had mostly emptied of the thousands of visitors who had come to the area for Cruisin’ the Coast, a showcase of 8,200 classic cars. On top of that, the Mississippi Gaming Commission closed the casinos here, leaving the waterfront Beau Rivage and other casinos eerily dark.

“Now it’s just like a ghost town,” said Faith Phillips, 30, a dialysis patient care technician who was waiting for dinner at Waffle House, looking at the Beau Rivage as water encroached on parking lots nearby. “You wouldn’t believe that all of this was full.”

Just a few hours earlier, there had been an air of calm along the coast.

Merlin and Suzie DeCorte of Metairie, La., stopped at the R & O restaurant with their son Jacob, 8, near the 17th Street Canal in New Orleans, all wearing Louisiana State University T-shirts.

“It didn’t seem like it was going to be that bad,” Ms. DeCorte said of the storm. They had more time, she said, to get away from the city if needed.

In Gulfport, Miss., Rich Hazen and his wife, Dawn, of Diamondhead, Miss., were completing their errands with a decided sense of normalcy.

“Church hasn’t been canceled for this evening,” Ms. Hazen said.

“And Waffle House is still open,” Mr. Hazen said, citing the ever-reliable barometer of Southern disaster.

“If they close,” Ms. Hazen said, “then you know you’re in trouble.”",Hurricane Nate Makes Landfall on the Gulf Coast,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/hurricane-nate-gulf-coast.html

“Ukraine, with the exception of the Baltic States, is the only post-Soviet republic which is not authoritarian,” said Serhii Plokhii, a Harvard professor and the author of a history of Ukraine. And unlike the three Baltic States, which enjoyed brief periods of independence between the First and Second World Wars, Ukraine has only an acute awareness of centuries of subjugation by outside powers, among them Poland, Austria and Russia, that left its people inherently wary of authority.

“What is Ukraine’s national idea? It is resistance to authority,” said Taras Chornovil, a former adviser to Mr. Yanukovych.

Ukraine’s painful history as a put-upon appendage has left it ill-equipped to curb unruly habits at odds with the rule-based, scandal-shy order of the European Union, which it aspires to join.

“Its attempts to stay democratic while building a nation are often messy, its oligarchs all powerful and, given the virtual absence of state control over media and oligarchic competition, post-Soviet corruption is out in the open,” Mr. Plokhii said.

Ukraine’s domestic intelligence service, or S.B.U., its powers of surveillance greatly enhanced by monitoring equipment provided by the United States after Mr. Yanukovych decamped to Russia, has added its own highly selective and distorted form of transparency by leaking information about alleged wrongdoing, often for political or financial gain.

Controlled by Mr. Poroshenko, the S.B.U. has become a tool in domestic political and business battles, with anti-corruption activists accusing it of working to undermine, not help, their cause.

While still politically influenced, Ukrainian law enforcement is no longer the swamp of incompetence and corruption it once was. It has been able to monitor Mr. Manafort’s former business associates and turn up evidence of Russian hacking in the 2016 United States election, in part owing to American technical support.

The Central Intelligence Agency tore out a Russian-provided cellphone surveillance system, and put in American-supplied computers, said Viktoria Gorbuz, a former head of a liaison office at the S.B.U. that worked with foreign governments.

Ms. Gorbuz’s department translated telephone intercepts from the new system and forwarded them to the Americans. “This team would translate and immediately, 24 hours a day, be in full cooperation with our American colleagues,” she said.

It is unclear whether any phone intercepts relevant to the election meddling investigation have gone to the American authorities. But a Ukrainian law enforcement official has given journalists partial phone records of former associates of Mr. Manafort.

Dismantling Russian spy gear, however, proved far easier than purging Russian power, which has shadowed Ukraine constantly since it declared independence in 1991 but became far more aggressive in recent years.

Since March 2014 Ukraine has lost Crimea to Russian annexation and large chunks of its industrial heartland in the east to rebels backed by fighters and weapons from Russia.

My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it’s supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don’t expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name.

Today, we’re no longer trusting machines just to do something, but to decide what to do and when to do it. The next generation will grow up in an age where it’s normal to be surrounded by autonomous agents, with or without cute names. The Alexas of the world will make a raft of decisions for my kids and others like them as they proceed through life — everything from whether to have mac and cheese or a green bowl for dinner to the perfect gift for a friend’s birthday to what to do to improve their mood or energy and even advice on whom they should date. In time, the question for them won’t be, “Should we trust robots?” but “Do we trust them too much?”

With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. “Alexa, what should I do today?” Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn’t long before she was trusting her with the big choices. “Alexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?”

In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn’t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses “machine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists” to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is “better” based on “current trends and what flatters you.”

The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon’s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.

It’s these kinds of intersections – like this small collision between robot “helpfulness” and a latent commercial agenda — that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not “Alexa.” She’s a corporate algorithm in a black box.

Grace doesn’t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future — preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer “people.”

Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: “Hey, Alexa, how old are you?” and “What are you?” Some thought the device had multiple personalities. “She doesn’t know the answer,” said one child, wisely. “Ask the other Alexa.”

Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.

How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?

Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn’t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear — and many more even important things in life — my job?

In nontheme news, I have to say that the long Downs made me smile. I loved SHOT TO HELL for its unexpectedness, and “FROST/NIXON” is a nice, Scrabbly entry to write into the grid.

Tricky Clues

49A: “Strands in a cell?” looks like it refers either to the microscopic type of cell or a jail cell, although strands in a jail cell doesn’t make much sense. The answer refers to microscopic cells and the strands of genetic material within. If you are not sure whether the answer is RNA or DNA, fill in the “NA” and work that first crossing. 40D is AUDI, so the answer is DNA. See? You don’t have to be a scientist to do the crossword.

59D: I thought this one might bring out some of my fellow vegetable gardeners, because I’m sure I’m not the only one who believed that yams were tubers, not ROOTs. Apparently, “all tubers are root crops, but not all root crops are tubers,” and there are many ways to distinguish the part of a plant that grows underground. The main point you should take away from all this is that they’re good for you and you should eat your vegetables.

Constructor Notes

This idea for this theme came from thinking about Schrödinger puzzles, and wondering if I could potentially create one so that entries that contain more than one distinct stand-alone letter, for example, VITAMIN which can be followed by A, B, C, D, E, or K, intersect another such entry. Ideally, the shared possible letters for each pair of theme entries would be some combination of A, B, C and D, so that the revealer MULTIPLE CHOICE could be used. This didn’t end up panning out, but it did lead me, through a somewhat stream-of-consciousness manner of contemplating crossword themes, to come up with the one you see here. The first version of this puzzle had the theme entries VITAMINS, MUSICAL NOTES, CHEMICAL SYMBOLS, GREEK LETTERS and ALPHABET, and was rejected on the basis that ALPHABET was too obvious, and GREEK LETTERS was inconsistent. It was tough to find a new set of symmetrical theme entries, but I’m pleased with the current set. In each case, the category contains other members besides the ones that are composed of a single letter, and the letters are the members of the category themselves rather than being abbreviations, unlike something such as L M S for SHIRT SIZES. I spent a decent amount of time trying to remove the black square between TILE and GREEK and its symmetrical partner to allow for two pairs of long parallel downs, but I didn’t like the compromises on the fill, so I decided to stick to 78 words. Given that this ended up as a Monday (I had expected it to be a Tuesday) and the importance of smooth fill for Monday puzzles, I stand by this decision, and though there aren’t a ton of bonuses here, I’m fond of SHOT TO HELL and some of the mid-length fill like U.S. NEWS and HANSEL (he’s so hot right now). I don’t have a lot to say as far as the clues go, but a few of mine I’m glad to see survive the edit are 49-Across, 9-Down, 31-Down and 56-Down. Though I’m not sure it will be particularly applicable to this puzzle, I like the inside nod in the clue that Will and Joel came up with for AHA. In any case it’s great to be back, and I hope (fingers crossed) that my puzzle will be a pleasant start to everyone’s week.

They wait on a platform at the Milan train station in 1970, their many suitcases secured with rope, their bags filled to the brim. A box of panettone, a Milanese holiday specialty, accompanies this family of travelers, suggesting Christmastime. Dressed for the cold, the family of five — parents, children, and an older woman wearing black from head to toe — gaze to the right, pondering perhaps their unknown destinies. We see them in Gianni Berengo Gardin’s photograph, shot at mid-distance from above, a portrait of Italy as a migrant nation.

I know these people.

Photo

No, they are not my family, but they could be. My parents left their respective mountain towns for New York City two decades earlier than those in the photo, fleeing the destruction, the penury and the hopelessness of post-World War II Italy.

The family on the platform could have easily been one of the multitudes of migrating Italians I encountered on trains when I lived in Milan and Bologna in the mid-1970s, traveling between their hometowns and northern Italian cities, Switzerland, Germany, and other enchanted places of drudgery, sacrifice and desires, temporary stops along an unending journey toward security.

Indeed, Italians keep leaving now, not with the same desperation of the undereducated masses that changed the course of nations in North and South America beginning in the 19th century, but with college degrees and smartphones in hands, grasping for opportunities their country remains incapable of providing.

These images from the mid-20th century capture the ubiquity and possibility of travel and escape, from the gaggle of scugnizzi (street urchins) hitching a ride on the back of a Neapolitan tram to a couple cuddling in their bathing suits, nestled between train tracks. I know them too, having met them in my own travels across the peninsula, heard about them in family stories on both sides of the Atlantic, and encountered them through the countless viewings of films by the likes of Vittorio De Sica, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni.

Photo

The 31 black-and-white images displayed in the London gallery exhibition of Gardin’s work, “The Italians,” are, for the most part, those he made in the midcentury, when Italy hovered between agrarian provincialism and an internationally touted cosmopolitanism. The meta-image of an Asian tourist posing for a photographic portrait against a Mediterranean backdrop highlights Italy as destination, in stark disparity to the fleeing migrant family.

Contrasts are a leitmotif for Gardin, as seen with the seven girls in communion whites delighted by a dark-haired dog before them, or the jangle of men on a train, caught in mirrored reflections. The pairing of Italy with style and leisure is found in the photos of an elegantly veiled woman in sunglasses and pearls aboard what appears to be a Venetian water taxi, and the portly man in bathing trunks beatifically splayed on an outcrop, the sea below a resounding swirl.

Photo

Gardin is a master of the patterned panorama, vistas of startling beauty shot from above: In one image a donkey-driven plow cuts a billowing swath across an astonishingly stark landscape and in another, two men scurry across a plank in a flooded Piazza San Marco. These are captured flashes of haunting revelation.

His images are not merely of the real, the documented — they are also reveries of the imagination. Lovers, clothed but barefoot, embrace on a beach. A blanket, a pair of shoes and vinyl records in the foreground.

I know them, too.

On Spring Street in NoLIta, a one-bedroom for $2,250 had slanted floors, and Ms. Ratliff and Mr. Milot feared the sofa would slide.

Other apartments were small, dark or both, often with odd layouts. “The pictures online were completely inaccurate,” Ms. Ratliff said. “They would use fish-eye lenses to make the room look large, or write things in the listing that weren’t there, like a dishwasher.” She enjoyed touring the apartments, though.

She and Mr. Milot contacted Laura Zente of Waverly Realty Associates, which specializes in the West Village, and Ms. Zente showed them a one-bedroom on Leroy Street for $2,350.

The bedroom was comparatively large, but there was barely room for a sofa in the living room. Mr. Milot thought the place was too small for guests. As Ms. Ratliff recalled, he told her, “Unless you want people hanging out in your bedroom and sitting on your bed, this isn’t going to happen.”

Then Ms. Zente took them to a six-story walk-up on a charming block of Christopher Street. Two one-bedrooms were available: one was just a flight up; the other, which had a newer kitchen and a slightly higher price, was three flights up.

They preferred the one on the lower floor, for $2,350. The relatively large living room faced the back, away from street noise. And even with outdated cabinets, limited closet space and a small bathroom, the apartment seemed well worth the money.

They wondered what was wrong with it. Maybe the size? As Mr. Milot said, “It is studio-sized, but it has a door” to the bedroom.

“It is no bigger than 350 square feet,” Ms. Zente said.

Still, they happily signed on. The broker’s fee was 12 percent of a year’s rent, or $3,384.

The couple moved in this past winter and set to work decorating. “I like to think I’m a little bit handy,” Mr. Milot said — he refurbished some of their furniture — “and Katie has a really good eye.”

The tiny bedroom fits a bed, one end table and a bureau.

“The bed touches three walls,” said Ms. Ratliff, who crawls on top of it to change the sheets, tucking them in as best she can.

“It’s a whole process,” she said. “I am on bed duty, and Chet is on garbage and light-bulb duty.” Eventually, she would like to have a bed out in the open, so she can easily change the sheets and put an end table on either side.

They never thought to test the water pressure until they moved in and tried to use the shower. That was when they discovered that the water trickles out. “You feel you still have shampoo in your hair,” Ms. Ratliff said. But they have a workaround: they often shower at the gym.

Even so, they feel they lucked out in finding a place just one flight up. “It’s definitely small, but it functions for us at a steal of a price,” Mr. Milot said.

On Friday, three members of the board — Marc Lasry, Dirk Ziff and Tim Sarnoff — resigned, according to a board member and a company executive. In a statement, Bob Weinstein and three other board members said that a group of lawyers from Debevoise & Plimpton, including one with experience prosecuting sex crimes, would lead an investigation into Harvey Weinstein’s behavior.

“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the board’s independent investigation and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”

The Weinstein brothers first came to prominence with Miramax in 1989, the year they helped to activate the indie-film boom with “Sex, Lies and Videotape.” They sold Miramax to Disney in 1993 and left in 2005 to form the Weinstein Company. They unsuccessfully dabbled in side businesses, including a fashion label, but eventually found their film footing with releases like “Inglourious Basterds.”

Lately they have hit a dry spell. Although they have a fast-growing television division, the Weinsteins have not had a mainstream hit at the North American box office since 2013, when “Lee Daniels’ The Butler” took in $116.6 million.

So far this year, the Weinstein Company, a boutique studio that specializes in sophisticated, small-budget dramas like the 2011 Oscar winner “The King’s Speech,” has released six films, which have taken in a combined $123 million at the domestic box office. (The biggest hit has been “Wind River,” a well-reviewed murder mystery that has collected about $33 million.) Last year, the Weinsteins had seven films, with combined ticket sales of just $65 million.

To compare, major studios like Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Company generally take in $1 billion to $2.5 billion annually at the domestic box office.

The Weinstein Company has also found itself sidelined at film festivals, where Mr. Weinstein has long shopped for movies to release, helping to discover auteurs like Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. For years at the Sundance Film Festival, for instance, his wallet was the only one that mattered to agents, who would track his team relentlessly. Netflix and Amazon dominate now.

At the same time, a new cluster of independent movie companies — some better financed and with more contemporary sensibilities — arrived on the scene. They include A24, which released the reigning Oscar winner for best picture, “Moonlight,” and Megan Ellison’s Annapurna Pictures, which has emerged as a favorite home for the kind of rebel filmmakers that Mr. Weinstein used to have to himself.

Ms. Ellison, whose films include “American Hustle” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” has been one of the few Hollywood executives willing to comment about the accusations against Mr. Weinstein. “Women face serious repercussions for sharing their experiences and deserve our full support,” she wrote on Twitter on Thursday, with a link to The Times report. “I admire the courage of these women.”

Mr. Weinstein acknowledged in a statement on Thursday that his behavior had “caused a lot of pain” and vowed to “do better.” On Friday, a lawyer advising him, Lisa Bloom, said in a television appearance that he had acted inappropriately and agreed with an interviewer who characterized Mr. Weinstein’s reported actions as illegal. And on Saturday, Ms. Bloom said that she had resigned as an adviser to Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein’s power in Hollywood has always come with his ability to capitalize on the Academy Awards. He was at his height in the late 1990s, when he drove films like “Shakespeare in Love” to best-picture wins and huge ticket sales. Even in his more recent diminished state, he remained a player, prodding a tiny, largely subtitled art film, “Lion,” to six nominations this year. (The last time a Weinstein film was a force at the Oscars was in 2012, when “The Artist” collected five awards, including best picture.)

In this year’s Oscars cycle, the company’s big hopes are “Wind River” and “The Current War,” a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that is scheduled for a late November release. It received a tepid response at last month’s Toronto International Film Festival, but Mr. Weinstein has personally helped to re-edit the movie since then.

Several agents and producers said that, without Mr. Weinstein’s all-or-nothing campaigning style, those films would probably be stranded on the awards trail.

As the movie business has become more difficult, the Weinsteins have found success in television, especially the reality genre, with Heidi Klum’s “Project Runway.” That series runs on Lifetime, a division of A&E Networks, and has spawned several spinoffs.

Series in development include a crime drama for Amazon starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore and created by the director of “Silver Linings Playbook,” David O. Russell. The Weinstein Company is also working with Oliver Stone on a series for Showtime called “Guantánamo.” It has three major projects with the Viacom-owned Paramount Network, including “Yellowstone,” a drama starring Kevin Costner and written by Taylor Sheridan, the writer-director behind “Wind River.”

Amazon, Showtime, A&E, and Paramount all declined to comment about Mr. Weinstein on Friday or did not respond to queries. Ms. Klum, Mr. Sheridan and other people involved with Weinstein Company films and shows responded similarly.

One prominent agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to draw his company into the controversy, said that he would advise female clients against withdrawing from Weinstein projects. He quickly added, however, that he would also tell them to ask for a contract saying that they would have zero contact with Harvey Weinstein.","Without Harvey Weinstein, Is There a Weinstein Company?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/media/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harrassment.html

Tricky Clues

A lot of the nonthemed clues in this puzzle had clever twists, which I think increase the difficulty and the enjoyment of solving a big Sunday grid.

15A: “Gasoline may make it go” turned out to be a pretty grim type of combustion, ARSON. I ran through a long list of vehicles and yard and garden tools before this became apparent.

22A: “Change of locks?” had to be a pun, as indicated by the question mark. Looking back, I don’t know why I starred this clue as a toughie since NEW DO is such an apt entry, but that’s often a sign that a clue is just elegant.

95A: I don’t stay up on my Disney much, so when I saw “Big 2016 film set in Polynesia” I searched my recent memory for a serious movie. I figured out MOANA through a few crosses and had a “D’oh” moment because of course in New York you can’t go a day without hearing about some insane accomplishment by Lin-Manuel Miranda (who co-wrote this movie’s music). So really this should have rang a lyrical bell.

96A: I worked on “Cab alternative” by trying to think of rivals to Uber, with three letters. Instead I should have been looking for alternatives to Cabernet, similarly shortened — in this case, ZIN.

106A: I was misdirected by this clue, “Consider it done”; since the entry appeared in quotations, I took it for a theme answer and left it until later in the game to fill in. It finally finished as I SHALL, which almost made the grade since there is an actual state concealed in there (ALabama). But the other rules of this theme are broken here, and it’s actually pretty hard not to use any of the 50 two-letter state abbreviations in nonthemed answers in a puzzle. Pulling that off would’ve been pretty amazing.

15D: “Firmly in place” was one of a handful of straight clues I didn’t get, for some reason. I guess I gravitate toward more chicanery on a Sunday and managed to fixate on some variation of tongue in cheek, but this was simply ANCHORED. I struggled with the across clues that furnished the first two letters of this answer, and a couple of other crosses were a bit tricky (including TD BANK, one of those entries that makes sense but makes for an illogical fill until it’s completed).

42D: The radio led me astray when I got to this clue, “Part of a recovery effort.” Too many disasters at once — hurricanes and earthquakes — had me racking my brain for something like “search and rescue” that would fit the grid. Instead the puzzle was hinting at a more personal cataclysm, and it took a while for me to fill out “AA MEETING”; another example of a clue with gnarly, unusual twinned letters to make you doubt yourself when solving.

52D: I got this in its entirety only from crosses, and still looked at it skeptically until checking out its etymology; TOP HOLE just made no sense to me for “First-rate, in British slang.” Turns out that it’s very similar in origin to top notch, both of them finding their roots in horse-jumping, where the best horses soar over the highest bar or rail of a fence, which is held in place by pegs in either a hole or a notch, sort of. I mean, pish posh, folks. Maybe you use “top hole” every day, but in my defense this is only the third usage in the puzzle since 1965. If you knew it then top hole, old chap!

65D: I consider this clue, in retrospect, to be the yin to 42-Down’s yang. “Getting help getting clean” made me think of renting a power washer before being IN REHAB.

All that British slang research brought to mind this little gem from our own archives. If you haven’t seen it already there are some top-hole touches:

Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.
While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers.
Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field.
This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro.","In the charcoal fields of San Pedro, a bustling port city in the southwest Ivory Coast, hundreds of women and children — some barely school-age — toil day and night among heaps moldering wood, waste water and air thick with smoke. Driving rain, withering heat and sawdust storms come with the job. This used to be men’s work. Not anymore.



Making charcoal for sale out of the refuse from nearby sawmills, work for the desperate and destitute, has become almost exclusively women’s work in San Pedro. It may have started with one widow from Bogart, a desperately poor slum, who ventured into one of the three charcoal fields in San Pedro, the Parc Du Pont, intent on making a dollar to feed her family.



As Joana Choumali learned when she began documenting the women in 2013, men are happy to sell wood, San Pedro’s largest export, and let women keep the filthy, back-breaking work of making charcoal. Ms. Choumali, a freelance documentary and fine art photographer from Abidjan, was on an assignment in San Pedro when she first spotted the phenomenon.



Three years later, Ms. Choumali’s project, “Sissi Barra (The Work of Smoke),” illustrates the harsh reality for women with few choices, the poorest of the poor, in the Ivory Coast. While the country is enjoying an economic revival and now boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy, the charcoal producers of San Pedro live like paupers. Her conversation with Evelyn Nieves has been condensed and edited.

Q.

What drew you to this topic?

A.

I was passing by this park at the entrance of the town, an immense expanse of coal-black soil, and hundreds of busy people around smoke-filled ovens. I then noticed that they were mostly women. I was intrigued by the contrast between the harshness of the place and the presence of these women, adolescents and little children.

Photo

Q.

Do you know why the industry has gone from all male to almost all female?

A.

At first, this work was exclusively masculine. Women began to become interested when Makandjé, the oldest of these women and leader of the Women Coal Producers Association of the Parc du Pont, dared to venture into this field. She first started assisting male producers, then started her own oven. Today, she has inspired hundreds of women follow her example. Men progressively deserted the charcoal field. Now, most of the men we meet around these fields are wood sellers or carpenters. Charcoal fields are usually near wood manufacturers.

Q.

What did you witness in your three years of documenting the “work of smoke” that stands out?

A.

Some women, like Makandjé, are widows; some are part of a polygamous marriage or have been repudiated. Except for one, Awa, they have no other qualifications, and have no choice but start to work in this field to survive.

All the decisions are made together. I was impressed by the solidarity and unity between the women. They support each other. They have a joint financial arrangement where they contribute equally to save money. I was inspired by the strength, the resilience and the dignity they have.

Q.

What are they made of? Who builds them?

A.

The ovens are made of wood and sawdust left by the carpenters and wood manufacturers. The women build them themselves. The last day of my stay one of the women invited me to work with them. I collected the trash wood from manufacturers that they sometimes use because they can’t afford to pay for good wood. Then we placed the wood in a very specific way to make the oven. It takes a whole day or more to build an oven, depending on the size, and each oven is made for only one time. They can’t be reused.

Photo

Q.

What are some of the hazards?

A.

The sawdust is very light and it is a powder and as the place is very windy, this sawdust enters the eyes and the nose, and sticks on the skin. The eyes are irritated. My eyes and nose were irritated the first day, so I had to wear glasses and a mask to avoid the smoke and the wind with sawdust.

Then there is a lot of heat on the floor from all these ovens which are on fire underneath.

After when the charcoal is ready, they break the oven and collect the hot charcoal and put into bags with their hands. The charcoal is sharp and hot. They need gloves.

So they need masks, proper work shoes, boots for example, and gloves. They do not have enough tools to work, since it’s too expensive for them to buy one for each of them. They share their tools. During the rainy season, the mix of mud and sawdust becomes a sort of moving mud. They also need boots. And as they do not have raincoats, some of them protect themselves with pieces of plastic they find or go without protection from the rain.

After trying to work with them for a day I got sick. The work is physically hard. I couldn’t do it for more than two hours. Everything is done by hand.

Photo

Q.

What do you plan to do with this project?

A.

This project, made possible with the support of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Grant in 2016 and the Prince Claus Fund, is finished. I am very happy because next month, I will go back to San Pedro to introduce the team of “The Poplin Project,” a socially responsible brand of artisanal textiles that wants to empower women and to create a future for underprivileged kids by working with small local organizations and cooperatives. This year, 33 percent of their profit will go to the women’s cooperative of charcoal producers of “Sissi Barra” in San Pedro. The aim is to finance a drinking water system, to build a safe recreation room for the women and children and to help the young girls get an education.

Tricky Clues

10A: It’s midweek, so read those clues carefully. “It’s found by the radius” sounds like it might be a math question, but it’s not; what other kind of “radius” exists? The radius we’re looking for today is a bone in the forearm. It is parallel to the ulna, a fabulous piece of osteocrosswordese (Yes, I made that up).

15A: A clue like “Brought home” evokes the childhood habit some of us might have had for bringing home stray animals and begging our parents to let us keep them. Not me, of course. But some of us. In a midweek puzzle, however, tricks are afoot, and today the clue is referring to how much money you’ve EARNED.

30A: #TIL the word MANUMIT, and it’s very interesting. To manumit is not merely to SET FREE, but to set someone free from slavery. It’s derived from the Latin manus, or hand, and means to “set forth from one’s hand,” or release from control.

2D: I had REFILL before REFUEL.

26D: “Glam rock?” is some nifty misdirection. You were thinking of a bunch of longhaired, bespangled musicians in heavy eyeliner, weren’t you? Not today. Another type of glamorous rock would be a GEM.

Let’s say hello to Evan Manhken:

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

Welcome to the party, Mr. Mahnken. I hope we get to see more from you soon, and 100 percent on your debut.

The D.S.H. payments were subject to a federal cut after Congress failed to forestall reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to taper federal contributions as the number of insured patients rose. The reduction took effect on Sunday, the beginning of the federal fiscal year.

Although Senator Chuck Schumer has expressed optimism that Congress will reverse the cuts before the end of the year, Mr. Cuomo has been adamant that the state needs to prepare for worst-case scenarios, saying that the state’s public hospitals will lose $1.1 billion if the status quo holds.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I’m not sure whether it stems from a solving, constructing, or editing mind-set, but I’m always fascinated by the variety of “circled letter” themes in puzzles. Circles can highlight letters within a single entry that spell a word, whether they’re adjacent or spread out. At times, they can be arranged to form images the solver must identify. There have even been puzzles where the circles were used to bring attention to noncircled letters.

Thus, with nearly infinite theme possibilities of this type, it’s no surprise that Jacob Stulberg has come up with an interesting “circled letters” puzzle based on a fresh revealer. Let’s take a look:

Today’s Theme

Mr. Stulberg has made the revealer, THREE-RING CIRCUS, almost come to life: the grid contains three common circus performers arranged in a “ring” as indicated by the clusters of circled letters. When read clockwise, they spell out GLASS EATER, FIRE DANCER, and WIRE WALKER.

This is a very impressive feat. Not only did Mr. Stulberg have to find three circus performers large enough to form into rings, but each one had to be hidden within normal entries so that the surrounding fill could still be smooth.

Normally, when constructing a crossword, each letter has two constraints: it must work with both Across and Down entries. However, for a puzzle like this, the requirement of spelling out a circular phrase serves as a third constraint that makes filling the grid exponentially more difficult. Sure, we have tougher bits of fill like KER, LATH and ASSAI in the bottom-right corner alone ... but these are small prices to pay for such an intricate theme.

There’s a flood of new and forthcoming fantasy fiction that draws on African mythology, culture and folklore.

An albino with pale skin and hair, Sunny is treated as an outcast by superstitious locals who call her a witch. But once she discovers her powers, she becomes friends with three other Leopard children, learning to cast spells, read Nsibidi and move between the physical world and spirit realm.

Like her protagonist, Ms. Okorafor, 43, grew up straddling two worlds, never really fitting into either. The daughter of Nigerian immigrants, she was raised in Illinois, but spent holidays with her extended family in Nigeria.

“Nigeria is my muse,” said Ms. Okorafor, who lives in a suburb of Chicago. “The idea of the world being a magical place, a mystical place, is normal there.”

Over the last decade or so, Ms. Okorafor has published a dozen science fiction and fantasy novels, and has emerged as one of the genre’s most innovative and visionary writers. Her stories, which are often set in West Africa, use the framework of fantasy to explore weighty social issues: racial and gender inequality, political violence, the destruction of the environment, genocide and corruption. She’s won virtually every major science fiction and fantasy award, including the Hugo, the Nebula and the World Fantasy Award, as well as the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature in Africa.

Now, after developing a cult following, Ms. Okorafor’s gritty, unconventional fantasies are catching on with a much larger, mainstream audience. Her novel, “Who Fears Death,” which is set in a postapocalyptic Africa, has been optioned as a series by HBO, with George R. R. Martin signed on as an executive producer. She’s writing a three-issue arc of Marvel Comics’s Black Panther series, as well as a Marvel comic based on her character Ngozi, a Nigerian teenage girl who is “bonded to the alien symbiotic organism Venom.”

In a genre that has long been dominated by white men and Western mythological tropes, Ms. Okorafor’s stories, which feature young black girls in starring roles as superheroes and saviors of humanity, have been hailed as groundbreaking. Her fan base includes some of the genre’s biggest names, titans like Rick Riordan, Mr. Martin, Ursula K. Le Guin and Neil Gaiman.

“The sheer joy of something like the ‘Akata’ series is the feeling that I simply have not read this before, and that is so rare,” Mr. Gaiman said in an interview. “It’s fantasy, yet it comes from a cultural place that isn’t the stuff we’ve already seen 1,000 times before.”

There’s a long literary strain of science fiction and fantasy that draws on African and African-American folklore, from masters like Ben Okri and Octavia Butler, and a deep tradition of magical realism in African-American literature. But until fairly recently, those stories have often been relegated to the fringes of science fiction and fantasy. The most popular fantasy franchises of the past few decades, from “Harry Potter” and “Twilight” to Mr. Riordan’s Greek mythology-based “Percy Jackson” series, have for the most part been rooted in European myths and legends, as are some of the genre’s canonical texts, like C. S. Lewis’s “The Chronicles of Narnia” and J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.”

That’s starting to change, as Ms. Okorafor and other African-American speculative fiction writers have risen to prominence, demonstrating that there’s an enormous appetite for fantasy stories that feature diverse characters and settings and tackle contemporary social issues. N. K. Jemisin’s “Broken Earth” fantasy trilogy, which takes place on a continent plagued by catastrophic earthquakes, has sold around 400,000 copies in English worldwide, won the Hugo Award for best novel two years in a row, and is being adapted into a TNT television series.

There’s a flood of new and forthcoming fantasy fiction that draws on African mythology, culture and folklore. The Man Booker Prize-winning author Marlon James is writing an epic fantasy trilogy that draws on ancient African myths and stories, and features bounty hunters, queens, witches, shape-shifters and monsters.

This month, Razorbill will publish “Beasts Made of Night,” a young adult fantasy novel by the Nigerian-American writer Tochi Onyebuchi. The novel takes place in a gritty, dangerous city of Kos, where so-called sin eaters make a living devouring rich people’s sins, absolving them. Mr. Onyebuchi, who has a law degree from Columbia University, envisioned the story as a parable about corruption and inequality in the criminal justice system.

Next March, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers will release Tomi Adeyemi’s debut novel “Children of Blood and Bone,” the first of a young adult trilogy set in a mythical country inspired by West Africa. Holt paid seven figures for the series, and Fox 2000 acquired film rights. Ms. Adeyemi, 24, whose parents moved to the United States from Nigeria, said she wanted to write a fantasy series that drew on her cultural heritage, particularly the gods and goddesses of the Yoruba religion, but that also explored themes like racial and social injustice. “It’s an allegory for the modern black experience through the lens of an epic African fantasy,” she said in an interview.

Lately, Ms. Okorafor is finding herself in increasingly high demand. She recently finished a new novel, “Remote Control,” a fantasy set in near-future Ghana, and just signed a deal to write the third book in her Akata series. She’s also working on a graphic novel, set in a Brooklyn tenement that houses both African immigrants and aliens from outer space.

Ms. Okorafor’s rise as a fantasy novelist came about somewhat by accident. Growing up in an immigrant family, she never thought she could make a living by writing. “As is the case with a lot of Nigerians, and immigrant families in general, there were only three career options: doctor, lawyer and engineer,” she said. “And failure.”

She excelled at sports and science, and was fascinated by insects; she planned to be an entomologist, she said. Then, when she was 19 she had back surgery for scoliosis, and woke up paralyzed from the waist down. Imprisoned in her own body and terrified, she started writing short stories to keep her mind occupied. She recovered over the summer, and when she returned to college, took a creative-writing class. Her path was set.

But when she published her debut novel 12 years ago, she struggled to find an audience. Her first book, a young adult fantasy titled “Zahrah the Windseeker,” sold fewer than 1,000 hardcover copies, according to NPD BookScan. “It was science fiction and fantasy from a Nigerian point of view, and you had this unique book that needed help and got no help,” she said.

Since then, her ascent hasn’t always been smooth. She was stunned when an early cover design for her second young adult novel, “The Shadow Speaker,” featured a white girl, even though the heroine is Nigerian. After she complained to her publisher, the cover was changed. More recently, in what should have been a triumphant moment, Ms. Okorafor’s name was omitted from some headlines announcing the HBO series based on “Who Fears Death,” while Mr. Martin was promoted as an executive producer.

Her “Akata” novels have been met with some resistance in Nigeria, particularly among religious conservatives who say she is glorifying superstition and witchcraft. “They can read ‘Harry Potter’ and be fine with it, but ‘Akata Witch’ is evil,” she said.

At the same time, she understands the apprehension. For some Nigerians, the creatures in her books are not just fantastical beasts — they evoke real beliefs and traditions. While describing her research, Ms. Okorafor listed some of the strange beings in her Akata series that come from Nigerian folklore: tungwas, which are floating balls of flesh, hair, bone and teeth that spontaneously explode; Mami Wata, a mermaid-like water spirit; Udide, a huge talking spider deity that smells like a house on fire; Ekwensu, a powerful and destructive goddess composed of tightly packed palm frond leaves.

It’s somewhat surprising, she admits, that as a celebrated fantasy writer, she often doesn’t have to rely on her own imagination for her wildest inventions.

“You’d be shocked by how much I don’t have to make up,” she said.",Nnedi Okorafor and the Fantasy Genre She Is Helping Redefine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/ya-fantasy-diverse-akata-warrior.html

Ms. Bloom, who said earlier this week that she was working only as an “adviser” to Mr. Weinstein, said she resigned from her role Saturday.
As the Times investigation revealed, however, no charges materialized after Mr. Weinstein paid off his latest accuser in a confidential settlement.
The allegations against Mr. Weinstein have come to light several years after similar stories concerning Mr. Cosby.
As The Daily Beast noted, Lena Dunham was one of the few who spoke out against Mr. Weinstein.","“The unfortunate reality of Hollywood is that if someone has money, then they can generally find some kind of audience of people who are interested in working with them,” said Kim Masters, the editor at large at The Hollywood Reporter. This was particularly true of Mr. Weinstein, who, she said, was known for having “the golden touch” that produced “Pulp Fiction” and “Good Will Hunting,” “The King’s Speech” and “Shakespeare in Love.”

Ms. Masters had been chasing the Weinstein story for years. She said she had gotten near “the end zone” once, only to bump up against the ultimate silencer: fear.

“At the last minute, the source withdrew,” she told me.

She said she wanted to believe that times were changing, given the number of women who have put their names to the words that derailed the careers of Bill Cosby, who faced criminal charges that resulted in a mistrial this year, and Bill O’Reilly. But she also wondered aloud whether trouble had finally found Mr. Weinstein because he was no longer the rainmaker and hitmaker he had once been.

“This industry is passionate about causes,” Ms. Masters said, “but when it comes down to doing business, they’re definitely capable of holding their noses.”

With the knowledge that the Times article was heading toward publication, and with word of a similar piece in the works at The New Yorker, Mr. Weinstein assembled an all-star team of crisis-management experts and lawyers that included Lisa Bloom. Ms. Bloom, who said earlier this week that she was working only as an “adviser” to Mr. Weinstein, said she resigned from her role Saturday. She is known for her work representing alleged (and often confirmed) victims of sexual harassment, including those who took on Mr. O’Reilly.

Ms. Bloom shared one reason she may have been sympathetic to Mr. Weinstein on Twitter in April, when she wrote, “My book SUSPICION NATION is being made into a mini-series, produced by Harvey Weinstein and Jay Z!”

Mr. Weinstein has admitted to some inappropriate behavior, and Ms. Bloom has attributed his missteps to his status as a “dinosaur” who is now “learning new ways.”

Certainly, shamefully, there is a long tradition of disgusting harassment of women who try to make it in the movie business. (Jack L. Warner, a founder of Warner Bros. studios, was no saint.)

The image that Mr. Weinstein had concocted for himself — that of a classic Hollywood type, the hot-tempered but charming mogul — took a serious hit in 2015 when an aspiring actress, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her at his TriBeCa offices. The New York Police Department’s Special Victims Division investigated the matter, resulting in a lot of bad press and some hard questions from his board. As the Times investigation revealed, however, no charges materialized after Mr. Weinstein paid off his latest accuser in a confidential settlement.

Hollywood isn’t the only industry still abiding behavior that never had a rightful place in civilized society. Not at all. But it stands out because the industry often holds itself up as a force for moral good, its awards ceremonies filled with beribboned attendees.

As my colleagues who wrote the investigative article about Mr. Weinstein, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, noted, he was allegedly harassing women in five-star hotel rooms across the globe even as his company was distributing films like “The Hunting Ground,” a 2015 documentary about sexual assault on college campuses. He also helped endow a “Gloria Steinem” faculty chair at Rutgers; joined a national women’s march in Park City, Utah, in January; and was a big fund-raiser for and supporter of Hillary Clinton.

The same day that The Times broke the story about Mr. Weinstein, Bloomberg News reported that State Street, the bank behind the famous “fearless girl” statue staring down the Wall Street bull, paid $5 million to some 300 female executives after a federal audit determined it had paid them less than their white male counterparts. State Street disagreed with the audit. But as in the case of Mr. Weinstein, the face it presented to the world was woefully contradicted by the charges about its out-of-view behavior.

The allegations against Mr. Weinstein have come to light several years after similar stories concerning Mr. Cosby. The charges against the once-beloved comedian and sitcom star had been floating around for years. But they generally stayed hidden — and did not figure in the biography of Mr. Cosby by the former Newsweek editor Mark Whitaker, published shortly before his public image unraveled — because of what my predecessor, David Carr, described as Mr. Cosby’s “stalwart enablers” and “ferocious lawyers.”

Mr. Weinstein had his own enablers. He built his empire on a pile of positive press clippings that, before the internet era, could have reached the moon. Mr. Carr wrote in a 2001 New York magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein, of whom he was an astute observer: “As the keeper of star-making machinery, Weinstein has re-engineered the media process so that he lives beyond its downsides.”

Every now and then, glimpses of his nasty side spilled out, like when he placed the reporter Andrew Goldman in a headlock and dragged him out of a party in 2000. Someone who was involved in that altercation, Rebecca Traister, wrote in New York’s The Cut on Thursday that it didn’t get the media attention it deserved because “there were so many journalists on his payroll, working as consultants on movie projects, or as screenwriters, or for his magazine.”

Let’s hope that those in the know did not include members of the Los Angeles Press Club, which this year gave Mr. Weinstein its “Truthteller Award,” calling him an example of “integrity and social responsibility,” along with Jay-Z. (The mogul received the honor because of his producing “Time: The Kalief Browder Story,” a Spike TV documentary series about a 16-year-old who spent three years in Rikers Island awaiting a trial that never took place.)

The Press Club might want to rethink the award given that Mr. Weinstein has hired the emerging leader of anti-press jurisprudence, Charles Harder, who brought the case that put Gawker out of business last year.

And what about the eerie Hollywood silence? As The Daily Beast noted, Lena Dunham was one of the few who spoke out against Mr. Weinstein. It sure was a departure from the delight that greeted the charges against the conservative Mr. O’Reilly. Behind the scenes in Los Angeles, as Janice Min, a former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, told me, “I can guarantee the second that story hit yesterday, several men called their attorneys.”

There will be questions for those who knew what was going on but did nothing, for the agents who dispatched would-be stars to his hotel suites when they may have understood what the cost would be and for the editors and reporters who conveniently didn’t bother to look into the tales making the rounds.

I asked Ms. Min how many other Harveys were out there.

“No name comes up more than Harvey Weinstein in this sort of behavior,” she told me. But, she added, “I guarantee there are many more rocks to overturn.”

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said.","“We worry when you look hard at us, but we are also touchy about being overlooked,” then-Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson of Canada told a group of American students in 1963. The quote, reprinted in the June 10th issue of The New York Times of that year, still rings true today, especially as a Canadian like myself goes through thousands of images of Canada from the newspaper’s archives.

Earlier this year, the Ryerson Image Center in Toronto received a donation of 24,804 images from a collector, Chris Bratty, who had purchased the collection with the intention of donating it. Selected by a team led by two gallerists, Steven Kasher and Stephen Bulger, the pictures range from World War I to the late 1990s, from hockey players to lumberjacks. A selection is currently on view in an exhibition at the center and in a book, both entitled “The Faraway Nearby.”

“When I heard of the collection, I immediately wanted to acquire it,” said Paul Roth, an American who is the center’s director. “For all the strengths of our holdings — including the Black Star and the Berenice Abbott archives — we don’t have a tremendous amount of Canadian photojournalism. This helps us fill that gap. And, since it comes from a major U.S. newspaper, it brings up the question of how one country covers another, which fits within our mandate of interrogating different aspects of the medium.”

The expected tropes are there: Canada as a winter wonderland; as a safe, polite neighbor who reveres hockey. But there are also images that challenge them: Canada the diplomat having lighthearted meetings with America’s foes. In one photo, Nikita S. Khrushchev laughs at a joke told by Mr. Pearson — the opposite of the famous “Kitchen Debate” moment by Elliott Erwitt, in which then-Vice President Richard Nixon castigates the Soviet leader. In another, Fidel Castro holds Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau’s youngest son, Michel Charles-Émile, during a four-day state visit. Or, Canada the troubled young nation deploying the Army to confront Quebec’s sometimes-violent calls for independence.

“The type of coverage we see speaks of a dual fascination between how familiar Canada feels, and yet how unfamiliar it sometimes appears,” Mr. Roth surmised. “I suspect that The New York Times had to ponder how to cover a country that was so close. Should they concentrate on the differences or highlight the similarities? When stories involved people or goods crossing the border, which was often the case, were they to be considered national or international news?”

Besides snow and hockey, evidence of Canada’s subordination to the British monarchy seemed of particular interest. The New York Times dedicated space daily to Princess Elizabeth’s first tour of Canada in 1951 (Slide 9) and continued to chronicle the royal family’s subsequent visits.

Mr. Trudeau also drew a lot of attention, more than any of his predecessors and successors, that is, until his son Justin ran for the same office and won in 2015. A reproduction of a spread published during the 1972 election is revealing. Within “The World” section, the article isn’t under a rubric with the country’s name, as is customary, but simply “Trudeau,” and a headline declaring “A Swinger Shows His Sober Side.” A full column is dedicated to a collage of images showing the candidate dancing, riding a motorcycle, playing hockey and pedaling a unicycle before concluding with a somber close-up portrait.

Mounting the exhibition, Denise Birkhofer — an American who recently settled in Toronto and co-curated the show with Gerald McMaster, an Indigenous Canadian of Plains Cree and Blackfoot descent — pondered how The New York Times’s fondness for certain subjects and visual archetypes might have shaped a national identity. That’s hard to answer, partly because of the variety of photographers who contributed to the paper’s Canadian coverage.

“There’s a multiplicity of voices that came together to shape the perception of Canada that The New York Times then shared with its readers,” she said. “Not all were Americans. Sometimes staff photographers were sent to cover a story, but other times it came from local publications or freelancers. There were also images made by Canadian agencies or corporations, such as the National Film Board and the Canadian Pacific Railway.”

Photo

Most surprisingly, during World War I, the images the paper used to showcase Canada’s participation in the war effort were supplied by Canadian entities, whose work had to be vetted by the nation’s official censors. Its goal was to avoid criticism of military endeavors by showing the conflict in a romanticized light. In other words, said Gaëlle Morel, the Ryerson Image Center exhibitions curator, “The New York Times — a private commercial enterprise — obeyed the censorship requirements of a foreign country.” In other words, the country’s image, as seen in The Times, reflected an official, sanitized perspective.

Mr. Roth said the collection has greater meaning given Canada’s sesquicentennial this year. “More than a time for celebration and patriotism, it is an occasion to think about complicated questions relating to the identity of the nation,” he said. “All countries should be interested in how they’re viewed by other states. We should strive to get past the mythologies that are created to promote tourism or to reinforce patriotic values, especially nowadays. Doing so requires unpacking widely held cultural assumptions. And that’s exactly what we can do thanks to this archive. While it doesn’t tell a single story, it does help us understand what the Canadian mythologies are.”

“I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said.","The new show arrives Oct. 11 on the CW, whose youth-centered programming has lately relied, with middling results, on superheroes. It has been not so much created as concocted by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz — who sold soap to an Axe body wash generation with “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” — as a layer cake of nostalgia and novelty to tempt both extremes of the 18-49 demographic so coveted by advertisers.

“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”

“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.

But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.

“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”

Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.

Photo

The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.

“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”

The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.

That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”

The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”

Photo

“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”

This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.

She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”

As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”

Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.

As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)

Photo

As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.

Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”

She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.

Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.

But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”

Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.

“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”","A ‘Dynasty’ for Generation ‘Gossip Girl’ (Mom Can Watch, Too)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/arts/television/dynasty-reboot-cw.html

Milkweed, which once grew in great stands along the nation’s roadsides and in the margins of farms, essentially disappeared from the American landscape overnight. In 1996, the year before Roundup-resistant soybeans and corn were first planted in the Midwest, the butterflies’ primary migration corridor, there were a billion migrating monarchs in North America. This year there are roughly 109 million, and that number is down 27 percent from just last year.

The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates thousands of miles the way birds do, wintering in Mexico and traveling — through successive generations in a single season — as far north as Canada before heading south again. Their travels make them vulnerable to more than just the loss of milkweed. Two other causes of population decline are deforestation in their Mexican wintering grounds and, you guessed it, climate change.

Of all the assaults on the monarch population, climate change may prove the most pernicious. In summer, excessive heat stresses developing caterpillars already vulnerable to diseases and predators. In fall, unseasonable warmth can prevent them from heading south in time to reach their wintering grounds, and extreme weather events like hurricanes can destroy an entire wave of the migration before it reaches Mexico. Worst of all, climate change threatens the monarchs’ wintering grounds, where very specific environmental conditions keep them in a hibernation-like state. In winter, unstable temperatures in Mexico can wake the butterflies too early from hibernation, sending them north before the nectar flowers they feed on have bloomed. And by some estimates, that microclimate high in the mountains of Mexico will all but disappear by 2030.

Not all monarchs in North America migrate. In South Florida, they live and breed year-round, though virtually all of those butterflies are heavily infected with protozoans that weaken the population. Monarchs west of the Rockies travel much shorter distances, overwintering on the California coast, but that population is in even worse shape, down 97 percent from its pre-Roundup norm. A new study this year suggests that it’s on the verge of extinction.

In the wild, less than 10 percent of monarch caterpillars survive to adulthood, even when environmental conditions are ideal. Monarch enthusiasts bring in the eggs they find outside to rear indoors, hoping to improve those odds. When something goes wrong for someone in an online butterfly group, the refrain of consolation is always a reminder of how poorly the monarch fares in nature, of how even one success will help to “raise the migration.”

Since I had no eggs to collect from my own milkweed, I decided to order another set of caterpillars from a different supplier and try again indoors. I put them in a professionally manufactured butterfly enclosure and fed them milkweed leaves I’d sterilized and rinsed. The monarch stewards in my online groups were having glorious success with this method, releasing hundreds of monarchs they’d collected as eggs earlier in the summer. They kept posting videos of the newly emerged butterflies walking delicately over their hands, and I was going a little mad with jealousy. I typed in my credit-card number one more time.

O.K., two more times. Still, not a single caterpillar survived.

There are many possible causes, both natural and chemical, for my failure. At the top of the list: user error. And my plan was flawed from the beginning, it turns out. Releasing monarchs raised from commercial butterfly farms can create additional risks for the native population, spreading disease, limiting genetic diversity and interrupting scientific efforts to understand the migration.

I haven’t decided whether I’ll go on a quest for wild monarch eggs when these lovely creatures return to Middle Tennessee next spring, but I think it’s time to admit that the pollinator garden I’ve planted here in sterile suburbia is just not big enough to attract a migrating butterfly high in the sky. Still, it’s possible, and if there’s any sight more heart-lifting than a monarch butterfly glowing in the sunshine, I don’t know what it might be. When I finally saw one the other day, it was flying straight down the middle of my street, heading south.",Meddling With Monarchs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/opinion/monarch-butterfly-migration-extinction.html

Angel Lazaro, 29, was hanging out with his friends (who call him Mayito) at Bar Roma , on the rooftop of a 1920s building in Old Havana. Mr. Lazaro hadn’t ended up at the bar from seeing it on the street. There was no sign outside indicating that a ride up in a rickety open-air elevator would lead him to one of the city’s most interesting watering holes.

Inside, the scene consists of creative types mingling with tourists over mojitos and rum cocktails. “To me, that was an indicator that Cuba was changing,” said Rose Cromwell, a photographer who has traveled to Cuba for over 12 years.

When Ms. Cromwell visited the bar, there was no bathroom. The residents living down the hall opened their homes to patrons for a small tip, a transaction in keeping with part of Cuba’s economy; many people run bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants and even clandestine clothing shops out of their houses.

In a country where clothing options are limited by a lack of imports, cultivating a singular style can be challenging. “People will bring clothes in bundles from Miami, Panama or Mexico and sell them up from their homes,” Ms. Cromwell said.

And when there is a particular trend, “you see it everywhere, it’s like wildflower,” Ms. Cromwell said. A few years back, she recalled, everyone was wearing the British flag: “It was just what they had made in China and had been manufactured on a large scale.”

Mr. Lazaro describes his style as “funk” and has tried to not follow these trends. He is one of the many Cubans who go to lengths such as making their own clothes, having relatives bring pieces from abroad or scouring local vintage spots.

“Often in Havana you will see people dressed in all white wearing multiple beads, covering their head and wearing socks,” Ms. Cromwell said. Here, Yairis, 19, is dressed in the traditional style of someone who has been “sainted” in Santeria, an Afro-Cuban religion with origins in the Caribbean. Part of the rite of passage is to wear all white for an entire year, which represents the process of rebirth and purification.

Alexis, 24, is a street vendor who sells odds and ends from a table in Old Havana. His sunglasses, fitted clothing, gold chains and fade haircut identify him as someone who listens to reggaeton, or “reggaetoneros,” as they are called in Cuba. “Men pay attention to detail in their grooming, from their beards or mustaches to their eyebrows and their haircuts,” Ms. Cromwell said. “You definitely see a high level of self-care, and barbershops are ubiquitous in Cuba.”

Some of those barbershops are in homes, like the one Roberto Alvarez, above, runs out of a rented space. Mr. Alvarez isn’t into trends and prefers to alter his own clothing; the vest he is wearing is made from a women’s jacket that he cut up. When he isn’t shaping men up, he is a rapper and goes by the stage name Robe L Ninho.

Preparation for the Necks involves shutting their eyes for five seconds, waiting to see who will serve.
The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances.
If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks.
A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation.","The Necks are not careerists. “Hanging Gardens” was followed by “Aether,” a whole album consisting entirely of variations on four shimmering chords. “Drive By,” with its potential to become a crossover hit, was followed shortly by a difficult double CD (“Mosquito/See Through”). By now I knew how foolish it was to try to guess what they might do next, but “Chemist” broke the molds of expectation in several ways. There were three tracks, each clocking in at a mere 20 minutes, on at least two of which the drummer (Tony) overdubbed surf guitar. The last of these tracks, “Abillera,” didn’t just swing; it rocked. The influence of Krautrock, of Neu! in particular, was unmistakable, but as often happens when the critic spots an unmistakable influence, it turns out that Tony hadn’t ever listened to Neu! The Necks had moved far from the minimalist grooves of the earlier records, from post-jazz to a kind of post-rock, but they were in the midst of a deeply creative groove, releasing masterpiece after masterpiece. The live album “Townsville” had none of the narrative trajectory that made “Drive By” and “Chemist” so enthralling — and that, I realized eventually, was its beauty. To experience “Townsville” properly is to give way entirely to the oceanic sense.

“Silverwater” (2009) followed, an epic reminder that they both were and were not the band that recorded “Sex.” Featuring further evidence of the drummer’s guitar prowess, “Silverwater” succeeded in being both fragmented and cohesive. After about 50 minutes, you could be forgiven for thinking that the record was coming to an end. Everything subsides to a series of low electronic beeps, like a faint message from a stricken space station, picked up randomly, so long after transmission as to serve as evidence of its doom. Except records by the Necks change radically according to the system on which you’re hearing them. On about the 10th listen, through headphones, I detected, so far back in the mix it seemed to have leaked through the inadequate sound proofing of a neighboring sound system, the faint bleed of funk. Scientists are still poring over this discovery, trying to establish if, in the last phases of its existence, a section of the space station was given over to a party.

I was about to start listening to the four tracks of “Unfold” when I was struck by how long it had been since I looked forward to a band’s new album the way I look forward to each new offering from the Necks. This was how I felt waiting to hear “London Calling,” by the Clash, “Slow Train Coming,” by Bob Dylan, or, going even further back, “Electric Warrior,” by T. Rex. So intense was the anticipation generated by the prospect of hearing “Unfold” that I kept putting off playing it. And then there was the nonoptional wait to get into the Lab in San Francisco for the opening gig of the American tour. Just as the experience of listening to an eagerly awaited record by the Necks varies from system to system, your experience of a performance depends a lot on where you sit. So, as we stood in the long and lengthening line, I delivered a rousing address to my troops — five of them — on the need to act decisively once we were inside, how we had to seize the very best nonassigned seats: as near to the front as possible, but not too close to the potentially overwhelming drums, and not to one side. This anxiety threatened to turn what for everyone else was supposed to be a fun night out — going to a gig — into its opposite, but I knew, with the unshakable conviction of the believer whose devotion is a sign not of gullibility but of superior powers of discernment, that we were potentially on the brink of one of the greatest musical experiences currently available on the planet. (In the unlikely event that it didn’t quite happen that night, I was booked in for another two-set helping the following evening.)

We scored great seats, three rows from the front, and I was able to make sure, without anyone noticing (even though everyone noticed), that I got the best seat of all, with the clearest view — of the resting instruments — of any of us. Ever since I went to my first rock concert, Family in Oxford in about 1972, the thrill of what was about to happen was symbolized by the dormant power of the vacant drum kit, the way it sat there like a throne to its imminent rhythmic might. That sense of the instruments lying in wait is even more pronounced with a gig by the Necks as we wait for music to come into existence for the first time.

The gigs the band played immediately before this tour were in large venues, opening for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, in Australia. This brought the Necks to the attention of a new audience, but it’s in places like the Lab that they really come into their own: 150 people, ready to focus on every moment, every note. Typically, bands “tour” an album, showcasing its contents, advertising it. The Necks do not do this, of course, but one track from the new album, “Blue Mountain,” bears a sufficiently close resemblance to some of the performances from the recent tour to permit me to conflate the transient experience of a live performance with repeated exposures to the documentary evidence of the record.

They take the stage at the Lab, Lloyd looking like a tall backwoodsman with balding head and full beard; Chris, bald, bespectacled, austerely professorial; Tony, white-haired and dressed, by comparison, quite fashionably in a polka-dot shirt. Chris sits with his back to the other two as if cutting himself off, but it’s a setup that enables them to hear one another better — and responsiveness to one another is at the heart of the performance. Tennis players, by the time they come on court, are already halfway into the realm of intense concentration required by the coming sets. Preparation for the Necks involves shutting their eyes for five seconds, waiting to see who will serve. Chris touches the piano keys.

Instead of the band gradually stretching out and easing into a groove, there is a steady creation and increase of internal pressure. From Tony there tends, at the outset, to be a lot of shaking, rattling, scraping and shuffling. It’s easy to hear this as aimless — a sonic bush through which it will be necessary to beat a path rhythmically. Gradually the impediments to rhythm emerge as its formative parts. Insistently repeated press rolls on the snare generate the need to break out — rhythmically — while simultaneously incarcerating this need. The same thing is happening with the tidal moan of Lloyd’s bowed bass, a sublimated pulse that manifests itself as a refusal to fully express itself. At some point the yearning is answered, at first chthonically, by the bass drum, later by the insistent jump of the high-hat. But the forward momentum remains contained.

So there is a piling up of forces, like the roiling storm clouds of a weather system, already in our midst but continuing to approach. The pressure continues to mount, to bear down and, partly through the immense shimmer of cymbals, to expand. The piano suggests what might remain of the lyrical after all else — including much of what constitutes lyricism — has been corroded. Think of all that aural starlight in jazz (“Stella by Starlight”!). The glimmer, here, is of ruined starlight. Contained in the piano is a scattered residue of jazz, traces of a lost blues. You focus on what Chris is doing, and then your attention is drawn to the drums, then over to the bass and back to Chris, who has jabbed the piano into an off-the-cuff Reichian lockdown. There are no solos, but the ball is being passed back and forth constantly. At some point it becomes impossible to tell who is doing what.

And not only that. There appear, through some weird alchemy of harmonics, phantom instruments. A cello? A human voice? A violin? Hearing such things, wanting to have the source of these auditory hallucinations verified, you look to see what is happening, but there are just these three middle-aged blokes, playing piano, bass and drums, conjuring things that do not exist. There are also moments that make you aware that your attention has wandered. Is this just about refocusing as a listener, or has the band, having drifted into a comparatively slack interlude, done something deliberately to pull you back into the trance? The Necks, these days, do not swing, but there is a constant swelling, an abundance of lateral movement that is manifest also as its opposite: a tightening of the screw, locking you inside the music, becoming part of its rise, its eventual fall and final fade.

At the end of the first set, Lloyd introduces the band and mentions that CDs are for sale. With their minimalist packaging and discreet information (the recent ones don’t explain who’s playing what), the CDs and the new double LP are consummately cool, eminently desirable, but the economic aftermath and interlude are relatively modest given the profundity of the experience that has preceded it. While the merchandise is being shifted, the band is more than ready to mingle, all the while displaying a distinct lack of any wish to be revered. At the Blue Whale in 2016, Lloyd came up to say hello. I was talking to a guy sitting in the row in front who had seen the band the last time they played in Los Angeles. He wasn’t sure when that was.

“But too long,” he said.

“Right,” Lloyd agreed.

“He was actually referring to the length of the set,” I said.

“Yeah?” he said. “I thought he meant your last book. Pretty surprising, since it was only about 150 pages.” In my book, so to speak, this represents the ideal behavior of the artist: You create this very serious work, and then you shoot the breeze as though the whole world is a pub in the Outback where no one cares what you do as long as you get your round in. Until it’s time for the second set.

The Necks are not improvising from existing tunes but creating from scratch, every night. Except now, in their 30th year, they are able to draw on their own history the way jazz musicians have relied on the history of the form, on what has been done — sometimes composed — by others. The idea in this classic jazz situation is not to copy or emulate but to distinguish yourself, to establish your individual identity by reference to what has gone before. The Necks could be said to do versions of — to improvise on — their past (entirely improvised) performances. In other words, they improvise on their own history. Each night is a slightly more familiar exploration or mapping of the unknown. Their career is therefore expressed in miniature in each piece, and each piece is a condensation of their career. The foundations have to be endlessly re-established, otherwise they collapse (into chaos) or cement themselves into cliché or convention.

It goes without saying that this way of proceeding cannot produce amazing results every time. Were they able to produce a miracle every night, the feeling of the miraculous would be lost. The only way to guarantee a superlative gig each and every time is to rehearse and rehearse, to get everything down pat. The Necks, of necessity, do not rehearse; nor are they locked into a monogamous musical relationship. They meet up, play gigs, tour and record, but each band member pursues other projects with other bands. Chris and Lloyd still live in Australia. Tony moved to Tokyo in 1990, then to Amsterdam in 1994, until 1998, when he moved — or, in a very Necksian way, “cross-faded” — to Berlin, where he is still based. So even after 30 years, making music has the feel of a special occasion — a get-together. And despite what was just said about the impossibility of routine miracles, the standard of the average — the frequency of the exceptional — is surprisingly high. At a gig some years ago at the Vortex in London, they were flooring it, going flat-out, and the next instant they stopped so suddenly that it was like being thrown through a windshield into silence. “How did you do that?” my friend asked them afterward. Well, Lloyd said, there were a few little signs we all picked up on. So are there some moves or tricks to which they resort when the alchemy does not occur? Or, as I said when I went to see them at their Airbnb, “Can a great performance result when one of you is having a bad night?”

“It depends what you mean by a bad night,” Tony said.

“Like a heart attack?” Chris said.

Lloyd mentioned a gig in Perth at the start of last year. The commitment to improvisation extends even to the instruments — he travels without a bass, preferring, like a piano player, to put himself at the mercy of what the venue provides. (Two weeks later, when I bumped into him at a noodle bar near the Blue Whale, he looked slightly stressed because, an hour before the show, he still had nothing to play.) The bass provided for the gig in Perth was diabolical. “The variability of the instrument is one of the things I try to get excited about. As long as the bass is playable, that’s quite exciting. But this one was an absolute dog. I said to the others, ‘There’s about five notes that work on this, so I’m not going to be contributing a whole lot.’ My bass part was really disciplined because I didn’t have a lot of options. And it was an amazing piece of music.”

“But you have made whole records where you’ve only played one note,” Tony said. “So you were spoiled for choice.”

“It’s actually remembered as a virtuoso performance,” I said (sitting in, as they say in the jazz world, improvising with the Necks!). “O.K., I get what you’re saying. But how about if two of you are having a bad night? You can see where I’m going with this. How about if all three of you are?”

“You could get a perfect storm of negative elements,” Lloyd said, before it occurred to me that there was a corollary to my line of questioning. If they are all on good form, it still does not necessarily mean that it will be a great gig by the Necks. And needless to say, what they do is not to everyone’s taste. I reminded them of a gig in Brighton, England, in 2002 — the second time I saw them, before my conversion — when, the moment the first set ended, a member of the audience leapt to his feet and started hurling abuse, telling them and us what a bunch of crap it had been. (The guys took it with surprisingly good grace, seemed entirely unperturbed.) For the record, and to prove that I am not a mindless devotee, their discography contains a few duds: “Silent Night,” “Photosynthetic” and “Vertigo” do nothing for me. And a member of my little group at the Lab, having prepared for our evening out with a noseful of cocaine, was less than enthusiastic. “He does everything with those drums except play them,” he remarked of Tony, rather wittily. I was unsure, when he went on to say that seeing the Necks was just like seeing the Grateful Dead, whether he was joking, trying to make a serious point or testing the limits of my tolerance. Either way, coke is a wretchedly inappropriate drug for experiencing the Necks.

Impatience prevents you from seeing — hearing — that what you are waiting for is already happening (not a bad test-definition of the avant-garde). But there is scope for anxiety on behalf of the participating listener, because the gathering intensity is underwritten by the potential for dissipation. And any given performance makes you wonder how any part of it could be different. This is the possibility that the performance has to raise on the way to becoming that which it was. So the answer is always, Yes, it could have been very different, at almost every stage. Could it have been better? In retrospect maybe, but there are long interludes — sometimes lasting the entire length of the set — when you are left to reflect instead on how much was latent in that first note or chord or rattle of percussion. To what extent did that note — by Chris, say — determine what they all went on to do? The sense, in this genealogy of the moment, is of unanticipated inevitability.

Each set of the San Francisco gigs was extraordinary, as were the two closing sets of the tour at the Blue Whale a fortnight later. But how would these shows sound if they were released on CD? I’ve no idea. Some kind of bootlegged video of part of the previous year’s gig at the Blue Whale exists, but I’ve avoided watching or listening to it. I don’t want to have to measure my experience of being there — superlative! — against a transcript of what occurred. Setting the record straight can sometimes distort it. A performance by the Necks is all about band and audience being utterly absorbed in the process of creation. Whether to release recordings of live performances is therefore a fundamental conceptual issue. In the course of any performance of continuous improvisation lasting for the best part of an hour there are going to be lulls — substandard stretches that are left behind, that evaporate and are forgotten as a show progresses, but that can fatally contaminate an entire recording. And as Lloyd points out, the orgiastic bits — which are so intoxicating live — can seem crude. More broadly, a record becomes a statement or template — this is what the Necks do — whereas it is merely a record of what happened that one night. Even without the problem of releasing live albums, it’s important that the band is not overly concerned with analyzing their live shows; the quality of performance depends on this relative indifference. The kind of post-mortems they go in for after a show typically amount to something along the lines of “That was pretty good wasn’t it?”

They have to feel uninhibited, to be free of the judgments that we listeners often feel bound to make. Was the first set on Saturday in San Francisco better than the second? (My little group of six was split straight down the middle, three and three.) Was Sunday better than Saturday? This is not a problem for the band; they have trouble remembering what they did on a given night.

In the course of thinking about — which means listening to — the Necks and their recent concerts, I’ve often remembered that idea of John Berger’s in “The Moment of Cubism”: “The moment at which a piece of music begins provides a clue to the nature of all art.” But it’s the moment after each piece of music, each set from the Necks, that I think of now. As the music faded into silence, instead of a rush to applaud, the audience waited, respectfully acknowledging that the altered silence was itself still a part of the performance. The silence meant that, on behalf of the performers, the audience wrapped the gift of the music they had received. Only then could the applause begin. That’s when we stood up and applauded.","My Obsession With the Necks, the Greatest Trio on Earth",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/magazine/my-obsession-with-the-necks-the-greatest-trio-on-earth.html

But today’s computing power has blown away the self-limiting nature of the enterprise, as it has with so many other limits. A new paper by a team of scientists at Duke paints a startling picture of the way the Wisconsin district map protects Republicans from risk. Remember the Volkswagen scandal? Volkswagen installed software in its diesel cars to fool regulators into thinking the engines were meeting emissions standards. The software detected when it was being tested, and only then did it turn on the antipollution system. The Wisconsin district map is a similarly audacious piece of engineering.

When the overall Republican vote share in the state is 50 percent or more, the authors of the paper show, the map behaves much like an unbiased one. But when the map is tested by an electorate that leans Democratic, its special features kick in, maintaining a healthy Republican majority against the popular headwind. To gain control of the State Assembly, the authors estimate, Wisconsin Democrats would have to beat Republicans by 8 to 10 points, a margin rarely achieved in statewide elections by either party in this evenly split state. As a mathematician, I’m impressed. As a Wisconsin voter, I feel a little ill.

Republican legislators argue that any Wisconsin map will look biased, because Democratic voters tend to congregate in big cities like Milwaukee and Madison. That packs the Democratic half of the state into a small cluster of districts. “Why are you gerrymandering yourselves?” they ask.

They’re partly right. The clustering of Democrats in cities does indeed give the Republicans an edge. But it’s a much smaller advantage than the turbo-boost the current map provides, as the Duke paper demonstrates. The main tool in the Duke paper is a method called the “Markov chain Monte Carlo” algorithm. Starting from the current Wisconsin district map, it makes a sequence of random changes, swapping wards from one district to an adjacent one, carrying out a “random walk” through the set of all possible maps. Completely unconstrained changes would create crazy-looking districts, so it weights its changes in favor of traditional districting criteria.

Few if any of these maps provide the Republicans the firewall against a Democratic electorate that the Wisconsin district map does. In other words, the map is an “outlier” — so far outside the ordinary run of things that it can’t be mistaken for a map without partisan purpose. It’s an outlier in another way, too: Research by the political scientist Jowei Chen suggests that the Wisconsin district map does much worse on traditional districting criteria than neutral maps do, despite the Wisconsin Constitution’s requirement that districts be “in as compact form as practicable.”

Outlier detection is a critical part of data analysis, and mathematicians have gotten really good at it by now. That’s the good news about advanced computation: You can use it to make electoral mischief, but you can also use it to detect and measure that mischief. It’s not math versus democracy; it’s math versus math, with democracy at stake.

If the Supreme Court sides with the three-judge panel that blocked the Wisconsin map, some liberals foresee an end to gerrymandering, while some conservatives imagine a districting process that is the purview of legislatures being completely usurped by the courts. Both sides of Gill v. Whitford agree: This is a momentous case with major implications for American democracy.

But what if it’s not? The panel’s standards for determining impermissible gerrymandering are hard to meet except in the most egregious cases. Judges empowered by an anti-gerrymandering precedent from the Supreme Court will blunt the worst cases, but won’t end gerrymandering. There will be many cases, maybe most of them, where it’s impossible, no matter how much math you do, to tell the difference between innocuous decision making and a scheme — like Wisconsin’s — designed to protect one party from voters who might prefer the other.",How Computers Turned Gerrymandering Into a Science,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/opinion/sunday/computers-gerrymandering-wisconsin.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Moonee is six. She lives in the shadow of Disney World, in a stretch of central Florida dominated by cheap thrills and off-brand amusements. Home is a room in a motel called the Magic Castle, one of many garishly painted stucco-clad palaces whose names represent either false advertising, honest aspiration or brutal irony. This is an unmagical kingdom, a zone of tawdriness and transience, of strip clubs and strip malls, knockoff souvenir shops and soft-serve ice cream shacks.

But for Moonee (who is played by an uncannily poised and resourceful young actress named Brooklynn Prince), the Magic Castle and its surroundings are a land of endless enchantment and nonstop adventure. Mischievous and fearless — heroically bratty; devilishly cute — Moonee may remind you of Eloise, who tries the patience of the grown-ups at the Plaza Hotel in that immortal picture book. Their situations are different, of course. Moonee’s mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite), is not jetting around Europe leaving her daughter in the care of a stressed-out nanny. She’s very much a presence in Moonee’s life, perhaps more big-sisterly than maternal, but doing whatever she can to keep them housed, clothed, fed and entertained.

What “Eloise” shares with “The Florida Project,” Sean Baker’s risky and revelatory new film, is the ability to tell its young heroine’s story from two perspectives at once. Moonee’s free-range existence looks like a lot of fun, and she and her friends — mostly a boy named Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and sometimes a girl named Jancey (Valeria Cotto) — run wild with an exuberance that adult viewers can only envy. Moonee and Scooty are like Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; the service road is their Mississippi River. They cook up pranks and follow their whims, heedless of the consequences.

But of course the viewer who experiences vicarious delight in their capers — ice cream tastes so much sweeter when you have conned some tourists into paying for it — is simultaneously conscious of an undertow of sorrow, anxiety and dread. We are well aware of the possible consequences, and also of the grim circumstances that grant Moonee her freedom. She is in every sense a child at risk. We watch her Little Rascal antics increasingly sure that something terrible is going to happen.

To balance joy and desperation as gracefully as Mr. Baker does — to interweave giddiness and heartbreak — is no easy feat. “The Florida Project” could easily have been cruel and exploitative, punishing its characters for their wildness and the audience for enjoying it. But the director, who wrote the script with Chris Bergoch, avoids the traps of condescension and prurience that ensnare too many well-meaning movies about poverty in America. Like Mr. Barker’s earlier features “Starlet” and “Tangerine,” this movie insists on meeting people on both sides of the screen where they are, on suspending judgment and extending compassion without abandoning its ethical grounding.

[The Magic and Hardship of “The Florida Project”]

“Tangerine,” an against-the-clock chronicle of a hectic day in the lives of two transgender hustlers in Los Angeles, won some of its fame for having been shot with an iPhone camera. “The Florida Project” has a more polished look, but the bright colors and rough, warm edges of Alexis Zabé’s cinematography fit the mood and the setting. You see traces of the near-tropical natural glory that drew generations of hedonists, fortune-hunters and entrepreneurs to this part of the Sunshine State. You also find some beauty in the blight they brought with them.","Review: In ‘The Florida Project,’ Enchantment in a Shabby Motel",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/movies/the-florida-project-review-sean-baker-willem-dafoe.html

Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent — perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class’s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn’t disburse the money at all, “so as not to encourage capitalism.”

Of course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of “reparations.” And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?

If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they’re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country — and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?

Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India’s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.

Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader “net neutrality” decision, the government banned Facebook’s “Free Basics” plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company’s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.

Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What’s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group’s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.

In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn’t always at hand.

The New York Times had filed a Freedom of Information request for Mr. Pruitt’s calendar, with no response from the agency. But the nonprofit group American Oversight sued the E.P.A. over its slow response to a similar request it had filed and received a copy, which it provided to The Times.

Lisa covers the E.P.A. for The Times. I write about regulatory policy and lobbying. We spent much of the weekend reading through Mr. Pruitt’s calendar.

Page after page showed Mr. Pruitt holding meetings with lobbyists and top executives from automobile manufacturers; oil industry giants; pork and soybean farmers; coal mining companies; chemical companies; coal-burning electric utilities; conservative media outlets; Republican lawmakers; even Steve Bannon and Ivanka Trump (they had a half-hour each, in successive meetings, on the same day, before Mr. Trump’s decision on the Paris climate agreement).

Mr. Pruitt had traveled to speak to industry groups at resorts in Naples, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and had fancy meals with industry executives at restaurants like Equinox and BLT Prime, and at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.

But there on Page 180 of the schedule was a detail that to me was perhaps the most fascinating of all: a brief description of a 30-minute meeting Mr. Pruitt had in his office at E.P.A. headquarters with an acquaintance he knew from Oklahoma.

A.J. Ferate, now the vice president of regulatory affairs at the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, which represents the industry statewide, was penciled in on March 27 at 3:15 p.m.

How the world had changed.

Few could have predicted back in 2011 that Mr. Pruitt was going to end up as the E.P.A. administrator. (I called Mr. Ferate this week and spoke with him briefly, asking if he himself could have imagined this turn of events. He said he did not want to comment.)

But now, five and a half years later, he had come to Mr. Pruitt’s office to thank him for moving to kill a part of the exact rule they had teamed up, without luck, to try to block in 2011. (Mr. Pruitt has moved to kill the entire methane rule, but, so far, a court has blocked him from doing that.)

It is a small detail, to be sure. But journalism, at its core, is a form of history. This was a reminder once again of how the course of history has changed in this new Trump era.","Deep in 316-Page E.P.A.
