The investigators are interviewing other prostitutes for information, the official told Associated Press. While prostitution is legal in remote areas of Nevada, it is not legal on the Strip, where he was staying.

The massive investigation has failed to uncover Paddock’s motive for the rampage Sunday night that killed 58 people. The 64-year-old Paddock was armed with 24 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammo when he opened fire on a country music festival from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Vegas strip.

Paddock also wounded hundreds before taking his own life.

The official also disclosed to the AP that Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, took at least a dozen cruises abroad in the last few years, most of them with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, the AP reported Saturday. At least one sailed to the Middle East.

Also Saturday, federal agents began to haul away thousands of personal items left behind when at the music festival.

FBI agents were seen Saturday morning hauling baby strollers, lawn chairs, backpacks and purses onto dollies and into the back of a white truck.

Law enforcement officers had fanned out across the crime scene throughout the week, stacking up belongings of concert-goers into more than a dozen large piles.

Authorities have said they plan to return the belongings to people in the next week.

An estimated 22,000 people were attending the Route 91 Harvest festival when Paddock opened fire.

Investigators say Paddock was the lone shooter.

Danley, who was abroad in Asia at the time of the shooting has told investigators she had no idea Paddock was plotting a mass shooting. She returned to the U.S. Tuesday.

Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Friday at a news conference that examinations of Paddock's politics, finances, any possible radicalization and his social behavior have turned up little information on what led to the attack.

The FBI announced a billboard campaign around Las Vegas seeking tips from anyone with information about Paddock.

The act of taking a knee during the pregame playing of the national anthem was started by then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year. Kaepernick said his action was a protest of racial inequality and police brutality.

President Trump brought the protests back into the national spotlight Friday when he asked the crowd at an Alabama rally, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he's fired?'""

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Learn more about private browsing as well as anonymous tools at my website.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., The Wall Street Journal



Those who say gun control is the answer to massacres like Sunday’s in Las Vegas are really saying they are willing to live with such outrages.

Gun-control proposals always float up in the aftermath of mass shootings, singularly detached from any plan that could be carried out, much less command majority support from the U.S. electorate. A law banning gun sales is not in the cards. A law seriously curtailing private gun ownership, as exists in the U.K., is not in the cards. If it were, enforcing it would be a whole other nightmare.

Non-meaningful gun regulations, in fact, were the specialty of a Democratic senator who long represented Nevada, scene of Sunday’s killings. Harry Reid had a lifetime “B” rating from the National Rifle Association. A New York Times columnist on Monday, under the web headline “Preventing Mass Shootings Like the Vegas Strip Attack,” proposed eight steps that, whatever their slight utility in lowering the rate of other kinds of gun crimes and suicides, even the writer admitted would have no “overwhelming effect” on gun deaths, let alone mass shootings.

Mass shootings of the modern ilk are a lot more like terrorist attacks than they are like routine gun crimes, in which guns are used to settle an argument, facilitate a robbery or eliminate a rival.

Mass shootings typically involve a substantial measure of planning and preparation. Stephen Paddock walked into a luxury hotel—correction, he walked into a hotel-casino, where it’s part of the business model to know and watch customers carefully—with 23 weapons, ammo and related equipment.

Another mass shooting has spurred another rush to judgment. After the Las Vegas shooting, Democrats complain about Republican leniency on the gun industry. But White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has flipped the argument.

In two separate interviews Thursday, Conway pointed out that the previous administration was responsible for the regulatory oversight that first made ""bump stocks"" legal. In short, the Trump White House now argues that it's former President Barack Obama's fault.

""I would just note for the viewers that since ‘bump stock' has not probably been in the lexicon before,"" Conway said on ""Fox and Friends,"" ""this is a device that President Obama's ATF decided would not be regulated in 2010. I think that's an important part of this conversation.""

And she's right. Halfway through Obama's first term, the ATF approved bump stocks, that device found in the possession of the Las Vegas shooter, which allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire almost at full-auto. Because the accessory uses the shoulder of the shooter and the momentum of the recoil to increase the rate of fire, instead of internal mechanical parts, the agency decided that the device ""is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.""",Trump White House Has a 'Bump Stock' Strategy: Blame Obama,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/06/trump-white-house-has-bump-stock-strategy-blame-obama

An old rule of thumb holds that when someone says it’s not about the money, it’s really about the money.

But there are exceptions to almost every rule. The National Rifle Association is a case in point.

In the wake of the horror in Las Vegas this week, countless politicians, journalists and commentators are insisting that the National Rifle Association has a “stranglehold” on the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton claimed that the GOP-controlled Congress simply does “whatever they are told to do” by the NRA and the gun lobby.

The Washington Post and New York Times laid out splashy reports chronicling how much money the NRA has given to Republican congressmen. “Since 1998, the National Rifle Association has donated $3,533,294 to current members of Congress,” the Post reported in 2016.

The New York Times listed total NRA donations to certain GOP politicians alongside their statements offering condolences and prayers for the victims in Las Vegas. And the op-ed pages have been suffused with claims that the NRA has bought Republicans with blood money, stifling the popular will and thwarting democracy in the process.

There’s just one problem: It’s not true.

For maximum benefits, Dr. Doft recommends getting three peels about a month apart. But if you’ve still got stubborn dark spots that just won’t seem to fade, it might be time to try a laser treatment. Dr. Doft suggests tackling those pesky imperfections with a fraxel laser treatment, which is designed to improve skin texture and pigmentation, erasing brown spots and smoothing acne scars and fine wrinkles.","Get brighter, glowing skin with these tips",http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/05/get-brighter-glowing-skin-with-these-tips.html

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

If you’re looking for more immediate results, turn to the professionals. “Chemical peels remove damaged outer layers of facial skin in order to smooth texture, improve skin clarity and color, lessen fine lines, and reduce age spots, sun damage and hyperpigmentation. The peels lead to brighter and more refreshed skin with little or no downtime,” says Dr. Melissa Doft of Doft Plastic Surgery in New York City.

For maximum benefits, Dr. Doft recommends getting three peels about a month apart. But if you’ve still got stubborn dark spots that just won’t seem to fade, it might be time to try a laser treatment. Dr. Doft suggests tackling those pesky imperfections with a fraxel laser treatment, which is designed to improve skin texture and pigmentation, erasing brown spots and smoothing acne scars and fine wrinkles.","Get brighter, glowing skin with these tips",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/05/get-brighter-glowing-skin-with-these-tips.html

Tesla’s entrepreneurial boss Elon Musk claims his cars “already have the hardware needed for a full self-driving capability”, known in the industry as a “Level Five” engineering standard.

However in a briefing about autonomous cars to Australian media in Detroit overnight, Scott Miller, General Motors’ director of autonomous vehicle integration said “I think he’s full of crap”, when asked what he thought about Musk’s claim.

“If you think you can see everything you need for a Level Five autonomous (car) with cameras and radar, I don’t know how you do that,” said Mr Miller.

“To be what an SAE Level Five full autonomous system is, I don’t think he (Elon Musk) has the content to do that.”

The car industry tests extensively before releasing new technology to the public.

“We put the customer in the middle of everything; we think it’s irresponsible to say (a car has fully autonomous capability) at this point,” said Mr Miller.

“The level of technology in doing what it takes to do … Level Four or Level Five, which is cameras and radar, I don’t think it’s physically possible (with what Tesla currently has),” he said.

“I think you need the right sensors and the right computer package to do it. We have lydar, radar and cameras on (our cars). The reason we have that type of sensor package is … to be deeply integrated into Level Five, you should have some redundancies (back-up measures in case of equipment failures).”

Mr Miller added: “Do you really want to trust one sensor measuring the speed of a car coming into an intersection before you pull out? I think you need some confirmation.”

Mr Miller said lydar and radar systems do a good job of measuring object speed and cameras do a great job of identifying objects.

Tesla’s autopilot hardware technology suite includes eight cameras, one radar and ultrasonic sensors.

“You can use the right sensor images to give you competence in what you’re seeing,” said Mr Miller. “That’s important if we’re going to put this technology out for general consumption to the public.

“Could you do it with what’s in the current (Tesla) Model S? I don’t think so.”

Sindelar replaced David Blough in the first half and had the best game of his career. He finished 19 of 26 with a career-high 248 yards and one touchdown.

And he helped make Jeff Brohm's first Big Ten win with the Boilermakers (3-2, 1-1) a memorable one.

More Gophers coverage

The game was delayed for 1 hour, 28 minutes after rain and lightning moved into the area -- just moments after Purdue made a 19-yard field goal to take a 16-14 lead with 9:58 left in the fourth quarter.

When play resumed, the Golden Gophers (3-2, 0-2) took more than 7 minutes off the clock and took a 17-16 lead on Emmit Carpenter's 38-yard field goal.

It didn't last long.

Four plays after D.J. Knox's 44-yard kickoff return, Jones faked out a defender on a run around the right side, cut inside and jogged in for the go-ahead score.

Ja'Whaun Bentley sealed it with a 76-yard interception return with 11 seconds left.

The first weather delay at Ross-Ade Stadium since Sept. 8, 2007, wasn't the only oddity.

Minnesota forced four turnovers in the first half and ran for 227 yards but couldn't put the game away.

Instead, after converting their first two takeaways into touchdowns to take a 14-6 halftime lead, they stalled.

That kept Purdue in the game, and eventually the Boilermakers took advantage.

Sindelar started the second half by throwing a 22-yard TD pass to Knox to make it 14-13. He had the Boilermakers in position to take the lead late in the third, too, but kicker Spencer Evans missed a 52-yard attempt wide left.

When Sindelar got his next chance, he drove the Boilermakers to the Minnesota 2, setting up J.D. Dellinger's short field goal.

Moments later, players and coaches were instructed to clear the field and once they were gone, fans streamed down the stadium steps and scrambled across the field and even onto the playing surface as they looked for shelter. Some made it before the deluge of rain; many were drenched.

The victory came on the same day Purdue honored Joe Tiller, its career leader in wins. Tiller died the previous Saturday in Wyoming.

THE TAKEAWAY

Minnesota: It seemed like the Golden Gophers were set up for a win. Shannon Brooks ran for 116 yards, Rodney Smith ran for 88 and they easily won the turnover battle. But they couldn't close it out, and that's something they'll need to figure out as the season progresses.

Purdue: Athletic director Mike Bobinski wanted a tougher team this year. He's got it. The Boilermakers have not lost back-to-back games this season, have matched their overall and conference victory totals from last season and did it Saturday by battling back after a ragged first half.

Bruce Hornsby could be heard at Key West’s Mallory Square as a “reclamation party” got underway, Thursday afternoon. The feeling was positive and the outlook was bright.

Hours later, Key West Mayor Craig Cates came in to Two Friends Patio Restaurant for dinner, as nearby Duval Street began to show signs of life.

“Key West is going to be open for business soon,” said Cates.

When asked about the higher volume of people out and about, the mayor replied, “Well, we’re taking visitors now. We haven’t advertised yet,” he said.

Cates, however, pointed out that the hardest hit parts of the Keys are still picking up the pieces from Irma’s devastation. “We understand our neighbors to the north in the Florida Keys got more damage than us,” he said.

In nearby Big Pine Key, the cleanup is still ongoing.

Among those cleaning up are 85-year-old Wes Harris and his wife. “We’ve been married 63 years,” he said.

The couple rode out the storm near their now beat-up home.

The wheelchair ramp into Harris’ home was just recently repaired by first responders, but there’s still so much more to do.

“See that rock? You see how big that rock is?” Harris said as he pointed to a large boulder in his yard. “That’s not my rock. I don’t know where the hell it came from.”

The legally blind U.S. Army veteran, who suffers from spinal stenosis, lost his orchid ranch, which he says had between 7,000 and 8,000 flowers.

Harris is so tough that the idea of getting a little emotional over the relief effort in the aftermath of the storm makes him annoyed.

“I just can’t believe how everybody has helped. It’s absolutely unbelievable,” Harris said.

Harris’ post-storm story isn’t necessarily unique. Residents told 7News about problems with their house, their boat, or in some cases, both.

Big names also came to help out the Keys, in the form of former football player Tim Tebow and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

“So many people are so tough, and what they’ve gone through,” said Tebow. “You know what’s even more special? So many people, who don’t know what’s even going on with their houses, but they’re still volunteering for other people that need help.”

Residents appreciated Tebow’s visit. “He’s such a huge model for me, so it’s a nice thing that he came down here to the Keys,” said one woman.

7News cameras captured Rubio posing for pictures, as food, ice and relief supplies got to those in need.

When asked what he would say to those residents who fear they may be forgotten, Rubio responded: “They won’t be forgotten by us — I don’t know if someone else will — primarily because we’ve spent a lot of time, personally, in the Keys, up and down this place. I mean my family, we’ve had so many incredible memories here. We want to see the Keys come back.”

Meanwhile, Harris indicated he will make it through that strong current called adversity, probably because of his big heart. “You’ve got to keep stroking, bud. That’s all you can do,” he said.

As the reclamation party begins in Key West, many residents feel that, because the cleanup is still underway, the party is happening too soon. however, others feel that it needs to happen to show that the Florida Keys are still alive.

Officials said tourism will return to Key West in a limited capacity on Sunday with the arrival of a cruise ship at the Margaritaville Pier. It is scheduled to arrive at noon.

Peter Hacking was driving Ellie and Grayson hom after picking them up at the babysitter, according to the paper.","A Texas woman is criticizing the two-year sentence an illegal immigrant received for killing her husband and two youngest children in a car crash last year.

Courtney Hacking told “Fox & Friends” Saturday that the sentence in a Texas state court doesn’t compensate her for the loss of her 36-year-old husband Peter, a volunteer firefighter, 4-year-old daughter Ellie and 22-month-old son Grayson in the accident.

“People think his crime and his punishment seem to fit because he was an illegal immigrant,” she said, referring to Mexican Margarito Quintero Rosales who pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in connection with the crash. “But to me being illegal in the country was a crime on its own so I don’t understand how he did get only two years.”

She added, “To me I take it offensively. I take it personally.”

Cops say Quintero swerved into Hacking’s vehicle which was coming the other way when he fell asleep at the wheel, WFAA-TV reported.

The sentencing took place Sept. 29. The sentence was the maximum under state law, the station reported.

Quintero has been jailed since the accident. He will complete the sentence in about another 110 days.

He is serving that sentence as he serves a two-year federal sentence for reentering the U.S. illegally after being deported. Court records show he was charged with that crime after the accident and sentenced last month.

Quintero was also arrested after the crash for having no driver’s license, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Peter Hacking was driving Ellie and Grayson hom after picking them up at the babysitter, according to the paper.

“I want our laws enforced,” Hacking said on “Fox & Friends.”

“The message needs to be put across to them that when you come to this country you need to do it legally because when they come here all they’re getting is…they’re committing crimes, they’re getting a slap on the wrist and they’re going back to Mexico or they’re going back to whatever country they came from.”

Her husband was a legal immigrant from England, she said.

Hacking is now caring for her other four children alone.

She said she each day she sees Ellie and Grayson’s beautiful faces from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed.

According to a statement released by the directors, the next steps for the Hollywood mogul's future with the company will depend on his therapeutic progress and the results of an internal investigation.

The statement was signed by four of six remaining board members.

The move comes after The New York Times reported Thursday that Weinstein has reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment.

Weinstein's alleged inappropriate behavior with women in the last 30 years was detailed in the bombshell report. In it, actress Ashley Judd described being lured to Weinstein's hotel room, only to find him wearing a bathrobe and requesting sexual favors.

The report also detailed encounters Weinstein allegedly had with other women working for the Weinstein Company, as well as official settlements from people associated with him, including actress Rose McGowen, who was issued a $100,000 settlement that Weinstein specifically said was not an admission of guilt.

Following the report from The Times, Weinstein announced plans to sue the publication for $50 million. The producer said he would sue because he allegedly wasn't afforded the opportunity to ""respond appropriately"" to specific allegations.

“What I am saying is that I bear responsibility for my actions, but the reason I am suing is because of the Times’ inability to be honest with me, and their reckless reporting,” Weinstein told the New York Post. “They told me lies. They made assumptions.

“The Times editors were so fearful they were going to be scooped by New York Magazine and they would lose the story, that they went ahead and posted the story filled with reckless reporting, and without checking all they had with me and my team,” Weinstein continued.

The Times says it stands by its reporting.

Weinstein also spoke of wanting to ""respect women and do better.""

“I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different,” Weinstein told the Post. “I worked at a record company that, if you were five minutes late, they’d hit you with a baseball bat.

“In the past I used to compliment people, and some took it as me being sexual, I won’t do that again. I admit to a whole way of behavior that is not good. I can’t talk specifics, but I put myself in positions that were stupid, I want to respect women and do things better,” he said.

News of the leave of absence follows reports that Anita Dunn, a key aide to former President Barack Obama, ""counseled"" the Tinseltown titan following the report from The Times.

Dunn, the managing director of K-Street firm SKDKnickerbocker, released a statement acknowledging she spoke to Weinstein following the report but noted that the firm's ""commitment to defending women’s rights remains as strong as ever.""

The board of directors of The Weinstein Co. named attorney John Kiernan of the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as the head of the internal investigation.

It is essential for The Weinstein Co. to have a culture where women can work with respect and without fear of harassment or discrimination, the company statement said.

“Paramedics already have basic skills in terms of delivering injections, and this approval allows us to give them training to do vaccination but only in very specific settings with very specific oversight,” Dr. Kristi Koening, director of the San Diego Emergency Medical Service, told the news outlet.

According to several media reports, 95 percent of the U.S. territory is still without power after the category 4 hurricane battered the island weeks ago. Some estimates have said that a full restoration of power may not return to Puerto Rico for as long as six months.

Tesla has not responded to a request for comment from Fox News.

Big opportunity for Tesla

In addition to selling electric cars, including the recently introduced Model 3, Tesla has an energy storage business, selling battery packs to commercial utilities, as well as home residences. It also has a solar panel business, after it acquired Solar City, co-founded by Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, for $2.6 billion in November 2016.

Tesla has powered such smaller islands as Kauai in Hawaii and Ta'u in American Samoa, according to the company's website. The populations of those islands is far less than the 3.4 million people living in Puerto Rico.

James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, parent of Fox News, is a member of Tesla's board of directors.

Tesla has already sent a number of its battery packs to Puerto Rico to help the island store energy in an effort to offset the shortage. Musk has also personally donated $250,000 in an effort to rebuild the island.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



More non-news on the Russia-collusion front came Wednesday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee said it has now verified what everyone knew nine months ago: Russia worked to sow chaos during the 2016 election; vote totals weren’t affected; and no evidence has emerged that Donald Trump was in cahoots with Moscow.

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.

How close was Fusion’s leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.

Witness how hard the Federal Bureau of Investigation is fighting to avoid divulging any information about the dossier. More than a month ago the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the FBI and the Justice Department, asking for dossier-related documents. Lawmakers were told to go swivel.

A little more than a week ago, the committee’s frustrated chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, took the case all the way to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who finally offered to make an FBI official available for a briefing. But the bureau is still withholding all documents. To date, Sen. Chuck Grassley’s Judiciary Committee has not received any paper from the FBI on Russia matters, despite numerous requests, some countersigned by the Democratic ranking member, Dianne Feinstein.

Increasingly, one name is popping up: Gregory Brower, who leads the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs. Mr. Brower is an odd man for the job. These gigs tend to go to more-junior people, since they involve the drudgery of answering calls from grumpy congressional staffers. Yet Mr. Brower is a former U.S. attorney—a job that requires Senate confirmation—and a former Nevada state senator.",About That Trump Dossier 'Wall',http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/06/about-trump-dossier-wall#commenting

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division.","Ironically, I was in bed last Sunday night reading a book about the challenges of America, when my 18-year-old daughter pushed open my bedroom door and blurted: “Have you heard what’s happening in Vegas? There’s a man with a machine gun who’s killing people at a concert!”

As I rushed to put on some clothes I caught myself whispering, “No, no, not another tragedy.”

I ran downstairs and flipped on the TV, where coverage had started only moments earlier. The first thing I saw was a reporter stopping wandering people and asking what they saw. Their zombie-like responses showed they were still in shock.

One shirtless guy in a cowboy hat had been splashed with blood, which prompted the reporter to ask if he had been injured. Unaware of the crimson stains, he semi-stuttered that the blood wasn’t his own but came from a victim he had helped to carry to safety.

Another guy who looked to be in his mid-20s, when asked where his shirt was, stumbled and stammered out the reply that he took off his shirt to cover the faces of the dead.

Neither seemed to comprehend nor consider the paradox: the worst of men and the best of men … utter grace amidst utter evil. I glanced at my daughter who just sat there clutching a pillow to her chest and cried.

Our nation has been repeatedly ravaged by numerous shootings of individuals, police officers and mass groups of people. On top of that, we are plagued with natural disasters, racial division, political upheaval and even nuclear missile threats from abroad.

We are a nation filled with unrest, a people who have been saturated by every tragedy as it has been plastered across our televisions, newspapers, internet and social media. We grieve for those brothers and sisters who suffer, we are repulsed and sickened by the depraved perpetrators, and we are inspired by the gallant saviors who courageously disregard their own safety at the expense of complete strangers.

Lights shine brightest on the darkest of nights and unknown heroes arise in the days of adversity.

Television networks have given airtime to those champions who scampered through gunfire in Las Vegas to help, just as they did to those who waded through floods and storm damage recently in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But we long for more; we desire to be quenched from their personal wells that drip with honor and valor.

In those heroes who willingly trod at death’s door, we see what is good in America and a portrait of who we can and should be. It’s why, now more than ever, we need less blame, politicizing and villains. We need more exposure to the common people who epitomize courage in the midst of cowardice – those who give us hope when all hope seems to be lost.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television. By the time my TV screen went dark after 4 a.m., the details were slim but there was less focus on the murderer and more on his victims.

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division. They were physically, verbally and morally objecting to the mayhem that sought to instill fear, hate and darkness. Their resistance converted into shielding others from bullets, calming the wounded as they were in the throes of death and carrying victims to safety.

And let’s never forget our brave law enforcement officers – the lately vilified men and women in blue who didn’t hesitate or vacillate when called upon to apprehend a demonic madman who was mowing down the innocent.

The book of John in the Bible states that there is a type of love that is greater than any other: it is the kind that embraces death so that others might have life. It is the rare, unconventional love that is dispensed independent of merit, worth or obligation but is gifted willingly because it comes from the purest of place … self-sacrifice.

This example has been written about for over 2,000 years and contains our greatest hope and purpose for eternal peace, purpose and brotherhood.","Las Vegas shooting: America, we've witnessed a new kind of protest -- against death, terror and hate",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/las-vegas-shooting-america-weve-witnessed-new-kind-protest-against-death-terror-and-hate.html

Make no mistake, among ourselves gun owners are the first to decry the heinous use of a firearm.
Gun owners are not evil.","Gun control is the hot topic of the day, and as usual it’s devolved into entrenched positions where many people supporting the Second Amendment will not give an inch, no matter the proposal. Why is that?

Do people who own firearms really believe that everyone should have the right to legally modify an AR platform so that it nearly duplicates the cyclic rate of a military assault weapon?

I had this conversation recently with a friend of mine, a former special operations soldier, who now makes a living providing firearms instruction to police SWAT units. As for me, I own two AR platforms, several pistols, shotguns and other rifles. I’m also a former special operations soldier, a member of the National Rifle Association, and support and defend the Second Amendment. We both agreed that bump stocks should be illegal.

Previously, bump stocks were simply toys that allowed recreational shooters to pretend they were firing an automatic weapon on the range. Because of the bump stock’s firing system, it isn’t inherently accurate, and the wasting of ammo using it relegated it to a gimmick. That was before the massacre in Las Vegas.

Bump stocks are no longer a gimmick. Accuracy became irrelevant when the target set was a crowd of 22,000 concert-goers in an open field in Las Vegas, where 58 people were shot dead and nearly 500 were hospitalized when a gunman opened fire last Sunday in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Fully automatic weapons are currently prohibited without an enormous expenditure of time, effort and money. Any mechanical device that is designed to enhance the cyclic rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon to duplicate that capability should be illegal – and should include devices separate from the bump stock, such as hand cranks.

I imagine the majority of gun owners would feel the same way, although I’m sure I’ll get hate mail from some.

After some vacillating from members of Congress about studies and research, the NRA finally issued a statement Thursday that called on the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “to immediately review whether these devices (bump stocks) comply with federal laws.” The statement added: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.”

Why did the NRA and staunch Second Amendment defenders in Congress not immediately call for making bump stocks illegal after the deadly rampage in Las Vegas Sunday? Why the equivocating when the issue is pretty clear-cut?

The answer is that gun owners see the fight in zero-sum terms, believing that the other side doesn’t care about preventing another Las Vegas, but instead wants to attack firearms ownership however it can. There is no faith in the intentions of gun control advocates, and for good reason.

The blood hadn’t even dried in the streets of Las Vegas before the de facto leader of the left, Hillary Clinton, tweeted about a suppressor bill currently in Congress. Immediately, the Twittersphere took up the charge, proclaiming that if the killer had used a “silencer,” the death toll would have been exponentially worse.

This is absolute hogwash, as everyone who has a modicum of knowledge about guns knows. To us, it’s a window into the true agenda. Hollywood would have you believe that a suppressor renders the bullet whisper quiet. That is simply untrue.

The shooter was four football fields away from his victims, and the sound everyone hears on the videos is not the explosion of the gunpowder, it’s the noise of the bullets breaking the sound barrier, something the suppressor does nothing to muffle.

In fact, the average suppressor simply lowers the gunfire to hearing-safe levels, but it’s certainly still loud (full disclosure: one of my AR rifles is suppressed). The fact is that suppressors would not have increased the death toll in Las Vegas, and Clinton knows it or should know it – even if her minions do not.

And yet Clinton used the tragedy of Las Vegas to further her agenda of attacking anything pertaining to firearms instead of working toward a solution to prevent a future mass casualty event. Gun owners see this, and instead of encouraging dialogue across the divide, it simply stiffens their will to resist.

Make no mistake, among ourselves gun owners are the first to decry the heinous use of a firearm. But when faced with the clearly partisan and cynical use of every event to further an overarching agenda, we close ranks reflexively – even over something as simple as the bump stock.

Gun owners are not evil. But we do fear the hidden machinations of the people espousing “common sense solutions” – especially when the proposal in question is anything but. If we as a nation truly want to work together to prevent tragedies like Las Vegas, the first requirement is trust in the good faith of the other side, and as Clinton just illustrated, that trust isn’t there.","Gun owners are not evil, but their opponents want to attack firearms ownership however they can",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/gun-owners-are-not-evil-but-their-opponents-want-to-attack-firearms-ownership-however-can.html

The media mogul is the ultimate bro-choicer, an adoring donor to the Democratic Party, defended by some of the left’s most powerful women.

Weinstein has been accused in a lengthy New York Times story of doing some truly horrendous things to women, totally unsolicited − also known as sexual harassment − over a period of nearly three decades. His alleged victims were talented young actresses and other women who had the potential to build successful careers on their own without some ugly, creepy man coercing them into giving him a massage or worse.

Gross.

But this is Hollywood, and the feminists are the women who defend creeps like Weinstein.

Anita Dunn, a close associate of President Obama who became his communications director for a time at the White House, has been reported to have counseled Weinstein after the allegations broke in the media.

Even more troubling is that celebrity women’s advocate attorney Lisa Bloom is representing Weinstein. This is a woman who has represented victims in high-profile sexual harassment cases. Throwing that legacy away, she agreed to represent Weinstein, whom she said she has counseled that “times have changed” and he “needs to evolve into a higher standard.” Really?

Bloom’s reasoning regarding Weinstein gets better, though: “He has acknowledged mistakes he has made. He is reading books and going to therapy. He is an old dinosaur learning new ways. He wants to reach out to any of the women who may have issues with him to talk to them in a respectful, peaceful way, with me present if that is acceptable to them.”

I hope Bloom has a better answer for the women who Weinstein is accused of sexually harassing and forcing to look at him half-clothed or with no clothes at all, with tears in their eyes, as he emotionally blackmailed them for sex.

But this is Hollywood. This is Hugh Hefner’s world. This is the liberal paradise of promoting equal rights and justice for women, yet defending the men who use them for their own satisfaction, discarding them for younger versions every year, and then complaining about it years later when the women finally have the courage to say “enough!”

This is not true feminism. Supporting men who tear down women for their own use, supporting free access to taxpayer-funded abortion so men can cover up their own conduct, and mistreating women for decades is nothing for women to get behind.

During my years of painting people’s homes, I’ve learned that small spaces don’t have to be boring or go unnoticed. All it takes is a little paint. By adding paint in strategic places around the home, you can easily and inexpensively transform a space. Plus, there is a good chance you could accomplish at least one of these eight painting projects during the course of one weekend.

Here are eight spaces to consider painting and my tips and tricks on making even the smallest places have a big impact.

1. Entryway. When a guest arrives, their first impression is based on your home’s exterior and the front door. Realtors call this curb appeal. But the very next thing guests will notice is the area right inside your front door, so you should use it to make a statement.

If your home has a formal entry, choose a paint color that is one to two shades darker than the next room. A darker paint color in the entryway can make the space feel more inviting, like a warm hug.

If your home has an open floor plan without a defined entryway, use paint to create one. Try a bold color on the wall surrounding the front door and an adjacent wall as visual borders for the entry.

2. Hall bath. Small bathrooms might appear to be limited when it comes to design, but they can easily be transformed with a quick paint color update.

How do you pick a color for this small bathroom? Look around your home for spots of color that crop up in your art or drapes. For example, a living room that is mostly beige with blue accent pieces would coordinate well with a bathroom painted in that same shade of blue.

RELATED: What Color Works Best in a Traditional-Style Bathroom?

Dark colors also have been trending with homeowners I’ve worked with lately. To offset the dark nature of the paint, we typically recommend keeping the other design details, such as the floors and sink, light to make sure the room still feels open and bright.

Worried one color will overwhelm the small space? Consider installing a chair rail as a natural divider. Then paint the lower portion of the wall in a statement color while leaving the wall area above a neutral tone.

3. Bookshelf. Whether the bookshelves in your home are built-in or freestanding, you can easily create style with paint. Remove the shelves from the surround and paint the back wall of the case. Don’t be afraid to go bold with your paint color, because once the shelves and objects on the shelves are in place, your color choice will seem more subtle. You will get an instant pop of color without being too in-your-face.

4. Closet. This space is often overlooked when it comes to paint, but a fresh coat of paint on the walls and shelving in your closet can go a long way. With a small- or medium-sized closet, keep your paint color choice bright and light.

With a large walk-in closet, consider using a paint color that complements the attached room.

For shelving, use an oil-based paint for durability against scratches and scuffs.

5. Hallway. Hallways are typically long and narrow and, depending on the lighting, can also be dark. When choosing a paint color for the hallway, consider the paint colors in connecting rooms and then go one to two shades lighter. The colors will complement each other and coordinate the home’s overall design. Plus, a lighter shade will brighten up the passageway.

6. Accent wall. If you have a small amount of paint and want to make the biggest impact on your home’s design, then an accent wall is your best bet. Choose a wall in your living room or master bedroom that you want to highlight, such as the area behind the sofa or bed.

Once it is painted, hang coordinating artwork on the accent wall to finish the design.

7. Kitchen nooks and crannies. Typically, I find there isn’t too much paintable space in the kitchen. But when I do find it, it’s between the cabinets, appliances and backsplash.

When space is limited, I always encourage owners to go bold and use colors that offset the room’s features. For example, in a kitchen with white cabinets and natural stone countertops, pick a hunter green or dark blue. In large quantities, these dark shades might feel overwhelming, but in small quantities, they give the room a strong dimension.

8. Laundry room. You can’t avoid the task of laundry, so at least make it a room that is easy on the eyes and generates positivity. Think of a paint color you would never dream of using in the social areas of your home but would make you happy, such as a playful orange, a bold purple or a sunshine yellow.

Once outfitted with the plastic exoskeletons, the small bots– dubbed Primers– are able to swim, walk, roll, sail and glide.

Created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), the Primer bot is a magnetic cube only a few centimeters in size that can be remote controlled using magnetic fields. Via remote control, this micro machine is able to move across surfaces before picking up one of four exoskeletons, each made from a plastic sheet. When heated, these sheets fold around the bot into predetermined shapes that enable Primer to become a tiny boat or hang–glider, the latter allowing it to fly through the air when falling.

Researchers at CSAIL created the exoskeletons to get around some of the hurdles faced in creating transforming robots.

GET SET FOR SEX ROBOT REVOLUTION, SURVEY SAYS

“It is difficult to build robots that can change their form or function at a very fine resolution - so-called ‘cellular machines’ are still far too coarse to be very useful,” CSAIL director Dr. Daniela Rus told Fox News. “The advantage of these exoskeletons is that the bodies are very precisely tuned for each particular task.”

Her team created the new bot by combining two of their creations: the cube-shaped robot that can assemble itself into different configurations, and the small origami robots that can be customized to fold into specific shapes from sheets of plastic.

“Combining these two approaches, we’ve been able to develop a basic robot body with fine-tuned ‘super-suits’ (exoskeletons) that it can pick up and drop off for different tasks,” Rus added.

She hopes that the tiny robots could one day be used for multi–phase surgery. “We’ve previously developed an origami robot that can be swallowed, with the idea that it could be used to do medical procedures inside your stomach,” she explained. “With this new approach, you could imagine being able to swallow a basic cube robot to do one task - deliver a drug, for example - and then swallow additional robots that can be magnetically controlled to combine with the robot to do other things, like patch wounds or perform simple surgeries.”

The exoskeleton technology could also be used in larger applications. For instance, a smaller robotic car could be built that would be able to squeeze into small spaces, along with an exoskeleton to fit around it and hold a few bikes.

ROBOTS COULD OVERPOWER HUMANS THANKS TO NEW 'ARTIFICIAL MUSCLE'

“It’s exciting to think that a robot could serve as a ‘Swiss army knife’ that could be used for a range of tasks depending on the different accessories it has,” Rus explained. “This is a research prototype, so there are no immediate plans to commercialize, but we certainly would encourage other researchers to build on our designs and explore the possibility of bringing these sorts of systems to the marketplace.”

Rus and her team are currently working to make robots with exoskeletons at different scales to support larger applications, such as the aforementioned car–sized model. They are also working on the “mini–surgeon” bot capable of incision–free surgery, which could potentially use different types of biomaterials so that it can do more long-term operations.","Transforming robot can swim, walk or glide",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/06/transforming-robot-can-swim-walk-or-glide.html

The governor said Saturday that residents in evacuation zones in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties should heed the warnings and seek safe shelter from the storm. He said shelters will be available to people who have nowhere else to go.

""Hurricane Nate is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges, strong winds and tornadoes that could reach across the Panhandle,"" Scott said. The evacuations affect roughly 100,000 residents in the western Panhandle.

The Pensacola International Airport announced it will close at 6 p.m. Saturday and remain closed on Sunday.

However, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport remained open Saturday.

""The airport does not close,"" spokeswoman Michelle Wilcut said. ""We are urging customers to check with their specific airlines to see whether their flights have been canceled because there have been some of those.""

Waterside sections of New Orleans, outside the city's levee system, were under an evacuation order. About 2,000 people were affected. But not everyone was complying.

Gabriel Black of New Orleans' Venetian Isles community sent his wife, a friend, and three dogs to a hotel in the city. Black stayed behind because an 81-year-old neighbor refused to leave.

""I know it sounds insane, but he has bad legs and he doesn't have anybody who can get to him,"" Black said.

Others nearby were staying as well. Nancy and Cleve Bell said their house is built so high off the ground that it stayed dry in the floods after Hurricane Katrina. Nancy Bell said they have a generator and plenty of supplies, and will be safe.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he spoke with President Trump on Saturday morning. ""He assured me that LA would have all the assistance we need as we prepare for #Nate,"" the governor posted on Twitter.

The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning was in effect from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. A hurricane warning was also in effect for metropolitan New Orleans and nearby Lake Pontchartrain. Tropical storm warnings extended west of Grand Isle to Morgan City, Louisiana, and around Lake Maurepas and east of the Alabama-Florida border to the Okaloosa-Walton County line in the Florida Panhandle.

We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.
Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone.
And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment.","For centuries, medical professionals have learned lessons from the casualties of war. In the wake of the horrendous shooting spree that left 58 people dead and sent nearly 500 to hospitals in Las Vegas last Sunday, the medical community – and ordinary citizens as well – should learn lessons about how to respond when an American city is turned into a war zone.

Learning these lessons is critically important to save lives, because the sad truth is that it is just a matter of time before guns, bombs, cars, trucks, planes or something else is used by mentally disturbed people or terrorists to attack innocent people again somewhere in our country.

When people are seriously injured, a rapid response can be the difference between life and death. But we can’t always count on trained medical professionals to be nearby when we need them.

Here are some ideas that can help us all deal with the possibility of violence or another medical emergency suddenly engulfing us:

First, as terrible as the attack in Las Vegas was, we shouldn’t panic. We can be sure that some people will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and fall victim to a violent attack, but the overwhelming majority of us never will. So while we need to be better prepared for an attack, we must not be paralyzed by fear. That in itself is harmful to our health. We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.

Second, as many of us as possible should get some basic first-aid training. Learn how to administer CPR. How to tie a tourniquet to stop bleeding from a wound. What you can do if someone is burned. How to immobilize a broken arm or leg. You don’t have to be a doctor or nurse to learn the basics of dealing with a medical emergency until the person you are helping can get treatment from a medical professional. Schools should provide this training to children and community groups should make it available to adults.

As a practicing physician I taught my children at home how to administer CPR, how to apply a proper tourniquet and how to deal with penetrating injuries. I remember some of my friends telling me: “Manny, if you want your kids to be doctors that’s fine, otherwise, you’ll be traumatizing them!” No, I don’t necessarily want my kids to be doctors, but rather be involved in our society. We all need to be part of the solution.

Third, know your blood type and have a card in your wallet listing it. Should you ever need a transfusion in an emergency, this information will be important for those treating you.

Fourth, donate blood to a blood bank. Having a plentiful blood supply on hand in an emergency can help medical professional save lives. The American Red Cross website makes it easy to find a blood drive near you by typing in your ZIP code.

In addition to these steps that everyone can take, emergency medical responders should learn lessons from what went right and what might have gone better following the Las Vegas attack and other mass casualty incidents, such as natural disasters. Studies of the emergency response should be shared widely in the medical community and among government officials.

Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone. New lessons learned in domestic attacks can do the same.

For example, the horror of World War I accelerated the learning and technical proliferation of surgery in the field of wound management. We began to learn about what unsanitary conditions could do not only in the battlefield, but in the cities to where the wounded would be transported.

In addition, the development of wound drainage techniques and surface wound antiseptics became the standards in many military hospitals in World War I, minimizing complications from infection. Civilian hospitals then made these improvements.

World War I also brought us the first concept of a blood bank and how the utilization of blood products would potentially save lives. Specific typing of blood became available and preservation of blood products was discovered in order to maintain the freshness of blood.

Surgeons and scientists during World War I became aware of the treatment of shock. Many scientists began to publish in the field of physiology, which led to discoveries for the treatment of hypothermia, fluid resuscitation and oxygen delivery.

World War II gave us the analysis of medical triaging and how important survival is from the time of injury to treatment. This discovery is the hallmark of trauma victim treatment to this day.

In addition, during WWII surgical techniques were improved and subspecialties in surgical training became the norm. The war taught us about the importance of medical teams of nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists and surgeons. More antibiotics were developed beyond penicillin. The treatment of trauma became more sophisticated.

From the end of the Korean War through the Vietnam War and up until 2006, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units were set up in a matter of hours, providing medical treatment near the front lines to wounded soldiers. A book, film and hit TV show made millions of Americans aware of the MASH units.

The Vietnam War gave us not only more sophistication in vascular surgery but also the framework of what it is today to have a trauma center. And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment. Now helicopters are used for the same purpose in this country.

In the long run, I know things will get better. Things will change. Because Good will prevail against Evil. In the meantime, we are in the middle of a war between Good and Evil and we need to minimize the casualties of war.",Dr. Manny Alvarez: The Las Vegas Massacre can teach us important lessons about saving lives,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/dr-manny-alvarez-las-vegas-massacre-can-teach-us-important-lessons-about-saving-lives.html

There’s a man with a machine gun who’s killing people at a concert!”

As I rushed to put on some clothes I caught myself whispering, “No, no, not another tragedy.”

I ran downstairs and flipped on the TV, where coverage had started only moments earlier. The first thing I saw was a reporter stopping wandering people and asking what they saw. Their zombie-like responses showed they were still in shock.

One shirtless guy in a cowboy hat had been splashed with blood, which prompted the reporter to ask if he had been injured. Unaware of the crimson stains, he semi-stuttered that the blood wasn’t his own but came from a victim he had helped to carry to safety.

Another guy who looked to be in his mid-20s, when asked where his shirt was, stumbled and stammered out the reply that he took off his shirt to cover the faces of the dead.

Neither seemed to comprehend nor consider the paradox: the worst of men and the best of men … utter grace amidst utter evil. I glanced at my daughter who just sat there clutching a pillow to her chest and cried.

Our nation has been repeatedly ravaged by numerous shootings of individuals, police officers and mass groups of people. On top of that, we are plagued with natural disasters, racial division, political upheaval and even nuclear missile threats from abroad.

We are a nation filled with unrest, a people who have been saturated by every tragedy as it has been plastered across our televisions, newspapers, internet and social media. We grieve for those brothers and sisters who suffer, we are repulsed and sickened by the depraved perpetrators, and we are inspired by the gallant saviors who courageously disregard their own safety at the expense of complete strangers.

Lights shine brightest on the darkest of nights and unknown heroes arise in the days of adversity.

Television networks have given airtime to those champions who scampered through gunfire in Las Vegas to help, just as they did to those who waded through floods and storm damage recently in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. But we long for more; we desire to be quenched from their personal wells that drip with honor and valor.

In those heroes who willingly trod at death’s door, we see what is good in America and a portrait of who we can and should be. It’s why, now more than ever, we need less blame, politicizing and villains. We need more exposure to the common people who epitomize courage in the midst of cowardice – those who give us hope when all hope seems to be lost.

As I watched the news coverage in the hours after the carnage in Las Vegas, I couldn’t peel my eyes from the television. By the time my TV screen went dark after 4 a.m., the details were slim but there was less focus on the murderer and more on his victims.

Those in Las Vegas were exhibiting a new kind of protest, the kind everybody watching was uniting around: a protest against death, terrorism, evil and division. They were physically, verbally and morally objecting to the mayhem that sought to instill fear, hate and darkness. Their resistance converted into shielding others from bullets, calming the wounded as they were in the throes of death and carrying victims to safety.

And let’s never forget our brave law enforcement officers – the lately vilified men and women in blue who didn’t hesitate or vacillate when called upon to apprehend a demonic madman who was mowing down the innocent.

The book of John in the Bible states that there is a type of love that is greater than any other: it is the kind that embraces death so that others might have life. It is the rare, unconventional love that is dispensed independent of merit, worth or obligation but is gifted willingly because it comes from the purest of place … self-sacrifice.

This example has been written about for over 2,000 years and contains our greatest hope and purpose for eternal peace, purpose and brotherhood.","Las Vegas shooting: America, we've witnessed a new kind of protest -- against death, terror and hate",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/demonic-las-vegas-killer-brings-out-grace-and-heroism-in-others.html

Nah. They turned to newly promoted, left-wing hack and occasional funnyman Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel, you’ll recall, served as the Democratic mouthpiece on ObamaCare recently. So he was all primed to do so again.

And he delivered an achingly embarrassing rant that journalists went nuts for. USA Today highlighted late-night show reaction calling for gun control under the headline: “If not now, then when?” The Washington Post bombarded readers with hot takes on Kimmel. Pop culture writer Emily Yahr called his comments an “emotional, scathing monologue about gun control” in one of the three separate stories she wrote about Kimmel’s monologue.

Post TV critic Hank Stuever agreed, adding: “Jimmy Kimmel is saying everything right.” He went on to discuss “a curious evolution process that turned late-night hosts into the nation’s moral conscience.” But remember, The Washington Post, D-Resist, is neutral.

Singing Kimmel’s praises became a journalism default. The New York Times conveniently used nearly identical phrasing, saying Kimmel was “acting as a social conscience as he called out politicians, the National Rifle Association and complacent citizens.” Even the sports site The Ringer tried this strategy, proclaiming that “Kimmel has become the voice that’s best encapsulated a large section of America’s conscience.”

CNN’s Bill Carter wrote an especially ridiculous piece under the headline: “How Jimmy Kimmel became America's conscience.” Carter’s piece read like a press release from Kimmel’s publicist: “Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points – because he is a regular guy.”

Maybe he seems like a regular guy, but he’s not. Kimmel earns $10 million a year and has a net worth of about $35 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. Everybody reading who’s a millionaire, raise your hands.

And with all the sudden pretense that Kimmel is such a moral leader, it might be good to recall the Jimmy Kimmel origin story. Kimmel built his career with jokes about genocide and promoting R. Kelly, who’s accused of sex with minors. And then there’s Kimmel’s time on “The Man Show,” where he urged young women to get on a trampoline and jump around to please the audience. Several even stripped, much to the pleasure of our new moral conscience.

The PR-ish Carter swallowed the Kimmel talking points 100 percent. Carter practically cheered Kimmel’s claim that “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to give you something to laugh about at night.""

Don’t believe a word of it. If Kimmel wanted to make us laugh, he could try. Instead, he had an agenda to push. Just like he did on ObamaCare. Just like all the other late-night hosts and most of TV – news or entertainment.

2. Media Push Gun Control, Attack NRA: The media have a pre-written script for gun stories – shift as soon as possible into a discussion of gun control and declare the National Rifle Association evil. Or worse.

GQ’s professional kook Keith Olbermann called the NRA “a terrorist organization” and the media ate it up. The Hill, HuffPost and Raw Story were just a few to highlight his comments, even though it’s been years since Olbermann has been anything other than a circus sideshow to American politics.

But Olbermann isn’t alone. Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw came out against the NRA in full attack mode, urging citizens “to organize on the other side.” He even claimed if members of Congress run against the NRA “you’re portrayed as a traitor to America.”

New York Times theoretically conservative columnist Bret Stephens made a mockery of his credentials and called for a complete repeal of the Second Amendment. Claiming he “never understood the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment,” Stephens skewered most of what the left proposes for gun control. “Expansive interpretations of the right to bear arms will be the law of the land — until the ‘right’ itself ceases to be,” he argued.

MSNBC proven liar and anchor Brian Williams said he didn’t understand why the Sandy Hook shooting hadn’t resulted in more gun regulation. “Why don't we act? What is the problem? What was it about first graders losing their lives that wasn't sad enough to result in changes?” he asked. Fellow MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blamed ""extreme gerrymandering"" for NRA success. Apparently, he’s never heard of the Democratic gerrymander in Maryland.

And when the media weren’t pushing an agenda, they were busy being outright wrong about guns. The Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski could work 24-7 squashing these errors and barely make a dent. Gutowski summed it up nicely, writing: “There is no way around it: The news industry is incomprehensibly inept at reporting on guns.” He noted that only three news organizations cover the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives – the Washington Free Beacon, The Trace, and Guns.com.

3. Look to Hollywood to Learn How to Think Correctly: You don’t have to look far in Tinseltown to find stars saying all the right (left) things about guns. Singer Nancy Sinatra recommended that NRA members “should face a firing squad.” Public Enemy’s Chuck D echoed much of the left, describing the NRA as a “terrorist organization.” Comedian Michael Ian Black repeated an identical sentiment: “The NRA is a terrorist organization. There's no other way to say it.”

Hollywood was awash in such declarations. Perennial left-winger Michael Moore came out with a complete rewrite of the Second Amendment that essentially guts it and doesn’t even let owners keep guns in their homes. Britain’s Piers Morgan declared: “The NRA is killing America” and singer Lady Gaga said “there is blood on the hands of those who have the power to legislate.”

All of that makes perfect sense because we know that Hollywood never makes any movies with guns or gun violence in them. Never at all. Last year’s top 10 movies included four superhero flicks that feature tons of gun violence – including “Suicide Squad” and “Deadpool.” And 2017 is already shaping up to have the top 10 films also filled with gun violence. That is, after all, how Hollywood stars get paid.

4. ‘Decades of Sexual Harassment Accusations Against Harvey Weinstein’: That’s the actual headline of The New York Times piece on a Hollywood A-lister long-rumored to have a major dark side. The story is both horrifying and hard to put down. Weinstein has simultaneously apologized for having “caused a lot of pain,” and claimed he will sue the paper for $50 million.

The story begins with an anecdote featuring actress Ashley Judd being “asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower.” The creep factor is about 112 on a scale of 1-10. ABC and CBS evening news shows covered the incredible story. NBC skipped it entirely.

In nearly three decades, “after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity,” wrote The Times.

Weinstein’s statement is especially bizarre, as he begs for forgiveness from left-wingers in Hollywood and offers them exactly what they want – war with the NRA. “I want a second chance in the community, but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it,” he wrote. A few sentences later, he vowed to go to war against the gun group. “I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party.”

Welcome to Hollywood, where you can rape a young girl and get an Oscar and a standing ovation, like Roman Polanski did. And you can be accused of decades of sexual harassment and try to buy yourself out of it by warring against the right.

And This Is Awful, Too: Some stories are worth noting, even if they didn’t garner a ton of media coverage. MSNBC lefty and political director Chuck Todd wants to build the wall. No, not the wall between the U.S. and Mexico. That’s too conservative. No, Todd wants to “reinforce the wall between the news media and the politicians.” That and more fun nuggets were included in Sunday’s New York Times Magazine piece with the hilarious headline: “Chuck Todd Thinks It’s Important to Stay Neutral.” Stop laughing.

Religion might be in the First Amendment, but it shouldn’t be near the National Mall, according to Washingtonian magazine. The mag ran an article on a new D.C. museum, with the bigoted headline: “The Museum of the Bible Will Probably Be a Big Hit. But It Doesn’t Belong Near the Mall.” Politics and Culture Editor Rob Brunner admitted: “I couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable with the whole endeavor.” He ended with a typically secular journalist comment: “The Museum of the Bible, well intentioned though it may be, feels like something of a violation.” That’s probably how most Christians feel when they read any news about faith.","Journalists claim Kimmel is America's 'conscience,' NRA is 'terrorist,' and other awful media mistakes",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/journalists-claim-kimmel-is-americas-conscience-nra-is-terrorist-and-other-awful-media-mistakes.html

So, when President Trump dismisses the notion of Russian “collusion” as a hoax, he is striking a resonate chord.","Amid the tragic events in Las Vegas this week, what would otherwise constitute a major news event in Washington received only passing notice. Which was perfectly fine with the mainstream media since it would prefer to ignore the news anyway. It does not hew to their carefully constructed narrative of Donald Trump as villain.

Here is the news: after an exhaustive 9-month investigation, the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee offered no evidence whatsoever that Trump or his associates “colluded” with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Nothing.

But wait, what about all those media stories which all but indicted and convicted President Trump for “collusion”? Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said on Thursday that his committee’s findings would contradict some of them. ""We will find that quite a few news organizations ran stories that were not factual”, he noted. Gee…what a surprise.

Yet, in a bizarre twist, the Republican and Democratic co-chairs said that the issue of collusion is “still open”. In other words, they’ve got bupkis… but they still might nose around.

The nation’s capital leaks like an old rusty bucket. And the torrent of leaks to the media on the multiple investigations into whether Trump colluded with the Russians leaves little doubt that if any evidence exists, we would surely know about it by now.

Only in Washington can you spend 9-months hunting for evidence, come up empty-handed, yet keep the probe going. It makes sense, I suppose, in the contorted ways of Congress. Why end the investigation when you can continue to squander endless taxpayer dollars chasing nonexistent evidence? After all, people keep hunting for the elusive Sasquatch and the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe someday…

Other Investigations

Since government redundancy is endemic on Capitol Hill, the House Intelligence Committee has been conducting a parallel investigation for the better part of a year. It, too, has come up with goose eggs. Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has flatly denied there is any evidence of “collusion.”

Even leading democrats, like Senators Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), have said they have seen no evidence of Trump- Russian collaboration. Both sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee. If such evidence existed, they would certainly know about it.

But even more compelling are the statements of senior Obama administration intelligence officials who were privy to all the information gathered by both the FBI and the alphabet soup of intel agencies which began investigating the matter more than a year ago. Take a gander at what they have said.

James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, has twice confirmed that he has seen no evidence of collusion. As the basis for his conclusion, he cited reports from the NSA, FBI and CIA. John Brennan, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has said the same thing –no sign of “collusion.”

And then there is James Comey. When asked if Clapper’s assessment was correct, the fired FBI Director testified that Clapper was “right,” there is no known evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians.

The search for incriminating evidence has not been for lack of trying. This was underscored by the Senate Intelligence Committee when it disclosed that it had conducted in excess of 100 interviews over 250 hours, held 11 open hearings, produced more than 4,000 pages of transcripts, and reviewed some 100,000 documents. Every intel official who drafted the report on Russian election meddling was interviewed, as were all relevant Obama administration officials. Every Trump campaign official the committee wanted to hear from was questioned.

Still nothing. Zero.

The Spy Game

The Obama administration was even more aggressive in its hunt for a smoking-gun, going so far as to spy on Trump and his campaign. Recent reports reveal that the FBI “wiretapped” former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, both before and after the election, as well as Carter Page, a Trump foreign policy adviser.

While this was going on, intelligence agencies were conducting secret surveillance that captured various Trump associates, listening in on their conversations. Obama officials “unmasked” their names and leaked at least one of them, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, to the media which then published it. This constitutes a crime under federal law.

Yet amid all the spying and eavesdropping on Trump and his campaign, including his transition team, no evidence of “collusion” with the Russians has surfaced. Why? Likely because it never happened.

It is indisputable that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 election, attempting to sow chaos in our democratic process. But, as the Senate Intelligence Committee pointed out, “No vote totals were altered by Russia.” Were voters, nonetheless, unduly influenced by fake advertising on social media websites, hacked emails and other propaganda? It's unclear.

But what’s abundantly clear is that there is no evidence revealed thus far which demonstrates that the Trump campaign collaborated or conspired with Russia to influence the election. This is completely consistent with the president’s repeated insistence that he never spoke with any Russians about the election and, if someone else in his campaign did, he knew nothing about it.

Yes, the president’s son met during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who allegedly promised information on Hillary Clinton. It is not prohibited under federal election laws, as explained in earlier columns . It is perfectly legal.

It is also true that Jeff Sessions and Michael Flynn met with the Russian Ambassador, as did many democrats on Capitol Hill. Such meetings are not unusual, despite the mainstream media’s unabashed hysteria. There is no evidence the election was ever discussed.

Even if there were conversations about the campaign with the Russians, “collusion” is not a crime under America’s criminal codes, except in cases of antitrust. There is not a single statute outlawing collaboration with a foreign government in a U.S. presidential election or any election. But these legal distinctions are irrelevant if it never happened.

The special counsel investigating all matters Russia appears to be focusing on Manafort and Flynn. Should Robert Mueller decide to seek an indictment of the pair, the charges will likely have nothing to do with Russian meddling or so-called “collusion.” Their respective business dealings and financial transactions outside the Trump campaign orbit have been under scrutiny for quite some time.

The Media

Washington is a place where secrets are kept about as often as politicians keep their word. The nation’s capital leaks like an old rusty bucket. And the torrent of leaks to the media on the multiple investigations into whether Trump colluded with the Russians leaves little doubt that if any evidence exists, we would surely know about it by now.

So, when President Trump dismisses the notion of Russian “collusion” as a hoax, he is striking a resonate chord. Most in the biased mainstream media loathe it, but only because they are tone deaf. They will not be deterred in their quest to convict the president, evidence be damned.

While they are chasing hoaxes, they may as well try to hunt down Nessie in the Scottish Highlands. Or Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest.

Their chances of finding conclusive evidence is about the same as proving what has become “The Great Collusion Hoax.”",Gregg Jarrett: The Trump-Russia 'collusion' and other great hoaxes,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/06/gregg-jarrett-trump-russia-collusion-and-other-great-hoaxes.html

More Wild coverage

Jaccob Slavin scored in the tiebreaker and the Hurricanes beat Minnesota 5-4 on Saturday night after the Wild forced overtime with a goal with 0.3 seconds left in regulation.

""Just got to focus on what's next -- obviously, there's nothing we can do about it after it goes in,"" Slavin said. ""So we've just got to focus on overtime there.""

Victor Rask scored late in regulation and Sebastian Aho had two assists in the third period while Noah Hanifin, Joakim Nordstrom and Derek Ryan also scored to help Carolina win its opener.

Mikko Koivu sent it to OT with his goal in the final second of the third. Jason Zucker, former Carolina captain Eric Staal and Chris Stewart also scored for the Wild.

Scott Darling made 23 saves in his debut as a full-time starter in the NHL and his first game with the Hurricanes, who traded for him during the offseason and then signed him to a four-year contract.

Slavin beat a sprawled-out Alex Stalock high with a backhand in the third round of the shootout, and Darling got a piece of Staal's shot to end it.

Carolina was 3-6 in shootouts last season and 2-5 the year before that.

""It just kind of happens out there,"" Slavin said. ""I couldn't tell you exactly what goes through my mind.""

It appeared as if Aho and Rask had made Darling a winner in dramatic fashion, with Rask taking a slick feed from the second-year forward and beating Stalock with a wrist shot with 1:34 left in regulation.

But Koivu whacked a loose puck past Darling amid a pileup in front of the net just before the horn sounded, and an official review determined that Matt Dumba did not interfere with the Carolina goalie during the scrum.

""I was looking right at the ref when it crossed the line, and he didn't see it cross the line,"" defenseman Ryan Suter said. ""I think he was just kind of watching everything. … It's too bad we had to come to that, but we got one point, and obviously one point's better than none.""

Stalock stopped 38 shots for the Wild, who led 3-1 late in the second period after killing an 88-second, 5-on-3 disadvantage. Staal made it a two-goal game by shaking free near the blue line, skating in on Darling and beating him with a wrist shot with 6:17 left.

""We were way too loose,"" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. ""We're not going to win a lot of games if we play like that and allow 40 shots a game. … It's not the way we practice and it's too loosey-goosey.""

Then came Carolina's rally: Ryan pulled the Hurricanes within a goal by redirecting a shot by Justin Williams with 3:40 left in the second, and Hanifin tied it at 3 after taking a pretty feed from Aho and slipping the puck past Stalock with 14:45 left in the third.

This is a season of promise for both teams, with Carolina aggressively adding players during the offseason in its bid to end the league's longest active playoff drought (eight years) and Minnesota confident that it has kept its window for Stanley Cup contention open after spending almost exactly to the $75 million salary cap.

Since the lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season, the Hurricanes have not made the playoffs in any season in which they lost their first game at PNC Arena.

""You go 0-1, the season's not over -- somebody's losing on opening night in everybody's first game,"" Carolina coach Bill Peters said. ""The trick's going to be to realize our potential and max each other out and push each other in practice to get better. Our upside with this group is very high.""

NOTES:RW Elias Lindholm also had two assists for the Hurricanes. … This was Jordan Staal's debut as Carolina's captain.

In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, some pundits are calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradication of our right to keep and bear arms.

Leading the charge is so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens, who is also a contributor over at conspiracy factory MSNBC.

“Repealing the [Second] amendment may seem like political mission impossible today, but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones,” Stephens wrote. “Gun ownership should never be outlawed, just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia. But it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection, either.”

Winkelmann cited Trump’s comments threatening military action against North Korea and argued “words, especially if they’re coming from someone who is the president, have consequences.”

TRUMP PRAISES 'BRAVERY' OF FIRST RESPONDERS IN LAS VEGAS

“I don’t know that these events would have inevitably happened whether or not he got elected, but he has rhetorical powers every president has to encourage or to discourage,” she said of the Las Vegas shooting. “So far all he’s done is to encourage violence.”

Fifty-eight people were killed about 500 were injured in the attack when Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino at attendees of a country music concert.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that a student told them Winkelmann’s comments polarized the classroom and students began shouting at each other.

The comments have since been criticized by both the university and the White House. Winkelmann has also issued an apology.

“While we respect academic freedom in the classroom and the right to free speech, we believe the comments were insensitive, especially given the series of events this week and the healing process that has begun in the community,” UNLV spokesman Tony Allen said.

“It is sad she is teaching students such divisive, inaccurate and irresponsible rhetoric,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “She should be ashamed of herself, and the university should look into it. What a terrible example to set for students.”

Winkelmann expressed regret about her comments to the newspaper.

“This week has been very difficult for members of our community, and we have allowed students space in our classes to discuss how they have been affected and to openly convey their feelings,” Winkelmann said. “I regret that my comments caused more pain during this difficult time. Emotions were running high and I wish I would have been more thoughtful in how I directed the conversation.”",Outrage as Nevada professor suggests Trump deserves blame for Las Vegas massacre,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/07/nevada-professor-suggests-trump-deserves-blame-for-las-vegas-massacre.html

On Friday the President and First Lady will host me, along with many other Latino leaders, for a celebration at the White House commemorating Hispanic Heritage Month.

Being a very public Hispanic supporter of Donald Trump is never easy, and I’ve endured myriad insults, from constant social media accusations that I’m a “Tio Tomas” (Uncle Tom), to in-person insults calling me a “coconut” (brown on the outside, white on the inside).

For the most part, I take these barbs in stride and realize that in the incredibly polarized political environment of recent years, politics truly is hardball. For my part, accepting insults is a small price to pay for saving our country from its slide toward mediocrity.

For far too long, the Democratic Party has shamelessly exploited race and ethnicity to create predictable voting blocks. But, despite big promises at election cycles, those same politicians have consistently failed to deliver tangible solutions to communities of color, as recent years see both a widening economic inequality vs. white households and a marked recent upturn in violent urban crime, which disproportionately afflicts blacks and Hispanics.

For far too long, the Democratic Party has shamelessly exploited race and ethnicity to create predictable voting blocks. But, despite big promises at election cycles, those same politicians have consistently failed to deliver tangible solutions to communities of color.

In contrast, in just nine months in office President Trump has already delivered real results for Hispanics in three key areas…with much more promise ahead!

First, and most importantly, our economy accelerates in tangible ways since the Inauguration, with manufacturing and consumer confidence indices soaring. This palpable economic uplift of course benefits all Americans, but particularly the incredibly entrepreneurial Hispanic community, which starts small businesses at about 1.5 times the rate of non-Hispanic Americans. President Trump has already moved forcefully to reduce the regulatory burden that stifles small business growth, empowering these amazing Latino business creators. The last decade has been wonderful for owners of assets, especially stocks and real estate. Most minorities, and most Hispanics, are not yet among that ownership class and, as such, badly needed growth in wages and entrepreneurship. The tax package announced by this administration will propel a renewed economic dynamism that will vault Hispanic prosperity.

Second, the President displayed wisdom and empathy in continuing the DACA program protecting illegal immigrants brought here as children. He recognizes that these young adults broke our immigration statutes through no fault of their own and comprise a separate category from adults who knowingly defied our laws. The President has sensibly charged the Congress with finding a sustainable and Constitutional solution this vexing issue, likely a compromise protecting these DACA recipients in exchange for large immigration reforms.

Third, Trump’s response to Puerto Rico has been as swift as it is impressive. Despite the constant grandstanding of the absurd T-shirt wearing mayor of San Juan, enabled by a mainstream media hell-bent on manufacturing “Trump’s Katrina,” the reality is that federal response to this epic catastrophe represents a triumph of both logistics and humanitarian concern. Despite the carnage of two category 5 hurricanes, today two-thirds of gasoline stations on the island are fully operational as well as the majority of grocery stores – a testimony to the determination of the Americans who call that island home as well as the 12,000 federal “boots on the ground” providing aid. And don’t take my word for it, listen to the Democrat Governor Ricardo Rossello who told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that “the president and the administration, every time we’ve asked them to execute, they’ve executed quickly.”

The mainstream media narrative in 2016, which I fought so vociferously on-air, painted Donald Trump as some anti-Hispanic bigot. That slur was always false and was, thankfully, largely rejected by our own communities as Trump surpassed the Hispanic vote percentage garnered by Mitt Romney in 2012. What Trump has shown in his first months in office, through economic growth, a reasoned approach to DACA, and an outpouring of support for Puerto Rico, is that he intends to govern for the increased prosperity and security of the forgotten common working American…including, of course, Hispanics.

It was her eyes, though, that truly terrified me. You could see the unrelenting, unshakable, unmovable fear they held.

In all fairness, nothing about fear should shock us. We’ve all been fearful at some point in our own lives.

But this was different.

This was a terrifying mix for when anger, shock and absolute horror all roll into one perilous package. It was as if you were about to tell someone they were going to...and then I knew what was about to happen.

And there is no preparation for it. None.

The doctor looked at me, looked at her patient, my wife Jennifer, and then looked down at the paperwork she had in front of her that contained Jen's test results. She repeated this over and over, as if she didn’t believe what her eyes were telling her.

When she finally stopped, the words for her were hard to find. But when she did speak, our world would be transformed forever.

The prognosis came in two parts. First, Jennifer’s thyroid had stopped working—certainly not good but something that happens to many people and was treatable. However, the second part was devastating: her kidneys were near total failure and her body was shutting down. If emergency measures weren’t enacted—and soon—she would be dead within six weeks.

Six weeks.

No one said anything at first. Then, after maybe ten seconds, we all looked at each other—no one really had a reaction. It felt like, for a moment, in that doctor’s office, time stopped.

For me, when I heard the news my reaction was paused for a simple reason: I wanted to cry, scream and yell—all at the same time.

I instantly blamed myself. I knew I should have pushed Jen to go to the doctor sooner. I should have been persistent, I should have seen the signs for what they were. But we kept making excuses for what was happening for months, and now we were paying the price—perhaps the ultimate price.

You see, starting in January 2015, Jennifer, the love of my life, my best friend—my everything—saw her health slowly start to slip away.

At first, we dismissed her symptoms as the result of her efforts to lose weight through diet and exercise. But as her health became gradually worse—her energy level deteriorated, she felt aches and pains throughout her body and felt awful all the time—we started to worry.

By the time the summer rolled around, things had gotten much worse. Jennifer was now losing weight dramatically. By July, she had lost almost seventy pounds in seven months. When we would go to the grocery store, separating into different aisles, there would be times I couldn’t find her as she looked like a completely different person.

Even at this point we dismissed the symptoms—now blaming Jennifer’s stressful job as a travelling psychologist, treating adolescent patients in some of the most poverty stricken and crime ridden neighborhoods of Washington, D.C.—as the culprit. It would take me comparing pictures of her from then to a few years prior to understand she needed medical treatment—or I might lose her.

When we walked out of the doctor’s office and went out onto the street we both grabbed for each other. Our heads nearly collided, each of us sobbing, shaking and crying uncontrollably, a reaction that words could never do justice to.

We both said at the same time: “What are we going to do?”

Once the shock washed away she did the only thing she could do, the only thing left to do: fight for her life.

And let there be no doubt, this was a battle that would test Jennifer’s will to live, test the strength of our marriage and make us rethink everything that was important to us.

Forever.

But just like every battle, there are some constants that aren’t changeable.

Ask anyone who has fought kidney disease and they will tell you a hard truth: you don’t ever beat it. You can become stable, even achieve some sort of remission from its unrelenting advance, but once your kidneys start to have problems they don’t ever heal themselves, they never return to their ‘normal’ state. So, the best result we could hope for in the war for Jennifer’s life was a draw, that no matter how hard she battled, no matter how much I supported her, no matter what sacrifice she was willing to make, all we could hope for is that it would not get any worse.

With this knowledge in hand, Jennifer’s struggle would begin.

The first order of battle began with constant visits to George Washington Hospital here in Washington, D.C. for battery after battery of tests. The constant blood work, doctor’s appointments and follow-up checkups were exhausting.

But none of that would compare to a kidney biopsy.

In what should be the latest Lannister torture method from ""Game of Thrones,"" Jennifer laid down on her stomach with her hands extended, holding onto what can only be described as grips. She was then given a small amount of numbing medication. After about a minute the doctor used a small device to remove a small 1cm piece of her kidney—while she was awake. When she came back to her hospital room she cried for hours as the pain was so intense.

Jennifer’s struggle, though, was just beginning.

Her kidney functioning levels were dropping fast and the amount of poison in her blood was increasing. If this could not be stopped, she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Her doctors recommended she be placed on steroids that could, emphasis on could, help stabilize her and maybe allow her kidneys to function slightly better. But there was a big downside to this treatment. Not only would Jennifer gain weight dramatically, but she would become temporarily—but horribly—disfigured as her whole body would swell uncontrollably.

She asked what other options she had. The doctor responded quite simply: “None.”

And with that, Jennifer’s descent into hell began.

If there was a dark time in this whole ordeal—or darker than any other—this was it. Jennifer was placed on the highest possible steroid dosage a person can take. From January 2016 to May of that year, Jen would be able to do very little as her arms and legs would begin to swell nonstop. When she did go outside, if she even had the energy to do so, people would shun her, as her face swelled to the point where she could no longer smile or make normal facial expressions. If she went to buy shoes, since all her pre-kidney disease shoes no longer fit, no one would wait on her. People would go to the other side of the street when they saw her, giving her dirty looks, time and time again.

Eventually, she stopped going outside—the physical and now emotional pain was too much to bear. The only thing that brought her joy was sitting by the window in our apartment, to feel a little bit a part of the outside world, looking down from six floors up as people walked to work or went about their lives. She would ask me constantly: “Am I going to die?” or “Is this my fate? To slowly rot away, just watching the world pass me by?”

Compounding all of this was the havoc this caused on her personally and professionally. She was fired from her job—they simply could not hold her position any longer after being out of the office for months. That meant she now had no health insurance—what could have been a death sentence, as the costs of treatment could easily bankrupt someone if they could not afford a private insurance plan that covered kidney disease. Thankfully my employer was able to add her to my plan quickly.

There was also the challenge of having to apply for Social Security Disability—a process so painful, so soul draining, so time consuming that it is hard for me to fathom how anyone can successfully navigate the process, especially if you’re sick. Despite countless forms that needed to be filled out repeatedly—with Jennifer’s hands so swollen at times it proved nearly impossible—hours and hours on the phone with lawyers and being sent for medical evaluations for the wrong things, Jennifer fought hard to get the assistance she needed. To this day, after one year of waiting and two denials in what should be a cut and dry case, Jennifer will now have to fight the federal government in court for the help she deserves. If we were not married and Jen needed Social Security and Medicare for survival she would already be dead.

Watching Jennifer go through all of this, knowing I could do almost nothing to help, took its toll on me as well.

This is where I started to break—and where our marriage was tested. How does one emotionally make peace with the fact that they are potentially watching their wife die?

At first, I became very quiet, withdrawn from the world. I then became very angry, feeling like we were robbed of the life we planned. Jennifer and I started to fight about anything—everything—as we did not know how to interact anymore. We did not know how to live in a world where she might not be part of it for much longer. And that scared me to my core.

Thankfully, our marriage would hold through this tough time—and get even stronger. We sat down one day and faced our fears together. Through hours of tough talk, laughter, heartache and sobbing, we admitted our greatest fear: not wanting to lose each other. We made a deal, right then and there: that no matter what, we would not take out our fears out on one another. That we would fight this no matter what, hand and hand, side by side, to the end—no matter where that brought us.

And then a small miracle happened. We made the decision to move out of the hustle and bustle of Washington, D.C. to the quiet suburbs of Rockville, 20 miles north. There, Jennifer and I spent the summer of 2016 laughing, swimming and learning to live with our fears—and we made a sort of peace with them. Once we let go of worrying about what we could not control, Jennifer starting getting some good news: the amount of poisons in her blood started to decrease. Month after month the functioning of her kidneys were improving ever-so-slightly. Her energy started to improve and her appearance started to return to normal, as the doctor started weaning her off the steroids.

Today, Jennifer is a as close to ‘normal’ as she will likely ever be. We know her battle with kidney disease will be one she wages for the rest of her days, but she has begun to reclaim the life she knew, piece by piece. She won’t ever be able to work again, as the daily stresses of any sort of employment could push her kidneys back toward failure. Her energy level can change hour by hour, many days she simply can’t leave the house.

But most importantly and positively, her spirit held strong and never broke. We moved back to Washington, D.C. in July, as she felt she needed to be close to the nation’s capital. She is back to being the happy, uplifting and inspirational person I love more than anything—someone who helped me in my darkest hours. In some small part, I was able to do the same for her.

We know the road in this struggle will be long and challenging, with many ups and downs along the way, but I know we can face it together, whatever comes.

Jennifer was shopping for a new look on LuLaRoe – an online-only retailer that sells straight to consumers from consultants, a little like Avon. Jennifer was chatting with a LuLaRoe seller in a Facebook group, trying to secure the sale of an “Amelia” style dress.

The dress — a simple knit frock with a cinched waist and pockets — was apparently available from this seller's Halloween catalog, and Jennifer messaged the seller, expressing interest.

A post shared by Yulis_posh (@yulis_posh) on Oct 2, 2017 at 7:14pm PDT

The conversation with the seller started on a strange note – Jennifer claimed her mother had suffered a stroke. The seller told Jennifer not to “worry about that” and that she was “praying for [her] mom.” Jennifer responded that she just “didn’t want [the seller] to sell it to someone else,” because she “love[d] it.”

The text exchange, which the seller uploaded screenshots of, ended there … until three hours later, when the seller got a message that she said “shook me to my core.”

“I am going through my wife’s phone,” the person wrote, via Jennifer’s account, to the seller. “She was on the way to [redacted] this morning and was hit head on by a person texting and did not make it. This is her husband. How do I pay this bill? I know how much she wanted this and I am going to have her buried in it.”

The seller was skeptical, and re-posted the strange message in a LuLaRoe Facebook group. Others in the group were similarly dubious about the claim.

“You don’t think he would have more important things to do like being at the hospital, etc with the remains, instead of buying Lula?” one said.

“I’ll bet it’s not true. Wouldn’t you think she would have taken her phone with her?? He was texting from her phone … I don’t believe that!” wrote another.

In order to test whether or not the message was legitimate, the seller reached out to Jennifer and said, “Hey girl! You’re the winner of a free Lula item in my group! Congratulations!”

Soon after, the seller received a response from Jennifer saying, “Omg I never win anything! What style can I choose from? I live in [redacted] so can you send it to me?”

The seller immediately confronted Jennifer: “I just saw a post where someone messaged from this profile about his wife dying? Is that true?”

Jennifer vehemently denied the claim, writing back, “Do what? From my profile? It is absolutely not true! What group is this in? This is crazy!” adding, “My husband is at work and hasn’t even been around my phone.”

An hour later, Jennifer — who blocked the original seller and removed herself from the Facebook group — popped back up, claiming to have “been in touch with the police” and that they had discovered that someone had “hacked into” her account.

“They also sent [redacted] a message and if she doesn’t take this down, I am pressing charges against her,” Jennifer wrote. “I did not message from her, order from her … nothing! It’s crazy! I wrote a police report out against the person who did this and they are being arrested.”

Her quick police work caught the attention of others in the Facebook group, who jokingly tagged the police department. “A+ work on the Jennifer [redacted] Facebook case. Arrested within the hour,"" one person wrote.

Someone who knew the original seller also commented that she had sold some leggings to Jennifer in the past, and after Jennifer received them, Jennifer tried to stop payment on the check so she wouldn’t be charged for them.

In another twist, after the original screenshots of Jennifer's message went viral, another woman who claimed to know Jennifer said it was Jennifer’s ex-husband who had hacked into her account and said she died. Though Facebook users have been quick to question what the ex-husband would have to gain from requesting the LuLaRoe dress. Also, the hacker that Jennifer claimed the police had “found out” about was a woman, as she herself had said earlier.

It is still unknown whether Jennifer was or wasn’t hacked — or if Jennifer is her real name, since there are three different Facebook profiles with the same name and pictures — but she did respond to the seller’s accusations.

Jennifer did, however, post a one-star rating of the seller, along with an extremely long review, where she claimed to work for the government.

The 71-year-old said she was forced to fall back on a ""boob joke"" at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sept. 18.

The singer presented an award alongside her ""9 to 5"" co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda at the star-studded event.

She was taken by surprise when Fonda and Tomlin used the moment to make a statement against Trump calling him a ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.""

Parton, who makes it a point to stay out of politics, lightened the mood before the trio announced the winner for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie.

""Well, I know about support,"" the country legend said pointing at her chest.

Parton told us she was fine with her former co-stars voicing their political opinions but it's not her cup of tea.

""I don't voice my political opinions,"" she told us. ""I just get out there and entertain. To me, that's what I do. I don't condemn them.""","Dolly Parton: 'When all else fails, do a boob joke'",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/05/dolly-parton-when-all-else-fails-do-boob-joke.html

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""
There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun.
Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Players from the Vegas Golden Knights -- the city's brand-new National Hockey League team -- are trying their best to offer a distraction from the horror that unfolded Sunday night.

This week, Golden Knights players such as Jon Merrill, Jason Garrison, William Karlsson, Griffin Reinhardt, Erik Haula, Deryk Engelland and others have made stops at Metro Police headquarters, the convention center and United Blood Services, the Las Vegas Sun reported.

“It’s amazing to be able to see these people smile after what they’ve been through for the past few days is amazing,” Merrill told the newspaper. “You forget about the impact that we are able to have on people as athletes so we’re lucky to be able to bring a distraction to people. These are amazing people, and we are lucky to have them.”

Metro police Sgt. Jeff Clark offered high praise of the Golden Knights for taking the time to visit.

“The Golden Knights from Day One have promised that they wanted to be an integral part of this community,” Clark said. “It’s unfortunate that during their inaugural season this had to happen, but the fact that they’re stepping up and coming down to just provide some entertainment or someone to talk to is amazing.”

The team, owner Bill Foley’s charity and the NHL recently announced a $300,000 joint donation to support victims of the massacre. Fans were also encouraged to donate to the fund through the Vegas Golden Knights Foundation.

NHL teams and players will also honor victims of the shooting through the opening week of the season.

Engelland told the Las Vegas Sun he hopes the team’s first game in franchise history will offer a temporary distraction, if only for a few hours.

“A big part is just turning your mind off a little bit,” Engelland said. “You come to a sporting event, and you’re not sitting around talking about it. You’re enjoying the experience of the game and the atmosphere of the arena.”

Every year, millions of Americans go after this same goal, some successful and others not so much. To attain their goals, they may choose from the over-abundance of diets and exercise programs available, and some turn to weight loss supplements as well.

While you shouldn’t rely on supplements to do all the work for you, there are a few that can be used safely to boost your weight loss efforts.

Before you decide on weight loss supplements, though, you should consider the health effects carefully. Always check with your doctor first to be sure about safety, and remember that these pills are supplements. They’re meant to be used alongside healthy eating habits and proper exercise.

DO YOU HAVE LIVER DAMAGE?

Again, never use supplements by themselves to lose weight. Some people turn to weight loss pills so that they can continue an unhealthy lifestyle while staying thin.

This dangerous mentality could lead to frightening situations like addiction, overdose or death. Also, brands that claim to shed weight without any effort may contain ingredients that will do you more harm than good. If you have any doubt about a supplement, stay away.

Weight Loss Supplements that Work

Just like any other medication, weight loss supplements have both benefits and side effects. When choosing a supplement, you should know all the possible effects and consider them in light of your own health history. Especially if you have other health issues, you should check carefully for ingredients that may trigger or worsen your symptoms.

Let’s look at 3 supplements that you could consider adding to your weight loss program:

1. Green Tea Extract

Green tea has long been known for its health benefits, mainly because the drink is high in antioxidants. In particular, green tea contains large amounts of polyphenol antioxidants called catechins, which may help reduce oxidative stress.

For weight loss, studies have shown that green tea extract can help boost the metabolism. Researchers think that the combination of antioxidants and caffeine work together to accomplish this goal.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL GAME

For example, in one study, researchers gave participants green tea and guarana extract 30 minutes before each meal. Researchers then analyzed how much energy the participants were burning.

After testing multiple times, researchers found that participants burned an extra 180 calories per day with just this supplement. In addition, green tea extract enhances norepinephrine, a hormone that tells the body to break down stored fat for energy.

Side Effects: Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach or headaches may occur due to the dietary change or caffeine content. Rare side effects include tremors, seizures or irregular heartbeat. Because of the caffeine content, you should consult with your doctor about using green tea extract if you have a heart condition.

2. Berberine

Another lesser known supplement that provides powerful help is berberine. This supplement is derived from plants and actually enters the body’s cells through the bloodstream, changing the function of the cell. One major benefit that berberine has is its ability to regulate and reduce blood sugar content.

In addition, studies suggest that berberine does boost weight loss directly. In one study, researchers tested 37 participants who suffered from metabolic syndrome.

During testing, the participants took berberine three times per day for three months, and in turn reduced their BMI from 31.5 to 27.4. Also, the researchers noticed that many participants lost abdominal weight and improved other areas of their health.

IS YOUR THYROID SLEEPING ON THE JOB?

Side Effects: Common problems with berberine include cramping, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation and stomach pain. Also, you’ll want to discuss whether or not to take berberine if you are already on medication to lower your blood sugar.

3. Meratrim

One relatively new but promising supplement is Meratrim, a blend of two plant extracts. In one study of the supplement, researchers tested over 50 overweight individuals. Participants were told to take the supplement or a placebo twice a day in addition to eating a 2000-calorie diet and walking for 30 minutes, five times per week.

At the end of 16 weeks, researchers found that participants had decreased their weight, triglycerides and total cholesterol. In addition, no participants reported side effects. Because Meratrim is new, you should consider a more well-tested supplement if you have any major health issues.

As popular as it is to use fad diets and supplements to lose weight, your main program should focus on exercise and healthy eating.

However, if you choose to boost your efforts with a weight loss supplement, choose one that fits your lifestyle and keeps you safe. Most supplements do have side effects and risks and should never be taken to lose weight alone. In the end, remember that your improved health is the main goal and that healthy weight loss happens gradually for lasting results.

As of 8 p.m. ET, Nate was located about 10 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and about 100 miles south of Biloxi, Miss. Nate was a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 90 mph. Forecasters also said Nate could dump 3 to 6 inches of rain on the region — with isolated totals of up to 10 inches.

Mississippi's six southern-most counties declared a state of emergency, with the state's emergency management director calling Nate ""the worst hurricane that has impacted Mississippi since Hurricane Katrina.""

""Everyone needs to understand that,"" Lee Smithson told reporters. ""this is a significantly dangerous situation.""

Nate was expected to pass to the east of New Orleans, sparing the city its most ferocious winds and storm surge. However, the storm could pose a major test for the city's fragile pumping and drainage system. Key weaknesses - including the failure of some pumps and power-generating turbines - were exposed after an Aug. 5 deluge flooded homes and businesses in some sections of the city. City officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew for Saturday.

On Alabama's Dauphin Island, water had already begun washing over the road Saturday on the island's low-lying west end, said Mayor Jeff Collier. The storm was projected to bring storm surges from seven to 11 feet near the Alabama-Mississippi state line. Some of the biggest impacts could be at the top of funnel-shaped Mobile Bay.

The window for preparing ""is quickly closing,"" Alabama Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Hastings said.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned residents of the Panhandle to prepare for Nate's impact.

The governor said Saturday that residents in evacuation zones in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties should heed the warnings and seek safe shelter from the storm. He said shelters will be available to people who have nowhere else to go.

""Hurricane Nate is expected to bring life-threatening storm surges, strong winds and tornadoes that could reach across the Panhandle,"" Scott said. The evacuations affect roughly 100,000 residents in the western Panhandle.

The Pensacola International Airport announced it will close at 6 p.m. Saturday and remain closed on Sunday.

However, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport remained open Saturday.

""The airport does not close,"" spokeswoman Michelle Wilcut said. ""We are urging customers to check with their specific airlines to see whether their flights have been canceled because there have been some of those.""

Waterside sections of New Orleans, outside the city's levee system, were under an evacuation order. About 2,000 people were affected. But not everyone was complying.

Gabriel Black of New Orleans' Venetian Isles community sent his wife, a friend, and three dogs to a hotel in the city. Black stayed behind because an 81-year-old neighbor refused to leave.

""I know it sounds insane, but he has bad legs and he doesn't have anybody who can get to him,"" Black said.

Others nearby were staying as well. Nancy and Cleve Bell said their house is built so high off the ground that it stayed dry in the floods after Hurricane Katrina. Nancy Bell said they have a generator and plenty of supplies, and will be safe.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he spoke with President Trump on Saturday morning. ""He assured me that LA would have all the assistance we need as we prepare for #Nate,"" the governor posted on Twitter.

The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane warning was in effect from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. A hurricane warning was also in effect for metropolitan New Orleans and nearby Lake Pontchartrain. Tropical storm warnings extended west of Grand Isle to Morgan City, Louisiana, and around Lake Maurepas and east of the Alabama-Florida border to the Okaloosa-Walton County line in the Florida Panhandle.

Kristen Leigh O’Connor, 27, of Coral Springs and June Ann Schweinhart, 28, of Lake Worth, were charged with child neglect after they were released from the hospital, police in Boynton Beach, Fla., said.

“This is an incredibly tragic situation and ultimately, the ones most affected by this are those innocent, beautiful babies,” Boynton Beach police said in a Facebook post announcing the arrests. “We hope this serves as a wake-up call for these moms, and that they seek further treatment for their addiction. We sincerely wish them all the best.”

Family members of the two women took custody of the newborns.

Police said O’Connor and Schweinhart went to a parking garage Thursday to snort heroin in the company of the two babies. They bought the heroin from a drug dealer for $60.

Schweinhart called 911 when O’Connor began to overdose but then she started convulsing, police said.

“Fortunately, there was a Good Samaritan nearby who saw all of this happening and took the phone from her to speak with dispatchers,” Boynton Beach police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said in the Facebook post.

Cops found the babies strapped in their car seats, the Palm Beach Post reported.

At the hospital, O’Connor told police she and Schweinhart knew each other from a drug treatment program and decided to “hang out” on Thursday, the paper reported.

O'Connor also told police she and Schweinhart became friends because their babies were due the same day, according to the paper. The infants were born four days apart.

In St. Petersburg, police responded only after facing a violent attempt by protesters to break through their ranks.","Hundreds of people supporting Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were arrested Saturday after rallying across the country in a wave of demonstrations on President Vladimir Putin's 65th birthday.

Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for calling for an earlier unsanctioned protest, called on his supporters to pressure authorities into letting him enter the presidential race.

The rally in Moscow was markedly smaller than previous demonstrations in the Russian capital staged by Navalny this year but ended peacefully. A rally in Putin's hometown of St. Petersburg attracted a bigger crowd and ended in clashes with police.

Several hundred protesters, most of them students, gathered on Moscow's downtown Pushkinskaya Square, waving Russian flags and chanting ""Russia will be free!"" and ""Let Navalny run!"" Police warned them the rally wasn't sanctioned and urged them to disperse, but let the protest continue for hours without trying to break it up.

Local media outlets reported that upwards of 200 people were arrested.

Escorted by police, mostly teenage protesters later walked down Moscow's Tverskaya Street toward the Kremlin, shouting ""Putin, go away!"" and ""Future without Putin!""

Police lines blocked them from approaching Red Square and they turned back. Several hours later, some demonstrators made a new attempt to march on the Kremlin, shouting ""Putin thief!"" Some briefly attempted to block traffic.

Police also didn't intervene at first with a bigger unsanctioned rally in St. Petersburg, where over 1,000 gathered at Marsovo Pole park and then marched across the city, cutting traffic and chanting ""Russia without Putin!"" and ""Putin, retire!""

Police later cracked down on the demonstrators, detaining dozens after some tried to break through police lines.

""Putin has been in charge since I was born,"" Dmitry Samokhin, 18, who was among protesters in St. Petersburg. ""The country is mired in stagnation and I want to see changes.""

The authorities' decision to refrain from breaking up the Moscow protest, contrasted with a more forceful response to previous Moscow rallies called by Navalny, when police detained more than 1,000 demonstrators. In St. Petersburg, police responded only after facing a violent attempt by protesters to break through their ranks.

Navalny's headquarters called protests in 80 cities. Most were not sanctioned by authorities, but police largely refrained from breaking them up. The Siberian city of Yakutsk saw the toughest police response, where a few dozen demonstrators were reportedly detained.

Navalny has declared his intention to run for president in the March 2018 election, even though a criminal conviction that he calls politically motivated bars him from running. The 41-year-old anti-corruption crusader has organized waves of protests this year, casting a challenge to the Kremlin.

Putin hasn't yet announced whether he would seek re-election, but he's widely expected to run. With his current approval ratings topping 80 percent, he is set to win another six-year term in a race against torpid veterans of past election campaigns, like Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.

Navalny argues that the high level of support for Putin comes from the lack of real political competition and urged supporters to help him get registered.

""(Putin's) 86 percent approval rating exists in a political vacuum,"" he said. ""It's like asking a person who has been fed rutabaga his entire life how eatable they find it and the rating will be quite high. Listen, there are other things that are better than rutabaga.""

The sarcastic analogy demonstrated Navalny's stinging style, which has helped him get broad support among the young.

Navalny has worked to expand his reach with videos exposing official corruption and YouTube live broadcasts. His documentary about Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's alleged ill-gotten wealth has been viewed nearly 25 million times since its release in March, helping galvanize protests.

Heeding his call, tens of thousands took to the streets in dozens of cities and towns across Russia in March and June, the biggest show of defiance since the 2011-2012 anti-government protests.

Unlike the past rallies, which were driven by anti-corruption slogans, Navalny this time focused on rallying support for his own presidential bid — a reason some gave for the smaller protest in Moscow.

""Some people dislike Putin and the government, but that doesn't mean they are willing to unequivocally back Navalny,"" political analyst Valery Solovei said on Dozhd television.

But more than a decade ago, Beacham began coughing and clearing her throat, constantly.

""It was embarrassing,"" she said.

A lung doctor listened to her symptoms and diagnosed her with asthma, prescribing a series of medications.

""I bet I went through 7 or 8 different types of inhalers,"" Beacham remembered.

""I was just getting out of breath, getting out of the air,” she said.

""I said 'How do you know I'm not an asthma patient, how do you know that,'"" Beacham said. ""And he said, 'I just know, that is not an asthma cough.'""

After extensive testing, Beacham was diagnosed with ""silent reflux."" She didn't have heartburn.

But during sleep, acid would leak from her stomach, up through her esophagus, pooling in the back of her throat. Kamean said that caused the irritation triggering her cough.

""So the idea is that it's at night,"" Kamean said. ""It's real reflux, but it's 'silent' because you're 'sleeping.'""

Put on on an acid-reducing medication, Beacham stopped coughing.

""And when she came back in two months, she said it was a miracle,"" Kamean said. ""Her cough was gone, she was sleeping, she was ready to travel.""

Earlier this year, Beacham underwent the LINX procedure, to stop the reflux.

Kamean said if you have an unexplained cough, see a lung doctor and an ear, nose and throat specialist first. Then, if you're still coughing, find a gastroenterologist willing to look deeper.

""There is still a debate in our field as to how much reflux really causes cough and sinus issues,"" Kamean said. ""We are firm believers here at DeKalb that that is true. We've had a lot of successful surgeries here correcting reflux, and medication as well.""

These days, Beacham is traveling again.

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

The SURUS is making its public debut at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Oct. 9-11.",GM developing stealthy self-driving hydrogen-powered cargo truck with military in mind,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/gm-developing-stealthy-self-driving-hydrogen-powered-cargo-truck-with-military-in-mind.html

They’ll be joined by much-anticipated expressions, such as ‘swear face’ and ‘mind-blown,’ food including broccoli and dumplings, fantasy figures like vampires and zombies, and the last remaining heart in the colour rainbow when Apple releases its latest software update next week.

Even a bearded man and yoga masters will make an appearance for the hipster crowd.

The new additions are part of a 2017 emoji update decided upon by emoji non-profit governing body, the Unicode Consortium, who sets the global standard for the colorful characters and ensures they can work across software platforms.

But the Apple updates will arrive at a challenging time for emoji, amid claims a Facebook-owned app has stolen the iPhone company’s thunder, and amid less blob-shaped emoji from Google.

The iOS 11.1 download will unlock cartoon-like characters including a woman breastfeeding a baby, fairies of both genders, dinosaurs and zebras, three gender neutral characters of different hair colours and ages, and a woman wearing a purple headscarf.

The latter made the cut following the success of The Hijab Emoji Project launched by 15-year-old German teenager Rayouf Alhumedhi who could not find an emoji that represented her.

The emoji smiley face will also adopt more expressions in this generation, including star struck, investigative (complete with monocle), and a vomiting emoji that appears to have eaten too much salad.

Emojipedia founder Jeremy Burge said vomiting face, along with the giraffe and sauropod dinosaur, had generated the most discussion from the site’s users.

“Personally, I’m looking forward to the new shushing face, and the face with the raised eyebrow,” he said. “I feel like these fill some gaps in my emoji communications range.”

The fifth generation of emoji will contain up to 69 new characters, according to Emojipedia, bringing the total number of approved emoji to 2666 as of June.

But Apple’s new release might have been spoiled somewhat by Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which released what appear to be copycat versions of Apple’s new emoji designs this week, including the new additions such as wizards and zombies.

Both new emoji releases also follow Google’s redesign of its much-criticised blob-shaped emoji, with slicker, redesigned emoji featuring in Android Oreo software on its new Pixel 2 smartphones revealed this week.

The star went off on social media about his efforts to donate blood as a gay man.

Bass, 38, was riled up after the tragedy when he realized that he could not give blood to the victims. He sounded off in a video to TMZ on the current U.S. policy that prohibits some gay men from donating blood.

“Every time a tragedy like this happens, I get reminded that I can’t donate blood. People just don’t know that there is a ban on my blood and we have to educate people out there that there is this stigma on my blood, my gay blood, and it needs to change,” he said in the video. “This tragedy has brought us together, and I honestly don’t have faith that this country is going to come together and make any common sense gun laws right now, so I would love, out of this tragedy, to have something good come from it. I think this ban on blood should be the easiest thing to pass.”

Rules imposed by the Food and Drug Administration prohibits gay men from donating blood if they’ve engaged in any kind of sexual encounter with another man for the past 12 months.

The rule is intended to ensure that the spread of HIV isn’t exacerbated through the blood donation process, and gay men were initially considered to be the highest carriers of the disease when the regulation was established. But Bass said all blood is now tested before it is used, regardless of the person’s sexual orientation. As a result, he feels that the rule is discriminatory to gay men. Late in the video, he went on to call out the American Red Cross directly, which abides by the FDA’s regulations.

“Shame on the Red Cross for not being a leader in this over the last 20 years to help relieve the stigma of HIV in gay man’s blood and donating,” he said. “They should really be the ones at the forefront of this movement.”

Bass previously posted about his frustration with the blood donation process on Twitter, where many fans shared his frustration.","After Las Vegas shooting, Lance Bass slams Red Cross over gay blood donor ban",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/05/after-las-vegas-shooting-lance-bass-slams-red-cross-over-gay-blood-donor-ban.html

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources.

One source told the network that Paddock displayed anti-social traits common to other mass shooters. Others point out that Paddock appeared to have trouble forming meaningful relationships and was seen by some acquaintances as disconnected or standoffish.

However, Paddock's girlfriend told FBI agents Wednesday that she had not noticed any changes in his mental state or indications he could become violent, a federal official told the Associated Press.

Investigators have spent the past week trying to pin down a specific motive for why Paddock targeted the Route 91 Harvest Festival before taking his own life Sunday evening. They have investigated whether Paddock was with a prostitute days before the shooting, scrutinized cruises he took and tried to make sense of a cryptic note with numbers jotted on it found in his hotel room.

Three police officers who responded to Paddock's hotel room at the Mandalay Bay have told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that the note included handwritten calculations about where he needed to aim to maximize the carnage.

""I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,"" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Dave Newton told the newsmagazine. ""So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.""

Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Friday that investigators had pursued over 1,000 leads, but admitted ""We still do not have a clear motive or reason why.""

""We have looked at literally everything,"" McMahill added.

It is unusual to have so few hints of a motive five days after a mass shooting. In previous mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer — or even phoned police.

""The lack of a social media footprint is likely intentional,"" Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, told the Associated Press ""We're so used to, in the first 24 to 48 hours, being able to review social media posts. If they don't leave us a note behind or a manifesto behind, and we're not seeing that, that's what's making this longer.""

What officers have found is that Paddock planned his attack meticulously.

He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the festival, stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon, and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.

In a possible sign he was contemplating massacres at other sites, he also booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements leading up to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

His arsenal also included tracer rounds that can improve a shooter's firing accuracy in the dark, a law enforcement official told AP. It wasn't clear whether Paddock fired any of the illuminated bullets during the high-rise massacre.

Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of the .308-caliber and .223-caliber tracer ammunition from a private buyer he met at a Phoenix gun show, a law enforcement official not authorized to comment on the investigation said on condition of anonymity.

Tracer rounds illuminate their path so a gunman can home in on targets at night. But they can also give away the shooter's position.

Video shot of the pandemonium that erupted when Paddock started strafing the festival showed a muzzle flash from his room at the Mandalay Bay resort, but bullets weren't visible in the night sky.

Woods tweeted this summer that he had “accepted the fact that” he was blacklisted from Hollywood because of his views. He has said being conservative has made it tough to find work in Hollywood the past few years.

The “Casino” actor has twice been nominated for an Academy Award and has won an Emmy Award three times. His movie credits include “Salvador (1986)” and “Ghosts of Mississippi (1996),” both of which earned him a nomination for an Oscar. He's also played H.R. Haldeman in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon (1995),"" starred alongside Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in Sydney Pollack's ""The Way We Were (1973)"" and was also in Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama ""Casino (1995).""

Woods was a Hollywood favorite -- and a Democrat -- until at least 1998, when he broke ranks with the party after former President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

He said on Twitter that he switched parties because of his disgust with the former president.

""Every single #Democrat without exception stood behind a convicted perjurer,"" he wrote on Twitter this summer. ""That was the end.""

His luck in Hollywood turned sour soon after he became a Republican. He has not had a major role in a film in at least a decade.

The news of his retirement was included in a press release issued by Woods' real estate agent offering Woods' Rhode Island lake house for sale.

Allen Gammons said Friday that Woods is 70 and wants to relax. He says the actor's brother and mother recently died, and he hopes to spend more time on passions including photography, antiquing and poker.

Gammons said Woods' decision was not political.

The announcement comes after Woods was in a Twitter feud with actress Amber Tamblyn, who last month accused him of trying to pick her up when she was 16. Woods called it a lie. Gammons said Woods declined to comment Friday when asked about Tamblyn's accusation.

Woods has said there are many conservative stars who didn’t speak up because “the blacklist against conservatives in Hollywood is very real.”

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK INJURY AT SON'S BASEBALL PRACTICE

...Sudden Unexplained Blindness…

“A 60+-year-old glaucoma patient came in as an emergency appointment with sudden unexplained blindness. Turns out, she mixed up her glaucoma drops with cyanoacrylate, an extremely fast-acting and an extremely effective adhesive. The glaucoma eye drop bottle and the adhesive bottle are very similar and she was working on building models and inadvertently glued her eyelids shut. Turns out, the adhesive worked beautifully on human tissue, causing the upper and lower eyelids to be sealed shut, with the eyeball underneath being totally immobile. Utilizing topical anesthetic and extremely sharp micro surgical scissors, I separated her eyelids. Thereafter, with lots of anesthetic drops, Q-tips, rounded forceps, and gentle pressure, I was able to free up the eyeball and remove residual glue. Each eye took at least 30 minutes, and her vision was restored.” —Mendelsohn

...An Ice Pick in His Eyeball…

“I did my eye surgery residency training at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, a major trauma center in the heart of the city's most violent neighborhoods. Every night was an adventure, with man's inhumanity to man showing up in the form of all sorts of injuries. After my first year, I stopped asking patients how they got their injuries and just marveled at the human body's ability to survive. One night, a fellow showed up at the emergency room with an ice pick in his eyeball. Because he couldn't afford an ambulance, he drove himself to the ER—on a motorcycle. He apologized for not wearing a helmet for obvious reasons.” —John Hovanesian, M.D., an eye surgeon at Harvard Eye Associates in Laguna Hills, Calif., and a member of the clinical teaching faculty at the UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute.

...A White Spot on the Surface of Their Eye...

“A couple of years ago when I was doing a fellowship in Miami, the ophthalmology residents in the emergency room were seeing a patient who came in for a white spot on the surface of their eye. The first-year resident who was looking at it was perplexed at what the lesion could be, so he called over some other first-year residents to take a look. They were all sort of confused, so they called their senior resident to come take a look. The senior member saw the patient, then grabbed a cotton tip applicator, and flicked the ‘lesion’ off…it was a popcorn kernel!” —Alberto Distefano, M.D., an oculoplastics fellow at the Yale School of Medicine.

...A Spike Had Flown Off the Metal...

""A couple of years ago I had a patient who came to me for decreased vision and a little pain in one eye. The patient had been working on his car using a metal grinder, which is used to remove rust off of the car frame. He thought something hit him but wasn't sure—he had poor vision and could only see a hand moving in front of his face. It turns out, a spike had flown off the metal grinder, had punctured his cornea, and was sitting in the middle of his eyeball. It was an inch long, which is the length of the eye. Fortunately, it didn't touch his retina, but he needed emergency surgery to remove this very large foreign body from his eyeball, which involved removing the lens and jelly from the back of the eye. After that surgery and another surgery months later, he ended up seeing 20/30 uncorrected."" —Jonathan Criss, M.D., a comprehensive ophthalmologist at Florida Eye Microsurgical Institute.

… Foreign Body Sensation, Discharge, Redness...

“Two years back, an older lady visited my clinic with complaints of foreign body sensation, discharge, and redness. There was history of multiple consultations in the past to many ophthalmologists and using many eye drops without any relief. On examination, I found a folded contact lens in the upper fornix of her right eye. I removed that contact lens. Later, the patient said that she had some eye problems 20 years ago during her visit to her son's place in Australia. The ophthalmologist had placed a contact lens in her eye and asked her to come back after a month, but the patient missed the visit and forgot about that contact lens. That same lens was in her eye for 20 years and that was irritating her eye. On her one-week follow-up visit with me, she was very relaxed and she said that she had a sound sleep, as all these years she could not sleep properly due to irritation by her contact lens.” —Vaibhev Mittal, D.O.M.S., a fellow in comprehensive ophthalmology at iCliniiq.

...The Lenses Were Placed Off Axis...

“A patient of mine came in explaining how her son, a middle schooler, had trouble focusing in school. He had been seen by a therapist who was testing him for ADD, but recommended having his eyes tested. He was already my patient and wearing glasses. I retested his vision and there was no change. But when we checked his glasses, the problem immediately became apparent. The lenses were placed into the frame 90 degrees off axis. His mom had purchased the glasses at a ‘buy-one-get-one’ optical special with a reputation among professionals for poor quality. Once his lenses were corrected, his focusing issue in school was no longer an issue. A buy-one-get-one special is not always a good deal.” —Mendelsohn

Often they’re women you’ve heard of—say, Beyonce or Madonna—and just as often, they’re not. But regardless of who’s in this NYC salon owner’s chair, conversation almost always turns to hair product.

“Patients have shown a greater interest in natural skin care, too,” says Doris Day, M.D., clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center. The reason?

So where does this growing appetite leave the beauty industry? In search of a broade array of ingredients, says veteran cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson: “There’s such a huge interest that companies are taking a closer look at all kinds of different foods to see what can be used in products.” Indeed, R&D teams are going well beyond the rosemary that zings up your bath and the honey that soothes your skin to hit every last corner of the grocery store.

Read on for five of their most surprising beauty finds.

Corn

A multitasking beautifier, corn is an effective alternative to increasingly unpopular synthetic exfoliants (those tiny plastic spheres that turn out to be big water pollutants)—and to synthetic lathering agents. You’ll find it in such products as Rita Hazan True Color Shampoo and Caudalie Deep Cleansing Exfoliator. One important note: These products smell nothing like corn. The shampoo is actually a cult favorite for, among other things, its gorgeous blend of white flower scents. Meanwhile, the exfoliating cleanser smells only faintly of mint, if anything. In fact, rest assured: Not one of the products to follow smells like a surprising grocery find.

Beans

“There is a navy bean extract that has been shown to reduce melanogenisis,” says Wilson. Read: Diminished pigment production and dark spots. Thus the navy bean extract in Mary Kay’s beauty editor-beloved TimeWise Tone-Correcting Serum and ClearProof Deep-Cleansing Charcoal Mask. But beans of all kinds, including those on offer at global grocers, are turning up in beauty products as well. One of the best examples: mung beans, long used in Chinese medicine as a detoxing and cooling agent, and now the star of Wei Mung Bean Sprout Stress-Relieving Soothing Mask.

Peas

Little did you know during your childhood protests against those bright green piles on your plate that you’d someday be seeking peas for your skin and hair. “Pea extract is a great ingredient,” says Wilson. “In hair, it strengthens and pumps up strands by forming an imperceptible film.” (Thus such launches as Honest Beauty Honestly Uplifted Volumizing Spray.) “In skin, that same film helps retain moisture,” Wilson explains. One great example? Ole Henriksen Sheer Transormation Perfecting Moisturizer.

Beets

Beets are known as super-moisturizers, so they’re turning up in all kinds of formulations. In Tula's Pro-Gycolic 10% pH Resurfacing Gel, for example, a hydrating beet derivative helps defend against external forces (pollution, UV radiation). Meanwhile, the beetroot extract in Pili Ani Intense Hydrating Facial Cream helps boost the concentration of NMF (natural moisturizing factor) in your skin.

Identifying quality wood furniture can be difficult these days. Many pieces look great in the store, only to prove flimsy once you get them home and start to use them. Here’s what to look for, and what to avoid, when shopping for your next piece of wood furniture.

When made with high-quality materials and solid construction, wood furniture can last for decades and sometimes even centuries. But not everything you see in stores is built to last. Buy something that’s made poorly and you’ll start to see wear and tear way too soon. How can you tell the difference? It’s harder than you might think. The first thing to pay attention to is the wood itself.

Solid wood. The highest-quality material for wood furniture is solid wood. This type of furniture will be made from single pieces of wood or wood boards that are glued together to make panels — trees are only so wide, after all. If something is described as being made with solid wood, find out if that describes the entire piece or just certain parts.

Hardwood. Solid wood can be categorized as either hardwood or softwood. Hardwood comes from slower-growing trees and the wood is denser and more resistant to dings. Common hardwoods include oak, ash, walnut, cherry and maple.

Softwood. Softwood comes from faster-growing trees and the wood is less dense. Some common softwoods are pine, fir and poplar. Since these trees grow faster, furniture made using their wood tends to be less expensive than pieces made from hardwood.

Domestic wood. Domestic wood comes from trees that are grown and processed in the United States. Common domestic wood species include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, ash, poplar and pine.

A quick note about how wood is described: The species can describe either the material or the stain color. So something described as walnut might be stained that color but actually be made from pine. This isn’t necessarily bad — just make sure you know what you’re getting. You shouldn’t be paying walnut prices for a piece of furniture made from less-expensive wood.

Imported wood. A lot of imported furniture is made from tropical wood species such as rubberwood (sometimes known as plantation hardwood), mango, acacia or sheesham (a type of rosewood). These species can produce a sturdy piece of furniture, but they may be susceptible to cracking if they’re coming from a humid environment to a drier one.

Benefits of solid wood. Ensuring that your furniture is 100 percent solid wood is a pretty fail-safe way to know that you’re purchasing something high-quality. Solid wood construction is extremely long-lasting and can be easily refinished and repaired down the road.

Cons of solid wood. Solid wood is definitely the best choice for furniture but, as with any natural material, there can be downsides. Solid wood is more susceptible to changes in climate, which may cause it to crack or warp. It’s also more expensive than furniture made from engineered wood products.

Plywood. Plywood (sometimes called engineered hardwood) is made by gluing together thin layers of solid wood. When used in furniture construction, plywood is covered with a thin layer of stained and finished wood — a veneer.

Pros of plywood. The main benefit of plywood is that it’s stable when the climate changes and is less likely to warp or crack in dry climates. It can also give you a sturdy piece of furniture at a lower cost than solid wood.

Cons of plywood. Sometimes the quality of plywood comes down to the quality of the veneer. Poor-quality veneers can chip, revealing the lower-quality wood underneath. Damage may also be difficult to repair since the bulk of the furniture is made using a different wood species than the veneer. Also, some plywood is made using chemicals with formaldehyde, which can affect indoor air quality, although formaldehyde-free plywood is available.

MDF. Medium-density fiberboard is made from wood waste products (basically sawdust) that have been mixed with resins. The mixture is compressed to create large, flat boards. For furniture, MDF is finished with a layer of real-wood veneer or non-wood laminate.

Pros and cons of MDF. There are more cons than pros when you’re talking about MDF furniture. Pieces made from it are less expensive than those made of solid wood or plywood, which makes them budget-friendly. However, MDF requires a lot of chemicals to make and is the highest-formaldehyde-emitting wood product out there. Other downsides: It can easily be damaged by water, it’s difficult to repair, it doesn’t hold screws very well and it’s heavy.

Particle board. Made similarly to MDF, particle board uses larger wood scraps to create boards. You can differentiate particle board from MDF by spotting the pockets of air when looking at it from the side.

Pros and cons of particle board. The one thing particle board has going for it is that it’s inexpensive. And then there are the downsides: It emits formaldehyde, requires a lot of chemicals to produce, is susceptible to moisture damage and really doesn’t hold screws well. Particle board furniture tends to loosen up quickly, resulting in wobbles.

Veneers. A veneer is a thin sheet of real wood that is applied to the outside of a piece of wood furniture. It can be added to any of the wood products mentioned above. Veneers are used when you want to match up wood grain to create a design, or to cover a lower-cost piece of furniture.

Selecting veneered furniture. Veneer quality varies widely. Look for those that are thicker, have good adhesion and are glued to solid wood or plywood as opposed to MDF or particle board. Poorly done veneers can peel and chip.

If it’s signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, California would be the first state to ban the sale of animals from so-called puppy mills or mass breeding facilities, according to the Associated Press. He has until Oct. 15 to sign it, reports say.

In the meantime, here are some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated this month by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The decision won’t immediately go into effect.

High Court Judge Azmi Ariffin declared that prosecutors and defense lawyers, along with the two suspects, will hold court at the laboratory for chemical weapons analysis to examine samples of the women's clothing before they are formally submitted as evidence.

The decision came after government chemist Raja Subramaniam told the court that VX found on the clothing may still be active.

Such a move is not unusual in criminal cases in Malaysia, where judges often visit crime scenes.

Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, lawyer for Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong, told The Associated Press that the visit to Raja's lab is purely for safety reasons. He said the concept of holding a formal court session at the lab is to legalize the visit, which is expected to take an hour, after which the trial will resume in the court building.

Huong and Siti Aisyah of Indonesia pleaded not guilty at the start of their trial last week to charges of murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing VX on his face at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13. They face a mandatory death sentence if convicted. Defense lawyers have said the women were duped by suspected North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden TV-camera show.

VX is banned by an international treaty as a weapon of mass destruction but is believed to be part of North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal.

Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea's dynastic rulers but was believed to have been cast out by his father and had lived abroad for years. He reportedly never met current leader Kim Jong Un, who is widely believed to have perceived his older sibling as a threat and targeted him for assassination.

Last week, VX-tainted evidence from Kim Jong Nam's body and clothing was presented in court in sealed transparent bags. It was not removed from the bags, but the judge and court officials wore surgical masks and gloves as a safety precaution.

During the week's four trial sessions, prosecutors sought to reconstruct Kim's final moments at the airport, establish that VX killed him and provide evidence linking VX to the two suspects.

Raja, who is the only Malaysian with a doctorate in chemical weapons analysis, testified he found traces of VX on Huong's white sweater and fingernail clippings, and on Aisyah's sleeveless T-shirt. Huong was seen on airport surveillance videos wearing a sweater emblazoned with big black letters reading ""LOL,"" the acronym for ""laughing out loud.""

Raja also confirmed that he found VX on Kim's face, eyes, clothing, and in his blood and urine samples.

Raja testified that VX can be safely removed from the palm of a hand by scrubbing it with water within 15 minutes of exposure, in a possible explanation of why the two women didn't show any symptoms of poisoning.

Raja, the eighth witness to take the stand, is to be cross-examined by defense lawyers on Monday after the lab visit.

Pathologist Mohamad Shah Mahmood also testified there were no signs that a heart attack or other factors had contributed to Kim's death. He concluded in his autopsy report that Kim died of ""acute VX poisoning.""

""It's no surprise,"" said Hisyam, Huong's lawyer. ""We know their (prosecution) narration; we know the evidence that they have. We have a response; we have an answer to every evidence they have adduced so far.""

Gooi Soon Seong, the lawyer for Aisyah, has said the detection of VX on the women is not enough to convict them.

An old rule of thumb holds that when someone says it’s not about the money, it’s really about the money.

But there are exceptions to almost every rule. The National Rifle Association is a case in point.

In the wake of the horror in Las Vegas this week, countless politicians, journalists and commentators are insisting that the National Rifle Association has a “stranglehold” on the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton claimed that the GOP-controlled Congress simply does “whatever they are told to do” by the NRA and the gun lobby.

The New York Times listed total NRA donations to certain GOP politicians alongside their statements offering condolences and prayers for the victims in Las Vegas. And the op-ed pages have been suffused with claims that the NRA has bought Republicans with blood money, stifling the popular will and thwarting democracy in the process.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task.
The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving.
It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving.
Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.","The infotainment technology that automakers are cramming into the dashboard of new vehicles is making drivers take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel for dangerously long periods of time, an AAA study says.

The study released Thursday is the latest by University of Utah professor David Strayer, who has been examining the impact of infotainment systems on safety for AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety since 2013. Past studies also identified problems, but Strayer said the ""explosion of technology"" has made things worse.

Automakers now include more options to allow drivers to use social media, email and text. The technology is also becoming more complicated to use. Cars used to have a few buttons and knobs. Some vehicles now have as many as 50 buttons on the steering wheel and dashboard that are multi-functional. There are touch screens, voice commands, writing pads, heads-up displays on windshields and mirrors and 3-D computer-generated images.

""It's adding more and more layers of complexity and information at drivers' fingertips without often considering whether it's a good idea to put it at their fingertips,"" Strayer said. That complexity increases the overall amount of time drivers spend trying to use the systems.

The auto industry says the new systems are better alternatives for drivers than mobile phones and navigation devices that were not designed to be used while driving.

The vehicle-integrated systems ""are designed to be used in the driving environment and require driver attention that is comparable to tuning the radio or adjusting climate controls, which have always been considered baseline acceptable behaviors while driving,"" said Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

But Jake Nelson, AAA's director for traffic safety advocacy and research, said drivers took their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel while using infotainment systems in each of the 30 cars and light trucks, all 2017 models, that were tested in the study. The drivers used voice commands, touch screens and other interactive technologies to make calls, send texts, tune the radio or program navigation all while driving.

Clearly automakers haven't worked hard enough to make the systems quick and easy to use, Nelson said. Researchers rated 23 of the 30 vehicles ""very high"" or ""high"" in terms of the attention they demanded from drivers. Seven were rated ""moderate."" None required a low amount of attention to use.

Programming a destination into in-vehicle GPS navigation systems was the most distracting activity, taking drivers an average of 40 seconds to complete the task. At 25 mph (40 kph), a car can travel the length of four football fields during the time it takes to enter a destination. Previous research has shown that drivers who remove their eyes from the road for just two seconds double their risk for a crash.

Under pressure from the industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2012 issued voluntary safety guidelines to automakers for dashboard technology instead of enforceable safety standards. The guidelines recommend that automakers lock out the ability to program navigation systems while a car is moving. However, the ability to program navigation while driving was available in 12 vehicles in the study.

The guidelines also recommend automakers prevent drivers from texting while driving, but three-quarters of the vehicles tested permit drivers to text while the car is moving. Texting was the second-most distracting task performed by test drivers.

Drivers looked away from the road less when using voice commands, but that safety benefit was offset by the increased amount of time drivers spent interacting with the systems.

AAA said drivers should use infotainment technologies ""only for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes."" It also urged automakers to block the ability to program navigation systems or send texts while driving. Automakers should also design infotainment systems so that they require no more attention to use than listening to the radio or an audiobook, it said.

Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults say they want the new technologies in their vehicles, but only 24 percent feel that the technology already works perfectly, according to an opinion survey conducted for AAA.

""Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use,"" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO, ""but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers.""",Technology crammed into cars worsens driver distraction,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/technology-crammed-into-cars-worsens-driver-distraction.html

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote.

Bloom was facing mounting criticism for standing by the disgraced Hollywood producer while making a career of representing a long list of women who have been harassed or abused by powerful men. Her mother, Gloria Allred, is also famous for representing sexual harassment victims.

HARVEY WEINSTEIN TO TAKE INDEFINITE LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM COMPANY FOLLOWING SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS

In an interview Friday with ABC, Bloom was grilled over her about-face.

“I’ve done a lot of cases for women and I’ve often thought, ‘Gee, I wish I could get on the other side and smack that guy around a little bit verbally,’” Bloom said. ""Here was an opportunity of a guy saying, ‘Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.’ I’m like, ‘Good. I’m going to tell you what to do. Be honest. Be real.’”

In the wake of the incident, a number of liberal celebrities have been criticized for remaining silent on the matter.

The New York Times published a story Thursday that the co-chairman of the Weinstein Company has over the years reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment. In the report, actress Ashley Judd described being lured to Weinstein’s hotel room, only to find him wearing a bathrobe and requesting sexual favors.

The report also detailed encounters Weinstein allegedly had with other women working for the Weinstein Company, as well as official settlements from people associated with him, including actress Rose McGowan, who was issued a $100,000 settlement that Weinstein specifically said was not an admission of guilt.

On Twitter Friday night, McGowan blasted Hollywood actresses for staying silent in wake of the report.

“Ladies of Hollywood, your silence is deafening,” McGowan tweeted.

McGowan praised actresses Patricia Arquette, Lena Dunham, Jessica Chastain, Amber Tamblyn and Brie Larson for supporting her and Judd.

She also praised MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski for stating she would drop the three book deal with Weinstein’s company if he did not resign, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The New York Times reported McGowan refused to comment in their article.

The Daily Mail noted A-list actresses such as Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Kidman who have collaborated with Weinstein previously have not publicly stated anything.

Other actresses, including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence, Holly Hunter, Mira Sorvino, Anna Paquin and Kate Winslet were all awarded Oscars for Weinstein movies.

The Daily Beast reported that it reached out to a number of famous actors who have collaborated with Weinstein in the past and were told “no comment.”

In wake of the report, many congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have given money they received as a donation from Weinstein to charity.

Weinstein and his family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, nearly all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Weinstein, who co-founded Miramax and the Weinstein Company with his brother Bob, announced he has left the company indefinitely as an internal investigation was launched.

Weinstein released a statement in response to the allegations.

“I came of age in the 60’s and 70’s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office – or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it…”

Waste pullouts are a secret weapon of the well-oiled kitchen machine. They do the dirty job of handling your garbage, recycling and more. In fact, among surveyed homeowners who are remodeling a kitchen and upgrading cabinets, the No. 1 storage addition is a pullout waste or recycling cabinet, according to the latest Houzz kitchen trends study. But what makes them better than a regular garbage can? Actually, a pullout bin can have quite a few advantages, both in style and function. Here are some reasons why a humble pullout cabinet for waste deserves a little consideration and a space in your kitchen.

Out of sight, out of mind. When you think about your dream kitchen, what do you imagine? I’ll bet the garbage bin is not the first thing that comes to mind. But then, this is the whole point of a waste pullout: It tucks the garbage, recycling and other waste bins out of sight but within easy access. That way you don’t have to look at a messy freestanding bin or struggle with a tiny, seemingly always full can tucked under the sink.

Seamless integration. Because a waste pullout is essentially just a very deep drawer, it can easily be integrated into the look of your cabinetry, bringing some great contemporary functionality to very traditional or transitional style.

In fact, it’s quite common for a pullout drawer to be faced out with multiple false fronts to help it blend more seamlessly into a cabinet scheme.

RELATED: Pick Out the Perfect Drawer Pulls

Ease of use. If you cook often, one of the trickiest and yet most common tasks is sweeping away the remnants from chopping. You can carefully carry a chopping board to the bin, or you can bring the bin to the chopping board. Locating your garbage or compost pullout below a chopping zone means you can sweep waste directly into the bin with ease.

Here’s another smart take on this idea: a pullout chopping block (in place of a typical drawer) positioned above a waste pullout, with a simple hole to allow for trimmings to be swept directly into the bin. A great option for small kitchens, as the whole chopping station can be closed away when not in use, and the main counter can still be used for other things.

Waste sorting. Pullout cabinets aren’t just useful for holding your garbage bins. More and more cities today not only facilitate recycling or composting, they also require some level of waste sorting, and this requires managing multiple bins.

Depending on the system you use, you can easily have space for two sizable bins, or many smaller ones, configured with one tucked behind the other in a full-depth cabinet, or side by side, or many other configurations to suit your typical needs.

Odor control. One major concern that people often have with waste bins is the odors that can linger in the kitchen. There are several possible ways to combat this issue, and one is by using compartments with individual lids for organic waste.

Some waste pullout systems even integrate a special bin with a securely sealing lid specifically to hold compost, so you don’t have to change it with excessive frequency just to keep odors in check. Keep in mind how quickly it will fill; you’ll want to plan ahead so that organic waste isn’t left sitting exposed to air for too long.

Another option is to put different types of waste into their own cabinets with appropriately sized bins so that you only have to open the relevant compartment at any particular time. You can devote more space for plastics and less for compost, or vice versa, depending on your needs.

All-in-one storage. If you want to make sure nobody has an excuse for not changing the bin when it’s full, try a drawer that includes a small storage drawer inside, and you can keep garbage bags and related products right by the bins themselves.

You can also use interior drawers to split compartments into smaller subcompartments or to keep cleaning products or deodorizers on hand.

A fit for any budget. Want a fully luxe look? For just a little extra investment, a system with side panels (which can be custom fitted by your cabinetmaker) will more fully cover the bins for a discreet look even while the cabinet is pulled open.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the budget spectrum, pullout systems integrated into a standard door cabinet can turn any underused space into a garbage pullout with room for multiple bins without a total renovation. Plus, for dexterous chefs, they can be pulled and pushed by foot to facilitate disposal even when hands are full.",7 reasons to consider pullout waste and recycling cabinets,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/08/03/7-reasons-to-consider-pullout-waste-and-recycling-cabinets.html

Did Paddock have any brain abnormalities or life-threatening illness that caused him to become a mass murderer and commit suicide?

An autopsy found that mass murderer Charles Whitman, who killed his wife and mother and then shot and killed 14 people at the University of Texas in 1966 before police killed him, had a malignant brain tumor. Whitman, who used a rifle to shoot at random from observation deck of the 27-story university clock tower, also wounded 31 people.

In a note written the day before he killed his victims, Whitman discussed his hatred for his family and plans to kill them, adding: “After my death, I wish an autopsy on me to be performed to see if there’s any mental disorders.”

In addition to examining Paddock’s brain, an autopsy on his body will show if he had the scars of a prior suicide attempt. What clues can be found for why decided to use the guns he loved to end his life and the lives of so many others?

Toxicological analysis will show whether there were any illegal or prescription drugs in Paddock’s blood when he died. Analysis of his hair will show what drugs he had taken during the weeks or months before he died.

For the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office, the task of investigating so many deaths at once in a high-profile national tragedy is an enormous one.

Based on my over 50 years of experience examining more than 20,000 bodies to determine the cause of death and investigating many mass disasters – hurricanes, fires, airplane crashes and more – its clear that the Coroner’s Office right now must be a place of organized chaos.

Families want the bodies of their loved ones to be immediately released, while the bodies are still being studied by teams of pathologists, police, FBI agents, dentists and radiologists. The investigators are trying to reconstruct what happened and whether there are any clues as how to prevent future such deaths.

Here is an explanation of the work facing the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office:

First, the Coroner’s Office has the responsibility to properly identify each person who died and then to determine the cause of each death. Did everyone die from bullet wounds? Or did anyone die of a heart attack, a fall or from being trampled?

Then pathologists must remove bullets from the bodies of the shooting victims for ballistics examination. This is necessary to determine if there is a bullet taken from one of the deceased that does not match the weapons at the scene. That would indicate it had come from a second shooter.

Also, the coroner must confirm after an autopsy that Paddock did in fact shoot himself.

There are also certain procedures that coroners or medical examiners must employ in all mass disasters where many lives are tragically lost.

The Clark County coroner had to make sure there was enough cold storage space at his office to prevent decomposition of bodies and would have obtained additional refrigeration trucks if necessary.

The coroner also had to make sure that there are sufficient personnel available to professionally respond to all families making inquiries, whether in person, by telephone or email. In addition, the coroner needs staff to obtain descriptive information from family members regarding tattoos, birthmarks, scars and medical and dental information of those who died.

Family members may also be asked to provide photographs or DNA, if necessary.

Each body will be photographed and fingerprinted and may be X-rayed and autopsied as necessary. Examination of clothing, jewelry, rings and watches may assist in identification and will be returned to the families.

The Coroner’s Office must work closely with families to assure them that the bodies of their loved ones will be released as soon as they are definitely identified. Identification documents that may be with each body may have to be confirmed by direct visualization or photographs.

Sadly, we can’t turn back the clock on this mass murder. The nation mourns the senseless loss of life. All we can do is investigate each death to help us better understand this tragedy and perhaps get some idea of what led Paddock to commit such a terrible crime.",Autopsy of Las Vegas gunman's body may provide clues about the mystery of why he became a mass murderer,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/autopsy-las-vegas-gunmans-body-may-provide-clues-about-mystery-why-became-mass-murderer.html

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., The Wall Street Journal



Those who say gun control is the answer to massacres like Sunday’s in Las Vegas are really saying they are willing to live with such outrages.

Gun-control proposals always float up in the aftermath of mass shootings, singularly detached from any plan that could be carried out, much less command majority support from the U.S. electorate. A law banning gun sales is not in the cards. A law seriously curtailing private gun ownership, as exists in the U.K., is not in the cards. If it were, enforcing it would be a whole other nightmare.

Non-meaningful gun regulations, in fact, were the specialty of a Democratic senator who long represented Nevada, scene of Sunday’s killings. Harry Reid had a lifetime “B” rating from the National Rifle Association. A New York Times columnist on Monday, under the web headline “Preventing Mass Shootings Like the Vegas Strip Attack,” proposed eight steps that, whatever their slight utility in lowering the rate of other kinds of gun crimes and suicides, even the writer admitted would have no “overwhelming effect” on gun deaths, let alone mass shootings.

Mass shootings of the modern ilk are a lot more like terrorist attacks than they are like routine gun crimes, in which guns are used to settle an argument, facilitate a robbery or eliminate a rival.

Mass shootings typically involve a substantial measure of planning and preparation. Stephen Paddock walked into a luxury hotel—correction, he walked into a hotel-casino, where it’s part of the business model to know and watch customers carefully—with 23 weapons, ammo and related equipment. Here’s a question: Do you think Paddock, if he had also spent 30 minutes on an al Qaeda or ISIS website, would have been allowed to get this far?

America’s surveillance state—yes, we have one—finds what it’s programmed to look for.

But watching live sports can put some serious stress on your heart, a new, small study finds.

Watching a hockey game live can more than double a fan's heart rate, according to the study. And you don't even have to be in the arena for your heart rate to climb: Catching the game on TV can also have an effect, according to the study, published today (Oct. 5) in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

The excitement of sports is likely responsible for the observed increases in heart rate, said study author Dr. Paul Khairy, a cardiologist at the Montreal Heart Institute.

MOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL PRACTICE

But the new study is the first to demonstrate that the ambience of a live game — being surrounded by cheering fans, being closer to the action and experiencing an increased level of engagement — may all contribute to the heightened emotional stress response in fans, Khairy told Live Science.

In the study, the heart rates of fans who watched a hockey game in person increased by 110 percent, on average, from their resting heart rates. That's comparable to the increase you'd see in someone running, jumping rope or doing any other vigorous form of exercise, Khairy said.

Fans who watched the same game on TV had a 75 percent increase in their heart rates, on average, which is similar to the heart rates seen with moderate physical activity, such as a casual bike ride, Khairy noted.

This is the first time that the heart-rate response of hockey spectators has been measured, the researchers wrote. But previous studies from Europe have found higher heart rates in soccer fans who watched World Cup matches in person. These increases occurred after their team scored a goal or after their team beat an opponent.

In the new study, the researchers looked only at fans of the Montreal Canadiens, a team with an avid fan base in a country where hockey is considered the national winter sport. The study was the brainchild of two 13-year-old girls in Canada, one of whom was Khairy's daughter.

They recruited 20 participants ages 23 to 63. Half of the participants attended Canadiens games while the rest watched the action at home. Both groups wore heart-rate monitors during the games.

Because the researchers included fans of only one team, the results may not apply to all hockey fans, the study noted.

Taking hockey to heart

The study found that fans' heart rates peaked most often during overtime periods. The second-most-stressful time for fans was during scoring opportunities by the Canadiens, followed by the opposing team's attempts to put the puck in the net.

Surprisingly, a person's interest in the sport and engagement as a fan were not linked to changes in heart rate during the game, Khairy said. However, he added that he suspects there might have been a different result if researchers had developed their own way to measure passion in hockey fans rather than adapting a tool originally designed for soccer spectators.

DONORS CONTINUE TO LINE UP AT BLOOD CENTERS IN RESPONSE TO LAS VEGAS MASSACRE

Although fans watching any sport can experience a similar amount of excitement as was observed in this group of hockey enthusiasts, these results may not apply to other sports, Khairy said. There are too many elements that differ among sports — such as the pace of the game, a fan's emotional attachment to a team, and even the number of high-intensity moments — that prevent researchers from making similar generalizations, he said.

A fan's emotional reaction to a game can be intense, Khairy said, and that could trigger cardiovascular problems.

Fans who experience cardiac symptoms during a game should seek immediate medical attention rather than waiting for a convenient moment, such as in-between periods, Khairy said. Many arenas and ice rinks have cardiac defibrillators on hand, as well as people trained in using them, he added.

Washingtonian Magazine first reported Obama’s invitation to join Columbia Country Club.

“Since 1898, Columbia has been a special place and has earned a tremendous reputation for everything from its championship golf course to its first class dining facilities to an unparalleled social fabric,” the club’s website states. “Columbia is not easy to capture in words or pictures.

Obama routinely played golf throughout his presidency, including regularly at the course at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington.

“A number of people have been injured in an incident involving a car in Exhibition Road, South Kensington.","London police said a vehicle ramming into a crowd outside the Natural History Museum injuring a number of people Saturday was being treated as a road traffic collision, not a terror-related incident.

At least 11 people were injured - most with leg and head injuries, the London Ambulance Service said.

London’s Metropolitan Police said a man was detained at the scene and a motive was being investigated. Police confirmed they would release more information as time went on.

""The incident in Exhibition Road South Kensington earlier is not being treated as a terror-related incident. It is a road traffic collision,"" London's Metropolitan Police tweeted.

“It is not being treated as a terrorist incident at this stage while we establish what has happened,” a spokesperson told The Guardian.



No other information was available on the number of people injured or their condition. Emergency services were said to be on the scene outside the museum.

Witness Katie Craine said she was coming out of the museum when she saw a man in handcuffs being pinned down on the ground by police near a damaged car.

""He looked really proud of himself,"" she said. ""He was laughing.""

One witness, Lesley Carter, said passersby held the man down before police arrived.

“I saw the man pinned down by about six people – one guy was trying to pin him down with his four- or five-year-old daughter in his arms,” Lesley Carter, a witness, told The Guardian.

“It looked like the car had smashed into the wall between two other cars and the guy got out to run before being pinned down. Loads of people were running away and within minutes the police had turned up. It was a very quick response,” Carter said.

Maxim, another witness, told Sky News, the man was removed from his vehicle.

“They took a man on the ground, they took the man from the car and put him on the ground and then 20 minutes later evacuated the street,” he said. “There was a lot of police, I saw people running, people were panicking.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May has been briefed on the incident, Sky News reported.

May tweeted her thanks to the first responders and that her thoughts were with those who were injured.

Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, tweeted his statement regarding the incident.

“A number of people have been injured in an incident involving a car in Exhibition Road, South Kensington. A man has been detained by police,” the statement said.

“Details are still emerging and I have spoken with and am in close contact with Assistant Met Commissioner Mark Rowley and our other emergency services,” Khan wrote.

The BBC reported that the injuries appeared to be minor.

London's official terrorist threat level has been set at ""severe,"" indicating an attack is highly likely after a series of terror attacks have rocked London and Manchester this year, including a vehicle attack on pedestrians at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.

One source told the network that Paddock displayed anti-social traits common to other mass shooters. Others point out that Paddock appeared to have trouble forming meaningful relationships and was seen by some acquaintances as disconnected or standoffish.

However, Paddock's girlfriend told FBI agents Wednesday that she had not noticed any changes in his mental state or indications he could become violent, a federal official told the Associated Press.

Investigators have spent the past week trying to pin down a specific motive for why Paddock targeted the Route 91 Harvest Festival before taking his own life Sunday evening. They have investigated whether Paddock was with a prostitute days before the shooting, scrutinized cruises he took and tried to make sense of a cryptic note with numbers jotted on it found in his hotel room.

Three police officers who responded to Paddock's hotel room at the Mandalay Bay have told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that the note included handwritten calculations about where he needed to aim to maximize the carnage.

""I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,"" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Dave Newton told the newsmagazine. ""So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.""

Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Friday that investigators had pursued over 1,000 leads, but admitted ""We still do not have a clear motive or reason why.""

""We have looked at literally everything,"" McMahill added.

It is unusual to have so few hints of a motive five days after a mass shooting. In previous mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer — or even phoned police.

""The lack of a social media footprint is likely intentional,"" Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California, told the Associated Press ""We're so used to, in the first 24 to 48 hours, being able to review social media posts. If they don't leave us a note behind or a manifesto behind, and we're not seeing that, that's what's making this longer.""

What officers have found is that Paddock planned his attack meticulously.

He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the festival, stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon, and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.

In a possible sign he was contemplating massacres at other sites, he also booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements leading up to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

His arsenal also included tracer rounds that can improve a shooter's firing accuracy in the dark, a law enforcement official told AP. It wasn't clear whether Paddock fired any of the illuminated bullets during the high-rise massacre.

Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of the .308-caliber and .223-caliber tracer ammunition from a private buyer he met at a Phoenix gun show, a law enforcement official not authorized to comment on the investigation said on condition of anonymity.

Tracer rounds illuminate their path so a gunman can home in on targets at night. But they can also give away the shooter's position.

Video shot of the pandemonium that erupted when Paddock started strafing the festival showed a muzzle flash from his room at the Mandalay Bay resort, but bullets weren't visible in the night sky.

And if you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.

“I realize,” Newton says at one point, “that the joke is really on me.”

Newton was apparently taken by surprise Wednesday when Jourdan Rodrigue, a football writer with the Charlotte Observer, asked him an insightful question about the team’s passing game.

“It's funny to hear a female talk about routes,” Newton commented. “It's funny.""

The comment unleashed a torrent of criticism that Newton was being dismissive of the female reporter. Earlier Thursday, yogurt maker Dannon announced it was ending Newton’s contract with the company.

Another sponsor, Gatorade, said Newton's comments were ""objectionable and disrespectful to all women.""

The NFL said Wednesday that Newton’s comment was “just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.”

NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters Thursday that it was not yet determined if the league or the Panthers would discipline the 28-year-old Newton for the incident.

Rodrigue, 25, said she spoke with Newton on Wednesday, soon after the comment, but did not receive a direct apology from him at the time.

Rodrigue issued an apology of her own Thursday, the Charlotte Observer reported, after reports surfaced that she used a racial slur in Twitter messages she wrote while still a college student several years ago. The tweets were first reported by BlackSportsOnline.com.

Meanwhile, some Newton fans argued on social media that the quarterback was being treated unfairly.

The comedian’s neighbor who just came under fire for his verbal tirade against Griffin has filed a restraining order against her claiming she and her boyfriend spy on him and his family.

Jeffrey Mezger, the CEO of KB Home and Griffin’s neighbor, filed for the restraining order Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif., and a hearing on the accusation was slated for next Tuesday, People reported.

Griffin filed her own restraining order against Mezger two weeks ago after the comedian and her neighbor got into an altercation. Griffin’s boyfriend, Randy Bick, called in a noise complaint on Mezger.

KATHY GRIFFIN RIPPED BY MILLIONAIRE NEIGHBOR IN POTTY-MOUTH TIRADE

Mezger claimed Griffin and Bick have been recording and filming conversations he has had on his property for more than a year, the restraining order filing stated.

“Ms. Griffin (and/or cohabitant Randy Bick) has admitted to making audio (and video) recordings of private conversations on my property over the past 15 months. In addition, Griffin (and/or Bick) have aimed an outdoor video-recording device at areas including a Jacuzzi where my young grandchildren sometimes play,” he says along with a photo of the specific outdoor camera,” the order stated.

“We have also been forced to keep the windows that face the Griffin-Bick residence closed with the blinds drawn at all times, to reduce the chance of becoming the unwilling subject of further illegal recordings,” Mezger claimed in the order.

The file concluded: “Ms. Griffin and Mr. Bick have completely deprived my family and me of the use of our yard, and have essentially rendered living in our home intolerable.”

Last month, Bick reportedly called in a noise complaint on Mezger after hours of excessive partying on the CEO’s property.

KATHY GRIFFIN: ‘I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG’ IN TRUMP BEHEADING PHOTO SHOOT

Mezger fired back reportedly shouted homophobic expletives at Griffin and Bick, calling her a, “c—t,” “d—e,” mocking her shaved had and bringing up her severed head photo controversy.

The controversy he was referring to was when Griffin came under fire for a photo of her with a fake severed head of President Trump.

Griffin shaved her head out of solidarity for her sister Joyce Griffin, who died of an undisclosed form of cancer on Sept. 14.

Following Mezger’s alleged verbal tirade against Griffin, KB Home took 25 percent out of the CEO’s annual bonus.","Kathy Griffin's neighbor files for restraining order, claims comedian spies on him",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/07/kathy-griffins-neighbor-files-for-restraining-order-claims-comedian-spies-on-him.html

So while we need to be better prepared for an attack, we must not be paralyzed by fear.
We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.
Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone.
And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment.","For centuries, medical professionals have learned lessons from the casualties of war. In the wake of the horrendous shooting spree that left 58 people dead and sent nearly 500 to hospitals in Las Vegas last Sunday, the medical community – and ordinary citizens as well – should learn lessons about how to respond when an American city is turned into a war zone.

Learning these lessons is critically important to save lives, because the sad truth is that it is just a matter of time before guns, bombs, cars, trucks, planes or something else is used by mentally disturbed people or terrorists to attack innocent people again somewhere in our country.

When people are seriously injured, a rapid response can be the difference between life and death. But we can’t always count on trained medical professionals to be nearby when we need them.

Here are some ideas that can help us all deal with the possibility of violence or another medical emergency suddenly engulfing us:

First, as terrible as the attack in Las Vegas was, we shouldn’t panic. We can be sure that some people will be in the wrong place at the wrong time and fall victim to a violent attack, but the overwhelming majority of us never will. So while we need to be better prepared for an attack, we must not be paralyzed by fear. That in itself is harmful to our health. We can’t spend our lives locked behind closed doors and afraid to go to concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings.

Second, as many of us as possible should get some basic first-aid training. Learn how to administer CPR. How to tie a tourniquet to stop bleeding from a wound. What you can do if someone is burned. How to immobilize a broken arm or leg. You don’t have to be a doctor or nurse to learn the basics of dealing with a medical emergency until the person you are helping can get treatment from a medical professional. Schools should provide this training to children and community groups should make it available to adults.

As a practicing physician I taught my children at home how to administer CPR, how to apply a proper tourniquet and how to deal with penetrating injuries. I remember some of my friends telling me: “Manny, if you want your kids to be doctors that’s fine, otherwise, you’ll be traumatizing them!” No, I don’t necessarily want my kids to be doctors, but rather be involved in our society. We all need to be part of the solution.

Third, know your blood type and have a card in your wallet listing it. Should you ever need a transfusion in an emergency, this information will be important for those treating you.

Fourth, donate blood to a blood bank. Having a plentiful blood supply on hand in an emergency can help medical professional save lives. The American Red Cross website makes it easy to find a blood drive near you by typing in your ZIP code.

In addition to these steps that everyone can take, emergency medical responders should learn lessons from what went right and what might have gone better following the Las Vegas attack and other mass casualty incidents, such as natural disasters. Studies of the emergency response should be shared widely in the medical community and among government officials.

Lessons learned by providing medical treatment in wars over the past 100 years have improved health care for everyone. New lessons learned in domestic attacks can do the same.

For example, the horror of World War I accelerated the learning and technical proliferation of surgery in the field of wound management. We began to learn about what unsanitary conditions could do not only in the battlefield, but in the cities to where the wounded would be transported.

In addition, the development of wound drainage techniques and surface wound antiseptics became the standards in many military hospitals in World War I, minimizing complications from infection. Civilian hospitals then made these improvements.

World War I also brought us the first concept of a blood bank and how the utilization of blood products would potentially save lives. Specific typing of blood became available and preservation of blood products was discovered in order to maintain the freshness of blood.

Surgeons and scientists during World War I became aware of the treatment of shock. Many scientists began to publish in the field of physiology, which led to discoveries for the treatment of hypothermia, fluid resuscitation and oxygen delivery.

World War II gave us the analysis of medical triaging and how important survival is from the time of injury to treatment. This discovery is the hallmark of trauma victim treatment to this day.

In addition, during WWII surgical techniques were improved and subspecialties in surgical training became the norm. The war taught us about the importance of medical teams of nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists and surgeons. More antibiotics were developed beyond penicillin. The treatment of trauma became more sophisticated.

From the end of the Korean War through the Vietnam War and up until 2006, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units were set up in a matter of hours, providing medical treatment near the front lines to wounded soldiers. A book, film and hit TV show made millions of Americans aware of the MASH units.

The Vietnam War gave us not only more sophistication in vascular surgery but also the framework of what it is today to have a trauma center. And helicopters played a key role in quickly evacuating the wounded to medical treatment. Now helicopters are used for the same purpose in this country.

In the long run, I know things will get better. Things will change. Because Good will prevail against Evil. In the meantime, we are in the middle of a war between Good and Evil and we need to minimize the casualties of war.",Dr. Manny Alvarez: The Las Vegas Massacre can teach us important lessons about saving lives,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/dr-manny-alvarez-las-vegas-massacre-can-teach-us-important-lessons-about-saving-lives.html

Those arrested would also likely be placed in out-of-state detention centers, ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said in a statement.

Homan’s comments came a day after Gov. Jerry Brown D-Calif. signed bill SB54, or sanctuary state legislation.

The bill, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, would ban police from asking people about their immigration status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities. Jail officials would only be allowed to transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities if they have been convicted of certain crimes.

Homan cautioned the bill helped protect illegal immigrants from deportation and made the state a “magnet.""

""Ultimately, SB54 helps shield removable aliens from immigration enforcement and creates another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,"" Homan warned.

However, Brown noted the bill does not bar ICE from operating in the state. His office declined to comment further on the ICE statement Friday.

""They are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California,"" Brown wrote.

Brown said the law does prevent the “commandeering of local officials” to do immigration work.

“These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families, and this bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day,” Brown said.

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS APPROVE ‘SANCTUARY STATE’ BILL

Democratic Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, who carried the bill, said Homan's statement ""exemplifies the fearmongering and lies that guide this Administration.""

""The Trump Administration is once again making heavy-handed threats against California because we won't help them tear apart families and our economy in the process,"" de Leon said in a statement.

Democratic lawmakers in California have worked to create barriers to Trump’s campaign pledge to bolster deportation efforts.

Trump highlighted sanctuary cities during his presidential campaign after the killing of Kate Steinle, a San Francisco woman, who was fatally shot at a pier in 2015 by a Mexican national who had been deported five times. In June, Kate’s Law passed in the House, which would increase the penalties for deported aliens who try to return to the U.S.

Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding to sanctuary cities, several of which have filed lawsuits to prevent that from happening.

California is home to an estimated 2.3 million immigrants without legal authorization.

Sgt. La David T. Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Fla., died in the Oct. 4 ambush, but his body was not recovered until Oct. 6.

The Military Times reported that Johnson enlisted in the Army in January 2014 as a Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic. He was decorated with the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Parachutist Badge, the Army Air Assault Badge, the Driver and Mechanic Badge, and the Marksmanship Qualification Badge - Sharpshooter with Rifle.

The other U.S. forces killed in the attack were identified Friday as Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash.; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Ga.

All four soldiers were assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C. They were part of a joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol that was ambushed by Islamic militants near the border with Mali.

Two U.S. soldiers were wounded in the attack. Niger's army said four of its soldiers were killed and eight others were wounded.

U.S. officials told the Associated Press that the soldiers were leaving a meeting with tribal leaders when they were ambushed by between 40 and 50 extremists on in vehicles and on motorcycles. The attackers fired rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns at the patrol, setting off explosions and shattering windows.

Look for the helpers.","2017 has been a year that will go down in history as one of the worst in terms of weather disasters. Three major hurricanes – Harvey, Irma and Maria roared ashore in just a few weeks of each other – devastating islands, inundating major U.S. cities and causing catastrophic damage.

As a meteorologist, we do our best to warn as many people of a potential disaster. Thankfully, the science is getting better and we have more tools to help forecast these forces of nature to better prepare the public. But there’s always going to be the chance that one storm hits your neighborhood with tragic consequences.

One of the things that brings me hope after these horrible weather events hits is the outpouring of community and support that comes in the wake of these storms. Mr. Rogers, the friendly sweater-wearing man I used to watch every morning on television, took notice of this as well. He wrote and spoke about it often:

“I was spared from any great disasters when I was little, but there was plenty of news of them in newspapers and on the radio, and there were graphic images of them in newsreels.

For me, as for all children, the world could have come to seem a scary place to live. But I felt secure with my parents, and they let me know that we were safely together whenever I showed concern about accounts of alarming events in the world.

There was something else my mother did that I’ve always remembered: ‘Always look for the helpers,’ she’d tell me. ‘There’s always someone who is trying to help.’ I did, and I came to see that the world is full of doctors and nurses, police and firemen, volunteers, neighbors and friends who are ready to jump in to help when things go wrong.”

Always look for the helpers. We saw this most recently in the aftermath of the horrifying attack in Las Vegas – everyday people stepping forward to help those in need.

And it’s what I saw when I met the men and women from Team Rubicon last weekend in Wharton, Texas.

The history of this special group of helpers began in 2010 after the Haiti Earthquake. Two Marines, Jake Wood and William McNulty, wanted to help. They teamed up with six other veterans and first responders, gathered funds and supplies from friends and family, rented a truck and went in to help.

Since that first mission, Team Rubicon has expanded and has been moving into disasters ever since to lend a hand. They pair the skills and experience of military veterans with first responders and medical professionals.

In Wharton, Texas, I found these hard working-men and women with their grey shirts moving flood-ravaged furniture and debris, cleaning up a community center so that residents could congregate, getting essentials and finding help for those returning to their flooded homes.

Even though they were strangers, Team Rubicon worked together as though they had known each other many years. When I asked them why they do this, they’d tell me it part of their DNA – as former servicemen and servicewomen, they continue to want to serve even after retirement. One army veteran, Rob, told me you can sit and watch the news and want to do something, but to really do something – get up and get out there.

I spoke with a team of several men and women from Australia that had travelled over 30 hours to come to the small town of Wharton to spread some “Aussie hope” and to remind people that what brings us together as human beings far outweighs what divides us. It doesn’t matter what race, religion, or color you are or where you come from. No one is talking politics when they are picking up dirty, flood-torn children’s books from a school desk, or peeling away moldy wallpaper and artwork from a classroom wall.

A resident of Wharton, Texas, who was gathering supplies such as cleaning items, diapers and food for her community told me she was in love with these teams of strangers who came in and were lending a hand. She said it made her heart feel great that people all over the world think about others. “When you have a serving heart” she told me, “it means everything.”

I came away from that experience with a heart full of hope and a much stronger spirit than I had before I arrived in Wharton. I hugged a lot of people and told them they made me want to be better as a mom, wife, sister and as a human being. I too, wanted to be a helper.

As my friend Jake Wood, team leader and CEO of his wonderful Team Rubicon organization, told me, “There’s nothing more American than getting out and helping your neighbors.”

A crazed gunman took the lives of at least 59 people and injured more than 500 innocent country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The tight-knit country music community immediately came together to commemorate those who were murdered and to stand behind the victims and their families.

Some of the industry's biggest stars like Keith Urban and Vince Gill performed at a vigil hosted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp and the Country Music Association drawing a reported crowd of 600 people on Monday night.

Urban serenaded the audience with Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" after recalling his 9-year-old daughter asking him if he knew any of the victims.

""[Fans are] like family,"" Urban said at the vigil. ""It's the one thing about country music. It is a community. I do know those people. It just hit me.""

Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said at the emotional event, ""Love is the answer and the only thing we know.""

Country singer Lee Brice, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the deadly shooting, told Fox News he feels ""attacked by an enemy.""

""I feel like the fans are probably reacting for the most part like I’m reacting,"" Brice told us. ""They feel the same way – they feel like they’re being attacked by an enemy but they’re not going to let that enemy win. The enemy is hate.""

For example, while one reviewer described the fleece as “warm and cozy,” another commenter was evidently more taken aback, writing “This is legit an USAF fleece lol”.

“Do NOT call 911 reporting a dead body. Instead, congratulate the homeowner on a great display,” it said.

The department later said someone called saying there was a “suspicious person lying in a driveway with bloody handprints on the garage.” Officers rushed to the scene with sirens blasting, only to find it was all fake.

""I'm sorry your university doesn't believe in freedom of speech!!!"" responded Cannon on Tuesday via Twitter.

Cannon was asked ""to avoid vulgarity and explicit sexual content"" because Saturday's show was expected to draw older alumni, university President Joseph Marbach said in a statement.

Marbach acknowledged the role comedy plays in conversations about social issues, but disagreed with the content of Cannon's performance.

""While comedy often explores serious social issues in ways that are fun and thought-provoking, Mr. Cannon's act crossed the line. His words were offensive and do not represent our Mercy core values.

Escudero, a 53-year-old woman from Alcala de Guadaira, a town outside of Seville in southern Spain, has been unable to renew her driver’s license or go to the doctor since 2010 because various government officers believe she’s dead -- the result of a seven-year-old clerical error.

“[I have] suffered for more than six years,” she told EFE, according to El Diario de Sevilla.

Escudero said she first learned of the error when she visited the emergency room and her primary care physician checked her out.

“He looked at her, not knowing how to break it to her, and told her that according to Social Security records she was deceased,” her daughter, Marta, told the newspaper, adding “the family has not found the funny side of this story for a long time now.”

The doctor still treated Escudero “because she knew me and knew my situation was urgent,” but that the error needed to be fixed sooner rather than later.

At first, Escudero thought it was just a computer error that could be fixed quickly at the Social Security offices. That wasn’t the case.

“They explained to me that someone probably made a typo or maybe it was a computer error. But we went to the treasury, to the courts…and everywhere I appeared as deceased,” she told the newspaper.

“On top of killing me, they find me, without hearing my story,” Escudero said, joking that she is dead to everyone but the banks, to whom she pays loans and mortgage on a regular basis. “On the government’s computers I am dead, but for the banks I am alive and kicking.”

In April 2016, she found out that a woman with her name and data had been buried six years prior in Malaga – about 127 miles away.

She said her daughter called the cemetery and confirmed the burial date and that the remains has been transferred to an ossuary because maintenance fees had not been paid. She also confirmed her mother’s social security and date of birth.

“'Look,' my daughter told them, 'that person is my mother and she is here right next to me,'” Escudero said. “Imagine the woman’s face at the cemetery.”

Earlier this month she filed a petition with Malaga courts to have the grave opened and has offered to do a DNA test – anything – to prove that the woman buried is not her.

Escudero says no one has explained to her how the woman has died, but believes that she has been confused with a sister with whom she has no contact and whose whereabouts are unknown.

“Pauli Murray represents the best of Yale: a pre-eminent intellectual inspired to lead and prepared to serve her community and her country,” Yale President Peter Salovey said in April 2016.

According to the school, Murray also helped organize the March on Washington with Martin Luther King, Jr. and was appointed by former President John F. Kennedy to the Committee on Civil and Political Rights of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women.

Eden: Oh, there’s so many! We seemed to have the same rhythm in our comedic timing, which was fortunate for both of us. We enjoyed working together… The most outstanding story with Larry was the one when we had a lion as a guest. I had done two feature films with lions and I’ve been told how to treat them. They’re male lions, they’re lazy. If they’re well fed, they don’t really want to eat you. But they do want to play with you if you run around! You have to be very quiet with them. So I went over and I told Larry, ‘We have to go make friends with the lion.’ He goes, ‘I’m not going to make any friends with any bleep lion!’ And walks off!

And so, I walked over and I did the usual things I’ve been trained to do. I scratched him behind the ears. Never the ears, just behind the ears. And I rehearsed with the cat. He was 600 pounds, a big male lion. They put a little bowl of raw meat beside me. He put his head down and nom, nom, nom. Oh boy, that was good. He looks around and he’s very happy. Very, very happy. And then Larry came in. They started the scene.

They put the meat down and he ate his meat. He turned around, looked at Larry, and let out a huge roar! It was the loudest roar you have ever heard in your life. Larry was on the next set. He was gone! But not only was he gone, every single man on that set ran. They broke the camera, one of the pieces fell over and I had a 600 pound lion on my lap purring. He put his head in my lap and started to lick my arm, like a great, big pussycat.

Fox News: Was there a moment from your time on ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ that still sticks out to you?

Eden: Oh my goodness, so many things happened on set. One of them was [when] my mother came to visit the set for the first time. And it was a show in which the genie was trapped in a safe. And inside that safe, don’t ask me why, there was a huge lipstick and a bottle of aspirin. I don’t know why that was in the safe, but it was! And of course, they would jiggle the set whenever someone would pick up this safe. Well, they jiggled it a little too hard and the lipstick fell over and hit me on the head. I was out for a couple of minutes. My mother was having a fit! Just having a fit.

Fox News: What’s the story behind the belly button controversy?

Eden: I have a big 'thank-you' to the media for that. I was on the set one day and [a writer] for The Hollywood Reporter walked on the set and right over to me. He said, ‘I don’t believe you have one.’ I said, ‘A what?’ And he goes, ‘A belly button!’ And then he poked me in the middle! He started writing about my belly button... The next thing I knew, the 'Laugh-In' wanted to premiere my navel on NBC. I know a lot of women are known for very glamorous body parts, but my navel? Ha!

Fox News: You previously starred in the 1960 film ‘Flaming Star’ alongside Elvis Presley. What was your impression of Elvis?

Eden: He was a lovely man. Well brought up. Was a hard worker. A very good actor and wanted to be. This was the only film that he really had a chance of showing he could act. He got excellent reviews on the film. And, of course, it didn’t make a penny because... he didn’t sing a song. That wasn’t what his fans wanted. But he was excellent.

Fox News: How was it working alongside Lucille Ball in “I Love Lucy”?

Eden: Oh my, that was mind-boggling for me. It was the third job I had in Los Angeles and she was so good to me. I can’t tell you how sweet she was. I had a dress on that she didn’t think was outstanding enough. She asked me to take it off and the next thing I knew, she was sitting there putting sparkling things all over it, just to make it look better.

Here’s the star of the show making this young woman look better. She was just so wonderful and so talented. Of course, I couldn’t believe I was there. She wanted to sign me to a contract because she believed in comedy and thought I had a great bent for that. But at the time I had already tested at Fox, and I received the phone call while I was on the set. They picked up my option and so, instead of ""Lucy"" I went to Fox.

Fox News: At any point in your career, did you ever feel typecast because of your success in ‘I Dream of Jeannie’?

Eden: No, I didn’t, I really didn’t. Because after I did ‘I Dream of Jeannie,' I did at least two other television shows. And I don’t know how many television movies playing entirely different kinds of people. I was so busy… So, I didn’t feel that I was ever typecast. In fact, I wasn’t. ‘Jeannie’ just so happens to be the one people remember and that’s all right with me. She’s easy to live with. I really like her.","'I Dream of Jeannie' star Barbara Eden describes working with Larry Hagman, Elvis and Lucille Ball",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/06/dream-jeannie-star-barbara-eden-describes-working-with-larry-hagman-elvis-and-lucille-ball.html

Did Paddock have any brain abnormalities or life-threatening illness that caused him to become a mass murderer and commit suicide?

An autopsy found that mass murderer Charles Whitman, who killed his wife and mother and then shot and killed 14 people at the University of Texas in 1966 before police killed him, had a malignant brain tumor. Whitman, who used a rifle to shoot at random from observation deck of the 27-story university clock tower, also wounded 31 people.

In a note written the day before he killed his victims, Whitman discussed his hatred for his family and plans to kill them, adding: “After my death, I wish an autopsy on me to be performed to see if there’s any mental disorders.”

In addition to examining Paddock’s brain, an autopsy on his body will show if he had the scars of a prior suicide attempt. What clues can be found for why decided to use the guns he loved to end his life and the lives of so many others?

Toxicological analysis will show whether there were any illegal or prescription drugs in Paddock’s blood when he died. Analysis of his hair will show what drugs he had taken during the weeks or months before he died.

For the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office, the task of investigating so many deaths at once in a high-profile national tragedy is an enormous one.

Based on my over 50 years of experience examining more than 20,000 bodies to determine the cause of death and investigating many mass disasters – hurricanes, fires, airplane crashes and more – its clear that the Coroner’s Office right now must be a place of organized chaos.

Families want the bodies of their loved ones to be immediately released, while the bodies are still being studied by teams of pathologists, police, FBI agents, dentists and radiologists. The investigators are trying to reconstruct what happened and whether there are any clues as how to prevent future such deaths.

Here is an explanation of the work facing the Las Vegas Coroner’s Office:

First, the Coroner’s Office has the responsibility to properly identify each person who died and then to determine the cause of each death. Did everyone die from bullet wounds? Or did anyone die of a heart attack, a fall or from being trampled?

Then pathologists must remove bullets from the bodies of the shooting victims for ballistics examination. This is necessary to determine if there is a bullet taken from one of the deceased that does not match the weapons at the scene. That would indicate it had come from a second shooter.

Also, the coroner must confirm after an autopsy that Paddock did in fact shoot himself.

There are also certain procedures that coroners or medical examiners must employ in all mass disasters where many lives are tragically lost.

The Clark County coroner had to make sure there was enough cold storage space at his office to prevent decomposition of bodies and would have obtained additional refrigeration trucks if necessary.

The coroner also had to make sure that there are sufficient personnel available to professionally respond to all families making inquiries, whether in person, by telephone or email. In addition, the coroner needs staff to obtain descriptive information from family members regarding tattoos, birthmarks, scars and medical and dental information of those who died.

Family members may also be asked to provide photographs or DNA, if necessary.

Each body will be photographed and fingerprinted and may be X-rayed and autopsied as necessary. Examination of clothing, jewelry, rings and watches may assist in identification and will be returned to the families.

The Coroner’s Office must work closely with families to assure them that the bodies of their loved ones will be released as soon as they are definitely identified. Identification documents that may be with each body may have to be confirmed by direct visualization or photographs.

Sadly, we can’t turn back the clock on this mass murder. The nation mourns the senseless loss of life. All we can do is investigate each death to help us better understand this tragedy and perhaps get some idea of what led Paddock to commit such a terrible crime.",Autopsy of Las Vegas gunman's body may provide clues about the mystery of why he became a mass murderer,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/07/autopsy-las-vegas-gunmans-body-may-provide-clues-about-mystery-why-became-mass-murderer.html

Now, the 86-year-old and his wife, Joy, are hoping his fans will listen in again as he discusses the importance of choosing the right statin, and keeping your heart health in check.

In 1992, heart health wasn’t a major concern for the then-cohost of Live! With Regis and Kathy Lee, and he never made it a point to check in on his cholesterol. His father had heart trouble and died in his 60s, but Philbin had kept an active lifestyle and was never overweight.

But during a trip to Florida, Philbin began having chest pains and knew he should seek help. He had an angioplasty and discovered his cholesterol levels had soared to 300 mg/dL. Anything above 240mg/dL is considered high.

HOW HOCKEY FANS' HEARTS REACT TO STRESSFUL MOMENTS IN THE GAME

“I couldn’t get over it,” the Emmy-Award-winning talk show host told Fox News. “Me? 300, I mean, give me a break!”

Joy flew down to meet her husband and had a similar reaction.

“I knew Regis did not have a great diet, but to me, he was indestructible,” she told Fox News. “It never occurred to me that he would have that high of a cholesterol level.”

The pair traveled back to New York and met with his doctor who put him on his first statin, while they vowed to make some lifestyle changes that included cleaning up his diet.

“I realized we had better have him checked out and put him on a statin because I knew that I couldn’t be a watchdog to Regis,” Joy said. “I felt that we finally took control of it and he was on a statin and things were fine.”

Somewhere along the way Regis began having aches in his legs, and it was attributed to the statin he was prescribed. Rather than become part of the 50 percent who stop taking statins within one year of starting, Philbin consulted with his doctor who prescribed him a different one, and his side effects subsided.

“We were so surprised to find out that 50 percent of people taking a statin top taking it after one year,” Joy said. “I thought, ‘What are they going to do about their cholesterol?’”

BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS SHARE THEIR ADVICE

Their concern for others moved the couple to become part of the Take Cholesterol to Heart Campaign, which encourages patients to check on their heart and cholesterol health. The campaign’s website provides users with information regarding different statins and suggests helpful talking points to take to the doctor. The campaign resonates with the Philbins, who opened their home to viewers in 2008 as Regis underwent a triple bypass surgery.

“The audience always felt that they were up to date on everything Regis was doing,” Joy said, adding that he always discussed what was happening in his life while hosting Live!.

Philbin said he wants others to realize that just because one statin might not be working, it doesn’t mean another won’t be right for you.

“A lot of people just give up and say, ‘I’m not going to take it,’” Philbin said. “I didn’t do that, I stayed with it. So here I am, 86 years old. Twenty-five years on the thing and here I am!”","Regis Philbin opens up on heart issues, cholesterol health",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/06/regis-philbin-opens-up-on-heart-issues-cholesterol-health.html

It might be if it weren’t for a couple of (not so small) sticking points.

One, the home remedy recommended by your friend — or one of the many websites promoting “natural therapies” — might not work.

And two, it could make you sicker or even kill you.

That’s exactly what happened to an Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning after taking high doses of apricot kernel extract, hoping to prevent his prostate cancer from returning.

BABY DIED AFTER PARENTS REFUSED TREATMENT FOR JAUNDICE, POLICE SAY

This “superfood” is touted as having anticancer properties. It’s a claim that has no reliable scientific evidence to back it up.

Apricot kernel extract isn’t alone in peddling hope alongside an increased risk of harming your health.

People use home remedies for a variety of reasons — fighting cancer, losing weight, increasing sex drive, or reducing symptoms of illnesses that have few medical treatments available.

Most home remedies or natural therapies, though, haven’t been put through the same rigorous clinical testing you expect from pharmaceutical medications.

So, does that mean you should ignore them completely?

Not necessarily. It’s more a matter of approaching them with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Dr. Harriet Hall, a retired family physician, former Air Force flight surgeon, and author of the SkepDoc column in Skeptic magazine, is one of those leading the charge against medical “treatments” not supported by science.

Like others in the medical and scientific community, Hall is bothered that many questionable home remedies that might once have been called quackery, folk medicine, or fringe medicine now take shelter under the “alternative medicine” umbrella.

“There is no such thing as ‘alternative medicine.’ There is only medicine that has been tested and proven to work, and medicine that hasn’t,” Hall told Healthline. “Alternative medicine is a marketing term, not a scientific one.”

Natural isn’t always healthy

It’s common for people to think that “natural” means healthy.

But many natural things can kill you — asbestos, ionizing radiation from radon, poison hemlock, and deadly nightshade, just to name a few.

As surprising as it may seem, some herbal supplements sold in reputable natural food stores or pharmacies can also harm you, even at doses recommended on the package.

Supplements may be toxic all by themselves, contaminated with another compound that is toxic, or interact with prescription medications.

Despite the risk of dangerous interactions between supplements and medications, only about one-third of people tell their doctor about the supplements they’re taking, according to one study.

Children are especially at risk of poisoning from herbal or dietary supplements.

A study published this summer found that calls made to poison control centers across the country about herbal and dietary supplements increased almost 50 percent between 2005 and 2012.

MOM GETS JAIL OVER REFUSAL TO VACCINATE SON

Dietary supplements were the top reason for the calls, followed by herbal, hormonal, and other products.

Serious medical problems occurred in about 4 percent of these calls. Ninety-five percent of the serious cases were in children under 6 years old. The majority of these poisonings were unintentional.

One reason for the popularity of herbal supplements is that they’re easy to buy — no visit to the doctor or prescription needed. They’re the ultimate health DIY.

There’s also little government regulation of these products. If companies don’t make claims that their product can treat or cure a health condition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) won’t bother with them.

Until there’s a problem.

Last year, the FDA issued a warning that homeopathic baby teething tablets and gels may pose a risk to infants and children.

Homeopathic remedies are based on the idea that “like cures like.” Small amounts of substances — sometimes toxic — are used to cure symptoms that those substances would cause at higher doses.

The teething tablets contained the poisonous plant belladonna, except in higher amounts than listed on the label.

The FDA investigation turned up more than 400 reports of bad reactions to these products over the past six years. Reactions included tremor, fever, and shortness of breath.

In 10 cases, children died.

On top of the dangers of some homeopathic remedies, there’s little evidence that they’re effective treatments for any condition.

The United Kingdom’s National Health Service recently decided to stop using government funds to pay for homeopathic treatments.

The debate over homeopathy, though, isn’t just about a lack of clinical trials.

One guiding principal of homeopathy is that the more you dilute the active ingredient in water or alcohol, the greater the therapeutic benefit.

Critics say that for this to work, we’d have to radically change what we know about biology, physics, and chemistry.

“Homeopathy not only doesn’t work, but couldn’t possibly work,” said Hall.

Home remedies for cancer

Cancer has long been targeted by people promoting natural therapies.

One study estimates that use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by cancer patients in 18 countries rose from 25 percent in the 1970s to 49 percent after 2000. Use of these products was highest in the United States.

Another study found that herbal supplements were the most commonly used home remedy for cancer, followed by homeopathy, vitamin and mineral supplements, medicinal teas, spiritual therapies, and relaxation techniques.

One of the most popular therapies is Essiac tea, which has been promoted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s. This herbal blend contains burdock root, sheep sorrel herb, slippery elm bark, Turkish rhubarb root, and sometimes other ingredients.

Despite its long reputation as an anticancer remedy, no clinical trials of Essiac have been completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Unlike apricot kernel extract, the side effects of Essiac are less severe, but they do include nausea, vomiting, increased bowel movements, and slight headaches.

DIET OF LAMB AND CHEERIOS LEADS TO BOY'S VISION LOSS

Another home remedy for cancer is the Gerson method. It involves following a strict diet, drinking lots of fresh fruit and vegetable juices, taking dietary supplements, and giving yourself coffee enemas.

Although some studies on the Gerson method have been published, none were the rigorous randomized clinical trials that are needed to determine if this home remedy actually helps.

Three people have also died as a result of giving themselves coffee enemas. They can throw off your normal blood chemistry if you do them too often.

There are many more home remedies for treating cancer, with side effects ranging from minor to severe.

But even natural therapies for cancer that don’t kill you directly can still kill you.

In a study published earlier this year, Yale researchers looked at the survival rates of 840 patients with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer.

People who chose to use only alternative medicine treatments had a higher risk of dying compared to those who used conventional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or hormone therapy.

There’s also the fact that people spend a lot of money on unproven treatments.

According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 83 million adults spent almost $34 billion out-of-pocket on CAM therapies that year. This accounts for 1.5 percent of the total healthcare spending in the United States.

Why people turn to home remedies

One study found that people are more likely to use herbal supplements if they’re uninsured, use more prescription and over-the-counter medications, or have certain health conditions.

Other research has found higher herbal supplement use among women and people with a higher education.

Some of the most common conditions that people try to treat with herbs include colds, stomach or intestinal illnesses, and problems like rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis. These are all conditions that have few effective medical treatments available.

A person’s culture may also influence their use of CAM therapies. For example, botanical medicine is important to many indigenous cultures in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Chinese herbal medicine has been for centuries by Chinese people and Chinese-Americans.

These studies try to explain why people turn to home remedies in the first place.

ONE SHOT FOR ALL VACCINES? STUDY SHOWS PROMISE

But a bigger question is why people use home remedies that don’t have any scientific evidence showing that they’re effective.

The Australian man who developed cyanide poisoning from taking apricot kernel extract — a mix of a supplement he purchased and a brew he made at home — apparently had a “scientific background,” according to an anesthetist at the hospital where he was treated.

His doctors also warned the man about the risks of the extract, saying the cyanide was blocking the cells in his body from getting the oxygen they needed to survive.

He still refused to give up his daily ritual.

Our Paleo brains drive us

In a post on Skeptic, Hall suggests that human evolution has made it easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking that an herb might cure our cancer, that burning a candle in our ear could improve our overall health, or that a homeopathic remedy diluted almost to nothingness might help us have better sex.

First, our brains are designed to look for patterns, even if they’re wrong.

In our distant past, we reacted quickly if we saw a shadow that looked like a lion in the bushes. It’s better to see a pattern that isn’t there than to miss seeing a real lion.

We also tend to listen to what others tell us. If your friend says there are lions on the other side of the hill, often you’ll listen rather than do your own research.

Our emotions — especially fear — can also motivate us to act, such as running away as fast as we can from a lion.

While these traits helped us survive in a world without technology, they can get us into trouble today.

If a friend has a cold, takes an herbal supplement, and gets better, we might think the pill cured her. But the cold could’ve just as likely gone away on its own. Without clinical studies, we’re just guessing.

Or if you have a headache and your friend says, “I put three drops of lemon oil on my wrists and my headache went away,” you might give it a try. What the heck, right?

Or if you have cancer and you’re afraid of dying, you might try anything to get better — even if it’s never been shown to be effective in a clinical trial, doesn’t make any sense how it might work in the first place, or you have to shell out thousands of dollars at a clinic in another country for treatment.

Choosing treatments for your illness is complicated by research that suggests many published studies — yes, scientific studies — are wrong.

ZIKA VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN EARLY HUMAN TRIAL

Science isn’t infallible. But it is methodical and self-correcting. Over time, new studies either confirm past results or weed out the mistakes.

Not everyone has a strong background in science or clinical trials, so how are we supposed to decide which treatments work?

Hall offers what she calls her SkepDoc’s Rule.

“Before you accept any claim, try to find out who disagrees with it and why. That can be very illuminating,” she said.

Also, you can always ask your doctor for advice. But even with that, Hall suggests some level of skepticism.

In the suits, Altman claims that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.
Companies like Facebook and YouTube have interpreted that to mean they are not liable for what their users post on their sites.
“We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” the spokesperson said in an email.
“If we win just one of these cases it is going to be like an atomic bomb went off at these social media companies,” he said.","A lawyer who earned his degree through a correspondence course and works for a company called 1-800-LAW-FIRM may seem like an odd choice to lead a series of potentially precedent-setting lawsuits against some of the world’s most powerful social media companies.

But judging Keith Altman by his resume would be underestimating the 49-year-old lawyer and his quest to make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter and Google liable for allegedly providing “material support” to followers of terror groups who commit mass murder.

“These cases seem impossible but they can have a real impact,” Altman told Fox News. “This is about holding these companies accountable for allowing terrorists to radicalize people through social media channels.”

Altman’s ambitious effort to take on the social media giants has been dismissed by some legal experts but others say the lawsuits have potential to shake up the industry and force major changes.

Starting in June 2016 while representing the family of Nohemi Gonzalez – the only American killed during the 2015 Paris terror attacks – and drawing on his previous experience taking on pharmaceutical giants, Altman has filed six lawsuits to date. In the suits, Altman claims that Google, Facebook and Twitter have allowed their social media platforms to be used as a tool to recruit jihadists and that these companies have even profited from advertisements on terrorist propaganda.

Besides the Gonzalez family, Altman represents families of victims from terror attacks in Dallas, San Bernardino, Istanbul, Barcelona and those killed at during the shooting at the Orlando nightclub last June.

“I filed that suit at 5 p.m. and had my first date with my now fiancee an hour later,” Altman said. “For the first half of the date, I was being bombarded with calls from every news organization you can think of to make a comment.”

At the heart of all these lawsuits is the interpretation of a provision tucked deep inside the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 called Section 230.

The language of Section 230 states that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Companies like Facebook and YouTube have interpreted that to mean they are not liable for what their users post on their sites.

“Section 230 is a free pass to online service providers as long as they act only as a pass-through,” Mark Bartholomew, a professor at the University Of Buffalo School Of Law, told Fox News. “If you set up a place for people to talk, but don't communicate on it yourself, then you are basically immune from prosecution.”

Section 230 of the CDA was implemented to help protect social media sites in their nascent years. But Altman and others have begun to argue that social media sites may be violating the provision with their heavily guarded algorithms and that these companies have the resources to monitor any terror activity on their platforms.

Altman – who before going into law developed litigation support tools and trial presentation software – said that computer programs can be developed that can filter certain key words like jihad and ISIS, shut down suspicious accounts and look out for accounts that send out mass follow and friend requests – all telltale signs of terror propaganda.

“Give me a weekend and I could write programs that do all of these things and more,” he said. “So how can these guys say with a straight face that they can’t do it?”

A spokesperson for Facebook told Fox News that the social media site does not allow any terrorist activity on its website.

“We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our Community Standards make clear that there is no place on Facebook for groups that engage in terrorist activity or for content that expresses support for such activity, and we take swift action to remove this content when it’s reported to us.”

A representatives from Twitter told Fox News the company does not comment on pending legislation. Google did not immediately reply to Fox News’ request for comment.

Altman is realistic about his and his client’s chances of succeeding in court, but says the real battle is going to take place in appellate courts and possibly even the Supreme Court.

“If we win just one of these cases it is going to be like an atomic bomb went off at these social media companies,” he said.

Experts in social media law don’t disagree with Altman that a victory for any his clients would create a massive sea change in the tech world, but note that it will be a tough fight to get courts to rule against Section 230.

“It sounds like a good idea, but when you get down into the weeds it get complicated,” Thaddeus Hoffmeister, a law professor at the University of Dayton and author of “Social Media in the Courtroom: A New Era for Criminal Justice?” told Fox News.

Hoffmeister says questions like how to define terrorist activity, how far does the censorship go and how do you differentiate between domestic and international terrorism are just a few of the roadblocks that Altman’s lawsuits could run into.

Whether or not any of Altman’s lawsuits are successful, experts contend that, at the very least, they are bringing light to the issue and creating a conversation that might force companies to be held more accountable.

“When he starts rattling the saber, it makes companies take action and do something about it,” Hoffmeister said. “These lawsuits add fuel to the fire.”","Lawyer takes on Google, Facebook, Twitter over terror videos",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/06/lawyer-takes-on-google-facebook-twitter-over-terror-videos.html

I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower.
My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet.
I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own.
And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower.","My pop, a WWII veteran, devoted husband and the sort of father I aspire to be, didn’t raise no fools. Except me.

I know I’m a fool because back when I was 9 years old and sporting a flat top and a pair of black Converse All-Stars, my pop advised me that I was now taking over the lawn mower duties from one of my older brothers. That brother was being promoted to the job of painting the house for the summer. So, head room being what it is, Pop handed the keys to the mower to his youngest boy.

Actually, no keys were involved. The mower was an old Sears model. For those of you too young to know your American history, Sears was the Amazon of the 20th century. Anytime between 1893 and ’round about 1985, if you wanted pants, a dishwasher, football pads, a lava lamp or a reciprocating sprocket wrench with detachable sprockets, then by damn you got it at Sears.

The lawn mower I inherited as a 9-year-old that early summer afternoon was a late-’60s gas-powered Sears model my brothers called “Chopper.” Chopper ate anything that got too close to its massive rotating semi-sharp blades. It belched smoke as clumps of grass, rocks and half-chewed army men flew out from all sides. As a 9-year-old, I calculated Chopper’s weight to be somewhere between 160 pounds and a two-door Buick. It took all 85 pounds of me, and about three hours, to push that beast around our yard.

Now I know Pop raised a fool, because when he announced solemnly that Chopper was my responsibility, I looked him in the eye and said what I typically said back then: “Yes sir… you bet.” What I should have said was, “Pop, I don’t mean to tell you your business, but do you have any idea how dangerous lawn mowers are to kids?” And then I would have handed him a couple of articles detailing those dangers, and for good measure recited current regulations related to child labor laws and how he just might be in violation of said laws.

Yes sir, that’s what I should have done. I know that now because that’s what former New York Times labor reporter Steven Greenhouse recently suggested following the curious case of Frank the Amazing Mowing Boy.

By now you’ve likely heard the heartwarming tale of Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old kid from Virginia. Frank has himself a lawn mowing business. According to reliable sources, he charges $8 a lawn. I’m not that good at math, but I believe that’s approximately 8 clams more per yard than I made during my mowing career, so I think it’s safe to say that Frank is some kind of business genius.

Anyway, one day Frank reached out to the White House Office of Lawns and Shrubbery, which is overseen by the Department of Landscaping over at the Ministry of the Interior I believe, and said it would be his honor to mow the White House lawn. Apparently realizing the lawn in fact did need mowing, they reached out to Frank and Bob’s your uncle. I do not know if Frank was also tasked with picking up dog poop prior to mowing. That may well fall under a different department.

Bottom line, Frank got his wish, and by all accounts he did a very fine job mowing the White House lawn. President Trump came out to greet and thank him. In the video of the encounter, Frank almost looks too busy to stop and shake hands. Clearly he’s worried about keeping the mowing line straight. And to be honest, he probably had a couple more lawns to get to that day. And as if this story needed any more of a kick in the pants, Frank apparently told the president that when he grows up, he wants to be a Navy Seal.

I don’t know about you, but after my experience as a kid, and now as a father raising three young boys, I wanted to shake Frank’s hand and tell him well done, keep it up.

But then, Steven Greenhouse came along and rained on my freshly cut lawn. He sent out a tweet that read, in part: “Not sending a great signal on child labor, minimum wage & occupational safety.” Now there’s a good chance that all Mr. Greenhouse was doing was pointing out that children and lawn mowers can be a dangerous combination. He is, after all, a writer on a wide variety of labor topics.

I don’t believe he was making any statement about the need to teach kids responsibility and the value of hard work. I personally think he was sincere in thinking Frank needed to back away from the lawn mower. But, frankly, children and anything else can be a potentially dangerous combination. My boys Scooter, Sluggo and Muggsy could take a cantaloupe, two mini marshmallows and a feather duster and turn it into a deadly weapon. Just the other day, Muggsy broke his nose while using a cardboard tube as a pirate sword.

Given that I’m a bit of a cynical sort, there is also the chance that Mr. Greenhouse didn’t vote for the current president and saw this as an opportunity to creatively take a dig at him. My guess is that if this had taken place under former President Obama’s watch, Mr. Greenhouse would have refrained from said tweet. That’s just speculation, folks.

I also have no idea if Mr. Greenhouse has boys of his own. My research staff is off on another team-building exercise at an all-inclusive resort, and I can’t remember the Wi-Fi password in the office. And I have no idea if he owns a lawn mower. If he resides in New York City, another fact I can’t be bothered to check, there’s a good chance that he has limited experience with yard implements.

What’s my point? When I started writing, I was going to take an easy potshot at Mr. Greenhouse and talk about how we all spend way too much time coddling our kids and trying to reduce life’s risks down to zero, and how mowing lawns teaches kids responsibility and the value of hard work. But Mr. Greenhouse has already been lambasted for his tweet in social media circles … and I don’t have the energy to leap on that dog pile.

Speaking of dog piles, I can look out my kitchen window and see my boy Scooter picking up after our dog Hendricks in the back yard. Scoot’s only 10, but sitting inside the garage is a gas-powered mower with fairly dull blades, and it’s now become his responsibility.

Not to worry, Mr. Greenhouse, I gave him a safety briefing… told him to watch out for flying rocks and chewed-up action figures, advised him not to stick his fingers where they don’t belong and, when pushing it up hill, don’t let it roll back on you. It was the same briefing I got from my pop. Scooter listened attentively, and I’m proud to say his response was, “You bet.” He’ll be just fine.","Frank, the lawnmower boy, still has liberals all worked up.

This is the right call, because decertification is the indispensable first step toward fixing a deeply flawed agreement that puts Iran on the path to becoming another North Korea.

Decertifying the deal, which was designed to limit Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons for over a decade in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, does not mean pulling out of the agreement. If President Trump refuses to certify by the Oct. 15 deadline, Congress could reimpose sanctions, but it should first give the White House a chance to negotiate a better deal.

The nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 by President Obama’s administration and the governments of Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement prohibits the U.S. from reimposing the original sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, but does not rule out tough sanctions on Iranian entities responsible for terrorism, missile development, regional aggression, corruption and human rights violations. These kinds of sanctions could exert the pressure necessary to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.

This kind of pressure could work because Iran does not want to give up the extraordinary economic benefits delivered by the nuclear deal. While attention has justifiably focused on how the nuclear deal has failed to stop Iran from launching nuclear-capable missiles or blocking U.N. inspectors access to military research facilities, Americans should also focus on the perpetual windfall the deal gives Tehran.

Iranian income from oil and natural gas exports increased by $24 billion, or 70 percent, in the first full year after the nuclear deal went into effect. The International Monetary Fund projects that energy exports will continue to grow steadily during the next five years, providing Tehran with $174 billion more of oil revenue than it would have earned if sanctions remained in place.

This windfall should not surprise anyone, although it may come as news to senior Obama administration officials who insist that the deal is not providing Tehran with the means to promote its agenda of terrorism and aggression throughout the Middle East.

According to Adam Szubin, who served as undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence during the final years of the Obama administration: “There are, to be sure, benefits to Iran for staying in the deal, but those benefits will take years to accrue. And contrary to the warning, Iran’s client Hezbollah has been under unprecedented financial pressure.”

Szubin’s opinions, contained in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post, command respect even among critics of the nuclear deal, because he was a leading architect of the comprehensive sanctions regime that put so much pressure on Iran. Though he has deep first-hand knowledge of this subject, in this instance the data and the facts tell a very different story.

As noted above, Iranian oil and gas exports began to surge immediately after sanctions were lifted. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil exports increased from 1.4 million barrels per day to 2.4 million in the first full year after the nuclear deal took effect.

Since oil drives the Iranian economy, this surge in exports translated into impressive overall growth of 6.6 percent. In sharp contrast, Iran’s economy shrank by 1.8 percent prior to the implementation of the nuclear deal and by 6.6 percent when sanctions were biting hardest in 2012. The World Bank reported a similar reversal of fortune. Moreover, both organizations project Iranian economic growth to be close to 4 percent this year and then stay above 4 percent for several years to come.

The economic benefits that followed the implementation of the nuclear deal also included lower Iranian inflation, which peaked near 35 percent in 2013 yet has now fallen to single digits, according to World Bank figures. In addition, Iran’s currency went into freefall as a result of sanctions pressure, but stabilized after the beginning of the negotiations that led to the nuclear deal.

Szubin does not acknowledge any of these extraordinary benefits. Instead he writes that Iranian gross domestic product (GDP) will still be 35 percent lower in 2017 than it was in 2011, thereby suggesting that Iran is nowhere close to recovering from the damage imposed by sanctions.

Arriving at this figure of a 35 percent decline requires some creative use of statistics. There are several ways to measure GDP, but Szubin chooses the only one that shows this kind of sharp contraction. Also, 2011 is a misleading year to use as the baseline for measuring changes in GDP, since oil prices shot up to an average of $108 per barrel that year, supercharging every oil- dependent economy. Had he used 2009 or 2010 as a baseline, there would be little or no decline to speak of.

In addition, Szubin understates by tens of billions of dollars the value of frozen assets released to Iran upon implementation of the nuclear. Whereas he offers a figure of $50 billion, a 2015 study by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that this estimate is far too low, because of its narrow focus on liquid assets. A broader look at Tehran’s foreign holdings shows that it gained access to somewhere between $90 billion and $120 billion – a remarkable infusion for a $400 billion economy.

Szubin also asserts, without providing data, that the terrorist group Hezbollah is “under unprecedented financial pressure.” A new study of Hezbollah’s finances, also by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, reaches a very different conclusion.

Our study reports that Iranian support for Hezbollah fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, “likely due to international sanctions and low oil prices.” Yet even though oil prices remained low following the implementation of the nuclear deal, Iranian assistance returned to its previous level of about $700 million to $800 million per year, or 70 to 80 percent of Hezbollah’s estimated budget. It seems Iran has money to spare.

In light of the extraordinary economic benefits Iran has received from the nuclear agreement, it is certainly a good deal for Tehran. But it is getting harder and harder to see how anyone can look at the facts and serenely insist that this is also a good deal for the United States.

Not long ago, “interest-based advertising” creeped out a lot of people who couldn’t understand why Facebook, for example, knew what they had just shopped for on Amazon. The truth is that personalized ads are the result of a very impersonal process.

Interest-based advertising crunches bits of data gathered from your browser to make marketing more efficient. Special algorithms analyze your visits over time and across different websites, making it possible to predict your preferences and show ads that are likely to interest you.

But sometimes, all this tracking can be overwhelming. While the process is basically automatic and unmanned, interest-based ads can feel like an invasion of privacy. That’s why many people look for ways to throw the trackers off their scent.

Here are three simple ways to do just that.

1. Wipe out history, turn off cookies

To start, you’ll want a clean slate. You should eliminate any trace of your past searches by clearing all the browsing data, history, cache and cookies from your web browsers.

Next, disable or limit tracking on your gadget, including on favorite services like Facebook. If you’re not sure how how to do this, click here for the steps to wipe out where you’ve been and what you’ve done. Next, make sure to delete third-party advertising cookies. Click here to learn how to remove them and prevent them from coming back.

When you’re finished, take a moment to test your browser with an online security and privacy checker. I like the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s tool that shows you the information about the browser you’re using and your risk level. Click here for the free download and more details.

2. Opt out of ads

You may notice only a handful of culprits, but many companies use algorithms to track your behavior and send you targeted ads.

Thankfully, there’s a way for you to opt out of interest-based, or “behavioral,” ads. The Digital Advertising Alliance lets you review its participating partners. When you first visit the DAA, the websites will scan your computer. Once the scan is complete, you’ll be shown a list of partners advertising directly to you.

From there, you can learn more about the practices these companies use for interest-based ads. You can opt out using “opt-out cookies” that are stored in your browser with your preferences.

Click here for the steps to opt-out of this form of online targeted advertising.

3. Go incognito

Every major web browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera — has private, or incognito, browsing. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies, including ad-tracking cookies, and your computer won’t record your browsing history. It’s almost like you were never online.

When your browser is in private browsing mode, it will show a special icon. In Firefox, it’s a mask; in Chrome, it’s a little spy; in Edge, it’s “InPrivate.” These all indicate that you’re in incognito or private mode.

Private browsing will keep your computer safe from casual snoopers. Someone who jumps on your computer won’t see where you’ve been.

Keep in mind that online ads aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Yes, they can annoy us, but they’re also the reason most online content is free. Without them, media outlets and content creators would have to find a different source of revenue. For most of us, seeing a few presumptuous ads is a tiny price to pay.

He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:“It was a very beautiful day,” he says.
Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority.
Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.
“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.","When Minneapolis entrepreneur Tashitaa Tufaa came to the United States from his native Ethiopia he quickly embodied the American spirit.

The political refugee, now in his late 40s, came to this country in 1992 with nothing to his name and worked his way up from washing dishes to running his own transportation company that still continues to grow.

Tufaa says that his drive was inspired by his adopted home.

“I had read a lot about America,” he said in a recent interview with Fox News. “Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way.”

Tuftaa was born in the Ethiopian village of Aloo and grew up working on his family’s farm with his 13 siblings until he attended an American college in Zimbabwe. He eventually returned to Ethiopia, where he was a history and English teacher until the early 90s when he decided to leave due to his native country’s changing political climate.

“I wasn’t forced to leave my country,” he says. “I just knew that it was time to leave when I saw politicians fleeing. I knew it wasn’t safe. I came here and decided not to go back.”

“Even though I had never been, I have always been a fan of the American way...” - Tashitaa Tufaa

He was granted political asylum and wound up in the city of Minneapolis, where he stayed in low-income housing with old college friends who had emigrated from Zimbabwe. He recalls the first day he stepped on American soil:

“It was a very beautiful day,” he says. “I was in downtown Minneapolis. I was amazed by the tall buildings and how clean it was compared to where I came from.”

Tufaa says that during those initial days in the U.S. it was difficult to find a job, but he never once thought about wavering.

“It was definitely hard. If you wanted a white-collar job, there were not many available,” he says. “My first job was as a dishwasher at the Minneapolis Hilton for $5.60 an hour and I thought at the time that it was great.”

Tufaa washed dishes for about ten months before moving on to a manufacturing job and a security position before enrolling in graduate school at the University of Minnesota. He continued working security jobs as he went through school.

“I would work until midnight and during the day in between my morning and afternoon classes,” he recalled. “I had few hours to sleep, but the biggest thing was these opportunities for work. We were not able to get this back home. You were lucky if you were able to get one job, here, I could get three jobs.”

Tufaa eventually graduated from school and wanted to pursue a career as a diplomat but quickly found out that he would have to be a U.S. citizen to do so (he became a citizen in 2000). Instead, he started working for the Minneapolis School District and then the city’s housing authority. He also worked extra jobs as a taxi and bus driver.

“I would leave work at 4:30 and then go drive a bus,” he says.

In 2003, he was laid off from his job with the city.

“That’s when I decided to form my own company.”

The determined Tufaa set out to market himself to school districts in the area, looking to provide transportation services for students.

“It was rough building it up,” the entrepreneur said. “On paper, my company was incorporated, but technically, I had no experience. People generally don’t trust you if you can’t show them your experience.”

In September of that year, Tufaa finally started gaining that experience when he started providing bus services to a handful of special needs students. School administrators took notice of the stellar job he did and he started receiving more and more work from the district, putting nearly all of his profits back into the business.

Eventually, Tufaa was able to establish his company, Metropolitan Transportation Network (MetroTN) and soon after he received his first large contract with the Beacon Academy School after their original bus provider went out of business mid-year. About 300 of the school’s 400 plus students ride MetroTN buses to this day.

Business continued to grow for Tufaa and MetroTN now boasts three facilities in the state, with a fourth on the way in October. The company currently includes 300 employees, including several family members who also emigrated from Ethiopia.

“They had to apply like everyone else,” he says, half-joking.

Along the way, Tufaa maried and he and his wife have five children ranging in age from eight to 21.

He looks to continue the expansion of MetroTN and serve other facets of public transportation in the city he has called home for nearly 25 years.

“I believe in the American dream because I appreciate what this country can provide to people like me,” Tufaa says.

Although it's not a kingdom now, Serbia has hosted a wedding for dethroned royals.

Prince Philip Karadjordjevic, of the dethroned Serbian royals, married Danica Marinkovic on Saturday in a ceremony at Belgrade's main cathedral.

The wedding was performed by the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Irinej, and attended by many public figures. Dozens gathered outside the church on a sunny but chilly autumn day.

Philip is one of the sons of Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, the heir to Serbia's now-defunct throne. The royal family ruled Yugoslavia until communists took power after World War II and abolished the monarchy. Exiled during WWII, the family returned to Serbia after 2000.

This is the right call, because decertification is the indispensable first step toward fixing a deeply flawed agreement that puts Iran on the path to becoming another North Korea.

Decertifying the deal, which was designed to limit Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons for over a decade in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, does not mean pulling out of the agreement. If President Trump refuses to certify by the Oct. 15 deadline, Congress could reimpose sanctions, but it should first give the White House a chance to negotiate a better deal.

The nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 by President Obama’s administration and the governments of Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. The agreement prohibits the U.S. from reimposing the original sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, but does not rule out tough sanctions on Iranian entities responsible for terrorism, missile development, regional aggression, corruption and human rights violations. These kinds of sanctions could exert the pressure necessary to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.

This kind of pressure could work because Iran does not want to give up the extraordinary economic benefits delivered by the nuclear deal. While attention has justifiably focused on how the nuclear deal has failed to stop Iran from launching nuclear-capable missiles or blocking U.N. inspectors access to military research facilities, Americans should also focus on the perpetual windfall the deal gives Tehran.

Iranian income from oil and natural gas exports increased by $24 billion, or 70 percent, in the first full year after the nuclear deal went into effect. The International Monetary Fund projects that energy exports will continue to grow steadily during the next five years, providing Tehran with $174 billion more of oil revenue than it would have earned if sanctions remained in place.

This windfall should not surprise anyone, although it may come as news to senior Obama administration officials who insist that the deal is not providing Tehran with the means to promote its agenda of terrorism and aggression throughout the Middle East.

According to Adam Szubin, who served as undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence during the final years of the Obama administration: “There are, to be sure, benefits to Iran for staying in the deal, but those benefits will take years to accrue. And contrary to the warning, Iran’s client Hezbollah has been under unprecedented financial pressure.”

Szubin’s opinions, contained in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post, command respect even among critics of the nuclear deal, because he was a leading architect of the comprehensive sanctions regime that put so much pressure on Iran. Though he has deep first-hand knowledge of this subject, in this instance the data and the facts tell a very different story.

As noted above, Iranian oil and gas exports began to surge immediately after sanctions were lifted. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil exports increased from 1.4 million barrels per day to 2.4 million in the first full year after the nuclear deal took effect.

Since oil drives the Iranian economy, this surge in exports translated into impressive overall growth of 6.6 percent. In sharp contrast, Iran’s economy shrank by 1.8 percent prior to the implementation of the nuclear deal and by 6.6 percent when sanctions were biting hardest in 2012. The World Bank reported a similar reversal of fortune. Moreover, both organizations project Iranian economic growth to be close to 4 percent this year and then stay above 4 percent for several years to come.

The economic benefits that followed the implementation of the nuclear deal also included lower Iranian inflation, which peaked near 35 percent in 2013 yet has now fallen to single digits, according to World Bank figures. In addition, Iran’s currency went into freefall as a result of sanctions pressure, but stabilized after the beginning of the negotiations that led to the nuclear deal.

Szubin does not acknowledge any of these extraordinary benefits. Instead he writes that Iranian gross domestic product (GDP) will still be 35 percent lower in 2017 than it was in 2011, thereby suggesting that Iran is nowhere close to recovering from the damage imposed by sanctions.

Arriving at this figure of a 35 percent decline requires some creative use of statistics. There are several ways to measure GDP, but Szubin chooses the only one that shows this kind of sharp contraction. Also, 2011 is a misleading year to use as the baseline for measuring changes in GDP, since oil prices shot up to an average of $108 per barrel that year, supercharging every oil- dependent economy. Had he used 2009 or 2010 as a baseline, there would be little or no decline to speak of.

In addition, Szubin understates by tens of billions of dollars the value of frozen assets released to Iran upon implementation of the nuclear. Whereas he offers a figure of $50 billion, a 2015 study by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies shows that this estimate is far too low, because of its narrow focus on liquid assets. A broader look at Tehran’s foreign holdings shows that it gained access to somewhere between $90 billion and $120 billion – a remarkable infusion for a $400 billion economy.

Szubin also asserts, without providing data, that the terrorist group Hezbollah is “under unprecedented financial pressure.” A new study of Hezbollah’s finances, also by our colleagues at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, reaches a very different conclusion.

Our study reports that Iranian support for Hezbollah fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, “likely due to international sanctions and low oil prices.” Yet even though oil prices remained low following the implementation of the nuclear deal, Iranian assistance returned to its previous level of about $700 million to $800 million per year, or 70 to 80 percent of Hezbollah’s estimated budget. It seems Iran has money to spare.

In light of the extraordinary economic benefits Iran has received from the nuclear agreement, it is certainly a good deal for Tehran. But it is getting harder and harder to see how anyone can look at the facts and serenely insist that this is also a good deal for the United States.

Different cabinet surfaces require different cleaning techniques. Whether your cabinets are stained, painted or laminate, they all need special attention. Here are a few easy tips and cleaning recipes for keeping them looking their best.

Stained wood cabinets. You will want to thoroughly clean and oil your stained wood cabinets once or twice a year. Clean them with a mixture of seven-eighths distilled white vinegar and one-eighth rubbing alcohol, with a few drops of dish soap added. Wipe the cabinets down with this cleaning mixture using a microfiber cloth. Next, rinse the cabinets completely with warm water then use a furniture oil that contains beeswax to seal the finish. This process will keep your cabinets looking new for a long time.

Painted cabinets. Painted cabinets need to be cleaned with a gentle cleaner, rinsed and dried. If you use a harsh cleaner on the painted surface, the cleaner can actually remove the paint.

Instead, mix up a DIY cleaner of distilled white vinegar and a few drops of dish soap, but this time leave out the rubbing alcohol. Try putting this mixture into a spray bottle to better control the amount. After spraying, wipe the cabinets down with a damp microfiber cloth. Finally, use another clean microfiber cloth to dry.

Black cabinets. Whether painted black or stained ebony, black cabinets create a chic look in a kitchen, but they do take some extra care. Every water and grease spot will show up on these cabinets as will an accumulation of dust. You should get into a routine of wiping them down at least once a week with a damp microfiber cloth. It will only take a few minutes but doing this will prevent nasty buildup.

White cabinets. White cabinets provide a fresh, clean look to many a kitchen, but they also show every fingerprint and scrape. Just like black cabinets, white ones should be wiped at least once a week with a damp microfiber cloth. You should also have a small bottle of matching white paint on hand to fix chips and scrapes that are bound to show up with white cabinets.

Laminate cabinets. Laminate cabinets are the easiest to keep clean because their surface doesn’t have porous wood grains that absorb dirt and grease. A damp microfiber cloth and minimal elbow grease once a week usually does the trick.

For deeper cleaning, the same DIY cleaner for stained wood cabinets will do the trick. Vinegar is a natural acid and will work to lift off stuck-on food. The alcohol cuts through grease and oil. And the few drops of dish soap help to create a mild lather for easier cleaning.

Get a handle on it. Areas around handles can get very sticky. The oils from your hands can mix with the finish on your wood and break down the finish. You can prevent this from happening by wiping the areas around the handles with a damp microfiber cloth. If you get that sticky buildup, you can wash it off with a gentle hand soap mixed with some rubbing alcohol.

To really get at hidden grime, it is recommended that you remove your pulls and knobs at least once a year and clean the fronts of your cabinets before putting handles back on.

RELATED: Don’t Forget to Wipe Down and Clean Your Kitchen Gadgets Too

Nooks and crannies. Cabinets with nooks and crannies need extra care to remove dirt, dust and buildup in those tight places. You can use a microfiber cloth wrapped around a table knife to get into flat areas that need to be cleaned. While a pointed knife will also work, just be careful it doesn’t penetrate the cloth and scratch or nick the wood. A toothpick will also work for tight corners and small crevices.

Around the stove. Cabinets around your stove can get spattered with grease and oil. You can clean them quickly with a spray bottle of vodka and a few drops of Castile soap. The vodka will work to cut through the grease and oil, while the soap will lift it away.

“My instincts told me that Donald was smart and funny,” Ivana Trump writes.","“I have a perfect life.” -- That’s how Ivana Trump, the first wife of President Donald Trump, sums up her current situation, 25 years after their messy, highly publicized divorce.

These days, Ivana writes in her new memoir, “Raising Trump,” she enjoys regular conversations with her ex, and has nothing but praise for their three children.

In fact, the proud mother writes that she wouldn’t be surprised if at least one more Trump occupies the White House in the years to come – daughter Ivanka.

“Maybe in fifteen years, she could run for president?” Ivana Trump writes, while also considering what her own title would be.

“First Lady? Holds no appeal for me personally,” she writes. “First Mother? That could work.”

Ivana Trump’s seeming contentment with the way her life has turned out might not have been predictable in 1992, the year of her infamous split from the man she famously nicknamed “The Donald.”

In the book – an early copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press -- Ivana writes that she knew her marriage was doomed not long after a day in December 1989.

""This young blonde woman approached me out of the blue and said ‘I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?’”



“I said ‘Get lost. I love my husband.’ It was unladylike but I was in shock.”

Donald Trump’s public affair with Marla Maples spawned the infamous ""Best Sex I've Ever Had"" headline in the New York Post in 1990. After divorcing Ivana Trump, the future president married Maples in 1993.

""Raising Trump"" is set to be released next week.

In the book, Ivana writes glowingly about her marriage to Trump and her prominent role at the Trump Organization. But then she unburdens herself about the heartache that Trump's affair with Maples caused her and the couple's three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.

She says Donald Jr. didn't speak to his father for a year after the split.

“I can only shake my head at how it insane it was,"" Ivana Trump writes. ""I couldn't turn on the television without hearing my name.”

But she and the president have returned to far warmer terms. She writes that they speak about once a week and that she encourages him to keep using Twitter.

Much of the book is spent recounting Ivana Trump's childhood in Europe, her burgeoning modeling career in New York and Trump's courtship. She writes that, at their first meeting, Trump secured her and friends a table at a hot Manhattan restaurant, paid the check and chauffeured her back to her hotel in a giant Cadillac.

“My instincts told me that Donald was smart and funny,” Ivana Trump writes. “An all-America good guy.”

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

Woods was a Hollywood favorite -- and a Democrat -- until at least 1998, when he broke ranks with the party after former President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

He said on Twitter that he switched parties because of his disgust with the former president.

""Every single #Democrat without exception stood behind a convicted perjurer,"" he wrote on Twitter this summer. ""That was the end.""

His luck in Hollywood turned sour soon after he became a Republican. He has not had a major role in a film in at least a decade.

The news of his retirement was included in a press release issued by Woods' real estate agent offering Woods' Rhode Island lake house for sale.

Allen Gammons said Friday that Woods is 70 and wants to relax. He says the actor's brother and mother recently died, and he hopes to spend more time on passions including photography, antiquing and poker.

Gammons said Woods' decision was not political.

The announcement comes after Woods was in a Twitter feud with actress Amber Tamblyn, who last month accused him of trying to pick her up when she was 16. Woods called it a lie. Gammons said Woods declined to comment Friday when asked about Tamblyn's accusation.

Woods has said there are many conservative stars who didn’t speak up because “the blacklist against conservatives in Hollywood is very real.”

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

A staff writer with Deadspin reported that the public information officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department told him to stop calling regarding the defecating female jogger whose story went viral in September.

However, Lt. Howard Black told Fox News on Wednesday that it’s “absurd” that anyone would be discouraged from calling the department about a story and an incident.

“There is no update. I am just not going to be doing interviews,” he added. “Our concern is that this individual be identified.”

Black said that while he understands the bathroom humor behind the story, he wants to determine if the female jogger has mental health issues and, if so, get her any help she needs.

The story of the so-called “Mad Pooper” went viral last month when Cathy Budde told police an unidentified woman had been defecating in front of her house for at least seven weeks.

Budde told KKTV at the time that her children even caught the jogger squatting with her pants down in front of the house.

The body parts and clothing were found Friday in plastic bags with a knife and “heavy metal pieces” to make them sink near where the 30-year-old Wall's naked headless torso was found in August, Copenhagen police investigator Jens Moeller Jensen said.

The discovery was made in Koge Bay by members of the Danish navy, Reuters reported.

Moeller Jensen said there were no fractures to Wall's skull and he declined to comment on the discovery of the knife.

Peter Madsen, the 46-year-old Danish inventor who is in pre-trial detention on preliminary manslaughter charges, has said Wall died after being accidentally hit by a 155-pound hatch on the UC3 Nautillus submarine, after which he ""buried"" her at sea.

But police have said 15 stab wounds were found on the torso found at sea off Copenhagen on Aug. 21. Her arms were still missing.

Wall's cause of death hasn't yet been established yet.

The detention of Madsen, who has denied manslaughter, expires Oct. 31 when a court will decide if he will continue to remain in custody ahead of a possible trial. He is also held on preliminary charges of the indecent handling of a corpse.

Police have said the submarine only sailed in Danish waters Aug. 10-11.

The change announced Thursday affects most of Netflix's 53 million U.S. subscribers.

WHAT GOES UP

Netflix will now charge $11 per month instead of $10 for a plan that includes HD and allows up people to simultaneously watch programs on two different internet-connected devices.

The price for another plan that includes ultra-high definition, or 4K, video, is going up by 17 percent, to $14 from $12 a month. A plan that limits subscribers to one screen at a time without high-definition will remain at $8 a month.

The increase would be the first in two years for Netflix, although it won't seem that way for millions of subscribers. That's because Netflix temporarily froze its rates for long-time subscribers the last two times it raised its prices, delaying the most recent increases until the second half of last year for them.

Netflix isn't giving anyone a break this time around. It will start emailing notifications about the new prices to affected subscribers Oct. 19, giving them 30 days to accept the higher rates, switch to a cheaper plan or cancel the service.

WHY PRICES ARE RISING

The price increase are being driven by Netflix's desire to fatten its profit margins as it spends more money to finance a critically acclaimed slate of original programming that includes shows such as ""House of Cards,"" ''Orange Is The New Black,"" ''Stranger Things,"" and ""The Crown.""

Those series' success helped Netflix land more Emmy award nominations than any TV network besides HBO this year. It's also the main reason Netflix's U.S. audience has nearly doubled since the February 2013 debut of ""House of Cards"" kicked off its expansion into original programming.

But paying for exclusive TV series and films hasn't been cheap. Netflix expects to spend $6 billion a year alone on programming this year, and the expenses are likely to rise as it competes against streaming rivals such as Amazon, Hulu, YouTube and, potentially, Apple for the rights to future shows and movies.

Both Amazon (at $99 per year, or about $8.25 per month) and Hulu ($10 per month) now offer lower prices than Netflix.

POSSIBILITY OF BACKLASH

Netflix believes its price rate is justified by recent service improvements, such as a feature that allows people to download shows onto phones or other devices to watch them offline.

But Netflix subscribers have rebelled against price increases in the past, most notably in 2011 when the company stopped bundling its streaming service with its DVD-by-mail service, resulting in price increases of as much as 60 percent for customers who wanted both plans. Netflix lost 600,000 subscribers and its stock price plummeted by 80 percent in the subsequent backlash. The company rebounded strongly, though, propelling its stock from a split-adjusted low of $7.54 in 2012 to about $184 now.

And Netflix blamed a temporary slowdown in subscriber growth last year on the lifting of its price freeze on long-time customers who decided to drop the service rather than pay slightly more money.

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Wedbush believes less than 10 percent of current subscribers will cancel Netflix as price rise again, but he predicts it will be tougher to attract new customers who will choose cheaper alternatives from Amazon or Hulu.",Netflix raising prices in the U.S. for the first time in two years,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/05/netflix-raising-prices-in-u-s-for-first-time-in-two-years.html

In other words, they need us to be Christians...Second, pray for the victims, for civic leaders and for Las Vegas churches.
The Las Vegas shootings are no exception, with the #ThoughtsAndPrayers hashtag trending in a negative way after the shootings.
They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy.
So, let’s remind the world that even—and especially—when it seems like the world is falling apart, Christ is present with us.","On Sunday night a shooter rained gunfire on 22,000 music fans along the Las Vegas Strip. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, fired from the 32nd floor of a Mandalay Bay Resort hotel, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500 others. Paddock’s motives are unknown.

In the face of horrors like this, we want refuge, comfort, answers, solutions. We want to know who the shooter is and why he did it. We want to know where God is in the midst of such evil. We want to know what we could have done to stop this evil act.

Most importantly, we want to know what we should do in response. Let me suggest five things we can do as we are processing this tragedy.

First, we should weep with those who weep. When Jesus stood by Lazarus’ grave with Mary and Martha, he wept. He mourned the loss of Lazarus’ life and expressed sympathy for his loved ones. Similarly, we should mourn. We should express genuine love and concern, opening ourselves up to experience some of the sadness and grief experienced by the victims and their families.

Sit with people. Cry with them. Express sympathy for them. Take a moment to reflect on the horror of sin. Say to the person next to you, “I don’t know why this happened, but God is present with us even when we can’t see him, even in the midst of a tragedy like this. And we are promised that he will return one day to make things right, to rid the world of sin and its consequences.”

During a time like this, people need to know that life is not a meaningless chaos. They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy. In other words, they need us to be Christians...

Second, pray for the victims, for civic leaders and for Las Vegas churches. Several times this year, social media flash mobs mocked evangelicals for saying we would pray in the aftermath shootings or other harrowing events. In their view, our tweets about prayer were simply a means of circumventing difficult issues instead of acting upon them. The Las Vegas shootings are no exception, with the #ThoughtsAndPrayers hashtag trending in a negative way after the shootings.

For our part, however, we’d turn the criticism around and say that prayer is a more powerful form of activism than social media flash mobbing. Our obedience to the biblical command to pray for our society is more important than the sum total of our Tweets or opinion pieces. So, as Ed Stetzer wrote this week, let’s determine to pray for the civic leaders, churches, and charities who are serving victims, family members, and communities in the aftermath of this horror.

Third, reject the speculations of self-appointed prophets. Often our neighbors and Facebook friends will reach out to us during moments like this, looking for a theological explanation or wanting to justify God’s goodness in light of such a horror. But the Bible doesn’t give easy or neat answers, so we shouldn’t either. We don’t know why God intervenes to stop some tragedies but doesn’t intervene in others. For that matter, we don’t know whether or not he intervened in this particular tragedy. What we do know is that God doesn’t sin but people do. Let’s stick to what we know.

We should be especially careful to dismiss the speculations of self-appointed prophets. It never fails that, after a terror act or natural disaster, some Christian leader will claim that the event is God’s judgment on a particular individual or nation or political faction. Yet, as Russell Moore wrote yesterday, “Jesus told us specifically not to do this, after his disciples asked whether a man’s blindness was the result of his or his parents’ sin. Jesus said no to both (Jn. 9:1-12). Those self-appointed prophets who would blame the victims for what befalls them are just that, self-appointed. We should listen to Jesus and to his apostles, not to them.”

Fourth, don’t try to score political points. Inevitably in the aftermath of terror incidents, political partisans try to score points. Let’s resist the temptation to join them in capitalizing on the tragedy. The time will come for debates about gun control and gun rights. But the week of the tragedy is not that time. So, during this time of mourning, let’s refuse to take cheap shots at people on the other side of the aisle whose policy views you think are harmful or foolish.

Fifth, point people to the day when Christ will return to make things right. During a time like this, people need to know that life is not a meaningless chaos. They need to know that God is at work even during a time of tragedy. In other words, they need us to be Christians, to be people who remind the world that God has promised to return one day to make things right.

As He told his disciples immediately after having been beaten, stabbed, and crucified, “I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Mt. 28:20).

So, let’s remind the world that even—and especially—when it seems like the world is falling apart, Christ is present with us. And not only is he with us now, but he will be with us in the future when he returns to rid the world of tragedy once and for all.","Christians, here are five ways to respond to the Las Vegas shootings",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/06/christians-here-are-five-ways-to-respond-to-las-vegas-shootings.html

The Democrat has accepted an invitation to join Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which borders Washington D.C., a member confirmed to Fox News.

Club members received a letter from its president, John Williams, this week informing them of Obama’s decision, the member said.

Secret Service agents were recently seen scoping out the property, according to the member. Obama has played on the course before, including with ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser.

The initiation fee for an active full golf member at Columbia Country Club is $80,000, with annual dues of $6,300, according to a document posted online.

MAN ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING GREENS AT 4 TRUMP GOLF COURSES

The course is not far from the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington where the Obamas purchased an $8.1 million home after moving out of the White House earlier this year. The president has said the family intends to stay in Washington until his youngest daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school.

Washingtonian Magazine first reported Obama’s invitation to join Columbia Country Club.

“Since 1898, Columbia has been a special place and has earned a tremendous reputation for everything from its championship golf course to its first class dining facilities to an unparalleled social fabric,” the club’s website states. “Columbia is not easy to capture in words or pictures. Its magic is more about how the people make you feel.”

Obama routinely played golf throughout his presidency, including regularly at the course at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington.

There’s been much speculation about which private course the president would join. He was thought to have been considering Woodmont Country Club, a predominantly Jewish club in Rockville, Maryland, but some members protested him joining the club over his stance towards Israel.

He has also joined the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Virginia.

Last week, VX-tainted evidence from Kim Jong Nam's body and clothing was presented in court in sealed transparent bags.
During the week's four trial sessions, prosecutors sought to reconstruct Kim's final moments at the airport, establish that VX killed him and provide evidence linking VX to the two suspects.
Raja also confirmed that he found VX on Kim's face, eyes, clothing, and in his blood and urine samples.
Raja, the eighth witness to take the stand, is to be cross-examined by defense lawyers on Monday after the lab visit.","The trial of two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader enters its second week with the court moving temporarily Monday to a high-security laboratory to view evidence tainted with the toxic VX nerve agent.

High Court Judge Azmi Ariffin declared that prosecutors and defense lawyers, along with the two suspects, will hold court at the laboratory for chemical weapons analysis to examine samples of the women's clothing before they are formally submitted as evidence.

The decision came after government chemist Raja Subramaniam told the court that VX found on the clothing may still be active.

Such a move is not unusual in criminal cases in Malaysia, where judges often visit crime scenes.

Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, lawyer for Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong, told The Associated Press that the visit to Raja's lab is purely for safety reasons. He said the concept of holding a formal court session at the lab is to legalize the visit, which is expected to take an hour, after which the trial will resume in the court building.

Huong and Siti Aisyah of Indonesia pleaded not guilty at the start of their trial last week to charges of murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing VX on his face at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13. They face a mandatory death sentence if convicted. Defense lawyers have said the women were duped by suspected North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden TV-camera show.

VX is banned by an international treaty as a weapon of mass destruction but is believed to be part of North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal.

Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea's dynastic rulers but was believed to have been cast out by his father and had lived abroad for years. He reportedly never met current leader Kim Jong Un, who is widely believed to have perceived his older sibling as a threat and targeted him for assassination.

Last week, VX-tainted evidence from Kim Jong Nam's body and clothing was presented in court in sealed transparent bags. It was not removed from the bags, but the judge and court officials wore surgical masks and gloves as a safety precaution.

During the week's four trial sessions, prosecutors sought to reconstruct Kim's final moments at the airport, establish that VX killed him and provide evidence linking VX to the two suspects.

Raja, who is the only Malaysian with a doctorate in chemical weapons analysis, testified he found traces of VX on Huong's white sweater and fingernail clippings, and on Aisyah's sleeveless T-shirt. Huong was seen on airport surveillance videos wearing a sweater emblazoned with big black letters reading ""LOL,"" the acronym for ""laughing out loud.""

Raja also confirmed that he found VX on Kim's face, eyes, clothing, and in his blood and urine samples.

Raja testified that VX can be safely removed from the palm of a hand by scrubbing it with water within 15 minutes of exposure, in a possible explanation of why the two women didn't show any symptoms of poisoning.

Raja, the eighth witness to take the stand, is to be cross-examined by defense lawyers on Monday after the lab visit.

Pathologist Mohamad Shah Mahmood also testified there were no signs that a heart attack or other factors had contributed to Kim's death. He concluded in his autopsy report that Kim died of ""acute VX poisoning.""

""It's no surprise,"" said Hisyam, Huong's lawyer. ""We know their (prosecution) narration; we know the evidence that they have. We have a response; we have an answer to every evidence they have adduced so far.""

Gooi Soon Seong, the lawyer for Aisyah, has said the detection of VX on the women is not enough to convict them.

""If I have the knife, it doesn't mean I killed the person. They must have other stronger evidence,"" he said.

This week, prosecutors say they will present airport security videos that show the two women carrying out the attack and indicate they knew they were handling poison.",Kim's murder trial to resume with lab visit for VX evidence,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/07/kims-murder-trial-to-resume-with-lab-visit-for-vx-evidence.html

""There will be a debate,"" added McVay, EVP of content and Programming for Cumulus Media and Westwood One. ""We'll know more in a couple of weeks how it's going to change.""

The debate has already started; Caleb Keefer, the guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival hours before the shooting occurred, spoke out in favor of gun control on Monday.

A significant portion of this population would like to be able to travel more and be offered a greater variety of personalized services and destinations to choose from.

But according to a new study commissioned by Amadeus, Voyage of discovery. Working towards inclusive and accessible travel for all, the needs of these travelers are not being met by the travel industry or the public sector. As a result, accessible travel is far from being a reality for everyone.

“Over the past 30 years, travel has undergone a revolution that has brought it within the reach of hundreds of millions more people. The rise of low-cost options, the ubiquity of the internet and sharing platforms have created unprecedented demand and choice. In turn, more people are visiting more destinations than ever before,” states the report.

“One demographic that is yet to truly benefit from this democratization of travel: people with accessibility needs.”

These people wish to be considered as mainstream travelers, the report adds. They don’t expect special accommodations but merely the ability to plan, search, book and purchase travel like everyone else.

The report was commissioned to develop a deeper understanding of this growing segment of travelers and raise awareness surrounding accessibility issues.

Among its findings:

—One of the biggest barriers to accessible travel remains inaccurate or incomplete information being available.

—When it comes to booking travel online, 53% of respondents said they need assistance to complete bookings.

—Travelers with accessibility concerns increasingly expect their needs to be met as part of mainstream service, rather than at an added cost.

—The least satisfactory travel experiences for this population are related to railway stations.

—Accommodation providers meanwhile received the highest marks when it comes to making travel accessible.

Transitioning to a travel environment that works for everyone will require numerous improvements. Among them, more effective communication that facilitates access to relevant information regarding accessibility as well as more responsive service, including trained staff to address the varying access needs of travelers.

Standardizing content across the industry would also help. The report recommends more collaboration between the public and private sectors to help meet the needs of travelers with accessibility concerns.

“Improving accessibility in travel means enhancing usability for all customers. Lifting barriers to travel, personalizing the travel offer, using technology to further facilitate travelers’ experiences and creating more accessible infrastructure where people can navigate autonomously will benefit everybody,” said Amadeus Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Alex Luzárraga.

A Russian mechanics expert has restored a Soviet-era military vehicle that moves without the use of wheels or tracks - but is entirely screw-propelled.

Originally built in the 1970s, the vehicle uses giant metal screws which move it forward by twisting across the ground.

Formerly used by the Russian military, the truck was purchased by Alexei Anikin, who is the Director at JSC Plant of All-terrain Vehicles.

His team restored the motor back to working order, recently testing it swampland near the Nizhniy Novgorod Region in Russia.

Alexei Anikin said: “We’re proud that we’re the first in the country who started producing this vehicles after a roughly 30-year break, because, starting from the 1970s such automobiles hadn’t been produced in our country.”

The unique truck can move across most difficult terrains, including water, swampland and snow.

Fitted with a 159bhp engine, it is capable of carrying diggers, cranes and rescue equipment to areas that were previously inaccessible by land.

Umar Vakhidov, Deputy Head of the Construction at Novgorod State Technical University said: “We think, that it will be actively used, at first, by the army, at second, by geologists, by oil and gas producers.

""We got used to solid surfaces, but regions of Siberia and the Far North mostly have creeping soil. This car is vital for oil and gas producers.”

Screw-propelled machines were first used by the military during the Second World War, after a German soldier came up with a design for a snow machine using the mechanism.

The USA used similar vehicles to transport supplies across swamp lands during the Vietnam War, but they have remained largely disused since the mid-1970s.

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.

How close was Fusion’s leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.

Last year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.","For decades astronomers tried to prove Albert Einstein right by doing what Einstein thought was impossible: detecting the faint ripples in the universe called gravitational waves. They failed repeatedly until two years ago when they finally spotted one. Then another. And another. And another.

Three American scientists — including one who initially flunked out of MIT — won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday that launched a whole new way to observe the cosmos. Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences cited the combination of highly advanced theory and ingenious equipment design in awarding Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology.

""It's a win for the human race as a whole. These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe,"" Thorne told The Associated Press in a phone interview.

The trio were part of a team of more than 1,000 astronomers who first observed gravitational waves in September 2015. When the discovery was announced several months later, it was a sensation not only among scientists but the general public. These are waves that go through everything — including us — but carry information on them that astronomers could not get otherwise.

""The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope, which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons. And all of a sudden, we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about,"" Ariel Goobar of the Swedish academy said.

Weiss said he hopes that eventually gravitational waves will help science learn about ""the very moment when the universe came out of nothingness.""

Gravitational waves were first theorized a century ago by Einstein, but he didn't think technology would ever be able to detect the tiny wobbles, smaller than a piece of an atom.

The waves are like ""a storm in the fabric of space-time that is produced when two black holes collide,"" Thorne said. The first detection came from a crash 1.3 billion light-years away. A light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.

The prize is ""a win for Einstein, and a very big one,"" Barish told the AP.

The waves are detected by a laser device, called an interferometer, which must be both exquisitely precise and extremely stable in a project that cost $1.1 billion dollars. The first observation involved two of the devices about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) apart — in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana. They came about 7 milliseconds apart, consistent with the speed of light.

A new detector in Italy went online and helped in the discovery of the fourth wave.

With the technology that the three developed ""we may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet,"" said Patrick Sutton, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.

The German-born Weiss, 85, who initially spearheaded the research effort, was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount. Thorne, 77, a theorist, and Barish, 81, who was a project director, will split the other half.

For decades, the scientists pushed for money to start the massive LIGO project, getting their first National Science Foundation grant in 1992. The first version of the detector went through six long runs looking for gravitational waves, but didn't find them because it wasn't technologically precise enough, Barish said.

And computer programs needed to solve Einstein's equations weren't quite right and ""the quest was foundering,"" said Thorne, who peeled away from the detector work to form another collaboration to get better computing for detection.

Two decades after construction ""we finally struck gold,"" Barish said.

Weiss also overcame failure. After flunking out of MIT, he didn't have anything to do so he offered himself as an electronics technician to a lab at MIT and learned how to solder and deal with people. He returned to school, got his bachelor's and doctorate at MIT and ended up as a professor there.

""There was a person who thought I was OK. I wasn't a complete dope,"" Weiss said. ""I got some confidence out of that.""

In a moment of poetry aimed at making the distant and infinitesimal phenomenon understandable to non-experts, the academy announcement said gravitational waves ""are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.""

Professor Alberto Vecchio, from the University of Birmingham's Institute of Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said this discovery will produce results for decades to come.

""They have taken me, as well as hundreds of my colleagues, through such an intellectually rewarding and recently adrenaline-packed journey that we could not have even remotely imagined,"" he said. ""The best part is that this is just the beginning of a new roller-coaster exploration of the universe.""

For the past 25 years, the Nobel physics prize has been shared among multiple winners.

Last year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.","I’m thankful I don’t live in a state like Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal. When I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and told I would probably be dead in four months, I went in an instant from living the American Dream with my wife and son to living a nightmare. In that moment of depression, I might have chosen to end my life.

After a seizure sent me to the hospital, the neurosurgeon told me I had a brain tumor known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and that the tumor was inoperable. In fact, three different doctors told me there was nothing that they could do.

The news was overwhelmingly depressing. As a United States Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq War, I could have lost my life on a faraway battlefield serving my country. Thankfully I survived, but I had now received a death sentence at home.

With the support of my family, I chose to fight the cancer. I have had some great success with an experimental, cutting-edge treatment and am still alive three years after I was told I had only a few months to live.

Not everyone is so lucky to have the support I do. Since my diagnosis of terminal brain cancer my wife and I welcomed our second son into the world. I would have missed out on so much if I had been given – and had accepted – the option of assisted suicide.

Assisted suicide laws require a prognosis of six months or less to live, but how can we let our life-and-death decisions rest on these prognoses, when even the most experienced doctors are often wrong? My own experience reveals how tragic that could turn out to be.

We also know from the 2016 Oregon Health Report that in Oregon, which 20 years ago became the first state to make assisted suicide legal, only 4 percent of patients considering ending their lives were referred for psychological evaluation.

Yet a 2008 study, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ, revealed that 25 percent of patients requesting assisted suicide suffered from major depressive disorder. These numbers suggest that people with mental illness could well be prescribed a death-too-soon, instead of the treatment they deserve.

On top of that, the legalization of assisted suicide injects government and profit-driven insurance companies into everyone’s end-of-life decisions. Just in the last year, more cases have surfaced of patients being denied coverage for care, showing how legalizing assisted suicide results in more abuse and less choice.

Take, for example, Stephanie Packer, a California mother of four suffering from a serious case of scleroderma, a chronic connective tissue disease. She reported that her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment but would pay for her to kill herself.

Then there is Dr. Brian Callister, a Nevada physician who asked insurance medical directors to approve lifesaving, curative treatments for a patient in California and another in Oregon – two states that have legalized assisted suicide. Callister’s requests were denied, and the patients were offered coverage for suicide drugs instead.

People are starting to realize the threat that assisted suicide poses. Though an onslaught of new bills has been introduced, 23 states have rejected laws designed to legalize assisted suicide this year.

And states like Alabama and Ohio recently enacted laws to strengthen the prohibition of assisted suicide. Legislators across the nation of all political persuasions are recognizing that assisted suicide is bad policy and puts people like me at risk.

Some vulnerable populations, like people with disabilities and terminal illness, are at more immediate risk to be adversely affected by the legalization of assisted suicide. But the truth is, assisted suicide affects everyone.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



More non-news on the Russia-collusion front came Wednesday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee said it has now verified what everyone knew nine months ago: Russia worked to sow chaos during the 2016 election; vote totals weren’t affected; and no evidence has emerged that Donald Trump was in cahoots with Moscow.

But in the more distant, less camera-filled corners of Washington, there actually is some interesting new information. It centers on the document that increasingly looks central to the “chaos” Russia sowed: the Trump dossier.

That was the infamous list of accusations compiled starting in the summer of 2016 by a former British spook, Christopher Steele, who had been hired by the liberal opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The discredited rumors about Mr. Trump came from anonymous Russian sources. This is notable, since it turns out Fusion was separately—or maybe not so separately—working with entities tied to the Kremlin.

How close was Fusion’s leader, Glenn Simpson, to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Kremlin-linked lawyer? Did the Russians know about the dossier all along and help plant the information in it? Were American law-enforcement agencies relying on Russian-directed disinformation when they obtained secret warrants against Trump associates? Chaos, indeed.

Witness how hard the Federal Bureau of Investigation is fighting to avoid divulging any information about the dossier. More than a month ago the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the FBI and the Justice Department, asking for dossier-related documents. Lawmakers were told to go swivel.

A little more than a week ago, the committee’s frustrated chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, took the case all the way to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who finally offered to make an FBI official available for a briefing. But the bureau is still withholding all documents. To date, Sen. Chuck Grassley’s Judiciary Committee has not received any paper from the FBI on Russia matters, despite numerous requests, some countersigned by the Democratic ranking member, Dianne Feinstein.

Increasingly, one name is popping up: Gregory Brower, who leads the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs. Mr. Brower is an odd man for the job. These gigs tend to go to more-junior people, since they involve the drudgery of answering calls from grumpy congressional staffers.

What they can’t confirm yet is whether anybody else knew about his planned attack before it took place.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Friday in a news conference that while tips and information have helped them build a “profile into the madness of this suspect,” they still don’t know why he fired a heavy stream of bullets into a crowd of concertgoers at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

“In the past, terror attacks or mass murder incidents, motive was made very clear,” McMahill said about police examination of social media posts or evidence left at the scene. “We have looked at everything, literally, to include the suspect’s personal life, any political affiliation, his social behaviors, economic situation and any potential radicalization that so many have claimed.”

He also confirmed that investigators hadn’t found any evidence to suggest that the Islamic State was in any way responsible for the attack, despite the Muslim group’s earlier claims.

Police said they have reviewed video footage from the hotel and didn’t see anyone that they view as a suspect.

They reiterated that authorities found Tannerite, a binary explosive, in the shooter’s car but said they do not know what Paddock was planning to do with it and based on the condition it was found in, it did not resemble an IED.

They also confirmed that authorities located a missing car they were looking for, a Hyundai Tucson with Nevada plates. It was at Paddock’s house in Reno, Nev.

In a timeline of events, police confirmed that a security officer initially went up to the 32nd floor of the hotel because an alarm sounded.

It was there that the security guard, Jesus Campos, came under fire by the suspect, during which he was hit by a bullet in the leg.

Campos turned back and notified his dispatch of the shooter, which McMahill said was “absolutely critical” because it gave police the exact location of Paddock.

McMahill referred to Campos as a “brave and remarkable” man who police had not done a good enough job of recognizing for his heroic actions.

The flying museum, better known as the “Madras Maiden” touched down in Columbia, S.C. Sunday, where volunteers give 30-minute tours to veterans, visitors or families of those who served in the military.

“They do fine…I’m proud of them. [They’re] down in that plane like they were born in it,” WWII Army veteran William Pate said about the volunteers.

From 1944 to 1947, Pate jumped out of C-47’s and C-82’s as an 82nd Airborne paratrooper.

“I enjoyed what I was doing. If I could, I would do it again. But I have a lot of age on me now. I ain’t no spring chicken,” he told Fox News.

Pate and other veterans in attendance swapped war stories with each other and the crew after taking one of the flights over the city.

“It’s just an honor to be able to hear their stories, talk to their families and just keep their memories alive for generations,” Rodney Schneider said.

An aircraft maintainer by trade, Schneider explained his love for planes stretched back to his childhood. This motivated him to reach out to the Liberty Foundation, which organizes the event.

“I’ve been with the airplane now seven-days straight. Sometimes its weeks between when I’m needed,"" Schneider said.

Robert “Max” Maiden, 21, is a co-pilot for the bomber. He flies to different cities every weekend for six months.

“I’ve always loved flying old airplanes…They have a cool story to tell and they are an important part of history,” Maiden said. “You really see people get really emotional and they sit there and they go, 'Aww man this is what my dad did,' or ‘my dad built them’ or 'my dad flew them or is a gunner.' It’s really cool to share that with people.”

Erin Creed traveled to Columbia from Virginia with her father and husband to honor her grandfather, who fought the Nazis in Europe.

“I just could not believe I was on a World War Two plane,” she said. “I had his picture and his favorite hat and I just couldn’t believe [I] was flying in memory of him.”

One of only 12 B-17’s still flying the “Madras Maiden” was built toward the end of the war but never saw combat. In 2016, The Liberty Foundation began operating the aircraft and spends over a million dollars every year for upkeep. The money that is generated from ticket sales or donations helps to cover the costs.

“If that goes away, it goes back into a museum and starts collecting dust and you don’t get to hear it or smell it,” Schneider explained.

The crew’s age and skills may vary, but one thing remains the same -- the love for planes and veterans.

“We get to ride on a WWII airplane that not everybody can do and just the satisfaction of just doing it,” Schneider said.

The massive investigation has failed to uncover Paddock’s motive for the rampage Sunday night that killed 58 people. The 64-year-old Paddock was armed with 24 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammo when he opened fire on a country music festival from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Vegas strip.

Paddock also wounded hundreds before taking his own life.

The official also disclosed to the AP that Paddock, a high-stakes gambler, took at least a dozen cruises abroad in the last few years, most of them with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, the AP reported Saturday. At least one sailed to the Middle East.

Also Saturday, federal agents began to haul away thousands of personal items left behind when at the music festival.

FBI agents were seen Saturday morning hauling baby strollers, lawn chairs, backpacks and purses onto dollies and into the back of a white truck.

Law enforcement officers had fanned out across the crime scene throughout the week, stacking up belongings of concert-goers into more than a dozen large piles.

Authorities have said they plan to return the belongings to people in the next week.

An estimated 22,000 people were attending the Route 91 Harvest festival when Paddock opened fire.

Investigators say Paddock was the lone shooter.

Three children's authors declined an invitation to the museum's inaugural Children's Literature Festival, which was set for Oct. 14 before being canceled. After the museum offered to take down the mural, the authors said they would attend, but the museum has not said if the festival is back on.

Authors Mo Willems, Mike Curato and Lisa Yee signed a letter and posted it to social media explaining why they take issue with the mural's depiction.

""We recently learned that a key component of this institution honoring Dr. Seuss features a mural depicting a scene from his first book, 'And to Think That I Saw It on Mullberry Street,' and within the selected art is a jarring racial stereotype of a Chinese man, who is depicted with chopsticks, a pointed hat and slanted slit eyes,"" the complaint reads. ""We find this caricature of 'the Chinaman' deeply hurtful, and we have concerns about children's exposure to it.""

The Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno slammed the authors’ criticism and museum’s decision to remove the mural, asking “where do we draw the line?”

“This is political correctness at its worst, and this is what is wrong with our country,” he said in a statement, according to WWLP. “We have extreme fringe groups on both the right and the left dictating an agenda to divide instead of working together towards the betterment of our country.”

On a cool and rainy afternoon during the first week of classes at Centennial High School in this well-to-do Baltimore suburb, about 50 members of the boys' cross-country team sauntered across the parking lot for their after-school run.

Meanwhile, about 30 kids in helmets and pads were going through drills on the pristine artificial turf field at the school's hillside football stadium.

""It used to be the other way around,"" said Al Dodds, Centennial's cross-country coach, who has 64 boys on his team this year. ""Now, there's a small turnout in football and cross-country is huge.""

Across the athletic complex, a practice football field sat empty, even though it was recently mown and painted with yardage lines and hash marks. In years past, the junior-varsity team would have been relegated to that grass field. But on this day they had the stadium to themselves, as they will for every practice this fall. Centennial isn't fielding a varsity football team because not enough kids signed up to play.

The situation at Centennial — where a long history of losing has dampened students' enthusiasm for football — is unique to this part of central Maryland, but there are plenty of similar examples around the U.S. Participation in high school football is down 3.5 percent over the past five years, according to the annual survey by the National Association of State High School Federations, or NFHS.

The decline would be much steeper if not for a handful of states in the South and the West. Throughout the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, in communities urban and rural, wealthy and working-class, fewer kids are playing football.

""I've never been interested in football,"" said 16-year-old Zach Deming, a cross-country runner at Centennial with the solid build of a defensive back. ""I'm afraid of getting hurt badly, like getting a serious concussion .""

The risks of football have never been more apparent. This summer, researchers at Boston University said they'd found evidence of a brain disease linked to repeated head blows in nearly all of the 202 former football players they studied. The athletes whose brains were donated to the study had played football in the National Football League, college and even high school.

The report doesn't confirm chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, is common in all football players, because many donors or their families participated in the study because of the players' troubling symptoms.

After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in 2015 to a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.

""There's no question about it. The amount of publicity, beginning with the NFL and what you see on national news, has caused concern among parents,"" said Bob Gardner, the NFHS executive director. ""Probably some who would have been more inclined to let their young men play, maybe are making different decisions now.""

A study published last month in the medical journal Translational Psychiatry showed that kids who played football before age 12 were more than twice as likely to have mood and behavior problems.

The news hasn't escaped the parents at Centennial, one of the top-rated public high schools in Maryland, where 97 percent of students go on to college after they graduate. Just 10 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, an indicator of poverty.

""Families around here are more into academics,"" Zach said.

Maryland is one of 14 states where participation in football was down 10 percent or more over the past five years, according to NFHS data. In all, 41 states saw a decline between the 2011-12 and 2016-17 school years, and just nine states and the District of Columbia saw increases.

In West Windsor Township, New Jersey, which borders Princeton University and has a median household income of $137,000, one of the two public high schools dropped varsity football this year, and the other might have to do the same next year.

Trinity High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, also disbanded its varsity team, with hopes that it could return in a lower division next year.

At the first practice, the team ""had three seniors, one junior, 12 sophomores and one freshman,"" athletic director Chip Polak told the New Hampshire Union Leader in August. ""Two of the seniors have never played any kind of organized football and the other senior is dealing with concussion symptoms.""

In Ventura County, California, northeast of Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks High School disbanded its junior-varsity team this season because it needed sophomores and juniors to fill out the varsity roster. In Marin County, north of San Francisco, Novato High School announced that it wouldn't field a varsity team this year, but the program got a last-minute reprieve when more athletes than expected showed up for practice.

The decline in participation isn't just limited to wealthy, coastal communities. Among the states where participation is down more than 10 percent are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Population in Illinois has also declined over that period, while in Michigan and Wisconsin it has only grown slightly.

Researchers at the University of Colorado, who studied data from the NFHS and the Census, said in an analysis published Sept. 26 that high school football participation peaked in 2009 before beginning a decline that is likely to continue.

The NFL is paying attention to the numbers and trying to find ways to get kids playing the sport.

""It is important for kids to play sports because it's healthy, it's fun, and they learn important values,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. ""Of course, we think football is the best team sport and we aim to ensure there are a range options for young players today — both tackle and flag.""

While participation in tackle football is down, flag football is becoming more popular. Participation in the NFL Flag program run by USA Football for kids ages 6-17 increased by 66 percent from 2013 to 2016, with 385,000 kids playing last year.

In high schools, the expense of the sport and increasing specialization by young athletes are also factors. And while football is declining, other sports are growing, among them soccer and lacrosse. But football is different because it remains the nation's most popular spectator sport, and schools expect to sell tickets on Friday nights.

""The key thing about football is that it's such an important part of the financial picture of schools. Some of these schools rely on the attendance in high school football to pay for these other sports,"" Gardner said. ""While we certainly applaud the growth of all sports, we remain vigilant about what's going on in football because of the economic impact.""

Around the Centennial football program, there is optimism that varsity football could return next year if the JV team can put together a reasonably competitive season. The team has a strong freshman class, some of whom have never played organized football before.

Toward the end of the 2-hour practice, coaches wanted the first-team defense to get some full-speed reps. That required some creativity.

""If you're not on first-team defense, I need 11 of you to make an offense,"" an assistant coach barked. ""I need a running back, I need a fullback, I need five linemen, I need a tight end, I need two wide receivers. Let's go!""",Schools disbanding football teams as participation declines,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/06/schools-disbanding-football-teams-as-participation-declines.html

But there were items that were off limits.

A Long Island winery lost its liquor license Thursday after it allegedly hosted a rowdy party where patrons reportedly got into fist fights, had sex in public and defecated on neighbors’ properties.

Vineyard 48 in Cutchogue was ordered by the New York State Liquor Authority to suspend its alcohol sales and consumption, Newsday reported.

“Vineyard 48 has amassed a disturbing record of repeatedly serving patrons far beyond the point of extreme intoxication, straining police resources and wreaking havoc on their neighbors and the surrounding community,” Christopher R. Riano, the liquor authority’s authority counsel, wrote in a news release.

Peter Sullivan, Vineyard 48’s attorney, told Newsday the allegations were not true and the order “would be reversed quickly.”

The State Liquor Authority decided to order the suspension after a boozy party disturbed some of the neighbors who lived nearby, the New York Post reported.

Some 400 customers reportedly had defecated and urinated on the homeowner’s premises due to long lines at the restrooms.

“Security prevents people from going onto adjacent properties unless they live there,” Sullivan said. Newsday reported that Southold Town Police were getting calls from neighbors about “two patrons engaging in sexual acts in view of their backyard bordering Vineyard 48.”

The liquor authority stated that police went to the winery due to “an altercation involving 400 disorderly, heavily intoxicated patrons who were pushing, shoving and screaming at one another.”

Sullivan denied the allegations and said he had proof to debunk them.

“For example, they allege that there were 400 drunk patrons [fighting] and we have videotape showing that it’s six people — a son and his mom and a drunk girl and two girlfriends yelling at each other,” Sullivan told the New York Post.

Authorities said the wild party was not the only incident where patrons at the winery lost control.

“The disturbing incidents of September 30 are only the most recent in a long line of resident complaints and police encounters at Vineyard 48,” the news release stated.

The vineyard has gotten in legal trouble previously, Newsday reported. In 2016, Southold Police reported alcohol overdoses and physical altercations on the vineyard’s property.

Next week, the vineyard will have a hearing on the matter.","Rowdy sex parties, poop antics cause New York winery to lose liquor license",http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2017/10/07/rowdy-sex-parties-poop-antics-causes-new-york-winery-to-lose-liquor-license.html

A significant portion of this population would like to be able to travel more and be offered a greater variety of personalized services and destinations to choose from.

But according to a new study commissioned by Amadeus, Voyage of discovery. Working towards inclusive and accessible travel for all, the needs of these travelers are not being met by the travel industry or the public sector. As a result, accessible travel is far from being a reality for everyone.

“Over the past 30 years, travel has undergone a revolution that has brought it within the reach of hundreds of millions more people. The rise of low-cost options, the ubiquity of the internet and sharing platforms have created unprecedented demand and choice. In turn, more people are visiting more destinations than ever before,” states the report.

“One demographic that is yet to truly benefit from this democratization of travel: people with accessibility needs.”

These people wish to be considered as mainstream travelers, the report adds. They don’t expect special accommodations but merely the ability to plan, search, book and purchase travel like everyone else.

The report was commissioned to develop a deeper understanding of this growing segment of travelers and raise awareness surrounding accessibility issues.

Among its findings:

—One of the biggest barriers to accessible travel remains inaccurate or incomplete information being available.

—When it comes to booking travel online, 53% of respondents said they need assistance to complete bookings.

—Travelers with accessibility concerns increasingly expect their needs to be met as part of mainstream service, rather than at an added cost.

—The least satisfactory travel experiences for this population are related to railway stations.

—Accommodation providers meanwhile received the highest marks when it comes to making travel accessible.

Transitioning to a travel environment that works for everyone will require numerous improvements. Among them, more effective communication that facilitates access to relevant information regarding accessibility as well as more responsive service, including trained staff to address the varying access needs of travelers.

Standardizing content across the industry would also help. The report recommends more collaboration between the public and private sectors to help meet the needs of travelers with accessibility concerns.

“Improving accessibility in travel means enhancing usability for all customers. Lifting barriers to travel, personalizing the travel offer, using technology to further facilitate travelers’ experiences and creating more accessible infrastructure where people can navigate autonomously will benefit everybody,” said Amadeus Vice President, Corporate Strategy, Alex Luzárraga.
