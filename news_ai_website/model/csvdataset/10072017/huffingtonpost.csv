PEOPLE - Parents de Wyatt -3 ans- et du petit Dimitri -10 mois-, Ashton Kutcher et Mila Kunis ont décidé de ne plus rien leur offrir pour les fêtes de Noël.

Une décision qui, vous allez le voir, est mûrement réfléchie.

Ces révélations ont été faites à ""Entertainment Tonight"" par Mila Kunis, qui était interviewée à l'occasion de la prochaine sortie de ""Bad moms 2"". Arrivant naturellement au sujet de la maternité, l'actrice d'origine ukrainienne s'est confié sur sa façon de faire avec ses deux enfants.

""Lorsque nous avons fêté Noël l'année dernière, Wyatt avait 2 ans et c'était trop,"" déclare Mila Kunis. ""On ne lui a rien donné - c'était ses grands-parents. Les enfants n'apprécient plus les cadeaux. Ils ne savent même plus ce qu'ils attendent. Ils attendent juste quelque chose.""

Si Mila Kunis et Ashton Kutcher sont d'accord pour que les grands-parents offrent un cadeau -un seul- à leur descendance, le couple d'acteurs voudrait également faire comprendre à leurs enfants que chaque cadeau est le fruit d'un achat.

""Nous aimerions faire un don de charité à un hôpital d'enfants,"" a-t-elle également déclaré à ""Entertainment Tonight"".

YANGON -- A Myanmar beauty queen says she was stripped of her pageant title after posting a graphic video accusing Muslim Rohingya militants of driving communal violence in Rakhine state, a conflict fraught with controversy in the mainly Buddhist country.

Myanmar's army is accused of waging an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya in the far west, where more than half a million of the Muslim minority have fled across the border to Bangladesh since 25 August.

In the face of intense global condemnation, Myanmar authorities have staunchly defended the security operation as a legitimate crackdown on Rohingya militants who attacked police posts last month.

The conflict has curdled religious tensions inside Myanmar, fanning Buddhist nationalism and a hatred against the Rohingya that has been steeping for years.

In a video posted on her Facebook last week, Miss Grand Myanmar Shwe Eain Si accused the Rohingya militants of leading a ""media campaign"" to trick the world into thinking ""they are the oppressed"".

Shots of Shwe Eain Si speaking to the camera were interspersed with graphic images of people with bloody gashes across their faces, nude babies and screenshots from videos posted by the militant group, known as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army).

On Sunday the firm behind the beauty pageant announced Shwe Eain Si had been stripped of her title for breaching contract rules, in a statement that did not mention the video on Rakhine.

But in a reply posted on Facebook Tuesday Shwe Eain Si said these accusations were ""groundless"" and linked the move to her comments on the Rohingya.

One of the company's complaints, the beauty queen wrote, was that she ""failed to project a decent image of a pageant contestant"".

""Yes, Shwe Eain Si made a video about the reign of terror brought about by the ARSA militants in Rakhine State, but that was hardly qualified as a failure to project a decent image of a pageant contestant,"" her post said.

Miss Universe Myanmar was not immediately available for comment.

It is not the first time Myanmar's nascent beauty queen scene has been rocked by drama.

Earlier this year a prominent transgender pageant winner was detained after a famous actress sued her for defamation over insults posted on a popular celebrity gossip page.

And in 2014 a Myanmar beauty queen was dethroned for alleged dishonesty and bad behaviour, after which she ran off with her crown to South Korea.

How Tech Can Secure The NHS' Place In Our Society And Bring Services Into The Digital Age It's now a little over a decade since Steve Jobs stepped confidently onto a stage in California and projected the world into the smartphone era.

Technology now governs every aspect of our lives: how we shop, how we work, how we play, even how we vote, have all been transformed by the march of digital. It's brought risk, as well as benefits, not least in its impact on our mental health. But what can't be disputed is its overwhelming power to disrupt traditional ways of working and create new possibilities for consumers. Secretary of State for Health

The outcry over the molestation of a woman student on campus at Banaras Hindu University has opened a can of worms. But in the long and sordid history of sexual violence at the institution, outlined by HuffPost India recently, the gangrape of a male student last year seldom comes into focus.

It's not that attacks against men deserve more attention than those perpetrated on women. When it comes to brutality and violation, no one has a monopoly or a competitive claim to justice. The truth, however, is that for a variety of reasons, usually fuelled by social stigma and shame, sexual abuse of men isn't reported as openly or widely as that of women. Ignoring such incidents results in reinforcing patriarchal stereotypes, by society, media and the system at large, and a vicious cycle of secrecy and assault is perpetuated.

According to reports, in August 2016, the victim, a Masters' degree student of Hindi, was allegedly forced to consume alcohol by five men, including an employee of BHU, and abducted in a car. For the next few hours, the kidnappers took turn to rape him repeatedly in the vehicle, as it was driven around the campus unchallenged by the security, including the patrolling vehicle of the proctorial board.

As if this ordeal wasn't horrific enough, when the victim was finally dumped on an open ground near the agriculture department, his calls to 100 remained unheeded. The police took four days to respond to the case, which, according to the victims' friends, the university authorities tried to suppress, by urging the victim not to file a formal complaint.

When a case was finally registered, the victim was made to undergo two medical tests, as if the trauma of sexual violence wasn't harrowing enough, and one of the accused who was the staff of the institution was served a chargesheet and spent six months in prison. A year on, the victim continues to study at BHU but now lives outside the campus.

Early last month, BHU had also asked a woman student to leave the girls' hostel, accusing her for showing ""homosexual tendencies"", the use of such a regressive phrase proving its deeply entrenched homophobia. It was also reported that the 'accused' was asked to have her ""disease"" treated.

Confiesa que no, que no le manda cartas de amor a Pataky, que le gusta más ""la eficacia de las llamadas de teléfono"", pero que quizá debería. ""No pasa mucho tiempo sin que le diga cuánto la quiero"", afirma.

What began as a week full of weird argy bargy over an extremely positive song at a footy final ended on a confident note, with polls indicating the 'yes' vote is ahead in the federal government's controversial survey to determine if people who love each other should marry.

A raft of opinion polls released over the past two weeks showing the 'yes' side is ahead were given extra heft by the Australian Bureau of Statistics update showing 57.5 percent of registered voters had already returned their ballots, with four weeks left until the survey is complete.

""It's very hard to see how the 'no' case could win from here unless an awful lot of people are straight-out lying to pollsters,"" concluded pollster John Stirton in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, in reference to the trends shown by the different polls after the ABS published its update.

But the week didn't start that with the same optimism.

As Germany conducted its first same-sex marriages since making them legal earlier this year, Australia's 'no' side of the debate was up in arms over Macklemore's performance of Same Love at the NRL grand final on Saturday.

Everyone from former Prime Minster Tony Abbott to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton chiming in.

""Footy fans shouldn't be subjected to a politicised grand final. Sport is sport,"" declared Tony Abbott, who was once loudly booed by the NRL's totally non political fans.

Dutton -- ever the political peace maker -- tried to help his former boss.

""I am into free speech,"" he said.

""Presumably two songs should be played, one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage.""

No doubt to Dutton's disappointment there was room for only one song at the grand final.

But it didn't stop some from changing their tune this week.

The NSW Law Society backed away from its support of same-sex marriage this week, by clarifying in a statement its public support for the move does not represent its 30,000 members.

Fairfax reports the professional body for the state's solicitors came under sustained pressure from a small but vocal group of members.

The Coalition for Marriage was singing a slightly different song too, with the launch of an app directing its supporters to the houses of undecided voters in an effort to sway their votes.

The move came a week after loud complaints about the 'yes' campaign's text message advertisement, which itself came a week after 'vote no' was scrawled across Sydney's sky.

Despite stepping up its advertising campaign while somehow avoiding tripping over its own double standards, the 'no' side has has had a whole other set of woes.

The group was left without a venue for a 'No' campaign event in Tasmania, with campaigners claiming the Wrest Point Casino cancelled its booking and University of Tasmania refused to take them on.

""It cannot produce a decision. It still requires a vote of the Parliament, whatever the result of the vote is,"" he said.

Puede que hayas visto o no esta cita circulando por internet, pero independientemente de eso, el punto es válido. ¿Cuántas personas se empinan el vino, o la Coca Light, o el té a cubetadas, pero tienen problemas para tomar su cuota de agua?

No teman. Existen muchas formas de hacer que tomar agua sea más fácil, y ninguna de ellas tiene que ver con adquirir cantidades interminables de EVIAN. SIn embargo, antes de llegar a eso tenemos que hacer la pregunta...

¿Cuánta agua tengo que tomar?

""Mi postura es un poco diferente a la de los demás, pero creo que algunas personas se dejan llevar por la idea de que mientras más agua tomen, mejor"". Sólo quiero aclarar que se puede llegar a tomar agua en exceso y que todos necesitamos diferentes cantidades de agua dependiendo de nuestra talla y de lo activo que sea cada quien"", dijo la nutrióloga Fiona Tuck al HuffPost Australia.

""En realidad no existe una cantidad fija de lo que tiene que tomar una persona, pero definitivamente no se trata de tomar tres o cuatro litros, a menos de que seas una persona de talla grande y muy, muy activa"".

Tuck explica que es importante tomar agua para reemplazar los fluidos que perdemos durante el día, y por tanto la cantidad de agua que tenemos que tomar dependen directamente de la cantidad que estamos perdiendo.

""Perdemos agua al sudar o al orinar, o cuando te enfermas o tienes un bicho en el estómago, necesitas tomar más líquidos de lo normal"", dice. Pero en promedio la mayoría de la gente pierde 1.5 litros de agua al día"".

""Se puede tomar una sobredosis de agua. Demasiada agua puede diluir la sangre y afectar el equilibrio de electrolitos. Si tomas demasiada agua también puede subir tu presión"".

¿Cómo saber si estoy tomando suficiente o demasiada agua?

La respuesta es muy sencilla: se ve en el color de la pipí.

""La forma más fácil de saber si estás o no tomando suficiente agua está en el color de tu orina"", dice Tuck. ""TIene que ser de un color paja pálido"".

""Si es oscura, quiere decir que estás deshidratado. Si es completamente blanca, tampoco es bueno porque quiere decir que está muy diluida"".

""Quiero hacer énfasis en que en general el agua es buena. La necesitamos para una digestión sana. Por ejemplo, si alguien está estreñido, puede ser por no consumir suficiente fibra en su dieta, pero también puede ser porque no está tomando suficiente agua como para ablandar todo para que pase"".

Fluidos de otras fuentes

Es importante hacer notar que el agua no es la única fuente de fluidos para tu cuerpo ( y no estamos hablando de cambiarla por Coca de vainilla).

""También obtienes fluidos de la leche y la fruta y los vegetales, e incluso de tu proceso digestivo natural"", dice Tuck.

""Es realmente interesante ver cómo en los meses más cálidos la naturaleza provee frutas con un mayor contenido de agua. Cosas como la sandía, los pepinos, la lechuga... tienen un alto contenido de agua"".

""No propongo tomar agua sólo de alimentos, pero puede ser bueno comer lo que nos da la temporada""

¿Qué hacer para tomar más agua?

Si eres de esas personas que definitivamente tienen que aumentar su ingesta de agua pero se le dificulta, Tuck tiene un par de trucos bajo la manga que te pueden facilitar el proceso.

Ténla a la mano

Así como la botella de vino en la mesa de la cena, se te facilitará tomar agua si la tienes cerca.

""Ten agua en tu escritorio. Sí está allí es más probable que la tomes"", dice Tuck. Yo se que si se acaba mi botella de agua y no tengo tiempo de rellenarla, me sentiré deshidratada más tarde en algún momento. Pero si está allí, puedo tomar un litro o medio, fácilmente"".

""También creo que es bueno tener un vaso de agua junto a tu cama en la noche. Cuando se que está allí y me despierto en la noche y la tomo, pero si no, me olvido de ella.""

""Básicamente creo que amamos la facilidad de las cosas. Y mientras más fácil, más lo hacemos. Si sólo tienes vino a la mano pero agua no, ¿adivina que vas a tomar?

Agrégale sabor

Si no te gusta el agua simple, trata de agregarle un poco de fruta o hierbas, o haz cubos de agua de sabor.

""Cortar rebanadas de fruta de la pasión y añadírselas al agua es algo que me encanta hacer. El sabor es de agua de esta fruta"", dice Tuck. ""También le puedes agregar menta o una rebanada de limón o naranja"".

""Así tendrás una bebida refrescante baja en calorías que es hidratante y no cuesta trabajo tomarla"".

""Otra idea es aderezar tus cubos de hielo poniendo una frambuesa o una hoja de menta en la charola del hielo. Y así serán más fáciles de usar.""

""Si de plano no es suficiente, trata de diluir jugo de fruta. Si lo diluyes con agua, te ayudará a tomar más y además estarás tomando más agua que azúcar concentrada del jugo"".

Adopta los tés de frutas

""Los tés herbales son una gran forma de ayudarte a tomar agua, aunque tienes que tratar de consumir demasiado té verde, ni té negro ya que tienen cafeína"".

""Los tés de yerbabuena o de manzanilla son una gran forma de ayudarte a llevar agua al cuerpo que no sea simple agua para tomar"".

Dahinter steckt eine Naturkatastrophe

Den See und was die Gefahr für Mensch und Umwelt verursacht, seht ihr im Video oben

Lake Erie ist einer der viertgrößten Seen Nordamerikas. Normalerweise zeichnet er sich durch sein blaues Wasser aus. Doch seit mehreren Jahren verfärbt sich der See grün.

Was sich faszinierend anhört, ist in Wahrheit das Anzeichen einer Naturkatastrophe dar. Die ist sowohl für Menschen als auch die Umwelt gefährlich. Anfang Oktober veröffentlichte die NASA neue Bilder des Sees, die das Ausmaß der Katastrophe zeigen.

Laut einer Pressemitteilung des National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sind “Microcystis Cyanobakterien” der Grund für die Verfärbung.

3 Millionen Menschen beziehen Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee

“Die Microcystis Cyanobakterien erstrecken sich über das westliche Becken und breiten sich entlang der Küsten von Michigan und Ohio, von Maumee Bay bis hin zur Küste von Ontario, aus”, heißt es in der Pressemitteilung.

Der See sei so stark mit giftigen Algen verschmutzt, dass die Ohio Environmental Protection Agency davor warne, das Leitungswasser in der Region zu trinken und in die Nähe des Lake Erie zu gehen. Laut der “New York Times” beziehen fast drei Millionen Menschen ihr Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee.

Die globale Klimaerwärmung verstärkt das Gift der Algen

Das Problem sei seit 2000 bekannt, dennoch sei bisher nicht viel dagegen unternommen worden. Wissenschaftler gehen davon aus, dass das Gift der Algen durch die globale Klimaerwärmung stärker werden wird.

Die Bürgermeisterin von Toledo, einer Stadt an der Küste des Sees, schrieb vor wenigen Tagen einen Brief an US-Präsident Donald Trump. Paula Hicks-Hudson macht darin auf die Gefahr, die von dem See ausgeht, aufmerksam.

“In unserem Land stimmt etwas nicht, wenn sich unsere Seen und Flüsse grün färben. Ich kann Ihnen eins sagen: Der Status Quo funktioniert nicht”, erklärte Hicks-Hudson in ihrem Schreiben.

In a tweet sharing the audio clip, the 53-year-old added: “We have 3,000 suspected terrorists living in the UK & 23,000 people known to security services who could do us harm.”

Farage’s comments sparked widespread anger, with critics calling him “grossly irresponsible” and a “shameless attention-seeker”:

Meanwhile, Hopkins tweeted a series of messages in the wake of the incident which appeared to suggest that it was a terror attack, telling tourists “right now, London is not worth the risk”.

She also accused the BBC of state propaganda after the news website described the incident as a “crash”.

However, the Mail Online columnist later deleted the tweets, telling followers “I hope you all stay safe”.

Battisti festeggia, ma la protezione da parte del Brasile - Paese che lo ospita dal 2004 - vacilla. Il quotidiano Estado de S.Paulo scrive che l'asilo politico, concessogli nel 2010 dall'ex presidente brasiliano Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, è a rischio.

La difesa sostiene che il denaro, che gli è stato sequestrato, era compatibile con il viaggio insieme alle due persone che lo accompagnavano e non era superiore al limite legale.

Ora Battisti è libero e già nella sua casa sul litorale di San Paolo, secondo quanto riferisce il sito G1. in base al provvedimento di libertà provvisoria che gli è stato concesso la notte scorsa dal giudice d'appello, José Marcos Lunardelli, Battisti non potrà lasciare la zona in cui è residente senza autorizzazione e dovrà presentarsi ogni mese in tribunale. Nel motivare la concessione dell'habeas corpus, il magistrato ha sottolineato che non esistono prove di traffico di valuta né di riciclaggio, reati per i quali Battisti era stato incarcerato, e che il suo arresto ha rappresentato una ""limitazione illegale della libertà di locomozione"".

Restano confermate le indiscrezioni sulla volontà del Brasile di concedere all'Italia l'estradizione del terrorista. Sarebbe pronto un 'piano' per riportare l'ex terrorista dal Brasile in Italia, affermano i media locali, che citano gli sforzi del governo del presidente Michel Temer per trovare un 'escamotage' giuridico dell'ultim'ora. Prima però, secondo la stampa brasiliana, devono essere risolte alcune importanti questioni legali.

Tra gli ostacoli da superare ci sarebbe l'assenza di una dichiarazione formale da parte del governo italiano che si impegni a rispettare le regole su quella che i giuristi di Brasilia chiamano 'detrazione penale'. In base ai trattati di estradizione, le autorità di Roma devono cioè vincolarsi ad assicurare all'imputato lo stesso regime di detenzione previsto dalle leggi brasiliane. Il ministro della Giustizia, Andrea Orlando, ha detto che l'Italia intende muoversi ""con grande determinazione ma anche con grande cautela"". ""In questi anni e in queste ore - ha detto Orlando - il nostro Paese ha fatto ogni passo possibile sia dal punto di vista politico sia giudiziario per ottenere l'estradizione di Battisti. Oggi c'è un fatto nuovo, che è quello dell'arresto, che ci può consentire di avere più probabilità di successo. Bisogna muoversi con grande determinazione ma anche con grande cautela"".

Il ministro ha ricordato che ""proprio qualche mese fa Pasquale Scotti, il braccio destro di Cutolo, è stato assicurato alla giustizia italiana con la collaborazione delle autorità brasiliane. Oggi mi auguro si possa fare lo stesso con Battisti perché credo sia il modo migliore per dare sollievo alle vittime, per rendere onore a chi è caduto e per parlare anche a chi ha sofferto"". Secondo il Brasile, l'Italia, dovrebbe impegnarsi ad applicare la pena prevista nel Paese per i delitti commessi da Battisti (condannato all'ergastolo nel nostro Paese), ovvero al massimo 30 anni di carcere.

Tutte le richieste di estradizione che si sono risolte in un nulla di fatto

La prima richiesta di estradizione in Italia dei confronti di Battisti risale al 1991, quando l'ex terrorista dei Pac, condannato per quattro omicidi, fu arrestato in Francia proprio su istanza dell'Italia. Parigi, però, lo dichiarò non estradabile. Oltralpe intraprese anche una carriera come scrittore di noir.

La seconda richiesta di estradarlo arrivò nel 2004. Battisti venne arrestato il 10 febbraio a Parigi sempre su richiesta delle autorità italiane sulla base delle condanne all'ergastolo per omicidio pronunciate nei suoi confronti. In Francia si scatenò una campagna in suo favore sostenuta dagli intellettuali della gauche. Il 3 marzo Battisti venne scarcerato. Il 30 giugno ci fu l'udienza per l'estradizione e la Chambre d'Instruction della corte d'appello diede il via libera.

Battisti fece ricorso in Cassazione e l'istanza fu respinta. La cosa sembrava fatta, ma il 14 agosto fu l'ultima volta in cui Battisti si presentò a firmare in commissariato, come previsto dalle misure nei suoi confronti, poi si rese irreperibile. Fu spiccato un mandato di arresto. E il 23 ottobre il primo ministro francese firmò il decreto di estradizione in assenza del condannato, latitante.

La terza richiesta di estradizione scattò in conseguenza dell'arresto dell'ex terrorista in Brasile, a Copacabana, il 18 marzo 2007. Alle indagini per catturarlo collaborò l'antiterrorismo italiano. Ma il Brasile riconobbe a Battisti lo status di rifugiato politico. Nel novembre 2009 si pronunciò il Supremo Tribunal Federal che, pur esprimendosi a favore dell'estradizione, lasciò l'autorità della decisione finale all'allora presidente Lula, che il 31 dicembre 2010 annunciò il suo no. Battisti venne successivamente scarcerato.

Ma il 3 marzo 2015 fu pronunciata nei suoi confronti in Brasile una sentenza di espulsione: alla base, la storia dei documenti falsi con cui, a suo tempo, era entrato in Brasile dalla Francia e da cui derivava, secondo i giudici, la nullità del permesso di soggiorno. Anche in questo caso, riprese corpo l'ipotesi di riportare Battisti in Italia e le autorità italiane si mossero in tal senso. L'espulsione fu poi annullata e tutto si fermò di nuovo.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York says the Canadian, identified as Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, of Mississauga, Ont., has been in custody since the FBI arrested him in New Jersey in May 2016.

The arrests were first announced Friday following a court's unsealing of federal terrorism charges against the three men. A spokesman for the justice department said late Friday that the case needed to be sealed for more than a year to protect the ongoing investigation, but he did not elaborate.

The other two accused are identified as Talha Haroon, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen residing in Pakistan, and Russell Salic, 37, from the Philippines.

U.S. authorities allege that the three men communicated through Internet messaging applications, allegedly plotting to carry out bombing and shootings in heavily populated areas of New York City during the Islamic holy month of Ramadhan in 2016.

They also allege that while in Canada, El Bahnasawy purchased bomb-making materials and helped secure a cabin within driving distance of New York City to use for building the explosive devices and staging the attacks.

El Bahnasawy and Haroon began communicating with an undercover FBI agent posing as an ISIS supporter, and declared their allegiance to the terror group.

The release says El Bahnasawy stated to the agent that ""these Americans need an attack'' and that he aspired to ""create the next 9/11"" with plans to come to New York from Canada. They also said he sent the agent a photo of Times Square, saying, ""We seriously need a car bomb at times square. . Look at these crowds of people!""

The unsealed court documents also alleged that El Bahnasawy also expressed a desire to ""shoot up concerts cuz they kill a lot people. ... We just walk in with guns in our hands. That's how Paris guys did it,"" the papers said in an apparent reference to the slaughter by men armed with assault weapons at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance of the rock group Eagles of Death Metal in 2015.

The documents said El Bahnasawy purchased and arranged to have bomb-making equipment, including 18 kilograms of hydrogen peroxide, shipped to the agent in the U.S. ahead of the planned attack.

People walk on a subway platform in New York on June 22, 2016. The city's subway system was a target in an ISIS-inspired plot, said authorities.

The RCMP issued a statement saying it collaborated with the FBI in the investigation that led to El Bahnasaw's arrest.

""This investigation is a good example of how law enforcement must continually work together to rapidly to gather evidence, irrespective of where that evidence may be found, to interdict those who would commit terrorist atrocities,"" it says.

The charges against El Bahnasawy include conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, both which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

El Bahnasawy is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12, 2017. His attorney, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment Friday.

American justice officials said extradition proceedings are ongoing in Pakistan and the Philippines to bring the other two suspects to the U.S. to face the charges.

“Sometimes we think we think we can cross a river and the hardest thing to understand is that we must wait,” Nicaragua’s vice president Rosario Murillo told state radio, warning people to avoid dangerous waters. “It’s better to be late than not to get there at all.”

Costa Rica’s government declared a state of emergency, closing schools and all other non-essential services.

Highways in the country were closed due to mudslides and power outages were also reported in parts of country, where authorities deployed more than 3,500 police.

The Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Nate could produce as much as 15 inches in some areas of Nicaragua, where schools were also closed.

Nate is predicted to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by the time it hits the US Gulf Coast on Sunday, NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen said.

At about 11pm EDT (0300 GMT) Nate was some 95 miles east-southeast of the Honduran island of Guanaja, moving northwest at 12 mph, the NHC said.

Blowing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, Nate was expected to move across eastern Honduras on Thursday and enter the northwestern Caribbean Sea overnight.

The storm will be near hurricane intensity when it approaches Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula late on Friday, where up to 8 inches of rain were possible, the NHC said.

Nate is expected to produce 6 to 10 inches of rain in southern Honduras, with up to 15 inches in some areas, the NHC said.

The NHC said a hurricane watch was issued from Morgan City, Louisiana, to the Mississippi-Alabama border, including metropolitan New Orleans, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake Maurepas.

US officials from Florida to Texas told residents on Thursday to prepare for the storm. A state of emergency was declared for 29 Florida counties and the city of New Orleans.

“The threat of the impact is increasing, so folks along the northern Gulf Coast should be paying attention to this thing,” the NHC’s Feltgen said.

In Mississippi, the US Environmental Protection Agency plans to release as a precautionary measure 40 million gallons (151 million liters) of acidic water from storage ponds at a Pascagoula waste site.

The release to a drainage bayou is intended to prevent a greater spill during the storm, the EPA said, adding there are no anticipated impacts to the environment.

You choose the second from cheapest and hope no one notices, especially if you’re on a first date.

Just when you think you’ve survived the ordeal, your waiter is back asking who would like to “sample the wine”. Cue rabbit-in-headlights eyes from everyone at the table.

While there’s no shame in being a wine novice, there are certain situations where we’d all rather not expose ourselves as amateurs.

With that in mind, we spoke to two wine experts to find out how to fake it ’til you make it.

John Fedele via Getty Images

1) What should you do if a wine list is boggling your mind?

If you look down at a wine list in a restaurant or bar and don’t recognise a single name, don’t panic, there are ways to navigate the list without admitting you don’t know what you’re doing.

Katie Smith, national account executive at Bibendum Wine, says you shouldn’t just go for the second cheapest bottle.

“A good restaurant will have their wine list separated by style. This can often help you more than flowery tasting notes,” she tells HuffPost UK.

You should also consider asking the waiter, waitress or sommelier for a recommendation based on your tastes.

“Telling staff what style of wine you normally like helps, for example, ‘light-bodied and dry’, ‘rich and spicy’,” Katie adds.

“There are also some brilliant apps out there like Plonk or Vivino, which allow you to scan or search for a bottle of wine and give you a description and ratings.”

Alternatively Café Rouge’s resident wine expert Richard Pryor recommends working out how much you want to spend, then adding 10%.

“Towards the bottom of the list, quality improves dramatically with only small increases in price due to the fact that all the fix costs are the same (transport, bottling, duty etc.)” he tells HuffPost UK.

2) What are you meant to do when asked if you’d like to ‘sample the wine’ before pouring?

When a restaurant asks you if you’d like to sample the wine before they pour you should go for it, because this is your chance to see if it’s corked.

Richard explains: “This is not bits of cork floating about in the glass, but a chemical compound called trichloroanisole which can be found in about 5% of wines bottled under cork and results in a mouldy, wet cardboard sort of a smell.”

Katie agrees that this process “is not just for wine snobs” and says you should start by looking at the wine to see if it is nice and bright in colour.

“If it’s cloudy or hazy that could be signs of a fault. If there is sediment in your glass, the restaurant should have decanted this out as it can be unpleasant to drink,” she says.

“If you see crystals have formed in your glass that look like shards of glass, don’t panic. These are completely harmless and often happen when a wine hasn’t been overly filtered, which is the case with some organic or natural wines.”

The next thing to do is swirl the wine around in your glass using the stem to “allow oxygen in the air into the wine, which enhances the aromas”.

“Next give it a good sniff,” Katie continues. “This is important for checking if there are any faults. If there is a cork taint then the wine can smell musty.”

She added that faults can also happen with screw-cap wines.

“If you smell rotten eggs or nail varnish remover, send it back straight away,” she says.

“You can also check for faults by having a taste. Practice drawing the wine around in your mouth so your taste buds get the full impact. If the wine doesn’t taste quite right, don’t be afraid to query it with staff.”

Unfortunately if you simply don’t like the wine you’ve chosen at this stage there’s very little you can do about it. Richard explains that in this case, the customer isn’t always right.

“I’m afraid it’s your fault. The best way round this is to ask whether you could have a quick taste at the point of ordering it,” he says.

“Any restaurant that refuses you this perfectly reasonable request doesn’t deserve your patronage.”

3) What’s a go-to safe order for red, white and rosé wine?

For Katie, wine choices really depend on personal taste.

“If you are in a big group and want some crowd-pleasing options, then a merlot - a medium-bodied, easy-drinking red - is a safe bet,” she says.

“For white wine, Sauvignon Blanc is a popular choice. It’s crisp and dry and versatile with lots of different dishes.”

She says rosé is a tricky one because preferences often depend on whether or not you have a sweet tooth. If you do, there’s nothing wrong with Zinfandel.

“Try Provence rosé from the South of France if you are looking for something drier and food-friendly,” Katie adds.

Meanwhile Richard recommends picking “a nice bottle of Burgundy” if in doubt.

“The reds are almost all Pinot Noir and the whites Chardonnay, so will please the vast majority,” he says.

Where rosé is concerned, Richard advises looking for the “palest pink hue” to ensure “a crisp, mouth-watering glass”.

Katie points out that drinking red wine with chocolate or white wine with steak isn’t usually recommended, but “you should never feel like an amateur whatever you order” because “exploring different varieties is one of the most fun things about the wine world”.

4) What wine should you bring if you’re going to a dinner party?

If you want to be a real wine geek, Katie says you should check what food your host is serving before selecting your wine.

“Again there are some great apps out there like Pocket Wine which gives you a food and wine pairing guide with specific dishes and food types,” she says.

“Malbec is a good choice if red meat is being served and an off-dry Riesling is fabulous with Asian-inspired spices.”

Most importantly don’t get stressed about presenting your host with the “right wine” - you can always suggest they save it for another day if they’ve already purchased a perfect pairing.

5) Cork or screw-top? Does it really make a difference?

A recent study by Oxford University reportedly found that seeing and hearing a cork popping can psychologically make us believe that the wine is better quality. But according to Katie, while we may have positive associations with corked wine, it isn’t always better.

“It’s a complete myth that screw-cap wines are lower quality. Screw caps are brilliant for preserving the freshness in wine and are less likely to be faulty than wines with a cork closure,” she says.

“Cork is better for wines intended to age, as it is a natural material that allows the wine to ‘breathe’ a little over time.”

Perhaps surprisingly, Richard says he actually prefers screw-top wine over corked.

“Put simply, we Brits are far too polite or lacking in confidence when it comes to making a fuss when a wine’s corked, meaning far too many people are buying and drinking corked wines,” he says.

“The screw-top solves this problem. Fortunately, the glorious snobbery inherent in the wine trade means the cork and the theatre that goes with it will be with us for a while.”

Ça semblait amusant. Cependant, on était quand même nerveux tous les deux, même s'il n'y avait pas de raison de l'être. Quand quelqu'un prend des photos de vous de cette manière, c'est difficile de relaxer. Mais on a tous deux eu beaucoup de plaisir.» - Neal S.

2. Nishant et Laura

«La séance photo a vraiment capturé notre connexion authentique de façon naturelle. Quelques fois, on était tellement concentrés sur nos bisous et nos frottements que le photographe s'est éclipsé sans même qu'on s'en rende compte! La séance photo était une bonne façon de ralentir et de se concentrer sur rien d'autre que notre amour pendant une heure.» - Laura G.

3. Kaitlin et Alex

«Il y a quelque chose qui se passe lorsqu'on voit les photos pour la première fois. Elles sont vraies et honnêtes. Elles sont des œuvres d'art, et les sujets sont vous et votre partenaire. C'est magique et c'est impressionnant. Vous retombez en amour à nouveau, non seulement avec votre partenaire, mais aussi avec vous-même. Vous vous voyez à travers les yeux de votre partenaire et c'est un cadeau inimaginable.» - Kaitlin S.

4. Alex & Kris

«On a mis du Miguel, on a ouvert les portes du balcon, on a bu du champagne avec notre photographe Steph et on a eu beaucoup de plaisir. C'était un moment d'affection intense pour nous. Kris a toujours été plus réservée et énigmatique avec sa sensualité, mais elle a vraiment sorti le grand jeu à notre séance photo et ça l'a aidée à accepter ce côté d'elle-même en public. C'était libérateur et ça nous a permis de nous voir d'un regard nouveau.» - Alex P.

5. Denise et Zach

«Si Zach était vraiment à l'aise à l'idée de la séance photo, j'étais terrifiée. Après avoir eu des enfants, la dernière chose que je voulais faire était de me déshabiller en face d'un étranger. J'y suis allée parce qu'il m'a encouragée. Cependant, les photographes Jennifer et Bryan m'ont fait sentir à l'aise. Ils ont renforcé ma confiance et m'ont bien dirigée. C'est devenu un rendez-vous galant pour moi et Zach. Je suis sortie de la séance photo en me sentant bien à propos de moi-même. Plusieurs photos ont été prises quand on n'en avait aucune idée et ça nous a vraiment montré comment on se regarde. C'était génial.» -Denise R.

6. Alexis et Adam

«On a décidé de faire une séance photo de style boudoir pour se rappeler de ce moment exact de nos vies ensemble. On allait devenir parents. Nous étions de nouveaux propriétaires, jeunes et en amour. J'aime toujours capturer des moments comme ceux-ci et pouvoir m'en rappeler plus tard.» -Alexis K.

7. Kyle et Tobi

«Tobi et moi aimons la photographie, surtout la photographie portrait. Nous étions au début de notre relation quand nous avons décidé de faire la séance. Par contre, ça semblait comme le moment idéal parce qu'on était obsédés par ce nouvel amour. Je voulais des photos pour capturer la chair de poule que j'avais au toucher de ma nouvelle partenaire.» - Kyle D.

8. Maggie et Cameron

«À ce moment-ci dans notre relation, nos corps sont un sujet très vrai et très difficile dans nos vies. J'ai eu des problèmes de santé qui ont causé une prise de poids, et Cameron (qui faisait la transition de femme à homme) n'avait pas eu sa chirurgie encore, donc je ne savais pas comment être intime avec quelqu'un d'autre et je ne savais pas comment ces moments captés sur caméra allaient se passer. Finalement, c'était libérateur. Je pense vraiment que c'était un point tournant pour nous. Depuis, on partage nos corps avec l'autre de façon plus ouverte.» -Maggie H.

9. Sarah et Samantha

«Ma femme Samantha était prête à déployer avec la marine, donc on voulait faire quelque chose de spécial. Elle est vraiment gênée et elle était nerveuse, mais notre photographe Ashley l'a aidée à se sentir à l'aise et à être la plus naturelle possible. Je crois honnêtement que faire la séance a fait une différence dans son déploiement. C'est génial d'avoir ces photos intimes comme rappel de notre amour pour l'autre.» - Sarah R.

10. Natalie et Chris

«À la base, la séance était seulement pour moi. Chris, mon copain, travaillait sur son ordinateur portatif à la table de la cuisine. Je voulais mettre du piquant dans notre séance photo, donc je lui ai dit de mettre son complet et de venir s'amuser! Notre relation a toujours été audacieuse, et être photographiée en lingerie avec un bel homme l'a rendue encore plus excitante! On a adoré ça.» -Natalie P.

You are unable to agree with your partner on expectations.","At the beginning of a new relationship, you’ll be forgiven for seeing everything through rose-tinted glasses - dreaming about your future together is part and parcel of the honeymoon period.

But once the lustful haze has worn off, you’ll realise your once perfect human being is also prone to their fair share of imperfections. Sorry, guys.

This disconnect between your hopes and reality may be difficult to get your head around, but that doesn’t mean it’s all over.

Social psychology professor, Eli Finkel, from Northwestern University, Illinois, who has just written a new book, The All-or-Nothing Marriage, on the topic, told The Atlantic that in modern relationships we are overly idealistic and expect too much from our partners, which means we can never be truly fulfilled.

“The main change has been that we’ve added, on top of the expectation that we’re going to love and cherish our spouse, the expectation that our spouse will help us grow, help us become a better version of ourselves, a more authentic version of ourselves,” said Finkel.

HuffPost UK asked Relate counsellor Peter Saddington, about this phenomenon, and he says: “Some people do have unrealistically high expectations of their partner, although it’s also common for people to have very low ones. The truth is that no relationship is perfect so setting your expectations too high may lead to a lot of disappointment and heartache.”

He shared six tell-tale signs that you may have your bar set too high.

1. You always idealise other people’s relationships.

They say no one knows what a relationship is like behind closed doors and putting other people’s relationships on a pedestal is a sign that you could be setting yourself up for failure.

Saddington said: “Our parents’ relationship can be a huge influence here – if we think they seemed like the perfect couple, we may set our expectations quite high. We also have a tendency to compare current partners to our exes.

“If our ex was a brilliant cook or was very affectionate for example, we may expect the same from our new partner, but it’s important to remember that everyone is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses.”

2. You compare your relationship to fiction.

We can all fall guilty of lusting after a knight in shining armour (especially when Disney makes them seem so damn appealing), but we need to embrace our partner entirely - warts and all.

Saddington said: “Hollywood films and romantic novels can also have an influence, by leading us to believe that there’s one perfect person out there who’ll meet all of our needs. This myth of the one can mean people don’t feel the need to work at their relationship. If there are problems, they may think they’ve made the wrong choice of partner.

“The truth is that no relationship is perfect so setting your expectations too high may lead to a lot of disappointment and heartache.”

3. You expect your partner to spend all their time with you.

Obviously everyone wants to spend time with their partner, and have mutual interests and hobbies to share, but there is a difference between enjoying their company and requiring they be present 24/7.

“We rely on our partners for so much these days but it’s healthy to have some separate interests and to enjoy the company of friends and family. It means you’ll have more to talk about when you’re together,” said Saddington.

Not only that, but you will find that spending all your time with your partner makes you both logistically and emotionally dependent on them.

4. You believe you should be showered with romantic gifts.

A kind gesture or unexpected cuppa goes a long way, but expecting your partner to constantly shower lavish gifts might mean you are setting yourself to be disappointed. After all, you shouldn’t need to be bought.

“Expecting your partner to buy you gifts and make romantic gestures all of the time may be unrealistic,” said Saddington.

“Of course, the odd thoughtful surprise is lovely but it doesn’t determine the quality of your relationship. Trust, open communication and understanding are more important so try to focus on these.”

5. You get frustrated when they don’t read your mind.

Often a lack of communication can present big problems in a relationship, mainly when you think your partner doesn’t understand you. Remember something crystal clear to you, may not be so obvious to them. So give your partner the benefit of the doubt and try not to talk in riddles.

Saddington said: “Sometimes we expect our partners to be mind-readers but it’s unrealistic to think they’re going to know exactly what you’re thinking all of the time. If you’re angry or upset, talk to them about it and explain why, rather than expecting them to know the answer.”

6. You are unable to agree with your partner on expectations.

The last sign that you might be expecting too much, is if neither of you can agree on what is reasonable. This might not apply to every relationship - especially if there is an imbalance of power or emotional abuse - but if you consider your partner to be rational, caring and invested, maybe it’s time to look at what you’re asking.

“Do this as early on in the relationship if you can but even if you’ve been together for years, it’s still worth having the conversation and reviewing your expectations over time as you both change and grow together. If you think their expectations are unrealistic then talk it through,” said Saddington.",6 Tell-Tale Signs That Your Expectations Of A Partner Are Set Too High,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/expectations-of-your-partner-are-too-high-signs-relationship_uk_59d4e324e4b04b9f92068f1c

""It was Dr. Murphy's decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""We thank him for his many years of tireless work on mental health issues here in Congress and his service to the country as a naval reserve officer.""

Murphy had initially said he would retire at the end of his term and take ""personal time"" in the coming weeks to ""seek healing.""

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Tuesday that a woman who'd had an affair with Murphy called him out for his publicly pro-life views in a text message after he asked her to have an abortion during an ""unfounded pregnancy scare.""

""You have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,"" Shannon Edwards texted Murphy in January, according to the Post-Gazette.

The Post-Gazette report was published the day Murphy cast a vote in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Murphy admitted to having an affair with a ""personal friend"" in September.

""This is nobody's fault but my own, and I offer no excuses,"" Murphy said then in a statement. ""To the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me.""

Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Democrats would ""be closely tracking"" Murphy's district.

Doch der Bereich im Gesicht, in dem ihr die Pickel bekommt, sagt mehr über eure Gesundheit aus, als ihr denkt

Oben im Video seht ihr, was die verschiedenen Stellen bedeuten

Dass Stress, Hormone oder eine falsche Ernährung für unreine Haut verantwortlich sein können, ist schon länger bekannt. Spannend ist aber, wie viel eigentlich die Stelle, an der die Pickel auftreten, über deren Ursache aussagt.

Laut dem Dermatologen Joshua Zeichner vom dermatologischen Institut des Mt. Sinai Krankenhaus in New York, lassen sich daraus nämlich einige Schlüsse ziehen.

Stresshormone sorgen für mehr Pickel

So ist für Pickel in der T-Zone, also der Stirn und der Nase, vor allem Stress verantwortlich.

Fehlender Schlaf und emotionale Belastungen sorgen dafür, dass Stresshormone, wie Adrenalin ausgeschüttet werden und so die Talgproduktion der Haut gefördert wird.

Da dieser Bereich mit den Lungen, dem Herzen, sowie der Leber verbunden ist, können Pickel laut chinesischer Medizin aber auch auf Probleme mit dem Blutdruck hindeuten oder auf übermäßigen Alkoholkonsum.

Von Unreinheiten an Kinn, Kieferpartie und Hals sind oft Frauen betroffen. Das liegt vor allem an den wechselnden Hormonen, die sich vor allem einige Tage vor der Periode ändern.

Das männliche Hormon Testosteron ist vermehrt im Körper zu finden, wodurch die Talgdrüsenzellen stimuliert werden.

Unreine Haut kann auch auf Darmprobleme hinweisen

Unreinheiten in der Kiefergegend, weisen gelegentlich aber auch auf Probleme mit dem Dickdarm hin, die oft von industrielle stark verarbeitenden Lebensmittel ausgelöst werden.

Das National Center for Biotechnology Information erklärt, dass der Einfluss der Ernährung auf Pickel und Akne zur Zeit noch sehr umstritten ist.

Dennoch wird vermutet, dass vor allem Milchprodukte und raffinierter Zucker unreine Haut fördern.

Auch fettiges oder sehr säurehaltiges Essen kann für mehr Irritationen im Bereich des Mundes und der Mundwinkel verantwortlich sein.

Zeichner: ""Drückt eure Pickel niemals aus""

Für Ausbrüche am Haaransatz sind vor allem ölige Haar- und Reinigungsprodukte verantwortlich.

So können Haarpflegeprodukte und Rückstände von Produkten zur Gesichtsreinigung die Haut in diesem Bereich reizen.

Zur Behandlung von Unreinheiten hat der Dermatologe einen klaren Tipp.

“Drückt eure Pickel niemals aus. Am besten versucht ihr euer Gesicht so wenig wie möglich zu berühren. Denn das verschlimmert das Ganze nur”.

Zeichner empfiehlt stattdessen, das Gesicht zweimal täglich mit einem ph-neutralen Produkt sanft zu reinigen.

So seid ihr die lästigen Pickel schnell wieder los.

“In North Korea, our goal is denuclearization,” he said. “We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life. We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening. And it will be done, if necessary, believe me.”

During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if needed to defend itself or US allies.

The President on Thursday also had tough words for Iran, saying the country had not lived up to the spirit of an agreement forged with world powers to curb its nuclear program.

Trump has filled top posts within his administration with military generals, including his chief of staff, retired General John Kelly, and national security adviser, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. McMaster, who normally dresses in civilian clothes at the White House, wore his uniform for the meeting.

Without being specific, Trump pressed the leaders to be faster at providing him with “military options” when needed.

“Moving forward, I also expect you to provide me with a broad range of military options, when needed, at a much faster pace. I know that government bureaucracy is slow, but I am depending on you to overcome the obstacles of bureaucracy,” he said during their cabinet room meeting.",Donald Trump's 'Calm Before The Storm' Comment Sparks Worried Speculation,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/06/donald-trump-calm-before-the-storm_n_18201336.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

""The treatment seemed to be successful, but in March 2016 I had to undergo surgery as the cancer had spread,"" he said.

Read the full statement below:

In April 2017, while in Morocco I fell and sprained my shoulder. I began to feel an imbalance when I was walking and my left eye was troubling me. Another tumour was discovered and subsequently, in September 2017, I had emergency treatment, and the tumour was neutralised.

It is a tough battle but I am greatly encouraged by the good wishes of family, friends and everyone who has supported my musical journey, which remains the greatest source of my inspiration.

I have cancelled my commitments for the immediate future as I will need all my energy to continue this fight against prostate cancer.

I'm in a good space, as I battle this stealthy disease, and I urge all men to have regular tests to check your own condition. Ask questions, demand answers and learn everything you can about this cancer, and tell others to do the same.

Caroline Lucas said May’s disastrous party conference speech must have been “an excruciating experience”, but that her resignation - being called for by a number of Conservative MPs, led by former party chairman Grant Shapps - would fail to address any problems.

Speaking to HuffPost UK ahead of the Greens’ annual conference, which kicks off this weekend, Lucas said: “On a personal level my heart goes out to her, in the sense that it was clearly an excruciating experience that you wouldn’t wish on anybody. Having said that, the real disaster of that speech was not the prime minister’s cough, but more what was in the speech and a complete failure to address the overwhelmingly important issues of the day.

“On housing, for example, the idea that an extra five thousand council houses a year is really going to go anywhere towards addressing the absolute housing crisis that we face is just for the birds and a demonstration of just how out of touch the Tories are.

Empics Entertainment Theresa May struggles through her conference speech

“The content of the speech was what was so incredibly disheartening - the lack of vision and the lack of any kind of understanding about what people want to hear.

“They are well aware that they face a problem, that they need to be attracting more young people to their cause, and yet what they were offering was just so insignificant and unhelpful, it’s really hard to see what they were thinking.”

Lucas, who is co-leader of her own party, said changing the leadership of the Conservative party would do nothing to address “this absolute Brexit catastrophe at its heart”.

“Whoever takes over from Theresa is still going to have that same challenge,” she added.

“They have obviously got a completely split parliamentary party on the issue, they can’t keep the same line more than a couple of days and the negotiations themselves seem to be going incredibly badly.

“When you’ve got the CBI themselves saying to the Conservative Party ‘pull yourselves together, you’re incompetent and incoherent’, that surely demonstrates just what an abysmal state the party is in, so changing leader isn’t going to help them.”

Empics Entertainment The Greens want a 'ratification referendum' on Brexit

The Greens have long been pushing for a ‘ratification referendum’ on Brexit - a second chance for voters to decide whether they really want Britain to leave the EU once exit negotiations are complete.

Lucas said she hoped MPs from other parties who were concerned about the Brexit process would back her proposal for a second vote.

“We need to banish any ideas of this extreme Brexit, that no deal is better than a bad deal, all of this empty rhetoric that does not bear any scrutiny, because it’s quite clear that no deal would be an asbolute disaster for the economy,” she said.

“Get rid of that and look very seriously at the proposals for remaining inside the single market and maintaining freedom of movement.

“One way that both parties [Labour and Conservatives] could square the circle of the dilemma they have at the moment in terms of split views is to support the Green proposal for a ratification referendum.

“The process was started by the British people, who voted [Leave] by a narrow majority, and it feels to me that it should go back to them to have the final sign-off.

“If they like what they see, fine, but if they don’t, and if on balance they would prefer to remain inside the EU now they are equipped with an awful lot more information than they had when they voted to leave, then they should have the final say.”

PA Archive/PA Images Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley

Lucas, who job shares her leadership position with former Parliamentary hopeful Jonathan Bartley, said she hoped the hung parliament produced as a result of the 2017 election would afford her more chances to work with rival MPs.

“One positive thing I have discovered about Westminster is that contrary to some of the appearances, it is possible to work cross-party on a case-by-case basis.

“You can make headway on different issues and that obviously is crucial, because none of the opposition parties on their own are going to be enough - so we need to work together.”

The Greens have so far enjoyed a surprisingly civil working relationship with environment secretary Michael Gove, who since returning to the cabinet has pledged to champion a number of environmental issues, including animal welfare, air quality and tackling climate change.

“To his credit he does appear to want to make his mark on this department which is good, because recently we have had ministers who didn’t seem to care very much about the brief they have been given,” Lucas said.

“He is a big beast and he wants to make his mark, and as long as he is doing that in a positive way, then that’s great.

Leon Neal via Getty Images Caroline Lucas says environment secretary Michael Gove is a 'big beast'

“That does not wipe clean his own voting record in this area - which has been far from positive - and there are plenty of challenges in terms of how he is going to square this new found environmental zeal with the fact the government is continuing to promote fracking and nuclear energy and airport expansion and HS2 and road-building and all of those other things.

“On the one hand, the idea that Gove is turning the Conservative Party into the real Green Party is genuinely laughable, but on the other hand, if we do now have somebody in that department who for whatever reason, whether they believe in it or not, is willing to be more positive and engage more seriously with these issues then that’s good, but the jury is out to see which way it goes.”

She said the Green conference, which is being held in Harrogate, Yorkshire, will focus on Brexit and its impact on the environment as its main theme.

Bartley will be in the spotlight as he delivers the leaders’ speech on Monday, and among policy motions to be voted on are proposals for a new bank holiday to celebrate “the contribution of migrants and people of colour” and enabling Parliamentary candidates to remain in place up to 18 months after a general election without being subjected to a new selection process.

Σύμφωνα με την ίδια στο σημείο έσπευσαν ισχυρές αστυνομικές δυνάμεις, ενώ από αέρος πετούσαν ελικόπτερα.

Ο οδηγός επίσης τραυματίστηκε. Αρχικά μεταφέρθηκε στο νοσοκομείο, κατόπιν συνελήφθη και παραμένει υπό κράτηση σε αστυνομικό τμήμα στο βόρειο Λονδίνο, σύμφωνα με ανακοίνωση της αστυνομίας.

Στις φωτογραφίες που κυκλοφόρησαν στο Twitter διακρίνεται ο οδηγός, που φορά μπλε πουκάμισο, να βρίσκεται πεσμένος στο έδαφος, ενώ δύο άλλοι άνθρωποι τον κρατούν ακινητοποιημένο, ενδεχομένως περαστικοί.

L'élection d'Emmanuel Macron et l'hymne européen résonnant dans la cour du Louvre ont rassuré les esprits et contribué à replacer la France au centre du jeu et c'est tant mieux.

Le discours sur l'Europe prononcé par le Président de la République en Sorbonne a été largement salué. Parce qu'il donne un élan nécessaire à notre Union en panne et parce qu'il propose des actions concrètes. Sur de nombreux sujets brûlants, au plus près des préoccupations des Européens (défense, sécurité, intégration économique, immigration, politique sociale, climat...) il apporte une réponse attendue à la question de ""l'Europe pour quoi faire?"".

Mais si les motifs de satisfaction sont nombreux et mérités, les récentes déclarations sur l'Europe du Président de la République soulèvent néanmoins quelques questions. Deux sujets en particulier, d'ordre institutionnel, ont été brièvement abordés par M. Macron, peut-être trop brièvement. Loin d'être anecdotiques, ils méritent quelques éclaircissements et interrogent quant à la nature exacte de l'Europe voulue par le Président de la République.

La première est l'idée de créer un ""Parlement de la zone euro"". En bonne place dans son discours d'Athènes, elle ne figurait plus en Sorbonne. Est-ce pour prendre le temps de la réflexion ou bien cette proposition a-t-elle été définitivement –et fort opportunément- abandonnée? L'idée d'une Europe dans laquelle certains Etats membres pourraient avancer plus vite que d'autres sur certaines politiques est non seulement légitime: elle est sans nul doute le meilleur moyen de sortir l'Union de sa paralysie actuelle. Mais faut-il pour cela, comme le proposait M. Macron, créer un Parlement réservé aux seuls élus de la zone euro? Faut-il pour sauver l'Europe créer de nouvelles institutions, concurrentes de celles qui existent déjà? Qu'est-ce à dire sinon à vouloir affaiblir le Parlement actuel qui joue désormais un rôle majeur? Ne serait-il pas plus judicieux de modifier le règlement du Parlement européen pour que les éventuels textes ne concernant que la zone euro soient portés à la connaissance de tous les députés mais négociés et votés uniquement par les députés issus des pays membres de l'Eurogroupe?

Les citoyens européens ont déjà suffisamment de mal à comprendre le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne pour ne pas leur proposer demain de voter pour deux Parlements européens différents. L'Europe souffre de sa complexité, n'en ajoutons pas! Et au-delà de cet enjeu de lisibilité et d'efficacité de nos institutions, prenons garde à ne pas dissoudre l'Union européenne dans une multiplication de ""clubs privés"". Car qui s'opposera demain, et avec quels arguments, à la création d'un ""Parlement de la mer Baltique"" ou d'un ""Parlement des eurodéputés polonais et hongrois?"" Encourager la coopération renforcée entre certains Etats membres ne doit pas conduire à en exclure d'autres. La nuance entre les deux est subtile, mais la création de nouvelles institutions exclusives l'effacerait à coup sûr.

Le Président Macron propose par ailleurs, pour les prochaines élections européennes de 2019 et de 2024, d'établir des listes transnationales, vieille idée soutenue de longue date par les partisans d'une Europe fédérale. Je respecte ceux qui pensent que le fédéralisme est la voie du salut pour le continent européen, même si je ne partage pas leur vision. Dans l'état actuel de crise de confiance que traverse l'Union européenne, un mouvement vers le fédéralisme serait sans doute le meilleur remède pour tuer le malade.

Les sondages d'opinion le montrent, nos concitoyens veulent une Europe qui les protège et qui prenne en compte leurs intérêts. Des listes transnationales, composées de dizaines de nationalités différentes, éloigneraient encore plus l'Europe des électeurs. Qu'auront à se dire ces différents candidats sur une même liste? Quels intérêts communs défendront-ils? Il est fort à craindre qu'avec des listes transnationales les programmes présentés aux électeurs se résument au plus petit commun dénominateur de politiques européennes au contenu devenu illisible. Quant aux députés élus sur de telles listes, ne leur reprochera-t-on pas d'être encore plus ""hors-sol""? Où pourrons-nous les rencontrer?

Enjambant le résultat défavorable des élections sénatoriales, le Président de la République est déjà passé aux élections de 2019 et considère à juste titre qu'il convient de les préparer dès à présent, au travers de grandes conventions démocratiques. Nous avons-là en effet une belle opportunité pour faire vivre la démocratie européenne que M. Macron appelle de ses vœux, une occasion unique pour redonner du sens à l'Europe.

Souhaitons que nos partis politiques se saisissent de ce débat, qu'ils investissent des candidats motivés et compétents, aptes à défendre les intérêts de leurs concitoyens et prêts à s'engager durablement. Mais de grâce ne multiplions pas inutilement les institutions et ne demandons pas aux électeurs français de voter pour des candidats qu'ils ne verront a fortiori jamais.

The same beliefs held by John Howard, the Australian Christian Lobby, Tony Abbott and conservative pundits such as Paul Kelly.

They should be careful what they wish for, because a wider understanding of religious freedom would threaten the many privileges faith groups continue to enjoy in this country. That's why Christian groups have opposed all new laws aimed at assuring religious freedom since 1980. By trading on an historical respect for faith, but seeking to protect only their own narrow range of beliefs, they risk eroding that respect even further.

Religious freedom cannot mean that one set of beliefs ought to take precedence over another, or that religious ideas should trump nonreligious ideas.

However, religious freedom is widely understood to be exclusive to faith-based beliefs. And, for the 'threat' argument to have any teeth, one must accept that society should actively discriminate in favour of religious convictions.

Cake makers, florists and wedding registrars must be allowed to act in accordance with their faith, notwithstanding the beliefs of those supporting the same-sex union. The 'threat' is that the law will force the faithful to act against their conscience.

This is framed as 'protection'. But, why are only religious beliefs worthy of protection? What this would mean in practice, is the faithful gain a special pass to exempt themselves from the laws of the land. But, paraphrasing George Orwell, why are some beliefs more equal than others?

Sabre-rattlers of religious freedom are running a campaign antithetical to their own agenda.

We generally don't exempt individuals from the law on account of their beliefs. Government employees who disagree with immigration policy cannot refuse to implement policy. Business owners cannot ignore laws which impinge on their conscience. Controversially, only religious organisations get the privilege of exemptions from anti-discrimination legislation.

But here's the problem -- freedom of belief was never intended as a magic wand for the faithful.

Article 18 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights vouchsafes ""freedom of thought, conscience and religion"", and protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, and the right to profess any belief. The progenitor of religious freedom is freedom of thought; which U.S. Supreme Court Judge Benjamin Cardozo described as ""the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom"".

There is no belief hierarchy where certain beliefs carry more weight than others -- beliefs are protected until they impinge on others. Religious liberty should not become a Trojan horse for perpetuating certain views.

Nor is religious freedom unlimited. The High Court of Australia has always enforced Section 116 rather narrowly, balancing religious freedom with the public good. In 1912 it upheld compulsory military training for boys in spite of their religious objections, and in the 1943 Jehovah's Witnesses case, it ruled that the Constitution did not protect the church from engaging in activities prejudicing the war effort. In Kruger v Commonwealth (1997) it was found that Section 116 allowed laws which indirectly prohibit the free exercise of religion.

Thus, according to our own High Court, the right to manifest religious beliefs is not absolute, and must exist in balance with other considerations.

In many countries, religious freedom is protected as part of a Bill of Rights along with other key freedoms. However, the same-sex marriage opponents explicitly reject a Bill of Rights, evidently, preferring religious freedom to remain unfettered by a modern understanding of human rights.

Which raises the question of how marriage equality represents a threat to our freedoms?

In an article for ABC Religion & Ethics, Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher described as follows, the supposedly dystopian future Australia which would result from legalising marriage equality:

evangelical business owners are threatened with legal action for discriminating against gay weddings,

religious schools would be forced to teach a state-approved tolerant 'gay friendly' curriculum,

religious instruction in secular state schools has been scrapped,

religious organisations have lost their charitable status, and now ""pay the same taxes and rates levied on any other business"".

What a prodigious slide down the slippery slope! Just how legalising same-sex marriage would suddenly result in the end of tax free status, is not explained. Even so, these 'consequences' are hardly horrifying.

Indeed, they are all issues in which freedom of thought, conscience and religion is balanced with the rights of individuals and the public good.

Religious freedom does not only apply to those who take the Bible literally. Equally, it applies to Christians who support same-sex marriage; to the 40 percent of LGBTQ people who are Christian, to those who hold spiritual beliefs, those of other faiths, and those with no faith.

Capturing the essence of religious liberty, the UK Secretary of Employment said in 2005, that a hallmark of a civilised society is respect for each other's beliefs. Safeguarding and balancing the rights of individuals in a pluralist society enables multiple belief systems to coexist in harmony.

Thus, sabre-rattlers of religious freedom are running a campaign antithetical to their own agenda. They should exercise caution with their blades, lest their wishes are granted.",Champions Of 'Religious Freedom' Should Be Careful What They Pray For,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/hugh-harris/champions-of-religious-freedom-should-be-careful-what-they-pray-for_a_23233274/

The Challenges Faced By A Prison Psychiatrist Severely psychiatrically unwell prisoners are people who, very likely, have been failed by services over and over again. They are very likely to have had horrific experiences (abuse seems to come as standard for the women, and even the men that I have assessed in prison). Sure, some of them have made poor choices and may have wronged others, and that can't be ignored. Nevertheless, for those who are too unwell to look out for themselves, we, as an apparently mature, developed society should step in and shoulder some of the responsibilities. It is not always simple; there are complications and barriers, but there are no excuses for floridly unwell psychotic prisoners to be trapped inside cells for weeks and months awaiting treatment.

At least 58 people were killed and 527 others wounded when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel late Sunday night. An estimated 22,000 concertgoers were at the festival when it was interrupted by rapid gunfire for approximately nine minutes around 10 p.m., causing widespread panic and bloodshed.

All but three of the people killed on Sunday have been identified, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Tuesday during a press conference.

Police officers found Paddock dead in his hotel room after the attack, apparently from a self-inflicted wound.

Paddock’s attack appeared to be premeditated, Lombardo said, citing the large number of weapons ― 23 total ― found in the gunman’s hotel room. This included five handguns, two shotguns and a “plethora of ammunition,” as well as a firearm with a possible “bump stock” modification that “enables a person to speed up ammunition,” Lombardo said.

Police also discovered cameras that Paddock had set up inside and outside of his hotel room, and they are evaluating whether there’s footage of the shooting.

“I anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,” Lombardo said.

Investigators are also in the process of reviewing body camera footage from police officers who were stationed at the music festival, as well as footage from concertgoers and hotel security cameras.

Authorities have uncovered some information about the attack, Lombardo added, but they would not publicly reveal all details because the investigation is ongoing. Paddock’s motive is still unclear.

Police are talking to Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, who was in the Philippines during the attack, and investigators plan to question her further when she returns to the U.S. Authorities say they don’t believe that Danley ― currently a person of interest ― was involved in the shooting, but Lomboardo said it is still unclear whether she knew Paddock was planning an attack.

Reuters reported later Tuesday that Danley had left the Philippines for the U.S. She arrived at the Los Angeles International Airport later that night, according to ABC News.",Suspect's Motive Still Unclear One Day After Mass Shooting At Las Vegas Festival,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-shooting-motive-still-unclear-one-day-later_us_59d3f17be4b06226e3f4441c

""I can never afford to buy cheap.""

Of course, she was talking about why buying more expensive goods would last longer than cheap ones destined to break, saving her cash in the long run.

But that phrase also has important repercussions when it comes to ethical or green practice for us all right now.

And if we want to protect our planet, we need to abide by them.

Bear this in mind: According to research by the United Nation's International Resource Panel, the global population, which is set to grow by 28%, is predicted to use 71% more resources per capita by 2050.

Without urgent steps to increase efficiency, the global use of metals, biomass, minerals - such as sand and other materials - will increase from 85 to 186 billion tonnes per year by 2050.

That increased level of production isn't good for emissions, and it won't be too clever when it comes to climate change, either.

So what can we do to help?

One thing is to move away from a culture of buying cheap without questioning where the product in your hand came from - or what it's doing to the environment as a whole.

And the good news is that things are slowly changing for the better.

More and more consumers understand the consequences of their consumption habits and therefore increasingly pay attention to the responsibility of their preferred companies and the brands they use in their purchasing decisions.

The raging debates about climate change, carbon offsetting, ocean pollution, human rights and child labour has made consumers more aware of the ecological, ethical and financial insecurity of our current consumption.

And it's vital we convince more to follow suit if we're going to move to a more sustainable future.

What we're seeing in some quarters is a new 'premium consumer' - who's not afraid to spend more money on an item if they know it's been ethically sourced and ethically produced.

We want to get people pay the premium price with a big smile on their face and be proud about it.

It's an ethos companies like my own have embraced.

For us, there's a reason our products - eco-friendly underpants - command a higher price than other undies on the shelves.

The material we use is not particularly cheap because of its origin; it's made from recycled materials, including salvaged ocean plastics and by-products of the manufacturing industry.

It's labour intensive.

Yet we also want to make a product that lasts, one that sticks two fingers up to modern 'throw-away-ism' habits.

And it's our hope that as more people start using this material in their own manufacturing, the price to the consumer will come down, making it even more appealing.

Let's say no to disposable culture and fast fashion and let's start thinking about the bigger picture.

Because if we don't, we'll all ultimately shoulder the cost.

Le premier cas est une violence, en effet, mais une violence faite à ceux qui soutenaient un coup d'État institutionnel, mené par une partie de l'État contre une autre partie de l'État (la generalitat catalane contre le gouvernement central). Une violence faite à ceux qui, soutenant de leur plein gré un référendum illégal, ont tenté d'empêcher la saisie des urnes illégales, ou en résistant, avec la violence dont ont été capables les centaines ou les milliers de personnes attroupées, décidées à ne pas laisser la police nationale ou la guardia civil faire son travail.

Des personnes heureuses et souriantes d'aller voter, comme si c'était la première fois de leur vie. Des zombies rêvant d'une république catalane qui, comme par magie, serait la solution à tous les problèmes de coupes budgétaires, notamment dans les domaines de la santé ou de l'éducation, ou au chômage, qui semble éternel. Une république qui serait administrée par les mêmes personnes qui ont imposé les coupes drastiques de ces dernières années. Une partie de la Catalogne se comporte comme un ado attardé, qui pense pouvoir prendre son indépendance de sa mère l'Espagne et voler de ses propres ailes, et compte à présent sur l'aide des Mossos d'Esquadra (force de police de la Catalogne), anges gardiens de ses prétentions indépendantistes, représentants béatifiés du nouvel ordre catalan, qui se figent dès qu'il s'agit d'empêcher des actes illégaux des indépendantistes.

Afin de démonter cette idée fausse, revenons sur quelques événements pas si lointains. Il y a cinq ans, le 14 novembre 2012, Esther Quintana, qui participait à une manifestation à Barcelone dans le cadre d'une grève générale, loin des préoccupations indépendantistes, a perdu un œil après avoir reçu une balle en caoutchouc tirée par un Mosso. À Tarragone, le même jour, un jeune garçon de 13 ans a eu le crâne fendu d'un coup de matraque. À cette occasion, personne n'est monté sur ses grands chevaux, et le conseiller intérieur de la generalitat, Felip Puig (du CiU) a même félicité tous les responsables de la police catalane, arguant que les Mossos avaient pour ordre de ""n'utiliser qu'au minimum le recours à la force"", ce que, selon lui, ils avaient fait.

Le scénario semblait écrit à l'avance par les deux camps. Seuls les Mossos sont peut-être passés à côté de ce scénario prévu en toute candeur par le gouvernement espagnol, qui donne l'air de ne rien comprendre et d'être dépassé par les événements

Jusqu'au 1er octobre, les Mossos traînaient une mauvaise réputation en raison d'actions qu'on pourrait sans difficulté qualifier de douteuses et qui concernent l'usage de la force contre des citoyens sans défense. Il suffit de fouiller dans les archives et dans les listes de blessés et de morts dans le cadre de leurs actions. Aujourd'hui, on en fait soudain des anges, surtout depuis qu'ils se sont érigés en défenseurs de l'indépendantisme et en exécutants fidèles des ordres de M. Trapero, un bon pacifiste à l'heure de réprimer les indépendantistes. Un autre fait notable a également eu lieu le 27 mai 2011. Ce jour-là, les Mossos ont fait irruption dans le campement du 15-M (lié aux Indignés) sur la place de Catalogne, dans une action qualifiée par la presse ""de grande violence"" contre les pacifistes qui campaient à cet endroit. On a comptabilisé plus de cent blessés parmi les personnes présentes. Cent blessés sur une seule place, face à six cents sur toute la Catalogne le 1er octobre. Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est que la comparaison n'est pas favorable aux Mossos.

Effectivement, ce qui s'est passé le 1er octobre dans les rues de Catalogne est une violence. Une violence de la part des deux camps, mais celle de la guardia civil et de la police nationale était plus visible. Beaucoup plus vendeuse que celle exercée par les dizaines de milliers de personnes qui tentaient d'empêcher le rétablissement de l'ordre constitutionnel rompu par la generalitat. Autre violence assez dure, celle infligée par la séance plénière du parlement catalan, qui a lancé la procédure de sécession unilatérale de l'Espagne, d'une partie de son territoire. C'est une violence peu médiatisée et qui ne fait pas couler le sang, ce qui en fait ne la rend pas moins néfaste. C'est une violence qui fait plus de dégâts, car elle sème la haine et la confusion chez les Catalans et les Espagnols qui assistent stupéfaits à la mise à mort de l'Etat espagnol, orchestrée par une partie de la classe politique catalane, avec l'aide de la population qui soutient les putschistes, des citoyens complices et désorientés qui ne savent pas où on veut les emmener ni pourquoi. Mais ces citoyens se dirigent vers l'inconnu le sourire aux lèvres, dans un bonheur ingénu qui les pousse à barrer des routes, à suivre une ""grève générale"", à soutenir le coup d'État institutionnel de la generalitat, et autres vétilles du même genre.

Il est certain que des violences ont été commises par les forces de l'ordre. Mais quel résultat peut-on espérer lorsqu'on envoie 20 ou 30 agents stopper 200, 300 ou 400 personnes décidées à les empêcher d'entrer dans les bureaux de vote afin qu'ils n'emportent pas les urnes ? Le scénario était écrit à l'avance par les deux camps. Seuls les Mossos sont peut-être passés à côté du scénario rédigé par le gouvernement, un gouvernement qui donne l'air de ne rien comprendre et d'être dépassé par les événements, un gouvernement qui, en définitive, ne fait rien d'autre que d'illustrer sa médiocrité. Ce qui est inouï, c'est qu'à ce stade on soit encore étonnés par ce qui se passe...

NEW ORLEANS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate made landfall near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 miles per hour on Saturday evening, threatening parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama with torrential rain and potential flooding.

Nate, the fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf and bearing down on the U.S. South.

As the hurricane struck at about 7 p.m. CDT (0000 GMT Sunday), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded its warning for New Orleans to a tropical storm. But Nate was expected to regain some strength and make a second landfall along the coast of Mississippi to the east.

""While it appears we're being spared ... our hearts go out to Mississippi,"" said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, a low-lying area in the New Orleans area.

The hurricane's center was expected to pass over portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee late Saturday through Sunday night, eventually weakening to a tropical depression. Before then, storm surges of up to 11 feet on the Mississippi-Alabama border were still possible, the NHC said.

Rainfall from Hurricane Nate could reach 100 million people https://t.co/jQUwp3qR55 pic.twitter.com/Vhf4NmB0xM — WLKY (@WLKY) October 7, 2017​​​​​​​

Earlier in the day, a state of emergency was declared in the three states, as well as in more than two dozen Florida counties.

Nate comes on the heels of three other major storms, Harvey, Irma and Maria, which devastated Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively. But as a Category 1, the weakest in the five-category ranking used by meteorologists, Nate appeared to lack the devastating punch of its predecessors.

Plaquemines Parish evacuated some 240 residents who were not protected by its levee system as the storm approached.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu lifted a curfew in the city on Saturday evening that was originally scheduled to last until Sunday morning. He said in a statement on social media however, that there was still a serious threat of storm surge outside levee areas.

Firefighters are helping with the emergency preparation.

ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI BRACE

In a statement, the City of Biloxi was warning its 46,000 residents that the highest storm surge would occur between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. and could reach 11 to 12 feet.

In Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey urged residents in areas facing heavy winds and storm surges to take precautions.

East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians, 3 to 6 inches and a maximum of 10 inches of rain was expected, the NHC said.

The Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians could see 2 to 5 inches with maximums of 7.

Major shipping ports across the central U.S. Gulf Coast were closed to inbound and outbound traffic on Saturday, as Nate intensified and storm surges of up 11 feet (3.74 m) were expected at the mouth of the Mississippi River.

The storm has curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.

Business owners board up their restaurant in the French Quarter.

Workers had been evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Before heading north into the Gulf, Nate brushed Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, home to beach resorts such as Cancun and Playa del Carmen, the NHC said.

The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.

Thousands were forced to evacuate their homes and Costa Rica's government declared a state of emergency.

Mel Arnold tabled his private member's bill on Tuesday, saying he was ""shocked to hear reports of firefighting equipment being stolen and vandalized during the worst wildfire season in British Columbia's written history.""

The North Okanagan—Shuswap MP said the idea behind Bill C-365 came to him while researching the Criminal Code. He noticed an apparent gap with the ""denunciation and deterrence of theft or damage to firefighting equipment.""

Arnold's home province of B.C. saw record-setting wildfires this summer. Over 1.2 million hectares have have been burned province-wide by wildfires this year.

B.C. Wildfire Service firefighter Jordain Lamothe takes a brief break while conducting a controlled burn to help prevent the Finlay Creek wildfire from spreading near Peachland, B.C., on Sept. 7, 2017.

On multiple occasions, some firefighting efforts had been complicated after crews reported their equipment stolen.

But despite the unfortunate circumstance of this year's record blazes, one Ottawa-based criminal defence lawyer thinks Arnold's bill is an unwise use of parliamentary resources.

Michael Spratt says the theft of firefighting equipment is already adequately dealt with by the law, as theft in general is illegal. And theft over $5,000 is already punishable with possible jail time.

He warned against making amendments to the Criminal Code, which already includes offences as specific as stealing cattle, theft from clam beds and mischief endangering life. Adding an additional offence such as stealing firefighting equipment is unnecessary, he said.

""The more complex and the larger the Criminal Code becomes, the more unwieldy it becomes,"" he told HuffPost Canada in an interview on Friday.

Focus on 'pressing and serious' issues: lawyer

Private members' bills are not given the same level of constitutional analysis and scrutiny as government bills, but Spratt thinks the MP's bill is a ""real loss of opportunity"" to focus the elected House on more ""pressing and serious"" issues.

""If we're looking to make a difference in criminal law and in increasing public safety and public health; bills tackling poverty or the overuse of jail as a solution to crime; or bills that might take steps to alleviate some of the serious problems that we have with the opioid epidemic would be a much better use of resources,"" he said.

In 2010, a little app called Instagram made its debut. The founders had no idea at the time but they were about to become a vehicle to change damaging and ingrained social norms.

The photo sharing app was the first visually focused social media platform, where regular people (yes, like us!) could say something through images. Before it, we were mainly influenced by models and celebrities in unattainable images from magazines, advertisements and pop culture.

Earlier on HuffPost:

Out of Instagram, people who previously didn't have a chance to express themselves emerged from the shadows because they finally felt comfortable sharing. Maybe it was because they started seeing others like them on social media. Maybe it was because influencers started using the medium to denounce damaging beauty ideals. Whatever it was, it worked.

David Vincent is Lise Watier's international makeup artist. As someone at the forefront of beauty, he sits on a unique perch in which to observe how social media has almost singlehandedly changed the game, and not just as it pertains to beauty.

""[Instagram and YouTube have] allowed the makeup world to evolve and be more fun and accessible — having multiple personalities showcase different products, and provide consumers with the opportunity to choose — a la carte — what content and information they subscribe to and engage with,"" he tells HuffPost Canada.

One of the most groundbreaking trends to emerge from Instagram and social media were ""beauty boys"" — males who are makeup artists or who just love wearing makeup. They may be straight, gay, gender fluid or transgender but at the end of the day, this came secondary to their immense talent and interesting content.

James Charles was the first. The U.S.-based YouTube personality was appointed the first male CoverGirl ambassador in 2016. Charles has since lost favour for some discriminatory remarks made on Twitter, but his appointment paved the way for a new generation of male beauty enthusiasts who are no longer afraid to discuss their passion for makeup openly.

A brief search with the hashtag #malemua #boyswithmakeup and #boywhoglam reveal how incredibly large the community is. Vincent sees this bold shift as an incredibly healthy direction for the beauty industry to go in.

""This new wave of acceptance has affected the beauty industry and will continue to do so,"" says Vincent. ""It provides two major opportunities for the industry: First and foremost, it allows beauty and fashion brands to be leaders in breaking down the barriers between traditional gender roles and what society considers to be 'normal'; and second, it opens up an entirely new consumer base for brands to engage with and teach.""

Breaking barriers is just what the trend has done. In 2017, Maybelline followed suit by tapping popular YouTuber, Manny Gutierrez aka Manny MUA as their newest campaign star. The formerly exclusive beauty world has been increasingly inclusive with the celebration of ""beauty boys"" and most recently, the appointment of transgender model, Munroe Bergdorf as the face of Illamasqua.

The rise of ""beauty boys"" is a long time coming but we can only hope for more progress when it comes to inclusion. There's still a lot of dissent and beauty brands that haven't shown many strides to change damaging social norms.

For example, the impressive skills of 10-year-old male makeup prodigy, Jack garnered almost as many negative reactions as positive.

The incredible response to Rihanna's Fenty Beauty launch is also an indication that more can be done to show that POC are welcome in the beauty world. It's 2017 and Rihanna's makeup line is only one of the first to offer a completely inclusive colour range.

Thank you to the 1 MILLION #fentyfamily that agree that beauty is inclusive of all. Welcome to the new generation of beauty. This is the future!! #1MILLIONFOLLOWERS #newgenerationofbeauty @badgalriri making #histoRIH! A post shared by FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA (@fentybeauty) on Sep 12, 2017 at 2:59pm PDT

For all the beauty boys and anyone who has been afraid to show who they are, Vincent has this advice:

""Don't be afraid to try! You can always remove makeup and re-apply - be creative and be open to ongoing learning. There is so much content available online, which is fantastic. Learn from the experience of others and show the world what you love.""

One backbencher texted the Government Chief Whip directly on Thursday evening to say the Prime Minister “needs to go and go now”, HuffPost UK has been told.

The campaign to force May to quit now has the support of five former Cabinet ministers, with a further two expected to join the plot in coming days, one MP revealed.

More than 30 MPs are now ready to privately tell her to step down, with the numbers growing since her party conference speech was spectacularly derailed by her failing voice, a prank protest and collapsing backdrop.

The PM was at home with husband Philip on a rare “day off” in her Maidenhead constituency on Thursday, and MPs keen on her resignation were hoping that Mr May could play a key role in persuading her to give up.

PA Wire/PA Images Husband Philip hugs Theresa May after her conference speech.

But if she refuses to resign before the weekend, the plotters are prepared for a “slow and gradual” process to remove her and have been taking tips from those who took months to oust Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader in 2003.

A Praetorian guard of May’s supporters turned out for her on the media, with Cabinet ministers and members of the backbench 1922 Committee pledging their loyalty.

Charles Walker, the committee’s vice chairman, went on the BBC and SkyNews to attack the plotters and insist that the PM was doing “a brilliant job”. “I think she comes out of it as heroic, to be perfectly honest, and strengthened,” he said.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said that many MPs and activists admired May for showing “guts and grace” in finishing her conference speech despite her poor health and a prankster presenting her with a fake P45.

Baroness Jenkin, a fellow founder of the Women2Win campaign to get more female Tory MPs, also said that “people should just back off” and let the PM get on with leading the Government at a crucial time for Brexit and other policies.

PA Archive/PA Images Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who was forced to quit in 2003.

One No10 insider said “the position today is much the same as it was yesterday” and senior allies added she had no intention to quit.

One former minister told HuffPost UK that some hoped the PM’s husband would play a key role this weekend, but added that he and fellow critics were prepared to wait months to build enough numbers to persuade her privately to leave office.

“I think Philip might in these circumstances say ‘darling, let’s not do this anymore’. But on balance that’s unlikely and she will need a further shove.”

A backbench MP texted Chief Whip Gavin Williamson directly on Thursday to say May “needs to go and go now”, and whips are aware of the size of the rebellion as key players have been open with No.10 about their intentions.

A couple more names were added to the list of dissenters during the day, but the plotters are ready to wait for May to quit by Christmas or even after the local elections next spring. They claim that even some serving ministers have expressed support but cannot go public.

The last 24 hours had “moved the dial” against her, one said, adding the idea she could remain in Downing Street until Brexit takes place in 2019 was “laughable”.

PA Archive/PA Images Government Chief Whip Gavin Williamson

If the council results are bad on May 3, and London is expected to see a further “Corbyn surge” in the capital, some rebels think it will be “May Day For May”.

Plotters have taken soundings from MPs who organised the overthrow of Duncan Smith in 2003.

It took six months from the first resignation from his Shadow Cabinet until he was defeated in a motion of no confidence, and then succeeded by Michael Howard. “We’re making progress, but we need to be patient,” an MP said.

To trigger a no confidence vote, 48 MPs would have to write to the 1922 committee chairman Graham Brady, but the plotters plan to instead get enough names to informally meet May in person and tell her she had lost their support.

Former minister Ed Vaizey confirmed that “quite a few” of her MPs want her to resign, while senior backbencher Mark Pritchard put on record that at least 30 MPs were involved in the plot to confront her as a delegation.

PA Archive/PA Images Former minister Ed Vaizey.

Speaking to BBC Oxford, the Wantage MP, who was sacked when Mrs May became Prime Minister in July 2016, said a number of Tory MPs “pretty firmly” want her to go. “I think there will be quite a few people who will now be pretty firmly of the view that she should resign.”

One rebel told HuffPost UK they felt May was “a decent woman with a strong sense of duty” but was now harming the Tory party’s popularity and chances of re-election.

They insisted there was “a coalition” of former Remain and Leave supporters and as such wanted a leadership election, rather than a ‘coronation’, to choose a successor to May.

Under the plan, the PM would pre-announce she was stepping down and stay in post to allow the contest to replace her.

However, a senior backbencher and Brexiteer told HuffPost UK that the actions of the plotters was “deeply, deeply dishonourable”. “They should put their names on letters and pin them on a noticeboard,” he said.

“If she’d collapsed on stage, and had an ‘Anthony Eden moment’ [the former PM collapsed due to ill health and quit within two months], then it would be different. But she didn’t. She had a cough and a cold.

“Obviously, we’re unhappy with the past week. But there’s a circling of the wagons going on because the biggest issue right now is Brexit. These people are the dispossessed Cameroons and don’t have any serious numbers. They say they have dozens, I very much doubt that.”

PA Archive/PA Images Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.

Supporters of the PM also point out that any attempt to force her out would inevitably lead to chaos, as the incoming leader would not be guaranteed the 100% backing of May’s allies, leading to further instability for a minority Government that already relies on the DUP.

Speaking in the annual Cambridge Union ‘no confidence in the Government’ debate on Thursday night, former Government Chief Whip and Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell weighed in behind the PM.

“It is not Theresa May’s fault that the Conference Set started to disintegrate or that the Prime Minister was suffering from a serious cold and wracking cough,” he said.

“It took courage of a high order to complete what was an important and interesting speech in impossible circumstances and I think all of us in politics should recognise and respect that.”

« C’est un drame, parce que c’est d’abord la perte d’une vie humaine. Et puis c’est une entreprise agricole de moins sur notre territoire », résume Jean Poirier, maire de Saint-Basile, un village d’environ 2600 âmes dans la région de Portneuf, et dont la moitié de l’économie tourne autour de l’agriculture.



Peu avant Noël dernier, Rudy Ducreux, un jeune agriculteur d’origine française, mettait fin à ses jours en se pendant dans l’atelier de sa ferme, la ferme Ducrêt, située à un jet de pierre de la mairie.



Pour les gens du milieu, ce jeune agriculteur était une étoile filante dans le firmament des fromagers québécois. « C’était quelqu’un d’assez réservé. Mais dès que vous parliez d’agriculture, vous constatiez combien il était passionné! Ses fromages au lait cru, dont Le Gaulois de Portneuf, étaient exceptionnels, irremplaçables. On ne peut pas se permettre de perdre des gens comme lui », raconte Charles Trottier, copropriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines qui, partageant la même profession, l’a bien connu.



Les deux fromagers artisans ont passé à travers la crise de la listériose de 2008, qui a fait 2 morts et 38 malades, et où le gouvernement a fait jeter aux poubelles des milliers de kilogrammes de fromage. Dans un rapport sur la gestion de cette crise (2010), le ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation (MAPAQ) exonérait les fromages au lait cru en identifiant la bactérie coupable, le pulsovar 93, une souche de la bactérie Lysteria monocytigene, provenant de fromages au lait pasteurisé. Mais le mal était fait, le Québec ne compte plus aujourd’hui, avec le départ de Rudy Ducreux, que quatre ou cinq fromagers au lait cru, selon Normand Côté, président de l’Association des fromagers artisans du Québec, qui regroupe une trentaine de membres.



Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j'ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents.

– Charles Trottier



Un métier sous très haute tension



Le métier de fromager-artisan relève des 12 travaux d’Hercule. Il faut traire des vaches 2 fois par jour, 365 jours par année, car on ne peut pas fermer le pis des vaches comme l’eau d’un robinet. Il faut ensuite fabriquer son fromage dans des conditions hygiéniques aussi salubres qu’une salle d’opération d’hôpital. Et il faut l’emballer, le distribuer et le vendre dans les boutiques spécialisées ou les restaurants.



« C’est trois métiers dans un », explique Charles Trottier. Sans compter qu’il faut composer avec le stress de la météo, la ferme étant une usine à ciel ouvert, pour produire des fourrages et des grains afin d’alimenter les vaches.



C'est dans l'établi de sa ferme que le jeune agriculteur Rudy Ducreux a mis fin à ses jours.



De plus, ce métier s’exerce sous une charge administrative kafkaïenne. « Pour opérer notre fromagerie, j’ai besoin de 16 à 17 permis différents, dont un de fabrication du ministère de l’Agriculture, un permis du ministère de l’Environnement, un permis de transport du lait, de vente au détail, de l’organisme de certification biologique, de la municipalité… » poursuit Charles Trottier.



Comme si cette lourdeur administrative ne suffisait pas, la décision du gouvernement Trudeau de permettre l’importation de 16 000 tonnes métriques de fromages fins en provenance d’Europe dès le 21 septembre prochain sous l’Accord économique et commercial entre le Canada et l’Union européenne (AECG) risque de faucher plusieurs fromagers artisanaux du terroir québécois. « Cette importation, c’est l’équivalent de 640 fermes comme la nôtre. Il est illusoire de penser que nous ne serons pas affectés », croit Charles Trottier.



Depuis ses débuts, l’homme d’affaires a investi 1,8 million $ dans la fromagerie, dont 750 000 $ depuis deux ans, entre autres pour construire une nouvelle étable. Et il compte sur sa clientèle québécoise -- plus de 30 000 personnes visitent la fromagerie chaque année -- pour survivre.



Contrairement à Charles Trottier, qui dit travailler plus de 105 à 110 heures par semaine pour faire tourner la fromagerie avec son associé et une vingtaine d’employés, « Rudy, lui, opérait seul, avec l’énergie de la jeunesse ».



C’est peut-être parce qu’il devait se battre envers et contre tous que Rudy Ducreux avait surnommé son produit vedette « Le Gaulois de Portneuf », gagnant d’un prix Caseus (2011), sorte de Jeux olympiques annuels du fromage.



Charles Trottier, co-propriétaire de la Fromagerie Des Grondines, a bien connu Rudy Ducreux, un champion fromager.



Combien d’agriculteurs se suicident?

« Je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure le cas de Rudy Ducreux est représentatif de l’état psychologique de l’ensemble des producteurs laitiers du Québec », dit Ginette Lafleur, doctorante au Centre de recherche et d’intervention sur le suicide et l’euthanasie (CRISE) à l’UQAM. Si les fromagers artisans ne transforment qu’une goutte de lait produite par les quelque 5 600 fermes laitières du Québec, ils sont le porte-étendard d’une industrie qui génère près de 30 % de toutes les recettes agricoles de la province.



Selon la doctorante, le métier d’agriculteur est reconnu comme l'un des plus à risque de stress à cause d’éléments incontrôlables comme la météo. Mais la mondialisation, les traités commerciaux, le prix du lait, le prix du quota, l’endettement des entreprises, les changements technologiques, les conflits familiaux, les chicanes de couple ou l’isolement sont tous des facteurs de stress qui s’additionnent et font grimper le taux de la détresse psychologique. « Jusqu’à ce que l’élastique pète », explique celle qui a étudié le malaise des agriculteurs tant au Québec qu’en France et en Suisse1.



Toutefois, la seule étude disponible sur le taux de suicide des agriculteurs québécois indiquait qu’il était le double de celui des hommes dans la population générale québécoise. Mais cette étude2 réalisée par Santé Canada date de trente ans (1971-1987). Le problème, pour obtenir l’heure juste, c’est que l’Institut national de la santé publique du Québec ne comptabilise pas les suicides par profession. En 2014, 845 Québécois se sont enlevé la vie et, depuis 1981, cette triste statistique annuelle oscille entre 795 et 1284 hommes.



Parmi les pays développés, la France s’est toutefois dotée en 2013 d’un Observatoire national du suicide qui dénombre 417 suicides chez les hommes agriculteurs entre 2007 à 2009, surtout dans les élevages de bovins.



Rudy Ducreux, l’arbre qui cache la forêt?



Notre enquête révèle cependant que le phénomène du suicide des agriculteurs existe bel et bien dans la campagne québécoise. Parlez-en à Laurier Gauthier, un voisin de Rudy Ducreux. L’homme de 67 ans est producteur de lait et copropriétaire avec ses frères de la seconde plus grosse érablière de la Belle Province. Il a offert de nous accompagner à la ferme Ducrêt.

La vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec.

– Laurier Gauthier

En chemin, à bord de son camion, M. Gauthier lance devant la ferme d’un de ses voisins. « Lui aussi il s’est suicidé. Puis pourtant, il avait de l’argent plein les poches. Il venait de s’acheter une Cadillac. Un bon matin, on apprend qu’il s’était tiré un coup de 22 en arrière des oreilles. Surprise totale ». Il ajoute avoir connu six personnes, dont cinq producteurs et un employé de ferme, qui se sont enlevé la vie dans un rayon de 12 kilomètres de son entreprise.



Quant au geste irrémédiable de Rudy Ducreux, M. Gauthier l’explique peut-être par une charge de travail trop lourde pour un seul homme, mais, « la vraie raison profonde, les gens partent avec », dit-il. Maire de Saint-Basile durant une trentaine d’années, le producteur pointe du doigt l’actuel contexte socio-économique comme facteur important de détresse psychologique chez les producteurs agricoles. Il reproche à Québec, depuis le règne du ministre de l’Agriculture péquiste Jean Garon (1976-1985), champion de la souveraineté alimentaire, de nommer des ministres de l’Agriculture à temps partiel ou ignorant des enjeux.



Quant au fédéral, le producteur se demande jusqu’où Ottawa, dans l’actuelle renégociation de l’ALENA exigée par le président Donald Trump, est prêt à défendre la gestion de l’offre et ne pas la sacrifier au profit des secteurs du bois d’œuvre, de l’automobile ou de l’aviation.



Nous arrivons à la ferme Ducrêt. Rudy Ducreux avait acheté en 2004 la ferme de Luc Mailloux, un ex-fromager au lait cru, et frère du psychiatre controversé Pierre « Doc » Mailloux. Sur place, nous sommes accueillis par Connie McLellan, une jeune agricultrice de 28 ans originaire de Nouvelle-Écosse. Elle hésite à parler au journaliste, selon les conseils de l’avocat engagé par la succession « pour ne pas nuire à la vente de la ferme », prévue d’ici l’automne. Le corps de Rudy Ducreux a depuis longtemps été rapatrié par la famille.



Connie McLellan, une jeune productrice, s'occupe du troupeau de Rudy Ducreux.



La jeune femme explique avoir été recrutée pour traire le troupeau de 26 bêtes. À part le cliquetis des chaînes des vaches à l’étable, le silence règne autour de la maison, de la fromagerie, de l’établi et des remises désertés. Seul un chat en manque de caresses nous suit d’un bâtiment à l’autre.



Dans les champs adjacents, de la machinerie rouille au milieu de hautes herbes. Et on peut apercevoir de nouvelles plantations d’arbres sur les terres voisines autrefois cultivées. Comme l’arbre qui cache la forêt, le suicide du créateur du Gaulois de Portneuf cache un pan de l’agriculture québécoise en péril.

Les Bleus ont leur destin en mains: un succès contre le Belarus mardi au Stade de France leur permettra de se qualifier même si les Suédois gagnent contre les Pays-Bas.

Une heure avant le coup d'envoi, la France était repassée en deuxième position de son groupe A, dépassée de deux points par la Suède qui avait écrasé le Luxembourg (8-0). De quoi au passage remuer un peu plus le couteau dans la plaie du piteux 0-0 concédé par les Bleus début septembre à Toulouse face au même Grand-Duché.

Bête noire

Si la France a dominé la Bulgarie en octobre dernier au ""SdF"" (4-1), cet adversaire avait des airs de bête noire, entre le cauchemar de 1993, lorsque la bande d'Emil Kostadinov était venue glacer le Parc des Princes (2-1) et priver les Bleus du Mondial américain, et une terre bulgare où les Bleus ne s'étaient plus imposés depuis 1932.

Les Bleus ont pris le contrôle du match et assommé d'emblée les Bulgares avec un but de Matuidi, dans un angle fermé, après une combinaison entre Digne et Griezmann (3e). Pas mal pour un joueur qui a les ""pieds carrés"", comme il l'avait évoqué mardi avec auto-dérision.

Titulaire avec l'Equipe de France, Matuidi a inscrit ce but ! pic.twitter.com/SzYTyNPSxo — Juventus Fr (@Juventus_Fr) October 7, 2017

""Mentalement, on est en train de se préparer pour aller à la guerre"", avait assuré Mbappé jeudi. Et il fallait du mental, dans la pluie et le froid, pour surmonter ce match aux allures de traquenard, et répondre au combat, illustré par quelques scènes musclées et cartons jaunes bulgares à la clef.

Il fallait résister. La première période fut largement maîtrisée, avec plusieurs occasions, et une seule frayeur, lorsque Lloris a mal renvoyé un ballon puis s'est rattrapé dans la foulée sur sa ligne (37e).

La seconde période fut bien plus décousue côté bleu. La perte sur blessure de la précieuse sentinelle Kanté, remplacée par Rabiot (34e), l'expliquait peut-être.

Lacazette moyen

Deschamps avait tenté un coup en revenant au 4-3-3 et surtout en titularisant deux ex-Lyonnais, Tolisso au milieu (deuxième sélection), et Lacazette en pointe, détrônant Giroud.

Tolisso a trouvé le ton juste, dans la technique et l'agressivité, tandis que Lacazette s'est moins mis en valeur. Il a certes prodigué quelques belles déviations, mais a notamment perdu son duel avec le gardien (29e), son unique occasion, et tergiversé dans une situation de contre-attaque favorable (66e).

Griezmann s'est montré très mobile, dans tous les bons coups, singulièrement pour le but de Matuidi. Il a beaucoup décroché pour orienter le jeu, et a dès lors manqué de présence aux avant-postes.

Mbappé, lui, a offert de belles opportunités à ses deux acolytes offensifs, que ce soit donc à Lacazette (29e) ou à Griezmann (26e), en vain. Dans un élan côté gauche prenant la défense de vitesse, il a par deux fois manqué de précision, entre un tir détourné par le gardien (15e) et un autre trop enlevé (45e+1).

Chacune de ses prises de balle allumait du danger, même s'il a aussi eu un certain déchet, comme ce centre trop long (18e). Il a été beaucoup plus quelconque en seconde période, remplacé par Giroud (85e).",Bulgarie/France : Le résumé et le but du match de qualification pour le Mondial-2018,http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/07/bulgarie-france-le-resume-et-le-but-du-match-de-qualification-pour-le-mondial-2018_a_23236139/?utm_hp_ref=fr-homepage

This is a great option if you know absolutely nothing about the person you’re meeting and want a safe, unintimidating activity.","Millennials are continuing to turn their backs on booze, so if heading to a bar is your go-to for a first date, it may be time to switch things up.

According to resent research, the typical millennial now consumes just five units of alcohol a week and 42% of us are drinking less than we were three years ago.

Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to get to know a potential love interest that don’t involve waking up with a hangover - you just have to get creative.

With that in mind, here are nine alternative activity ideas for those who are cutting back, have quit booze altogether, or have pledged to Go Sober For October.

1. Try crazy golf.

A post shared by Swingers - the crazy golf club (@swingersldn) on Sep 7, 2017 at 10:03am PDT

Crazy golf is no longer reserved for tacky seaside holidays, with a number of new indoor venues popping up over the country, perfect for a post-work putt.

Many venues, such as London’s Swingers (pictured above), do serve alcohol, but if you appoint yourself as score-keeper you have the perfect excuse not to drink.

Better yet, you’ll have plenty to talk about as you navigate the course.

2. Visit a museum.

A post shared by Natural History Museum (@natural_history_museum) on Jul 31, 2017 at 7:05am PDT

Museums and galleries are perfect for dates on a budget thanks to the free entry at most. Many venues also run “after hours” nights that are catered towards adults, meaning you won’t have to dodge school children while chatting with your date.

For example, the Natural History Museum runs “late” nights every last Friday of the month with different themes, while more than 150 galleries in east London stay open late the first Thursday of every month. While alcohol is available, getting plastered and knocking over some artwork is not advised.

Check the opening hours at your favourite museum or gallery for details.

3. Get your bowling shoes on.

A post shared by Jade Pitts🎀 (@jadelouisepitts) on Sep 15, 2017 at 9:16am PDT

There’s nothing like clown shoes and the smell of feet to get you in the romantic spirit.

Jokes aside, once you get over the footwear a night at a bowling alley makes a pretty good date, and there are venues open nationwide.

You’ll learn a lot about your date from how competitive they are and if you’re both terrible, at least you’ll have a laugh.

4. Potter around a market.

A post shared by Bath Christmas Market (@bathchristmasmarket) on Dec 14, 2016 at 3:34am PST

Grab your coat and head to your nearest market with your date for a day out that’ll provide you with plenty of talking points.

As the cold weather draws, in why not visit one of the UK’s popular winter markets? For example, Bath Christmas Market (pictured above) opens from 23 November - 10 December and is guaranteed to leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside.

If it’s far too early for you to even think about Christmas, try a food market or flower market such as London’s Columbia Road Flower Market instead.

5. Grab a spot of brunch.

A post shared by Lauren Morgan (@laurenmorgannnnn) on Sep 17, 2017 at 4:53am PDT

Brunch does not have to come in the bottomless variety and is just as good with a refreshing smoothie as it is with a glass of Prosecco.

Thanks to the nation’s ever-growing love of avocados there is no shortage of stylish brunch venues around the UK.

And if sparks don’t fly between you and your date, at least you’ll have the rest of the day free to enjoy yourself.

6. Attempt ice skating.

A post shared by L I V E F A S T🤙🏽 (@_skinnyviera) on Jan 16, 2017 at 12:05pm PST

Ice skating is a no-drink kind of activity. After all, most of us spend the first half hour clinging onto the side for safety.

Slipping and sliding across the floor is also a great way to break the ice (pun intended) with your date.

If all goes to plan, you can heat things up by grabbing a hot chocolate afterwards. Steamy.

8. Hit up an alcohol-free bar.

A post shared by Redemption Bar (@redemptionbar) on Sep 27, 2017 at 9:08am PDT

In 2015 London venue Redemption became the UK’s first alcohol-free bar and since then others have been cropping up around the country, from Bar Zero in Middlesbrough to Cafe Sobar in Nottingham.

These bars still have a grown-up vibe but are strictly tee-total.

Most also sell healthy food options for daters who are truly embracing the wellness revolution.

7. Embark on a country walk.

A post shared by Aimee Heloise (@aimee_heloise) on Sep 26, 2017 at 7:38am PDT

Head for the hills and channel your inner country bumpkin for a date that’ll help you save some pennies.

If it’s not too cold out, we’d recommend packing a blanket and some picnic nibbles for the afternoon.

It may be better to save a country walk for a second or third date rather than a first. After all, no one wants to get lost in the middle of nowhere with someone they’re not into.

9. Chill out in a coffee shop.

This sort of death and suffering, he said, is a foregone conclusion.

“This is the price of freedom,” the former Fox News anchor wrote on his website. “The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons.”

For all the talk on the right about the importance of not politicizing the tragedy, O’Reilly was jumping with both feet into the middle of our raging political debate over gun rights. And he was doing us the favor of being explicit about his argument: In a society that supports a largely absolutist and individualist view of the right to bear arms, we should expect to make ritual sacrifices at the altar of the Second Amendment. This violence isn’t pretty ― it’s “the big downside of American freedom,” wrote O’Reilly ― but it’s an unavoidable tradeoff for a nation that wants easy access to weapons.

O’Reilly was simply distilling the overarching philosophy of the National Rifle Association, its supporters and the lawmakers who reliably toe the line on their interpretation of gun rights.

“This is a frank admission of the gun rights movement’s philosophy, which is that, yes, there will be these harms that come from broad civilian ownership of guns, but you have the right, and the right’s essential to your freedom, so we’ll just have to live with these consequences,” said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the UCLA School of Law.

The glib resignation of that mindset is the final rhetorical stage of a revolution launched a half century ago by gun rights advocates. They’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political lobbying and campaigns, suppressed and distorted gun violence research, and aggressively pushed the paranoid narrative that the government is coming for Americans’ guns.

Having reshaped the Second Amendment to their ends, all that remained for the NRA and its supporters was to encourage a shrugging acquiescence to the supposed holy writ of our Constitution. President Barack Obama was addressing that acquiescence in 2016, when he gave a speech unveiling new gun control measures in the wake of a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. He urged Americans not “to accept this carnage as the price of freedom.”

But Americans largely have accepted it, if the failure of Congress to pass any gun control legislation in nearly a decade is any indication.

O’Reilly understands the stakes of our acquiescence, which is never more important to the gun rights cause than in the emotional aftermath of massive gun death. And in this case, there was little room to obfuscate or deflect. Typically, there is a much longer period of finger pointing and what-ifs after a mass shooting, at least when a gunman claims to be an ISIS sympathizer, or is found to have been mentally ill, or in violation of existing firearms law, or carried out the attack in a gun-free zone, where armed bystanders were not free to return fire.

But Stephen Paddock, the gunman in Las Vegas, had legally purchased a veritable arsenal, including numerous assault-style rifles, and did not set off any alarm bells with law enforcement or mental health professionals before carrying out his murderous plot. No number of good guys with guns could have neutralized the shooter as he indiscriminately sprayed gunfire into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.

The same particulars behind O’Reilly’s frankness led others to change their minds. Caleb Keeter, a guitarist who performed with the Josh Abbott Band in Las Vegas hours before the shooting, publicly apologized for his lifelong opposition to gun control in a Twitter post on Monday. He recalled that his colleagues received shrapnel wounds merely because they were standing near other gunshot victims, and suggested civilian weaponry had gotten “out of hand.”

Not O’Reilly.

“You don’t say human lives are a price you’re willing to pay,” said Winkler. “We should always try to reduce the loss of life, not increase it, or objectify it as some cost and not recognize the real human beings who are affected.”

Geoffrey Stone, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School, said there’s a broader debate to be had about whether society wants to define “freedom” to mean civilians being largely free to purchase and possess whatever firearms they want in whatever quantity.

“In my view, that is an utterly absurd conception of ‘freedom’ and has absolutely no basis in our Constitution or our Second Amendment,” Stone said in an email. “One might just as well say that one has the ‘freedom’ to drive as fast as one wants or one has the ‘freedom’ to rape women or the ‘freedom’ to hold others as slaves.”

By taking no action whatsoever in the wake of these increasingly deadly and frequent mass shootings, lawmakers and their constituents have given tacit approval to an arrangement in which death tolls are only limited by a would-be gunman’s depravity, choice of target, planning and marksmanship. As Sunday’s bloodshed shows, there will always be a more heartless person, with higher-powered weapons, better aim and a more sadistic plot to lay waste to innocent civilians.

Although people like O’Reilly appear determined to sit back and continue to do nothing in the face of these circumstances, not everyone may be resigned to living in the gun lobby’s stranglehold. As the euphemisms fall away and the issue clarifies itself into a straightforward matter of largely unfettered gun rights versus lives, the courts perhaps will be freer to tip the balance in the other direction.",The Las Vegas Massacre Was A Ritual Sacrifice To The Second Amendment,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/10/03/las-vegas-shooting-second-amendment_n_18176402.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&ir=UK

British media reported a car had mounted the sidewalk outside the tourist attraction, one of several large museums in that area of South Kensington, west London, and police said a man had been detained at the scene.

“A vehicle has collided with pedestrians near the Natural History Museum entrance at Exhibition Road,” the museum, one of the most popular visitor attractions in the country, said in a statement.

“We are working with emergency services to assess the incident and we are doing all we can.”

Police described the incident as a collision. Unverified footage from the scene showed a man being pinned to the ground by four people.

“Inquiries to establish the circumstances and motive are under way,” police said.

A spokeswoman for the London force said counter-terrorism officers were assessing the incident but had not yet reached a conclusion as to the circumstances. Earlier a spokesman told Reuters it was not being treated as a terrorism-related incident at this stage.

Prime Minister Theresa May was being updated, a spokesman said, adding it was usual practice in such circumstances.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was in close contact with the police’s most senior counter-terrorism officer.

A Reuters witness said there were large numbers of police, including armed officers, and paramedics at the scene although the atmosphere appeared calm.

A BBC reporter at the scene said she could see a car diagonally across the road surrounded by a crowd of people with one or two on the ground. She said she was told by police injuries sustained were minor.

A spokesman for the museum told Reuters that no one was being allowed into the building and people were being let out through a different exit.

Es geht um Urin. Russisches Urin.

Anfang des Jahres tauchte ein 35-seitiges Geheimdossier über angebliche Russland-Verbindungen von Donald Trump auf, das sogenannte Steele-Dokument.

Es ist nach seinem Verfasser, dem ehemaligem britischen Geheimagenten Christopher Steele, benannt und enthält viele Informationen über Trumps Beziehungen nach Moskau und St. Petersburg.

Für Furore sorgte aber vor allem eine Anekdote in Steeles Bericht, die dem Dossier den Spitznamen ""Urin-Dossier"" eintrug - und die jetzt auch Sonderermittler Robert Mueller beschäftigt.

Trump und die russischen Prostituierten

So soll Donald Trump laut Christopher Steele in der Präsidentensuite des Moskauer Hotels Ritz Carlton mehreren Prostituierten befohlen haben, auf das Bett zu urinieren. Nicht nur eklig, sondern auch brisant - denn in diesem Bett soll zuvor das Ehepaar Obama geschlafen haben.

Tatsächlich ist das Dossier des britischen Agenten äußerst umstritten. Es zirkulierte schon Monate vor seiner Veröffentlichung in mehreren US-Redaktionen - erst das Nachrichtenportal ""Buzzfeed"" wagte sich an die Veröffentlichung. Auch Vertreter der US-Geheimdienste äußerten Zweifel über das Dokument und konnten seine Echtheit nicht bestätigen.

Doch nun beschäftigt sich laut verschiedenen Medienberichten der als seriös und unbestechlich geltende Robert Mueller mit dem Steele-Dossier - und gibt diesem somit eine neue Relevanz.

Muellers Team hat mit Christopher Steele gesprochen

Dafür spricht vor allem, dass Muellers Ermittlerteam das Dossier wohl nicht nur eingesehen hat, sondern sich auch mit Christopher Steele persönlich getroffen haben soll. Das berichten übereinstimmend die US-Sender NBC News und CNN.

BREAKING NEWS: NBC News confirms that Mueller's office spoke to Trump Dossier Author #TheBeat https://t.co/PqEFJDMcLF — TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) 5. Oktober 2017

Auch die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters hatte zuvor berichtet, dass das Steele-Dossier offizieller Teil von Muellers Ermittlungen über die möglichen Verbindungen von Trumps Team nach Russland sei.

Ermittlungen, die gerade enorm an Fahrt aufnehmen.

Steele-Dossier nur kleiner Teil der Untersuchung in der Russland-Affäre

Denn Mueller beschäftigt sich längst nicht nur mit dem ominösen Steele-Dossier. Vielmehr gehe der Ex-FBI-Chef auf breiter juristischer Front gegen Trump vor, wie der ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti für das US-Magazin ""Politico"" schreibt.

Demnach hat Mueller nicht nur zahlreiche Unterlagen des Weißen Hauses angefordert, sondern auch Finanzdokumente von Trumps Unternehmen. Der Sonderermittler hat zudem mehrere Interviews mit ehemaligen und derzeitigen Mitarbeitern von Donald Trump angefragt.

Einer dieser Mitarbeiter ist Paul Manafort, Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfmanager, dessen Wohnung auf Geheiß Muellers bereits bei einer Razzia durchsucht und der monatelang vom FBI abgehört wurde.

Es führen also viele Spuren von Donald Trump nach Russland - und Robert Mueller folgt ihnen allen. Auch, wenn sie nach russischem Urin riechen sollten.

Here's a scene straight out of a ubiquitous Saas Boohoo K-serial. Or a live telecast from your neighbour's house, or possibly, yours. It is Karva Chauth. The urban Hindu wife draped in servility, a big bindi of enslavement on her forehead, the mehndi of servitude on her palms, a mangal sutra (the mother of all married tokenisms) around her neck, dolls up to fast and pray for her Lord and Master. A pallu on her head completes the look of mental confinement and surrender.

This is a slightly aggressive way of introducing the Big Daddy of all Hindu festivals, you'd say, right? Probably yes.

But I've decided not to succumb to the 'Spiral of Silence,' the mass communication theory which states that minority opinions aren't usually expressed in group settings for fear of social isolation. The fear more pronounced in cases where the issue has a moral component.

KC is at best, discrimination wrapped in pseudo-love, and at worst, a subtle instrument of social control.

Captain Obvious tells me that the Indian connotation potpourri has no bigger moral component than mera suhaag (my matrimony, a.ka. the husband), whisker-trailed, of course, by ghar ka chiraag (the light of the son).

So when I say that Karva Chauth (KC), the Hindu Valentine's Day, is nothing but a grim reflection of a dystopian mindset that smacks of chauvinism and reeks of gender bias. I'm not just ruffling a few moral feathers; I'm committing social harakiri and possibly exposing myself to public lynching by my own extended family.

Thank God, Facebook doesn't have a hate button, because this write-up threatens to cost me my already anorexic friends. Still, encashing my constitutional privilege revalidated three summers ago by tattooing my forefinger, I dare reiterate that KC is at best, discrimination wrapped in pseudo love and at worst, a subtle instrument of social control.

You may spin any number of reconciliatory webs around this blunt starker, give it a veneer of modernity by roping in the poor husband to fast along with the wife, but there's no way you can wish away its inherent misogyny. Because misogyny is not always explicit violence; it is also the pita bread on which the meat sauce of cultural legitimacy is slathered to make it look like a family celebration.

A minuscule number of Indian couples, ridden perhaps by a subconscious guilt for their growing western proclivity, keep a 'conjoined' fast in a brave attempt to inject parity into KC's congenital lop-sidedness. The husband's role here mutates from a smug-as-a-bug-in-the-rug receiver of spousal attention to a grudging 'co-faster' (Chetan Bhagat, are you listening?). This decision, I suspect, is more to assuage his own culpability than any real faith in the 'fast' at hand. The happy involvement seeks to cover a murky inequality.

In any case, whether a man chooses to fast along with his wife or not, the cultural dice remains implicitly loaded in his favour. Heads, he's a magnanimous and caring metrosexual. Tails, he's a virile alpha stud.

What is baffling about KC is that in spite of being a blatant reassertion of traditional gender roles, it enjoys ecstatic patronage by many members of the so-called estrogen brigade. These cause-crusaders are more than happy strutting around with sindoor-smeared partings, flaunting their mehndi-stained palms, jauntily playing passing-the-parcel with traditional thalis.

So what is it about KC that causes even the garden-variety 'feminazis' to kowtow such?

Well, there appear to be more than a couple of elements at play here, the foremost being a neo-traditional sheen bestowed upon the festival through clever packaging by commercial forces.

KC is uber-romantic ( thank you DDLJ ). KC is uber-moralistic (thank you, Ekta Kapoor).

Our TV channels feature pseudo-contemporary ads, with coy brides propounding the virtues of fasting for their husbands, playing an oxymoronic rub-a-dub with progressive ad campaigns espousing gender equality. This contra-positioning ensures that materialism thrives and consumption-industry coffers keep ringing.

What is a few hours of fasting in place of all those goodies? It's good to detox anyway!

A resurgence of KC also has its genesis in the big-fat-wedding syndrome, the driving force, once again, being consumption. Afterall, mega celebrations mean mega bucks!

For the urban woman, KC is fast becoming a win-win. She seems to bask in its celebratory aura, the mushy romance, those brownie points with a beaming ma-in-law, the generous gift from an obliged husband (an equivalent of the modern-day push-present for new moms). What are a few hours of fasting in place of all those goodies? It's good to detox anyway!

A milch cow of sorts for the consumer industry, KC's misogynistic origin is now sadly a forgettable footnote in its CV. In a society that fasts at the drop of a religious hat (Shiva to Shani and Krishna to Navratri), what's one more for a husband, you might ask. The lady's happy, the hubby's happy, so what's your problem dude?

It is no secret that the Indian society starts to instil a feeling of inferiority in its women from a young age.

Yeah really, what is my problem? My problem is that I like to envisage a gender-neutral and proportionate playing field for men and women. A cultural scenario that does not subject one spouse to social discrimination at the hands of the other. A social climate where love need not be expressed through overt rituals (not to be mistaken with voluntary gestures of affection). My problem is that KC makes a religious mascot out of a flesh and blood mortal by placing him on a pedestal reserved for the divine.

Unlike other festivals where devotees beseech a supreme being for blessings, KC demands that the wife genuflect and seek the blessings of her husband (besides the Moon God). This simple ritual creates an utterly expendable divine halo around the 'Y' chromosome. It shows the wife that her place is at the feet of her husband who is the protector of her womanhood and her purity as if she were a piece of 24-carat gold or a glass of aqua-guarded water!

It is no secret that the Indian society starts to instil a feeling of inferiority in its women from a young age. Through superstition. Through discrimination. Through coercion (both overt and covert). Women are conditioned to believe that their abstinence will ensure longevity for their spouse. For centuries, KC has fanned this conditioning.

Most Indian women now actually revel in genuflecting in front of their husbands, elevating this regressive gesture to a moral trait. Those who choose not to kowtow are looked down upon as 'indignant feminists', toxic for the society.

Marriage is a bond of love, equality, companionship and mutual respect. It has no place for patriarchal rituals that create some subtle and some not-so-subtle instruments of social control to oppress women.

Any tradition that urges women to deify men is no less cruel than explicit violence. It's time to scrap this power asymmetry. It's time to shuffle the deck. It is time to deactivate my Facebook account.

Si el Parlament declara unilateralmente la independencia entraremos en una maraña institucional y en una tensión permanente entre gobiernos.
Con todo, y para no dejarse parasitar por el gobierno, ha exigido a Rajoy que abra de inmediato un diálogo sin exclusiones, que se reúna también con Puigdemont y que busque el acuerdo.

Pase lo que pase el 1-O será ya para la historia de España una fecha maldita, y no solo por la desobediencia y la flagrante ilegalidad cometida por el independentismo, también por la torpe respuesta que el gobierno de Rajoy ha decidido dar al desafío secesionista: primero esconderse tras la toga de los jueces y, después, tras el material antidisturbios de la policía. Y todo para seguir no haciendo política.

¿El resultado? El desgarro, la ruptura y una España convertida en la vergüenza de Europa y en profundo motivo de preocupación de todos sus socios.

Lo que no habían conseguido durante años Mas, Puigdemont, Junqueras y Romeva lo ha logrado solito en 24 horas el Gobierno. Ya tenemos aquí la internacionalización del conflicto. Y encima el Parlamento Europeo va a discutir sobre la crisis catalana antes de que lo haga nuestro Congreso.

Eso es lo que ha logrado la derecha española con su peculiar defensa del Estado de Derecho, además de reiterar hasta la náusea algo obvio, que lo del 1-O no fue un referéndum, y que el presidente está ahora dispuesto a dialogar con todos.

El independentismo consigue la internacionalización del conflicto. El gobierno, al borde del abismo.

¡A buena hora! De haberlo hecho hace cinco años, no estaríamos donde estamos, ante una crisis de Estado de consecuencias incalculables que España afronta, por cierto, con la clase política más mediocre de cuantas ha dado la democracia y con una situación de debilidad como nunca antes ha tenido un gobierno.

Ahora resulta que el más sensato va a ser el socialista Pedro Sánchez. Sin su apoyo, Rajoy, al borde del abismo, está condenado a adelantar elecciones. Y cuidado, que ya sabemos que, aunque la crisis catalana ha resucitado al rancio nacionalismo español al que el PP da cobijo en sus siglas, las urnas en este país las carga el diablo. Al fin y al cabo, el independentismo es el principal responsable de los daños causados, pero el gobierno ha contribuido indiscutiblemente a agrandarlos.

El caso es que la consulta independentista no era más que la excusa para la Declaración Unilateral de Independencia. Y no será porque no estuviera escrito y anunciado. Solo el PP se negó rotundamente a verlo, como se negó también a aceptar que las costuras de la España territorial habían estallado hace mucho tiempo. De aquellos fuegos, estas cenizas.

El presidente catalan, Carles Puigdemont, y otros miembros del gobierno regional marchan con la gente en la Plaza Sant Jaume en apoyo a la protesta iniciada por diferentes grupos independistas para que los ciudadanos se reunieran al anochecer en frente de los Palacios Municipales en toda Cataluña el pasado 2 de octubre.

Y ahora hablan de diálogo, de acuerdo y de ese pacto que nunca quisieron. Lo que no aclaran, por miedo al demonizado 155 de la Constitución, es cómo antes de sentarse en una mesa -si es que el independentismo acepta- piensan reestablecer la legalidad en una Comunidad autónoma que ha decidido no respetar el marco general pero tampoco el suyo propio.

Cataluña es hoy una región sin ley , donde la autoridad del Estado ha quedado seriamente dañada tras las imágenes del 1-O, y en la que no hay Código Penal que pueda arreglar el destrozo causado.

Guste o no, hay una parte de Cataluña que, aun sin declaración de independencia, ya se ha desconectado emocionalmente de España y así seguirá durante décadas. Y lo que tenemos por delante no es un problema, sino la cronificación de un gravísimo conflicto. Por muchas apelaciones que se hagan al diálogo, esto no se resuelve ni mañana, ni pasado, ni en una comisión parlamentaria por la que vayan desfilando todo tipo de expertos.

La crisis catalana se debatirá antes en Estrasburgo que en el Congreso. Sánchez garantiza estabilidad pero exige ya diálogo sin exclusiones.

Si el Parlament declara unilateralmente la independencia entraremos en una maraña institucional y en una tensión permanente entre gobiernos. Y el independentismo -por muy dividido que ande-, después de la implicación social del 1-O no tiene más remedio que seguir hacia adelante y soslayar la inmediata convocatoria de elecciones autonómicas, como reclama el bloque constitucionalista.

La situación es tan crítica que no extrañaría que tardáramos poco en escuchar llamadas para la constitución de un gobierno de gran coalición, un escenario del que el PSOE no quiere ni oir hablar. Una cosa es garantizar la estabilidad institucional, a pesar de no compartir la respuesta policial del gobierno en Cataluña, y otra dejarse embaucar por una derecha tan dada a patrimonializar los éxitos como a socializar los fracasos.

'Podemos' trabaja en una alternativa a la Declaración Unilateral de Independencia

El PSOE navega estos días entre dos aguas: la de la defensa del Estado frente a la ilegalidad y la de la repulsa a las cargas policiales que dejaron un balance de centenares de heridos en Cataluña. Con todo, y para no dejarse parasitar por el gobierno, ha exigido a Rajoy que abra de inmediato un diálogo sin exclusiones, que se reúna también con Puigdemont y que busque el acuerdo.

Para Sánchez, se puede y se debe hablar ya con el independentismo, al margen de que haya o no declaración unilateral de independencia. Si Rajoy decide antes restablecer la legalidad y aplicar el 155, no tendrá más remedio que apoyarlo. Siempre, eso sí, que se sepa para qué y por cuánto tiempo.

Y esto a pesar de que esa desdibujaría, sin duda, al Pedro Sánchez que ganó las primarias. Su apoyo al gobierno le aleja de un Podemos con el que se había propuesto reconstruir puentes y al que, sin duda, necesitará en el futuro si quiere llegar a La Moncloa.

De ahí su empeño en que Rajoy incluya a Pablo Iglesias en el diálogo al que le ha emplazado de inmediato para resolver la crisis catalana. El secretario general de los morados trabaja, por su parte, con el independentismo en una alternativa a la Declaración Unilateral de Independencia. Las conversaciones, se solemnicen o no, son a varias bandas. Y todos están enterados. Los próximos días son críticos, pero decisivos para el futuro de España.

Daher fordert die Partei nun umso lauter eine Verschärfung der Flüchtlingspolitik

6 Zitate zeigen, wie absurd die Diskussion über die Obergrenze mittlerweile ist

Deutschland braucht eine Regierung - aber die CSU braucht Aufmerksamkeit. Also blockieren die Christsozialen die Bemühungen von FDP, Grünen und CDU bei den Verhandlungen zur Gründung einer Jamaika-Koalition.

Zum Beispiel, indem sie offen die Partnerschaft mit der Schwesterpartei CDU in Frage stellen. Vor allem aber, indem die CSU bei jeder sich bietenden Gelegenheit auf ihre Forderung nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge pocht.

Dass FDP, Grüne und CDU die Festlegung einer solche Beschränkung für Asylsuchende ablehnen, dass der Vorsitzende des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, Andreas Voßkuhle, sie für unvereinbar mit dem Völkerrecht hält - dass Deutschland dafür womöglich sogar aus der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention aussteigen müsste: Der CSU ist es egal.

Die Lokalpartei will ihren bayerischen Stiefel durchziehen - sie muss es, denn an der Basis rumort, es nach dem schwächsten Wahlergebnis seit 1949.

Und so wird die Obergrenzen-Diskussion zum Zwergenaufstand. Hier sind die 6 absurdesten Zitate und Aussagen in der CSU-Posse:

1. Alexander Dobrindt: ""Die CSU ist die einzige Volkspartei""

38,8 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten in Bayern haben die CSU bei der Bundestagswahl gewählt. Bundesweit macht das einen Anteil von 6,2 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen. Rechnet man diesen Anteil auf die Gesamtbevölkerung um, haben 4,62 Prozent der Deutschen die bayerischen Christsozialen gewählt - etwas mehr als 3,8 Millionen Menschen.

Die CSU ist also eine Kleinpartei. In ihrem Selbstverständnis ist dieser Umstand jedoch noch nicht angelangt. Und so sagte Alexander Dobrindt am Freitag dem Magazin ""Focus"": ""Die CSU ist aktuell die einzige Volkspartei. Sie ist modern und in der politischen Struktur der Bundesrepublik unverzichtbar.""

Kein Wunder, dass die Partei also glaubt, beim Thema Obergrenze auch bundesweite Ansprüche stellen zu können.

2. Nochmal Dobrindt: ""Die Obergrenze hat einen thematischen Unterbau""

Dabei weiß die Partei, wie unpopulär sie sich damit macht. Eine ihrer Taktiken ist deswegen: Die Obergrenze fordern - aber jeden Tag etwas anderes damit zu meinen.

Eigentlich ist die CSU-Definition der Flüchtlings-Obergrenze klar: Mehr als 200.000 Asylsuchende im Jahr sollen nicht nach Deutschland einreisen dürfen. Doch gleich mehrere der bayerischen Lokalpolitiker haben diese Definition zuletzt aufgeweicht.

Federführend war dabei Verkehrsminister Dobrindt. Der reinterpretierte den Begriff in einem Interview mit der ""Augsburger Allgemeinen"": ""Die Obergrenze hat einen thematischen Unterbau und der heißt: Fluchtursachen bekämpfen, Grenzen schützen, Integration fördern, Rückführungen beschleunigen.""

3. Joachim Herrmann: ""Es hat in der CSU-Führung nie jemand von einer Beschränkung des Asylrechts gesprochen""

In der Flüchtlingspolitik ist Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann ein Mann der harten Phrasen. Er fordert gern einmal härtere Grenzkontrollen, Smartphone-Verbote oder die präventive Gefangennahme und Aussetzung der Unschuldsvermutung für islamistische Gefährder.

Auch die Obergrenze fordert Herrmann immer wieder - wenngleich er fortwährend betont, dass in Deutschland das Asylrecht gelte.

So sagte Herrmann der ""Rheinischen Post"" zuletzt: ""Es hat in der CSU-Führung nie jemand von einer Beschränkung des Asylrechts gesprochen.""

Das eine Obergrenze genau das zur Folge hätte - wen kümmert's?

4. Horst Seehofer: ""Wir garantieren eine Obergrenze nach der Wahl""

Horst Seehofer schon mal nicht. Der verkündete im vergangenen Dezember vollmundig: ""Wir garantieren eine Obergrenze nach der Wahl."" Auf die Nachfrage, ob die CSU sonst in die Opposition gehe, sagte Seehofer: ""Das haben Sie richtig verstanden.""

Im August ruderte der CSU-Chef dann zurück. Die Zeiten im politischen Berlin hätten sich geändert - und überhaupt, die Zuwanderungszahlen seien ja nun zurückgegangen.

Da war die Obergrenze für Seehofer auf einmal keine Koalitionsbedingung mehr.

Parteikollege Dobrindt scheint das allerdings nicht mitbekommen zu haben. Er bekräftigte erst am Donnerstag, die Obergrenze sei für die CSU ""nicht verhandelbar"".

5. Angela Merkel: ""Mit der CDU wird es eine Obergrenze nicht geben""

Das ist in der Tat ungünstig. Denn das gleiche gilt für Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel.

Die hatte schon im vergangenen Jahr deutlich gemacht: ""Mit der CDU wird es eine Obergrenze nicht geben."" Bei ihrem ARD-Sommerinterview im Juli legte Merkel nach: ""Zur Obergrenze ist meine Haltung klar: Das heißt, ich werde sie nicht akzeptieren.""

Merkels klare Haltung zeigt, wie unsinnig die störrische Haltung der CSU bei der Obergrenze ist. Die Kanzlerin wird sich nicht von ihrem bayerischen Lokalpartner vorführen lassen. Dafür müsste dieser dann schon tatsächlich in die Opposition gehen - und das würde der CSU genauso schaden, wie der CDU.

6. Wolfgang Schäuble: ""Juristen wissen, dass überflüssige Dinge nicht extra erwähnt werden müssen""

Und so war es an Wolfgang Schäuble, Ende der vergangenen Woche der CSU den Spiegel vorzuhalten.

Der scheidende Finanzminister zeigte sich in einem Interview mit der ""Bild am Sonntag"" spürbar genervt. ""Hier wird um einen Begriff ein Scheinstreit geführt, obwohl es inhaltlich keine wirklichen Differenzen gibt"", sagte Schäuble.

Zwar erklärte Schäuble auch, in der Flüchtlingspolitik gelte, was der ehemalige Bundespräsident Joachim Gauck gesagt habe: ""Unser Herz ist groß, unsere Möglichkeiten sind begrenzt."" Auf die Hilfsbereitschaft der Deutschen würden kommende Generationen stolz sein, die Ordnung müsse in der Bewältigung der Flüchtlingskrise aber bewahrt werden.

Angesprochen auf die Obergrenze sagte Schäuble jedoch in Richtung der CSU: ""Juristen wissen, dass überflüssige Dinge nicht extra erwähnt werden müssen.""

Und ewig grüßt die Obergrenze

Doch die CSU tut genau das, aus einem guten Grund.

Denn die bayerischen Konservativen haben für sich schon immer in Anspruch genommen, der Ausdruck des Volkswillens zu sein. Das galt bei der Mütterrente und der PKW-Maut - und das gilt in der Flüchtlingspolitik.

Und tatsächlich: Laut einer aktuellen Umfrage will eine Mehrheit der Deutschen, dass eine Flüchtlings-Obergrenze eingeführt wird. 54 Prozent der Befragten sprachen sich dafür aus.

Das reicht der CSU als Rechtfertigung. Die Einführung einer Obergrenze wird dadurch nicht wahrscheinlicher - ebenso wenig wie die Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition.

Aber die Aufmerksamkeit der Republik, die ist der CSU gewiss. Und das ist schon einmal was, in diesen schwierigen Zeiten für die Konservativen.

At least 58 people were killed, plus the gunman, and over 500 were injured.



Paddock, who had no serious criminal history, died of an apparent self-inflicted wound. Police could not immediately determine a motive for the attack.

LAS VEGAS ― At least 58 people were killed, plus the gunman, and more than 500 wounded after a gunman unleashed a storm of bullets on an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas late Sunday. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Singer Jason Aldean was performing in the final act of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, a massive three-day country music event, when his set was interrupted by rapid gunfire around 10 p.m. Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, was shooting at the approximately 22,000 concertgoers from a room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel, police later said.

Hordes of panicked fans rushed to flee the scene, hiding under cars and bleachers to escape the bombardment. SWAT team members stormed the hotel and found Paddock in his room, dead of apparent self-inflicted wound and surrounded by at least 20 firearms, including “long rifles,” police said. The windows of his room were smashed open.

Police later found 18 additional firearms, “some” explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition at Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nevada.

Victims, including some in critical condition, were taken to five nearby hospitals. Police said they expected the death count to rise in the coming hours and days.

The Mandalay Bay casino was largely empty Monday afternoon with a heavy security presence throughout the casino floor. Guards blocked exists to the famed Las Vegas Strip. The tense feeling hovering over the main casino floor was offset by friendly staff ready for gamblers to resume their usual activities. The main casino floor bars, still at low capacity but busier than all other areas of the casino floor, were serving the guests who remained. Occasional applause and cheering trickled out of the casino floor, celebrations of those still gambling.

Some staff said the lack of guests in the casino was normal for a Monday afternoon, but others said they saw an unusual number of guests with luggage checking out. Some nearby shops were closed; others remained open for business as usual.

Officials are still investigating the motive behind the attack. Paddock, a white male who was described as the “sole aggressor,” had no serious criminal record, police said. He lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, with a female companion, Marilou Danley, but he had been staying in the Mandalay hotel room since Sept 28. Authorities said that Danley, 62, was not a suspect.

Eric Paddock, the suspect’s brother, said Stephen Paddock was a retired accountant with “no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,” and no history of mental illness. Family and friends described the suspect an an avid gambler.

“We are completely dumbfounded,” Eric Paddock told the Orlando Sentinel. “We can’t understand what happened.”

The owner of the gun shop that recently sold Paddock a shotgun offered a similar assessment.

“He didn’t set off any of my alarms, anything than I felt like there’s a problem in any way shape or form with him,” he told an ABC affiliate. “He was a normal, everyday guy.”

ISIS on Monday claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq News site, but an FBI spokesman said that authorities had found “no connection to an international terrorist group.”

“We don’t understand what’s happened... but as we move on we’ll learn more” Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) said Monday at a press conference. “It was a cowardly despicable act that I am very angry about. There is not much we can do but learn.”

Witnesses to Sunday’s attack described frantic concertgoers running for their lives as intermittent rounds of bullets rained down on the crowd. Many thought the pops were coming from fireworks.

“The concert was going on and we heard what sounded firecrackers going off,” witness Megan Kearny told NBC News. “All of a sudden we heard what sounded like a machine gun and people just started screaming that they were hit and to get down, and about every 20 seconds after that you would hear a round of machine guns, and people just dropping, hundreds of bodies over the ground.”

Joseph Ostunio told the Las Vegas Review Journal that he and his friends “heard shots ring out and we thought they were fireworks so we stayed. And then all of a sudden they just kept coming and coming.”

Ostunio said he realized something was wrong after Aldean abruptly left the stage.

Justin Leyva, a 22-year-old graphic designer from Riverside, California, was at the concert with his girlfriend, Jenna Newton, and her family when he heard the initial gunfire.

“I look back to my girlfriends father who just yells to get down ― and we did,” Leyva said. “My instinct kicked in and I knew I had to get myself as far away from the firing as possible. I grabbed my girlfriend as she was staying down for cover and began throwing chairs out of our path until we finally decided to make a break for it.”

Aldean and his crew were unharmed, he said in an Instagram post, calling the incident “beyond horrific.”

One off-duty police officer was killed and multiple others were injured, including one from the Bakersfield Police Department in Bakersfield, California, authorities said. The Bakersfield officer’s injuries were not life-threatening. Police said that two on-duty police officers were also injured in the shooting, one critically.

President Donald Trump called the shooting an “act of pure evil” and said he would travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday.

“This was a day I wish I had never had to see here in my 27 years of law enforcement,” Las Vegas Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said. “Seeing that scene was probably the most disturbing thing I have had to see in those 27 years.”

The shooting was the third attack on a major music event in recent years. Earlier this year, 22 people were killed at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in the United Kingdom. And 90 people died in 2015 during a suicide attack at a performance by the Eagles of Death Metal at the Bataclan theatre in Paris.

The British actress and model, who is passionate about farm animal welfare and is a patron of Compassion in World Farming, is hopeful that the Beyond Burger will spur more people to ditch meat.

Speaking exclusively to HuffPost UK ahead of sampling the new Beyond Burger, which isn’t yet available in the UK, the 71-year-old says she is confident that plant-based alternatives to meat and fish will “catch on”.

“The idea (of not eating meat) panics people. They wonder ‘how do you get your protein’, but the truth is that we’ve never been taught about it because the farming lobby is so strong and so powerful, it’s rather like the oil lobby, which manages to bury or stifle any new ideas which is not to do with oil,” Lumley says.

Compassion in World Farming Joanna Lumley and Philip Lymbery, CEO of Compassion in World Farming, at the Extinction and Livestock Conference food innovation event.

The food innovation event took place on London on Wednesday night as part of the world’s first ever conference to explore the impact of livestock production on our planet.

Lumley stresses the importance of working with farmers and calls for meat to be more expensive in order to limit the amount that is being consumed.

Yet she admits that the idea of more expensive meat is hard to sell as people want meat that “costs the gutter”.

“And then there’s something slightly aggressive about it (people’s arguments) ‘I don’t see why I should go without meat’, ‘animals are there for us’, Lumley adds.

She stresses the importance of meat alternatives being appetizing.

“If you can lay the breadcrumbs to the cage then you can catch any animals you want. It’s got to be delicious, so you mustn’t do it to feel virtuous and a slog,” Lumley says.

The Beyond Burger, which is backed by Bill Gates and Twitter founder Biz Stone, is the first of its kind to be stocked in the meat section of US supermarkets.

Vegans are hopeful that the burger will soon make its way onto the shelves of Britain’s retailers, although no plans have yet been announced.

Its creator, Beyond Meat, says the plant-based burger has 20g of protein, is cholesterol free and contains no gluten, soy or GMO ingredients. The effect of the burger “bleeding” comes from beetroot.

Compassion in World Farming Joanna Lumley tells HuffPost UK: 'We’ve never been taught about it because the farming lobby is so strong and so powerful'.

Lumley says she is hopeful that people, particularly the younger generation, are starting to embrace a plant-based diet.

“Once it’s in your head that it’s completely normal not to eat meat or fish, there’s no battle to be fought because the next generation will have expensive meat when they do eat it, they will eat much less of it, and they will be much, much healthier.”

But Lumley says apathy is the biggest threat to people embracing a diet richer in plant-based alternatives.

“The difficult part to sell about this is to try to say to people to do something good for the planet. 50% of people will do something good for the planet but 50% couldn’t give jack anything, they will continue to chuck stuff out of the window, buy 74 plastic bags a day and throw them away, they will not recycle stuff because they don’t care.",Joanna Lumley Backs New Vegan Burger That 'Bleeds' Like Meat,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/05/joanna-lumley-vegan-burger_n_18194974.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to.
Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals.","For a long time, the way philanthropy worked was simple: Rich people gave their money to museums and churches and opera houses and Harvard. Their names went up on buildings, charities gave them made-up awards, their grandkids went to rehab, the Earth went around the sun. But philanthropy is changing. Today's billionaires are less interested in legacy institutions, less obsessed with prestige and perpetuity. Part of this is a function of their age: In 2012, 4 percent of America’s biggest charitable donations were made by people under 50 years old. In 2014, a quarter of them were. The other factor driving the new philanthropists is how they earned their money in the first place. Last year, six of the 10 largest charitable donations in the United States came from the tech sector, solidifying Silicon Valley’s place as the epicenter of the newer, bigger, disrupty-er philanthropy. There, tech billionaires form “giving circles” to share leads on promising charities, and they hire the same consultants to vet them. They use terms like “hacker philanthropy” and “effective altruism.” These guys—they are mostly guys—believe that they became successful businessmen by upending existing institutions, by scaling simple ideas, by ""breaking shit."" And, with few exceptions, that is how they plan to become successful philanthropists, too. All of this became much more relevant in December, when Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their wealth to charity. The total amount they pledged, around $45 billion in Facebook shares at current valuation, exceeds the endowments of the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations combined. If Zuckerberg gives away the upper limit of what he announced in December, $1 billion per year for the next three years, he will likely become the world’s second-largest charitable donor after Bill Gates. He is 31 years old.

Give Early, Give Billions 4 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 25 of the biggest philanthropic donations came from people under 50. 2012 2014 Percentage of the biggest philanthropic donations that came from people under 50.

Zuckerberg’s ability to remake the world in his own image, in his own lifetime, is unprecedented. Andrew Carnegie opened his first library when he was 68, and only managed to get around $5 billion in today’s dollars out the door before he died. John D. Rockefeller, generally considered the most generous industrialist in history, launched his foundation when he was 76, and only gave away around half his fortune. If he wanted to, Zuckerberg could eradicate polio, or de-neglect half a dozen tropical diseases, or fix all the water pipes in Flint, or give $9,000 to every single one of the world's refugees. But $45 billion, as a former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grantee put it, is ""a 1,000-pound gorilla."" You don't give away that much money without changing the places and institutions and people you give it to, sometimes for the worse. Zuckerberg should already know this. In 2010, he donated $100 million to the Newark Public Schools on a promise from Cory Booker that he could, according to Dale Russakoff's The Prize, ""flip a whole city."" Zuckerberg rode into Newark with the suddenness of a software update. He was determined to end the stalemate between the teachers’ union and the district, establish dozens of new charter schools and close down failing public ones. Oh, and establish a model that could be replicated in urban school districts all over the country. All in just five years. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Up to $20 million of the donation went to consultants, scrappy little MBAs charging $1,000 a day to develop, among other things, an algorithm that assigned thousands of children to new schools. And nobody bothered to ask parents or teachers whether they wanted to be flipped, causing a ton of resentment that ultimately slowed everything down. By 2015, Zuckerberg was touting Newark's charter schools, with 14,000 students, as a success. Meanwhile, its public schools, with 35,000 students, were announcing a budget deficit of $65 million and layoffs of up to 30 percent of their staff. As Antony Bugg-Levine, the CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, told me, the hard part about social change “is that it doesn’t scale like a social network.” I’ve spent the last few months talking to more than 40 researchers, development practitioners, foundation employees and other Silicon Valley philanthropists, asking them about the difficult business of giving money away. They told me about their own Newarks: Promising ideas scaled into oblivion, donations that disappeared into corrupt governments, groupthink disguised as insight. But they also told me about projects that worked, that scaled, that matched the ambitions of the new philanthropy while avoiding its blind spots. And it turns out that some of the best ideas are the ones Zuckerberg is the least likely to hear in Silicon Valley.

Don’t Be Seduced By Technology

Since December I've been studying Zuckerberg’s Facebook posts like a Talmudic scholar, looking for hints of what he's interested in, trying to figure out the investments and bets and mistakes he's going to make. So far he’s light on specifics, mostly speaking in gushy bromides about ""connecting people"" and ""building strong communities."" But if there is one clear, undeniable, overriding theme that emerges, it is this: Zuckerberg believes in the power of technology to transform the world. ""We must build technology to make change,"" he wrote last fall. ""Many institutions invest money in these challenges, but most progress comes from productivity gains through innovation."" He's not wrong. Nearly every social advance in history has technology somewhere near the center of it—the aqueduct, the steam train, the birth control pill. And whenever you start asking people about the life-altering potential of Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and the tech-based philanthropy he represents, the first words you're likely to hear are “The Green Revolution.” In 1975, nearly three out of five people in Asia lived on less than $1 a day. Rains at the wrong time of year meant the difference between starvation and survival. Then, researchers funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations created new crops—varieties that grew taller, needed less water and could be planted year-round. Over the next 30 years, this innovation radically improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Rice yields spiked by 1,000 percent. Wheat got cheaper, healthier and more abundant. Norman Borlaug, the scientist who developed the new wheat varieties, won the Nobel Prize.

It's understandable to be seduced by this story. America spent more than 100 years going from a poor agrarian society to a rich urban one. Technology, the development agencies and the foundations tell you, has the potential to ""leapfrog"" this process for the next batch of countries, to boost poor communities into the middle class without all the messy slave labor and cholera we went through on the way. But as Kentaro Toyama, a former Gates Foundation consultant and the author of Geek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology, points out, it’s not the development of technology that leads to social change, but the application of it. The Green Revolution, he says, wasn't just a case of ""new crops, big changes."" At the same time the farmers were planting the higher-yield crops, governments were dramatically reforming their agricultural policies. Between 1972 and 1990, Asian countries nearly tripled their investments in agriculture. They provided subsidized loans for farmers to buy fertilizer, trained them in how to plant the new crops and built roads and canals to get their produce to markets. In 1970, only 12 percent of the agricultural land in Bangladesh was irrigated. By 1995, 38 percent of it was. ""Technology,"" Toyama says, ""is the easiest part of any solution."" The hard part is everything that comes afterward. Take car crashes, which kill more people every year than tuberculosis or pulmonary disease. The technology to prevent these deaths—seat belts, motorcycle helmets—is not rocket science. It's just that no one has figured out how to make it appeal to the people who need it, especially in the developing world, where 90 percent of these deaths occur. Sometimes technological solutions aren't up against indifference, but outright resistance. In the ’80s, a global health NGO called PATH got a grant to develop Uniject, a pre-filled, single-use syringe designed for midwives or birth attendants to inject patients in their homes. The syringe was ready in the mid-1990s, but more than 15 years later, it had only been rolled out in one developing country. The others had laws that prohibited anyone but doctors from giving injections. ""Lots of new technologies require policy changes to be effective,"" says Michael Free, the former director of product development for PATH. ""Getting buy-in for that takes a lot longer."" All these snags, though, are too complicated for the clean ""leapfrogging"" narrative you hear from the techno-utopians—and from Zuckerberg himself. ""A few months ago I learned about a farmer in Maharashtra called Ganesh,"" Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed in the Times of India in December. ""Last year Ganesh started using Free Basics [Facebook's no-cost Internet service for developing countries]. He found weather information to prepare for monsoon season. He looked up commodity prices to get better deals. Now Ganesh is investing in new crops and livestock."" This, too, is tempting to swallow whole. If farmers knew the prices they'd get for their produce, they could choose the market offering the highest price, or plant more profitable crops in the first place. Entire communities could be changed by the simple injection of information. The only published evidence of this effect in the real world, though, is a 2007 study that showed fishermen in Kerala, India, checking prices for their fish before deciding which port to sell them to. These fishermen sell a perishable good. They have to sell it to someone, they have to sell it today and it's the same distance back to the shore regardless of which port they pick. But the typical African or Indian farmer does not live perfectly equidistant from several produce markets. One might take an hour to get to, the other 10. And when farmers in developing countries buy seeds, they are not comparison-shopping between dozens of stores. They have just a few options, and often have to go through village middlemen or loan sharks. ""Even when you have the information,"" Toyama says, ""you're not in a situation where you can get any benefit from it."" Also, when “leapfrogging” happens, it can be less of a jump and more of a step. The Kerala study, which sounds so transformative, only boosted incomes for fishermen by around 8 percent, and reduced the price of fish for consumers by 4 percent. It didn’t turn poor fishermen into white-collar workers, and it didn’t give a broad swath of the population access to more nutritious food. And guess what? That's fine! If there's one piece of advice that emerges from the last 50 years of the tech-for-the-poor hope and disappointment cycle, it is this: Chase the 8 percents. Zuckerberg has interest and expertise in technology, and there's nothing inherently wrong with making bets on gadgets or innovations that have the potential to help the poor. But as he does so, he should acknowledge that the silver-bullet promise of technology only works at changing the world when it's combined with political will and popular demand. Until he finds a way to engineer those (please don't), he should focus on the small ways, at the margins, where technology can improve people's lives, 8 percent at a time.

$45 Billion Isn't That Much Money

In 2001, the Gates Foundation gave PATH and the World Health Organization $70 million, 10 years and a simple objective: Develop a vaccine for meningitis A and make it affordable for every single person who needs it. At the time, meningitis A was concentrated in one part of the world, a stripe across the middle of sub-Saharan Africa known as the ""meningitis belt."" The disease mostly affected children, causing them to die or become paralyzed in minutes. The yearly outbreaks were predictable. Where they would happen, and how severely, were not. Eventually, PATH developed a vaccine that gave patients 15 years of immunity. At a cost of around 50 cents a dose, public health departments in every country in the meningitis belt could afford to procure it at scale. By 2013, less than a decade after an outbreak killed 25,000 people, the meningitis belt had just four reported cases. Marc LaForce headed the team in charge of bringing the vaccine to market. He says it wasn't just the scale of the Gates donation that mattered, but its duration. In those days, most grants were capped at two or three years, with check-ins every six months. Years of work could be wiped away if a donor decided progress was moving too slowly and pulled out. ""If you want to do something major,"" LaForce says, ""you need the ability to go two steps forward, then one step back."" Plus, the Gates team left LaForce alone. Back then, the foundation only employed about a dozen people who worked out of a small office in a residential neighborhood of Seattle. Staffers spent their time making lists of diseases, ranking them by annual fatalities, then calling around to find out which ones were closest to being cured. “We didn’t need to be specialists,” says Gordon Perkin, the foundation’s first director of global health. “We just needed to know which organizations had the judgment and the infrastructure, and we gave them money.” This story doesn't just illustrate the potential of philanthropy. It also demonstrates that how Zuckerberg gives away his money will be just as important as what he gives it to. Because one way to look at his $45 billion is that it's a lot of money. Another way to look at it is that it's about what the United States spends on prisons every six months. Or education every four weeks. Or health care every five days. Even at a scale that large, efficiency matters. It’s shocking just how unusual that early Gates grant was. Most legacy foundations pay consultants millions of dollars to study and re-study problems before they give grants toward solving them. The Ford Foundation spends nearly $1 for every $4 it gives away. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation’s largest grant recipient (other than its offshoot, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors), was Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm. “All the work was to provide advice on internal decision-making,” a former Rockefeller employee told me. “To make it seem charitable we'd ask them to write a blog on our website, and that would frequently be the only public or charitable thing to come out of these multimillion-dollar so-called grants.” (In a statement, the Rockefeller Foundation defended its approach, saying that it “has developed a rigorous model on how to determine the problems we support, and ultimately the solutions that we believe will create the most impact.”)

Won't Somebody Please Think of the Consultants? $146.4M What the Ford Foundation spent in 2013 deciding how to give its money away $539.1M What the Ford Foundation gave away

The Gates Foundation, as it's expanded to more than 1,300 employees, has become prone to the same bloat, the same ""expert-itis,"" as a former grantee calls it. ""They hired Ph.D.s in biotech and all they wanted to do was the science that the grantees were doing."" As the staff proliferated, so did the conditions on the donations. The foundation started requiring grantees to keep track of baggage fees and told them they couldn't buy laptops or let their overhead go above 15 percent. ""Grant approval processes went from 48 hours to 48 months,"" the former grantee told me. (The Gates Foundation responded, too: “While each grant agreement is unique, we have policies in place to help ensure that our funds are spent as effectively as possible."") It’s hard to overstate just how un-Silicon Valley all of this is. ""Money is sitting there to make the world a better place, and to dole it out cautiously is antithetical to why it’s there,"" says Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, a foundation set up by Mitch Kapor, an early investor in Uber and other unicorns. I heard similar arguments from almost all the tech people I talked to: Zuckerberg shouldn't be afraid to fail; he should approach philanthropy like a venture capitalist, testing out ideas to scale up later on. Bypassing legacy institutions is what Silicon Valley CEOs are good at, right? All those consultants must strike them as the charity equivalent of taxi medallions. Still, running a charity does require fully understanding problems before you try to solve them. ""Move fast and break things"" is a fine mentality for Facebook, where the consequences of a few bad lines of code are mostly limited to a drop in revenue or an exodus of users to Snapchat. Applying the same philosophy to health or education or criminal justice has consequences that can't be shrugged away. In the 1990s, Western donors' emphasis on HIV/AIDS in Africa resulted in chronic under-funding of less-visible conditions like pneumonia, anemia and diarrhea. Zuckerberg's donation in Newark resulted in public schools being closed and some kids having to walk through rough neighborhoods to charter schools far from their homes. And it’s this neglected zone, somewhere between bloat and ""break things,"" where Zuckerberg has the opportunity to do something quietly, unsexily awesome. The U.S. has more than 85,000 foundations and 1.5 million charities. Most major charitable causes, things like curing cancer, regularizing immigration and providing early education, are already covered by dozens of capable—and overlapping—organizations. In its annual survey of philanthropists, Grantmakers for Effective Organizations reported that 80 percent of donors wanted to see more collaboration between their grantees. But only 13 percent were willing to consistently pay for it. The need for coordination is obvious when you look at the scale of the problems that philanthropists want to solve. Again, studying Gates’ early years is instructive. When he decided he wanted to vaccinate hundreds of millions of African kids, he didn't set up an organization that would replace WHO or UNICEF or all the other agencies already handing out vaccines. Instead, he founded something called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a funding pipeline designed to help those agencies work more effectively. Gavi pays pharmaceutical companies to research tropical diseases, it issues ""vaccine bonds"" so poor countries can buy millions of treatments on layaway, it orders medications in such bulk that the cost comes down to pennies. In short, it connects a network of actors who have similar interests—something Zuckerberg knows a thing or two about. So if he really wants to leverage the limited funding he has, Zuckerberg shouldn't think of himself as a venture capitalist. He should think of himself as a mutual fund manager. Find promising organizations, perform due diligence, link them to a portfolio of other agencies doing good work—then give them money and get out of their way. Or, as Patricia Stonesifer, the current CEO of Martha's Table and the former CEO of the Gates Foundation, puts it, “Don’t expect to be the only solution out there.”

Capitalism: The Cause of, and Solution to, All of Life’s Problems

What Zuckerberg actually announced last December wasn't a big fat donation to charity. All he did was establish a limited liability company (LLC) and issue a promise that he would use it for good. Much of the reaction at the time was suspicious, speculating that an LLC was a scheme for Zuckerberg to avoid taxes (which isn't true) or that it would allow him to spend mountains of money without disclosing how he was doing so (which is). But the corporate approach actually makes a lot of sense. Under the standard philanthropic model, billionaires set up a foundation and give it a huge endowment. Every year, the foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its total value. Meanwhile, the other 95 percent gets invested in blue chip stocks, hedge funds, foreign currencies, whatever will keep the total endowment the same size. That's how foundations like Rockefeller and Ford exist in perpetuity: Do-gooders work on one side of the building finding things to donate to, while bankers work on the other side, making sure there's more to donate next year. Recently, though, donors have started to reject this model. Giving away a trickle of money each year is unlikely to live up to the verbs—transform, reimagine, revolutionize—the new philanthropists use to describe their goals. Besides, why should 95 percent of your money just sit there in hedge funds and Halliburton stock, especially if you think you can do just as much good with the money you invest as the money you give away? ""This idea that philanthropy is only about nonprofits is an outdated model,"" says Paula Goldman, a vice president at the Omidyar Network. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, was one of the most prominent tech billionaires to merge his investing and grant-making. The foundation still gives donations, but the LLC provides loans and seed capital and invests in things like solar-powered lighting startups, Brazilian test-prep companies and funds that discover Indian entrepreneurs. Zuckerberg is going even further, giving up on a foundation entirely and putting all of his charity money in a corporate form with no limits on how to spend it. He’s not interested in making his money back. He just wants the flexibility to fund charities or companies or both. Which explains why one of Zuckerberg’s most recent donations wasn’t a donation at all. It was $10 million in seed capital for an education startup called Bridge International Academies, a chain of private elementary schools that wants to deliver education to the world's poorest students. Bridge’s model, which has only been rolled out in Kenya so far, is based on standardization and accountability. Teachers get a centralized curriculum from Bridge experts, then deliver it to kids from an e-reader. Students—and teachers—are tracked in real time, principals notified of everything from attendance rates to busted pipes. The latest class of Bridge students just took their exams. Sixty percent passed, compared to the national average of 49 percent

It's tempting to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either.

The primary appeal of Bridge, especially to investors like Zuckerberg, is the $6 per month it says it charges its students. Operating as a business rather than a charity gives each school an incentive to deliver a decent education and ensures that it’s not going to wither away when development agencies or donors move on to the next idea. But the problem with dispatching private companies to supply basic services is that they replace the public systems already tasked with providing them. Last year, 116 African NGOs signed an open letter to Bridge International Academies and the World Bank, pointing out that $6 per month is in fact a lot of money for a lot of Kenyans. Bridge schools charge extra for uniforms and lunch. Its teachers earn around $90 per month, teaching classes as large as 70 students. Those pass rates 11 percent higher than the national average are great, but the letter also noted that Bridge, with 400 schools, has attracted more than $100 million in international investment. Meanwhile, Kenya's public system, with almost 20,000 schools, has gotten just $88 million. Lucy Bradlow, Bridge's global director of public relations, counters that the majority of Kenyan kids already attend private schools, many of which cost even more than Bridge and provide even less. In public schools, teacher absentee rates are so high that the average kid only gets two hours of instruction per day. She’s right: Bridge is a little bit better than what's already there. But the troubling part about the company isn't the service it provides now, but the one it wants to provide later. Bridge sees itself as a “model,” one that its backers believe can be spread across the entire developing world. It plans to be profitable once it serves 500,000 students. Eventually, it hopes to reach 10 million. Bridge's own marketing materials describe it as “a scalable Academy-in-a-Box solution.” But the history of philanthropy is littered with projects that helped the poor at a small scale, then made them worse off at a larger one. Microfinance started out small, too. The early trials were non-profit, and revenues were invested back into services that would help borrowers pay back their loans. Then, in the late 2000s, responding to donor pressure to be “sustainable,” microlending went private. Citibank, Barclays and Deutsche Bank established microfinance divisions. In 2007, one of the largest microlending banks, Mexico’s Compartamos Banco, even had an IPO, its executives earning millions loaning out money to women and poor farmers and charging interest rates as high as 195 percent. Since most loans were capped at a few hundred dollars, borrowers could only get enough money to set up informal businesses, stuff like selling fruit on the side of the road or giving rides on a scooter. As microloans flooded the market, small-scale services flooded entire economies. In Bangladesh, nearly 25 percent of the population took out a microloan. In Mexico, Compartamos’ customers were taking out new microloans to pay back the ones they already had. By scaling up too fast, microfinance ended up trapping people in the exact cycle—informal work, bottomless debt, low productivity—from which it was designed to free them.

How Microfinance Traps the Poor *As illustrated by someone we’ll call Joey Joey lives in a village. He earns $5 a day working on a farm. He doesn't want to do that anymore. One day, he takes out a microloan for $100. He opens a fruit stand that sells apples for 50 cents each. He sells around 20 a day, so now he’s earning $10. Success! But then the bank starts giving loans to lots of other people in the village, too. Suddenly everyone is selling apples, and Joey has to sell his for 25 cents each to compete. Now, he’s earning $5 a day again. And starting tomorrow, he owes the bank $10 every week to pay off his loan.

It's tempting to stop there, to say capitalism perverts philanthropy, full stop, and advise Zuckerberg to just go back and form a foundation. But that's not right either. One of the most successful private-sector development projects of the last 10 years is M-PESA, the mobile-money system that allows people in Kenya to transfer money via their cell phones. Before the system launched, Kenyans sent money to each other by mail, or by giving envelopes full of cash to bus drivers. Replacing an inefficient, expensive system with a regularized one made everybody better off. That's not as easy to argue, in the long run, about education. So, when Zuckerberg hears pitches from companies seeking to solve the world's problems, he shouldn't ask them if they have a plan to grow, or an ambition to exist in perpetuity. He should ask himself whether he really wants them to replace the systems that already exist, or simply make them better. Because successful companies don't just disrupt other companies—they disrupt economies, governments and the people who depend on them. That's not something that Zuckerberg ever had to worry about, but he has to start.

Go Beyond Giving Directly

In 2009, four grad students came up with an audacious idea: Instead of giving poor people the things we think they need—bags of food, stacks of clothing, a pair of goats—what if we gave them enough money to decide for themselves? They called their charity GiveDirectly, and in 2011 they started doing exactly that. They went to villages in Kenya, found the poorest people living there and transferred $1,000 straight to their cell phones. Later, they came back to ask the villagers what they did with the money. Mostly, it turns out, the villagers spent it on better roofs, better food, paying off debts, starting up businesses. All the stuff the development system used to buy for them—but without any overhead. At first, no one wanted to fund an idea this outlandish. But then, GiveDirectly went to Silicon Valley. Google got in early, awarding the charity its Global Impact Award and dispatching the head of Google.org to sit on GiveDirectly’s board. Since then, GiveDirectly has grown like a Y Combinator startup, its budget ballooning from $700,000 in 2012 to $17.4 million in 2014. In 2013, Chris Hughes, Zuckerberg’s Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, hosted a coming-out party for the charity with the heads of Dropbox and General Catalyst Partners. Dustin Moskovitz, Zuckerberg's other Harvard roommate and Facebook co-founder, just handed GiveDirectly $25 million. At five years old, GiveDirectly is the most buzzed-about charity in Silicon Valley. What all this hype ignores, though, is that GiveDirectly's audacious idea has been around for decades. Post-disaster charities have been experimenting with cash transfers since the 1990s. In 2010, when floods deluged one-third of Pakistan, aid workers handed out 1.7 million debit cards pre-loaded with $230. As early as the 1980s, Latin American countries were handing out ""conditional"" cash grants, paying parents to send their kids to school or feed them balanced meals. Even the World Bank, not exactly a laboratory of revolutionary thinking, has poured more than $25 billion into ""social safety nets""—unemployment and pension benefits, basically—in developing countries. ""Welfare"" sounds a lot less “break shit” than transferring money to people via their cell phones, but it is, sorry everybody, the same thing. And that's exactly why Zuckerberg should be excited about giving money directly to poor people: Not because it is a new and revolutionary idea, but because it is an old and effective one—that’s only fulfilling a fraction of its potential. The challenge with direct cash payments, says Owen Barder, the director of Europe for the Center for Global Development, is getting them to all of the people who need them. The places where this strategy has worked well already had functioning banking sectors and national identification systems in place before a disaster struck. In Pakistan, humanitarian agencies used government data to identify the areas with the worst damage, then checked IDs to make sure the debit cards got to the people living there. Most poor countries, though, don't have these pipes laid down. Kenya's Hunger Safety Nets program, which gives cash to people at risk of starvation, took months to establish because payouts were distributed through local agents, whom people didn't trust, or ATMs, which people had never used before. Barder describes a scenario where, 10 minutes after an earthquake hits Nepal, all the people within five miles of the epicenter get $500 on their cell phones. That's a great idea. But it is, he says, a lot harder than it sounds. After the 2005 tsunami, low-caste populations in India were almost entirely excluded from cash transfers because they weren't registered in the national welfare system. In Indonesia, cash transfers were distributed through community leaders who had to come to a central planning center, then travel back to their constituencies with an envelope full of cash. In at least one case, bandits were waiting for them on the bus. The need for modernizing these systems is obvious. In 2009, India launched an ambitious—and largely unheralded—project to issue a 12-digit identification number to all 1.3 billion of its citizens. So far, it has spent around $880 million and registered 970 million people. The numbers are already being used to distribute unemployment checks and disaster relief. But as this effort moves to more remote populations, registering them gets harder. Some farmers have hands so worn the scanners can’t read their fingerprints. Laying down the pipes to get cash transfers to the first 75 percent of a population, the people who have birth certificates and cell phones, is relatively easy. Getting to the last 25 percent, the people one charity could never reach, is technical, slow, expensive and absolutely critical—a perfect project for Zuckerberg.

Let Cosatu know that our Constitution is a triumph against this bigotry, writes Director of School Vouchers SA, Mbulelo Nguta.

We condemn the barbaric and unfounded notion that Pastor Nala can ""heal"" homosexuality. Although we believe that Pastor Nala, like all South Africans, is entitled to an opinion and association, we find it to be extremely problematic if his views threaten the lives of the many others who are sexual minorities, writes the ANC LGBTI Forum.

A medida que se va acercando el primero de octubre la virulencia de los sentimientos independentistas se va atemperando a juzgar por la evolución que muestran los datos del estudio sobre la situación política elaborado por NC Report para LA RAZÓN. Al retroceso en el apoyo a la secesión del resto de España se unen, además, opiniones mayoritarias tendentes al escepticismo sobre el resultado de las maniobras del bloque independentista. Concretamente, un 55,9% cree que la consulta ilegal no se permitirá, mientras que un 33,1% mantiene la esperanza de que el referéndum finalmente llegue a producirse. El 11% restante no sabe o prefiere no manifestar su opinión al respecto. También es revelador el tanto por ciento de los que creen que los pronunciamientos del Tribunal Constitucional frenarán los planes de los partidos secesionistas, que sube incluso hasta 56,5%. Por el contrario, un 34% confía en que los pronunciamientos del Alto Tribunal no tengan ningún efecto para los planes soberanistas y un 9,5% prefiere no opinar. Estos dos datos, y el hecho de que se confirma una tendencia al alza en estos dos apartados del estudio respecto a la misma encuesta publicada a principios de julio, dibujan un estado de opinión en Cataluña que contrasta dramáticamente con el que «venden» los principales portavoces del independentismo en esta región y con el tenor general que se deja ver en el resto de apartados de la encuesta.

Precisamente, el estudio comienza preguntando a los participantes la que, si las pretensiones del bloque independentista se materializan finalmente, será la pregunta que aparezca en la papeleta de la consulta ilegal: «¿Quiere que Cataluña sea un Estado independiente en forma de república?». La mayoría sigue oponiéndose a esta «república» catalana propuesta por ERC y PDeCAT, ya que el 48,6% de los encuestados respondió negativamente, frente al 41,5% que es partidario del «sí» a la secesión del resto de España. Un 9,9% de los participantes en el estudio no contestó a la pregunta, lo que supone un aumento de 2,5 puntos respecto a la encuesta de principios de julio. Es preciso señalar asimismo que el tanto por ciento de partidarios de la independencia ha descendido en ese mismo periodo 3,5 puntos, del 44% de julio al 41,5% registrado en el estudio publicado hoy.

A los que respondieron afirmativamente a la primera cuestión del estudio se les preguntó a continuación si cambiarían el sentido de su voto del «sí» al «no» en el caso de que Cataluña quedara fuera de la Unión Europea tras la independencia, tal y como han afirmado reiteradamente varios portavoces de las instituciones europeas desde que arrancó el llamado «procés». Tres cuartas partes de los encuestados independentistas (75,3%) no tienen miedo a las repercusiones para la economía catalana de una salida de Europa, ya que mostraron su intención de votar «sí» en la consulta ilegal en cualquier caso. Sin embargo, un 14,5 por ciento sí estaría dispuesto a cambiar el sentido de su voto si esto asegura no ser excluidos de la UE.

La mayoría de los participantes en el estudio de NC Report, concretamente un 53,9%, coinciden con el sentimiento generalizado en la clase política de que si las pretensiones independentistas fracasan y finalmente no se celebra la consulta deberían celebrarse elecciones anticipadas en Cataluña, unas elecciones que, a tenor del resultado de la encuesta de intención de voto publicada ayer por LA RAZÓN, daría la Presidencia de la Generalitat a Oriol Junqueras ya sea reeditando el pacto con la CUP o aventurándose a un frente de izquierdas con la franquicia de Podemos y los socialistas catalanes. El porcentaje de encuestados que cree, en la misma línea, que Carles Puigdemont debería dimitir si no se celebra el referéndum es del 53%, muy superior al de los que creen que su dimisión no sería necesaria (35,9%). Muy critica es también la respuesta mayoritaria cuando se preguntó a los participantes en el estudio si la Generalitat había descuidado las tareas de gestión que le son propias por atender a la buena marcha del llamado «procés». En concreto son un 57% los catalanes que coinciden con esta manera de ver las cosas frente al 34,4% que piensa que el órdago independentista no ha afectado a las labores de Gobierno de Puigdemont.

Son porcentajes análogos a los que arrojó la siguiente pregunta del estudio, aquella que inquiría sobre si la antigua Convergència ha utilizado la cortina de humo del independentismo para tapar sus escándalos de corrupción. Afirmativamente contestó el 54,6%. Por otro lado, el 35,9% no coincide con esta opinión. Si apelamos al sentimentalismo, germen y filón del soberanismo, son mayoría (un 39,4%) quienes se reconocen tan españoles como catalanes, seguidos del 23,6% que se siente más catalán que español, y el 20,1 por ciento que se identifica únicamente como catalán. Cierran esta suerte de ranking quienes no quieren o no saben responder a esta cuestión (6,6%), quienes se sienten más españoles que catalanes (5,9%) y quienes se reconocen únicamente españoles (4,4%).

Como ya sucedió en la encuesta publicada a principios de julio, ninguno de los líderes políticos catalanes llega al aprobado en opinión de los catalanes. Oriol Junqueras es el mejor valorado con un 4,3, una décima menos que hace mes y medio. Le siguen Ada Colau (4,2), Miquel Iceta (4,1) y Carles Puigdemont (4,0). Por debajo del 4 aparecen Inés Arrimadas (3,6), Xavier García Albiol (3,0) y, cerrando la tabla, la portavoz de la CUP, Anna Gabriel, con un 3, una décima más que en la última encuesta.",La mayoría de los catalanes cree que el referéndum no se celebrará,http://www.larazon.es/espana/la-mayoria-de-los-catalanes-cree-que-el-referendum-no-se-celebrara-OK15797485

Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan.","ADVERTISEMENT

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI -- At Hrithik Roshan's sprawling, 3,000-square feet house in Juhu, Mumbai, an entire wall in the living room is covered by a mirror. Hidden away in tiny lettering in a corner of the wall closest to the mirror are the words, ""There are two sides to every story."" You can spot it if you look closely. It is the writing on the wall that matters now as the latest volley of statements and accusations fly thick and fast in his supposed affair-gone-sour story with Kangana Ranaut.

The Rashomon-like narrative is not just about two Indian movie stars squabbling over a past affair. Both of them have indicated that they would rather just ""move on"". Hrithik has claimed he was never romantically involved with Kangana; she has in turn called him a ""silly ex"". What is truly bewildering is that neither of them are ready to actually let go — Kangana has spoken about her alleged affair with the Krrish star in numerous interviews at least two years after it was all supposedly over, and Hrithik has responded with legal notices and police complaints.

Apart from the obvious point of contention — that a woman claims a man dated her and he denies it — the whole controversy also throws the spotlight on certain incidents that border on something much sinister: cyber harassment and stalking.

According to Hrithik, he has had a strictly professional relationship with Kangana. They shot two films together — Kites in 2010 and Krrish 3 in 2013 — and never spent any time in private.

How It Started: 'Queen' Incident

In January, 2014, Kangana sent Hrithik an email and a text message asking him why he hadn't thanked her for a ""special birthday present"" she had sent him. She had also sent a synopsis of a script she had written and wanted to direct some day, which he read around the same time and replied to both emails, saying he hadn't received a present but that he had read her script and was really proud of her.

""This is the only mail I have sent her in my life,"" Hrithik told HuffPost India. He said he encouraged Kangana, who grew up in Himachal Pradesh, to overcome her language barrier. ""Throughout the time I have known her, she has been struggling with her language to learn how to speak in English. And I am coming from a place where I have had a handicap — a stutter — and I have been in a very empowered place to tell her things like 'it doesn't matter'. That is the one thing where maybe I have had a chat with her in my life. I gave her examples like (late) Yash Chopra who doesn't know English but he speaks with his heart.""

""And I am coming from a place where I have had a handicap — a stutter — and I have been in a very empowered place to tell her things like 'it doesn't matter'.""

In the 28 January, 2014, email, Hrithik told her he was proud of her evolution, calling her script a ""storybook romance"".

In response, Kangana offered to buy him an Apple device, according to emails exchanged between them. Hrithik stopped replying. All emails mentioned in this story have been viewed by this HuffPost India reporter who is in possession of copies of most of these written exchanges between the two.

Meanwhile, Hrithik said that Kangana sent him some texts that year. When he went to shoot Bang Bang in Shimla in February 2014, Kangana sent him suggestions of places he could visit near her hometown. He thanked her.

But it was on 24 May, 2014, at a party thrown by Bollywood film director Karan Johar, where Hrithik said an encounter with Kangana ""stunned"" him. Her film Queen had been released to tremendous critical and commercial acclaim in March that year, and he went up to congratulate her at the party.

""I told her I haven't seen the film but I will see the film and I will give you my feedback,"" he said. But the 27-year-old actress looked at him in confusion. ""But you have seen my film,"" she told him.

""I told her I haven't seen the film but I will see the film and I will give you my feedback,"" he said. But the 27-year-old actress looked at him in confusion. ""But you have seen my film,"" she told him. ""No, I haven't, but I will, and I promise to watch it soon and give my honest feedback,"" he remembered replying to her.

""But you've seen my film,"" she insisted, he said. That was when she told him that she had received an email from him, detailing the scenes in Queen he enjoyed the most. He told her he hadn't sent her any email. She walked away, visibly upset, Hrithik recalled, and he followed, disturbed. She refused to speak to him after that, he said.

Kangana's legal team has a very different description of the night — according to her, she confronted Hrithik at the party after suspicions that he had hacked her email, and later believed that he hacked a second email address she had created in order to send himself emails.

Next morning, Hrithik said he woke up to a string of abusive messages from Kangana sent between 3 and 4am.

""I presumed that she had lost her phone and somebody had found it and was playing a prank,"" he said. What followed was even more baffling. Rangoli forwarded him an email he had supposedly sent to Kangana earlier that month. In that email, he refers to them as a ""couple"". Alarmed, the actor thought his email had been hacked. It was only after he alerted his office manager and IT assistant, did he notice that the mail Rangoli had forwarded came from a different ID than the one the actor used.

Imposter At Play?

Hrithik informed Rangoli that his email address was different, and warned her that someone could be posing as him in communication with Kangana. In fact Rangoli herself suggested that they go to the police together. She said Kangana was ""stressed"" because she had sent on that email id ""pictures, videos, mails and messages"" and has received ""a lot of stuff"" from him as well.

An hour later, in an email, Rangoli accused the actor of ""psychologically raping"" her sister.

""When I read words like this, I completely disconnected,"" he said, adding that he refused to engage after the accusations against him.

However, the next morning, Rangoli wrote back to him, saying that she didn't know what was going on, but that Kangana was upset. In an email, dated 26 May, 2014, she wrote Kangana had forwarded to her a mail, supposedly from the actor, to show that the two were indeed in a relationship.

Matters took a turn soon when Rangoli claimed that Kangana's email had been hacked, and all her emails from Hrithik were deleted. Interestingly, both Rangoli and Kangana appeared to be convinced that it was Hrithik who was writing to the actress. Rangoli asked him to delete all old videos and photos that the actress had shared with him over the email ID Hrithik claimed wasn't his. She said she believed he did not have any ""bad intention"" and that she wanted to ""close the matter"".

Hrithik stopped responding.

Five weeks later, in July, Hrithik said he was startled to receive a blank email from Kangana, with a subject line that said she missed him. He didn't respond, and continued to receive dozens of emails from her regularly, following which he said he started sending these emails to his ""junk"" mail folder.

""I just decided that this is very weird, I went through this very weird episode on one day, I don't want to into this and I started to junk them,"" he told HuffPost India. ""All this time I am thinking, oh my god she is extending her relationship with the imposter on to me now.""

""I was just irritated, confused, I showed these mails to all my friends and asked what should i do and they said just ignore.""

""All this time I am thinking, oh my god she is extending her relationship with the imposter on to me now."" Hrithik Roshan

He shared his concerns with his close friends, and even a top police officer in Mumbai, all of whom suggested that he should ignore it, he told HuffPost India.

""At times I thought I would call her and clear the matter once and for all but I could sense from her explicit mails and words that this was a mess and I just didn't want to get myself further involved in something that literally had nothing to do with me,"" he wrote to a friend in the film industry in May, 2016.

""Ninety percent of the mails were explicit in nature.""

""There were times when my kids were travelling with Sussanne (his ex-wife) and [I] used to keep my alerts on at night only to receive such mails from her that used to mess up my mind in the middle of the night,"" he wrote. ""I used to bang my phone down in anger,"" he said.

""There were times when my kids were travelling with Sussanne (his ex-wife) and [I] used to keep my alerts on at night only to receive such mails from her that used to mess up my mind in the middle of the night.""

In some of the emails, which Hrithik said he only read much later, when he was submitting them to the police, she had detailed her day's plans, and sent photos of herself at pujas, unwinding at home, as well as some explicit images. All of these, Hrithik said, were unsolicited, and totalled to about 3,000 by the time he submitted them to police.

Kangana later told the police that her computer was hacked. According to her lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, Hrithik hacked into her account and sent himself these emails. Kangana had complained to Hrithik's father, filmmaker Rakesh Roshan about this incident. Siddiquee told HuffPost India that only a handful of these emails were actually sent by Kangana to Hrithik, and that she did not file a police complaint as the two actors were on cordial terms.

Many of the photos sent in these emails to Hrithik, Siddiquee claimed, were actually older photos of Kangana that she had sent earlier to the ""imposter"" email ID. He alleged that Hrithik had downloaded these emails and sent them to himself from Kangana's email, to establish a one-sided love affair.

Her 'Mystery Man'

After a news report in December 2014 claimed Hrithik was Kangana's ""mystery man"", he decided to lodge a complaint against this imposter who seemed to be communicating with her using his name. It was on the same day that he stopped getting emails from Kangana, he said.

According to Hrithik, there were several times in 2015 when someone in the film fraternity would refer to his supposed relationship with Kangana, which he would deny. ""It began really bothering me,"" he wrote to his friend.

Hrithik said he explored all his legal options, but he was advised that the laws of the country would not work to his advantage. What he was undergoing, he said, was cyberstalking — there was no other way to describe it. And cyberstalking holds a much lower risk of punishment than any law that protects women from harassment.

Early the following year, in January 2016, Kangana referred to Hrithik as a ""silly ex"", which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The actor sent a legal notice to the actress.

It needs to be said here that this alleged love affair was all happening over mail.

At the time, the actor was convinced that the complaint to the cyber cell in 2014 would help bring out the facts of the case. It was around then that he retrieved from his junk folder emails from Kangana, he said.

""I realised I couldn't do both — maintain clean hands AND wish for the mess to be cleaned on its own. I had to get my hands dirty,"" he wrote to his friend. ""I remember a time in school when crow shit fell on my head, every kid stayed away from me even tho [sic] I had nothing to do with the crow or its shit.""

However, the police could not trace the ""imposter"" in Hrithik's complaint – the US justice department which was trying to trace the account found that it either ""never existed"" or had been automatically deleted because it hadn't been in use for several months, reported The Times of India in November last year.

Kangana did not submit her electronic devices for investigations into her hacking claims. ""She claims that she was receiving emails from an ID which she told us that is not ours. We offered to get to the bottom of the fake identity. The police have told us this ID is registered in New Jersey. She has neither cooperated in getting that ID and we don't know how many emails she got. Nor has she given any of the receiving instrument,"" Hrithik's lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani told HuffPost India in a telephone interview.

In April this year, Hrithik submitted his emails and devices to the police for forensic analysis. Given the nature of delays in forensic examinations in India, he also submitted a report from a private forensic firm where he himself got his devices tested. The report says that none of his devices were used to access the internet domain for the alleged ""imposter"" ID, nor did he have any intimate photos or videos of Kangana in his hard drive, even among his ""deleted files"". The emails with Kangana's photos were mostly sent directly from her iPhone 5s, according to the private forensic report.

The cops still have his laptop.

""I'm a bystander in this entire episode. This shit has just fallen on my lap,"" he said to HuffPost India.

""Testifying for my character, for something I have not done — it looks half guilty.""

Despite repeated requests, Kangana declined comment on the matter. Rangoli did not respond to text messages requesting her comment.

A vast array of institutions and scientific infrastructure keeps UK food fit to eat.
Yet both Falkenberg and Johnson admit that animal welfare and farming practices aren’t always at the top of politicians’ agendas.
A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.","There have been fresh warnings that Brexit could lead to British farming and food standards being lowered if meat from the United States is allowed to flood UK supermarkets.

The claims, which have been backed by passionate animal welfare advocate and former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson, come amid a conference this week of international agriculture and livestock experts in London.

Experts have said that Brexit could see a race to the bottom for Britain’s food quality in the interests of completing free trade deals with countries like the United States, and that food safety standards faced “serious risks” if the UK failed to adopt EU-style rules.

This follows previous warnings that rules around hormone-injected meat, chlorinated chicken, milk containing antibiotics and genetically modified vegetables could be weakened after the country severs ties with the European Union, which currently offers protections against such products.

EMPICS Entertainment Stanley Johnson warns that Brexit could force UK farmers to lower standards to compete with US market.

Johnson, who also revealed he now backs his son Boris on Brexit, told HuffPost UK it would be easy for Britain to go down the mass production route seen in the US.

“Just how animal friendly are some of these intensive rearing techniques... which result in cattle never getting out of the feed lot at all? I would be worried that, once we’re out of the EU, people will say ‘ok we can get American beef’.

“I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life, where you have got thousands and thousands of animals packed in,” he told HuffPost UK.

I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life Stanley Johnson

Johnson added that cheap meat from the US could also lead to farmers in the UK being forced to compete with food giants across the Atlantic: “I would be very worried that, as a result of letting that happen we then have increasing pressure in this country, because of competition reasons, to say ‘we must do that ourselves now, go down this mass production route’.”

International trade secretary Liam Fox has repeatedly talked up the benefits of free trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada after the UK leaves the EU.

But there was outrage in Britain this summer after it was revealed that chlorine-washed chicken, which is legal in the US, could enter the UK food chain in order to facilitate a trade deal with Washington.

Fox slammed the media for being “obsessed” with the issue after he was challenged to eat chlorine-washed chicken to show he was comfortable with the product entering the UK food market.

PA Wire/PA Images The practice of washing chicken in chlorine, common in the US but banned in the UK under EU regulations, has sparked concern.

Under current EU regulations, poultry meat which is rinsed in chlorine is banned, but after the UK leaves the EU it will be up to the government whether a ban stays in place.

Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University in London, has previously warned that Brexit could see a race to the bottom in terms of food quality.

He told the Compassion in World Farming’s Extinction and Livestock international conference on Friday: “We in Britain are currently away with the fairies, because of Brexit we are throwing everything into the air like children throwing toys out of the pram.

“Beware, intellectually and in principle we might get improvements from it (Brexit), but the likelihood of that is very low, because at the moment the food culture in Britain is based around price. The schemes to go for ever cheaper food will triumph over higher values.”

Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City, University of London

In a University of Sussex report co-authored by Lang in July, experts warned there were “serious risks that standards for food safety will decline if the UK ceases to adopt EU safety rules and instead accepts free-trade agreements with countries with significantly weaker standards”.

In addition to weaker standards in countries like China, the report also identified the US, warning: “Under the Trump administration US standards are likely to decline sharply.”

It continues: “Brexit campaigners ignored the inbuilt reliance the UK has on pan-European institutions, to which we contribute. A vast array of institutions and scientific infrastructure keeps UK food fit to eat.

“Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards, nor that foods derived on world markets use standards which are weaker than the EU’s and those of the USA.”

Examples of food practices used in the US, which are currently banned in the EU: Hormones Many beef producers in the US use implants of synthetic hormones under the skin of their beef cattle in order to promote growth, requiring the animals to need less food but still grow at a fast pace. The US says meat from hormone-treated cattle is safe, but the EU disagrees, citing the posed risks to vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and people with weak immune systems. Bovine somatotropin in dairy cows In the US, many dairy cows are injected regularly with a synthetic hormone called bovine growth hormone (BGH). In the UK and the EU the hormone is called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST). The growth hormone is used to to increase milk yield but it can cause mastitis in cattle, which is an inflammation of the udder that derives from a bacterial infection. This can lead to more antibiotics being given to the cows. The EU’s Scientific Committee on Animal Health found that the practice led to “very significantly poorer welfare because of increased foot disorders, mastitis, reproductive disorders and other production related diseases”. GM crops and animals More varieties of GM crops are allowed to be produced and sold in the US than in the EU. GM foods are not currently grown commercially in the UK, but they can be imported. In the EU, if a food contains or consists of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or contains ingredients produced from GMOs, this must be indicated on the label. In the US there is no mandatory labelling requirement. Chlorinated chicken Poultry dipped in chlorinated disinfectant hit the headlines in the UK this summer. In the USA, in an attempt to combat problems of microbiological contamination of poultry meat, manufacturers are required to dip the meat in disinfectant, which most commonly is a chlorine-based product. The practice is not lawful in the EU or the UK and in the US poultry meat is not labelled as having been dipped in disinfectant.

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, more than 99% of farm animals in the US are raised in factory farms.

Speaking about factory farming, which can see tens of thousands of animals crammed into one warehouse, Johnson said: “I wouldn’t want that to come back on the agenda merely because the Americans are able to sell their stuff over here”.

He also warned about UK policies possibly being swayed by US food giants in the future.

“Never underestimate the political influence of the big agricultural business ... they will ... take whatever advantages they find they can take.”

As part of the EU Withdrawal Bill, all existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law after March 2019.

This means there is unlikely to be an immediate impact on much of Britain’s industries, including farming, straight after leaving the EU.

Karl Falkenberg, a former adviser to president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, served as deputy director general for trade in Brussels for five years before becoming director general for environment between 2009 and 2015.

He told HuffPost that the EU’s extensive food product legislation has been heavily criticised by the US in the past: “In the United States GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) are common practice, hormone addition in producing meat is absolutely normal practice.

“We have decided that these are things that we don’t want to have in the European Union and therefore we have legislation that protects this.

“But when you leave the European Union, again you become free to modify those conditions, if you so want.”

That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union

Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union, claimed last month that free trade was a “myth” as so many countries subsidise their agricultural sectors.

“That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards.

“We don’t think that’s a very sensible scenario for anyone to just sign up to some ideological idea that free trade actually exists where I don’t think it does.” If the UK’s food safety standards do not meet the EU’s requirements, then exports from the UK to the European bloc would also be affected.

However, if the UK increases its food standards to a point that exceeds European Union guidelines, then it would be up to the EU to meet those requirements if it wants to sell to the British market.

Extinction and Livestock Karl Falkenberg speaking at Compassion in World Farming's Extinction and Livestock Conference.

Yet both Falkenberg and Johnson admit that animal welfare and farming practices aren’t always at the top of politicians’ agendas.

Environment secretary Michael Gove told a party conference fringe meeting he was aware of concerns and was committed to ensuring animal welfare standards in the UK do not slip after Brexit.

The Tory minister said: “Outside the European Union’s single market, we can improve animal welfare, supporting more humane methods of farming and restricting the live export of animals.”

And while Johnson praised Gove’s goal to restrict live animal exports, he said Theresa May’s government isn’t doing enough about sustainable farming.

The Government said that maintaining safety and public confidence in food available in the UK “is of the highest priority”.

A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.

“Any new products wishing to enter the UK market must comply with our rigorous legislation and standards – we will not compromise on animal welfare and food safety.”

Unlike his son, who was one of the main driving forces behind the Leave campaign, the Johnson was a staunch Remain supporter.

In the run-up to the European Referendum last year, the 77-year-old founded and co-chaired Environmentalists for Europe.

He said: “My position in the run up to the referendum I said let’s stay in.. because the gain is not only the gain in animal welfare in Britain but is the gain in terms of animal welfare throughout Europe as a whole.

“I think this whole question of chlorinate chicken, for example, was an issue… I mean certainly if you look at the way chickens are raised in the United States you do have to say to yourself, ‘look, come on, are we really talking about humane treatment of animals?’.”

Die Gratwanderung zwischen Unabhängigkeitsstreben und Neo-Nationalismus ist dabei gefährlich. Freunde der Freiheit müssen darauf Antworten finden.

Nicht „die oder wir"", sondern „Zwang oder Freiheit""

Wäre das schottische Referendum vor drei Jahren positiv ausgegangen, hätte Schottland sicherlich einen deutlichen Links-Schwenk vorgenommen (was jetzt freilich das gesamte Land unter May und Corbyn ohnehin tut). Die Befürworter des katalonischen Referendums befinden sich in einem Dauerkonflikt mit Verfassung und Rechtsstaat und kooperieren mit Linksextremen. Und die Bevölkerungsminderheiten in den kurdischen Gebieten des Irak fürchten sich davor, in einem kurdischen Staat marginalisiert, unterdrückt und vertrieben zu werden. Durch die Sezession entstünden also keineswegs lauter paradiesische Zustände.

Die erste Erkenntnis, die man mitnehmen sollte, lautet: Das Streben nach Unabhängigkeit von einer größeren Einheit geht durchaus nicht immer einher mit einem umfassenden Freiheitsdrang. Selten fallen die Vertreter der Unabhängigkeitsbewegungen auf durch das Versprechen, die individuelle und ökonomische Freiheit zu stärken. Viel gewichtiger ist in der Regel das Argument, dann mehr Geld zur Verfügung zu haben, um es mit den eigenen Leuten zu teilen.

Nun soll hier wahrlich nicht eine Lanze für Länderfinanzausgleiche und Solidarzahlungen gebrochen werden. Tatsächlich könnte man wohl mancherlei Absetzbewegungen eindämmen, wenn man nicht innerhalb von Staaten und Staatenverbünden die große Umverteilungsmaschine in Gang setzen würde. Es sollte aber klar sein, dass Sezessionen an sich noch nicht unbedingt etwas Gutes sein müssen, sondern häufig auch von Nationalisten und Sozialisten für ihre Zwecke instrumentalisiert werden.

Der Ökonom Ludwig von Mises, der den Zerfall des mitteleuropäischen Vielvölkerstaates in nationalistische und autoritäre kleinere Staaten miterlebt hatte, warnte 1927 unmissverständlich: „Es handelt sich nicht um das Selbstbestimmungsrecht einer national geschlossenen Einheit, sondern es handelt sich darum, dass die Bewohner eines jeden Gebietes darüber zu entscheiden haben, welchem Staatsverband sie angehören wollen."" Mit anderen Worten: Nicht die angebliche gemeinsame Volkszugehörigkeit von Kurden oder Katalanen sollte das entscheidende Argument für die Trennung sein, sondern die Abwehr von Übergriffen und Willkür einer Zentralregierung. Für den Liberalen ist die Frage, auf die es ankommt, nicht „die oder wir"", sondern „Zwang oder Freiheit"".

Kooperation statt Abschottung

Wenn das Ergebnis einer Sezession das Entstehen eines mächtigen und ausgabenfreudigen kleineren Staates ist, der darüber hinaus wegen seiner geringeren Größe noch mehr Kontroll- und Zugriffsmöglichkeiten auf die Bürger hat, war die politische Entscheidung kein Gewinn für die Sache der Freiheit, sondern ein Rückschlag. Gleichwohl bleibt natürlich die kleine Einheit für den Freund der Freiheit in vielerlei Hinsicht eine ganz entscheidende Referenzgröße. Die Kleinstaaterei ist für ihn nicht unbedingt ein Schimpfwort, sondern eher ein positives Ziel - allerdings nur dann, wenn die Betonung nicht auf Staat liegt, sondern auf klein. Kleinstaaterei kann eben auch Abschottung bedeuten.

Das widerspricht aber dem liberalen Verständnis von zwischenmenschlicher Ordnung. Denn, wie Mises formuliert, „als letztes Ideal schwebt immer der Gedanke einer vollständigen Kooperation der ganzen Menschheit vor ... Das Denken des Liberalen hat immer das Ganze der Menschheit im Auge, ... es endet nicht an den Grenzen des Dorfes, der Landschaft, des Staates und des Erdteils. Es ist ein kosmopolitisches ... Denken, das alle Menschen und die ganze Erde umspannt.""

Die Kleinstaaterei der Neo-Nationalisten, die sich von anderen abschotten wollen, ist davon nicht gedeckt. Wohl aber die Kleinstaaterei der Freunde der Freiheit, die die kleinen Einheiten bevorzugen, weil sie flexibler sind und besser auf konkrete Fragen reagieren können; weil sie sich im Wettbewerb mit anderen bewähren müssen und daran wachsen können; weil sie mitunter besser kontrolliert werden können und Verantwortlichkeiten klarer zuzuordnen sind. Es gibt Modelle der kleinen Einheiten, die zukunftsweisend sind - von den baltischen Staaten bis zu dem Modell der Private Cities. Dies sind Modelle, die Liberale aus vollem Herzen unterstützen können. Einfach unbedacht jeder Sezessionsbewegung zuzujubeln, kann jedoch dazu führen, dass man Feinde der freien und offenen Gesellschaft unterstützt.

Es kommt nicht auf die Größe an, sondern auf die Technik

Die Gefühle und Wünsche der Menschen in Katalonien und Kurdistan, im Kosovo und vielleicht auch auf der Krim sind natürlich oft bestimmt von einem echten Streben nach Selbständigkeit, und nicht nur vom Streben nach einer Vorzugsrolle bei der großen Umverteilung oder von dumpfem Neo-Nationalismus. Gerade die Drohungen Erdogans gegenüber den irakischen Kurden und die Gewaltexzesse der spanischen Polizei in Katalonien lassen Verständnis aufkommen für das Bedürfnis, jetzt erst recht auf eigene Füße zu kommen. Sowohl die EU als auch Institutionen, die das Völkerrecht schreiben und sprechen, sind dringend aufgerufen, für solche Situationen zufriedenstellende Lösungen zu finden.

Schwelende Dauerkonflikte können Länder auf Dauer in ihrer Gesamtheit zerrütten. Für den Irak etwa wäre ein freundschaftlicher Nachbar Kurdistan wahrscheinlich auf Dauer besser als ein Unruheherd im eigenen Land. Und gerade innerhalb der EU, wo Grenzen ohnehin marginalisiert sind, dürften die Beziehungen zwischen Katalonien und Spanien kaum große Unterschiede zum status quo aufweisen - außer, dass weniger Gelder vom einen ins andere fließen.

Und die Liberalen allenthalben sind aufgerufen, für sich selbst ein konsistentes und gut vermittelbares Konzept von gelingender Kleinstaaterei zu formulieren. Sonst werden sie sich, wenn sie dieses Anliegen formulieren, viel zu oft in der unangenehmen Gesellschaft von Sozialisten und Nationalisten wiederfinden. Es gibt spannende Denkansätze wie etwa den Polyzentrismus, zu dem junge Wissenschaftler wie Julian F. Müller und David Thunder forschen. Hier richtet sich dann auch der Fokus weg vom Staat - wer wüsste schließlich besser als Liberale, dass er bei weitem nicht die einzige Organisationsform für uns Menschen sein muss?

Das oberste Ziel muss stets die individuelle Freiheit sein und im Zusammenhang damit möglichst große Freiheitsräume für Gruppen von Menschen, die untereinander kooperieren. Wenn Sezession das Mittel der Wahl ist, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, dann kann man die Bestrebung durchaus unterstützen. Aber letztlich zählt, dass es nicht auf die Größe ankommt, sondern auf die Technik. Und deshalb sind kleine zentralistische Staaten oft nicht die bessere Lösung im Vergleich mit größeren, aber insgesamt freiheitlicheren.

Just 42 percent of Americans now believe mass shootings can be stopped. That’s the lowest percentage yet found in a series of HuffPost/YouGov polls taken over the past two years, often in the wake of tragedy. Thirty-seven percent believe mass shootings are “a fact of life in America today.”

HuffPost

Americans who don’t personally own guns are 21 points likelier than those who do to believe that mass shootings can be stopped ― 49 percent to 28 percent. But as is often the case, views are most sharply divided along political lines. Two-thirds of voters who supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s election, but just 28 percent of those who supported Donald Trump, think such shootings are preventable.

The vast majority of Americans continue to view gun violence as a serious problem, the survey finds. A modest majority of 53 percent say it’s possible to enact new regulations while preserving the right to bear arms, with fewer than 3 in 10 believing that any regulations pose a threat.

The public remains generally in favor of tighter gun control: 49 percent think gun laws should be made stricter, while 30 percent believe they should stay as is and just 10 percent think they should be relaxed. That division has remained relatively stable in HuffPost/YouGov polls since 2015, with support for stricter gun laws hovering between 48 and 55 percent.

Many individual gun control policies, such as instituting universal background checks, draw close to universal support in other polling.

But just 41 percent of Americans say Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings, the most recent survey finds, while 43 percent believe these events can’t be reduced through legislation.

There’s also a close divide on whether passing stricter guns laws is politically feasible, with 37 percent saying that it is and 40 percent saying that it’s currently impossible.

Just 15 percent of Americans name gun policies as among the two issues most important to them. That’s up 9 points since September, but still lagging far behind issues like health care and the economy. Those who favor stricter gun laws and those who wish they were less strict are about equally likely to rank the topic among their highest priorities.

Parents, enfants, conjoints, amis, voisins prennent soin d'un patient resté à domicile. Hors les murs, le plus grand hôpital de France est en souffrance.

Le retour au domicile est une volonté pour nombre de patients atteints d'une maladie chronique. C'est aussi un objectif prioritaire pour les hôpitaux, inscrits dans une logique de réduction permanente des coûts. Cette opération aussi humaine que comptable repose sur un élément souvent ignoré, le proche qui accompagne ce retour.

En France, il faut s'en féliciter, le système de santé parvient à faire des économies en permanence tout en maintenant la qualité des soins.

L'hébergement de nuit à l'hôpital est devenu au fil des années un poids financier pour l'institution hospitalière. Face à ce coût, l'hôpital a développé l'ambulatoire, le fait de recevoir une intervention de jour sans nécessité de passer la nuit en observation, et l'hospitalisation à domicile.

Pour les patients, retrouver leur maison, leur lit, leurs habitudes, leurs proches, est une bonne nouvelle. Ce retour est conditionné par la présence d'un ""aidant"". Cette personne de l'entourage accompagne le patient dépendant au quotidien. Le système hospitalier comme le patient y gagnent mais c'est une contrainte lourde imposée pour l'aidant.

Aidant malgré lui

A l'heure du ""consentement libre et éclairé"", le patient reçoit toutes les informations qui lui permettent de prendre une décision en toute conscience. Dans ce contexte, le consentement de l'aidant passe souvent au second plan. Cependant, comment ""dire non"" à un proche dans le besoin ? C'est ainsi quasiment incidemment que le proche se voit désigné ""aidant"".

L'aidant en général s'occupera de toute l'""intendance"": prendre les rendez-vous médicaux, coordonner les différents soignants, conduire le patient jusqu'à l'hôpital quand c'est nécessaire, gérer l'administratif... Selon les cas, l'aidant participera à la toilette, portera le patient jusqu'à la salle de bain et l'aidera à prendre une douche, changera les draps souillés -parfois plusieurs fois par jour-, fera les courses... Au-delà de ces aspects matériels et physiques, l'aspect psychologique est souvent minoré. Ce que subit l'aidant c'est aussi la douleur, la peur, la sienne et celle du patient comme l'idée de la fin de vie qui s'installe. Certes, en fonction de la pathologie du patient, de ses ressources, une aide complémentaire peut exister. Mais quant celle-ci existe, elle ne résout pas la question de la souffrance de l'aidant.

Cette souffrance est souvent muette puisque c'est la maladie du patient qui est au centre. Cumulant parfois emploi, famille et soin du patient, l'aidant peut se retrouver dans une situation d'épuisement.

De nombreuses études montrent les effets sur la santé, à la fois physique et mentale, de l'accompagnement d'un proche gravement malade: dépression, burnout, jusqu'à la tentative de suicide parfois. (1). La mauvaise santé des aidants peut d'ailleurs avoir un impact négatif sur les patients (2) et tout cela peut même mener à une institutionnalisation précoce du patient (3). En 2007, une étude publiée dans The journals of Gerontology, compilant les données de 176 études dans le monde, a démontré que c'était la dégradation de la santé physique des aidants qui était la plus correlée avec leur dépression, et non des facteurs de stress dûs à la situation difficile. (4)

Le sujet est donc sérieusement étudié au sein de la communauté scientifique, mais les effets sur les politiques de santé sont encore légers. On sait depuis des années (les premières études sur les conséquences de l'accompagnement d'un patient datent de la fin des années 1970) qu'être aidant peut être délétère. Et pourtant, les pouvoirs publics commencent tout juste à avancer sur le sujet.

Les évolutions du système de santé

Ces dix dernières années, le système de soins a évolué en prenant en compte l'avis des patients dans tous les aspects du quotidien.

Au travers des associations, ces patients ont participé de l'élaboration de ce qui est appelé la

""démocratie sanitaire"". Des représentants des patients siègent maintenant, grâce à la loi, dans toutes les commissions des établissements de santé. La parole est désormais libérée par la loi et par l'organisation des patients.

L'introduction du droit au répit

Malgré quelques avancées, cette évolution est en retard sur les ""aidants"". Il a fallu attendre le 18 novembre 2016 et la promulgation du décret relatif au congé du proche aidant pour que ceux-ci se voient considérés en décrochant un ""droit au répit"", à compter du 1er janvier 2017. Intégré à l'Allocation Personnalisée d'Autonomie (APA), il permet aux proches aidants qui ne peuvent pas être remplacés et dont la présence ou l'aide est indispensable à la vie au domicile du bénéficiaire de l'APA de prendre un temps de repos.

Les aidants, si nombreux en France, demeurent encore trop peu informés, formés, préparés ou suivis. Face au vieillissement accéléré de la population française cela apparaît désormais comme un enjeu majeur de santé publique. Eux aussi se structurent maintenant en associations, comme l'Association Nationale des Aidants, pour faire entendre leur voix. Il est temps que la démocratie sanitaire les inclue et que leur parole soit prise en compte.

Aider les aidants: un plan national nécessaire

Il est essentiel d'organiser le suivi médical des accompagnants à long terme. Dans ce cadre, le médecin généraliste a toute sa place dans ce dispositif. La coordination entre l'hôpital et la ville doit se faire pour les patients comme pour les aidants.

Certaines institutions commencent à prendre les devants. La Fédération Nationale des Établissements d'Hospitalisation à Domicile a noué fin mai un partenariat avec l'Association Nationale des Aidants pour travailler sur leur rôle et réaliser des actions concrètes d'amélioration.

Politiques, représentants des fédérations hospitalières et des personnels soignants, ordres nationaux et associations doivent se mettre autour de la table pour mettre en place un plan national pour accompagner au mieux ceux qui portent le poids des lacunes du système de santé français dans une société en vieillissement. Il est temps vraiment temps d'aider les aidants.

One story involves a 5-year-old boy named Aden Huser. Aden attended the Jason Aldean concert at the Route 91 Harvest Festival with his mom Doris, 8-year-old sister Cordelia and aunt Samantha, who has a developmental disability. Right before the shooting started, Doris took Cordelia to the bathroom ― a quick break that she thought would only take five to ten minutes. As they made their way back into the crowd, gunman Stephen Paddock began opening fire on concertgoers from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. ""People say that in a war, you get an instinct to stay down, to get cover, but I didn't have that instinct,"" Doris told Time. ""All I had was, 'I have to find my son. I have to find my sister.'"" In the ensuing chaos, Doris said she and Cordelia searched piles of bodies for signs of Aden and Samantha. Meanwhile, Aden and his aunt had been separated as people fled the scene. The little boy wound up in a merchandise tent, where 26-year-old concertgoer Lindsey Rogers found him.

His name is Aiden and we're at the Motel 6 on tropicana. If anyone knows anything about his moms location please call!! pic.twitter.com/ZxfjWJGd2d — Jake⚓️ (@jreid323) October 2, 2017

Rogers scooped him up and ran to the nearby Motel 6. ""I was nervous to take him because I knew that his mom would be devastated to find that her child was gone, but in the moment we thought that the best decision was to get as many people as safe as possible,"" she told ABC News. ""The shots were so sporadic and it wasn't stopping so we took a chance."" Sheltered at the Motel 6, Rogers took a photo of Aden and posted it on social media, urging others to share it to help track down his family. An off-duty police officer named Chris Cunningham was also at the Motel 6 with his girlfriend, Taylor Sutton, and both shared Aden's photo and information. As they waited, Sutton said Aden helped her stay composed. ""He honestly kept me calm. I didn't want to freak him out so we told him they were fireworks and asked him, 'Who were you with before the fireworks happened?'"" Sutton told ABC News. ""He didn't seem scared or worried.""

Rogers echoed this, telling KTNV that Aden stayed calm despite all the uncertainty. ""He was really brave,"" she said. Police officers advised Rogers to take Aden to Sunrise Hospital for better chances of reuniting with his family. As they prepared to leave, they received a phone number for Aden's grandfather through social media ― the posts of Aden's picture had spread far and wide. They called Aden's grandfather to let him know the little boy would be at Sunrise Hospital. He arrived to pick up him shortly after. The grandfather also picked up Samantha, who had made it to a nearby Hooters with the help of another Good Samaritan. In the meantime, Doris and Cordelia had taken shelter in a casino. The mom told ABC News she felt ""hopeless and helpless"" but tried to be strong for her daughter, who had started vomiting in response to the trauma. Finally, she received the good news from her father and reunited with Aden at home. On Wednesday, Doris met up with the kind strangers who took care of her son on that horrible night. ""They are heroes!"" she wrote on Facebook. ""I will be forever in debt to Lindsey Rogers, Chris Cunningham and Taylor Sutton for saving my son!""

In the aftermath of the trauma, Doris is focused on her children's well-being. She's seeking counseling for Aden, Cordelia and herself and making sure to fill their days with love and comfort. ""I don't want them to grow up and be afraid to go to festivals, to go into crowds,"" she told Time. ""I know they'll never be the same as they were on Saturday night. I know seeing something so terrible will be like taking a chunk of their childhoods. But I want them to have no worries. I want them to be fun loving little kids again.

On the same day the report was published, Murphy voted for legislation that would ban abortion after 20 weeks. In fact, Murphy has a history of supporting anti-abortion legislation, from bolstering efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, to voting to grant fetuses protection under the 14th amendment.

This particular scandal is an important reminder that despite the emphasis put on “protecting the unborn,” the rhetoric of the “pro-life” movement is largely just that. At its core, the anti-abortion movement is less about protecting fetuses, and more about legislating and controlling women’s sexual and reproductive health.

Murphy’s affair with Pittsburgh-based forensic psychologist Shannon Edwards was made public last month when her husband filed for divorce. In a text message obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Edwards lambasted Murphy for his anti-abortion rhetoric after he pressured her to go through the procedure when he thought she was pregnant with his child.

″[Y]ou have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,” she wrote to him on January 25.

Edwards seems to have been responding to a Facebook post on Murphy’s official page from January 24, in which he’d written that, “it is a tragic shame that America is leading the world in discarding the disregarding the most vulnerable.” The purpose of this particular post was to tout H.R. 7, a bill that would permanently ban any federal funding for abortion care, as well as any reimbursements for insurance plans that cover the procedure. (Read the full post below.)

Murphy reportedly responded to Edwards’ text saying that he didn’t write any anti-abortion Facebook posts personally (apparently his staff members did), and that he “read them and winced.”

However, just two days later, on Jan. 27, Murphy released a statement of support for the 44th annual March for Life in Washington, D.C.

Murphy’s public persona as a selfless advocate for the unborn is typical for members of the anti-abortion right. But what he said behind closed doors to a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship is certainly a more accurate depiction of the anti-abortion movement ― a movement fraught with general disdain for women’s sexual empowerment; one that uses “pro-life” rhetoric in public spaces to drum up support for insidious anti-choice legislation that puts women’s lives in danger.

There is often a glaring gap in anti-abortion legislators’ assertions that they are protecting women and future children, and their subsequent lack of advocacy for women and children who need government resources and support the most. Murphy is no exception. He supported the massive failure that was President Trump’s American Health Care Act, which would have had serious consequences for welfare-dependent children. He has also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and does not support same-sex marriage or stronger punishment for homophobic hate crimes. And on Tuesday, House members (including Murphy) passed the 20-week abortion ban legislation to “facilitate a culture of life,” even though, as HuffPost’s Laura Bassett pointed out, they had actually “just missed a deadline to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helped states provide insurance coverage to 9 million children in low-income families.”

There is also a long history of anti-choice conservatives depending on reproductive health care access in their own lives only to turn around and try to restrict it for others ― thus, like Murphy, positioning themselves as arbiters of what other people get to do with their bodies. (Norma McCorvey, also known as Jane Roe in the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in the U.S., went on to become an outspoken advocate against the procedure and joined the ranks of some of the most extreme anti-abortion movements in the country.)

“We will once again be a nation committed to honoring life from the moment of conception and ensuring American taxpayer dollars are never spent to end a life before it even begins,” Murphy, or his staff, wrote on Facebook in January. Apparently they forgot to include the caveat that he only supports this as long as it’s convenient for him.","He Urged His Mistress To Have An Abortion, Then Voted To Ban Other Women From Getting One",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/he-urged-his-mistress-to-have-an-abortion-then-voted-to-ban-other-women-from-getting-one_us_59d4dfcfe4b0218923e6b3e7

Among all the cost-cutting in the NHS it's vital that we safeguard the futures of community pharmacies and the pharmacists who carry out such important work.","All eyes have been on Manchester this week as the Conservative party held their annual conference.

But as a pharmacist, I was extremely disappointed that the future of community pharmacies was not addressed.

The industry is facing some of its toughest times, with speculation rife that cuts are afoot and pharmacists will be stripped of many of their day-to-day jobs, with responsibilities handed over to technicians instead.

The biggest problem is this: pharmacists are often the most accessible healthcare professionals for people.

You would be surprised at the number of people who walk into their local chemist and say 'can I speak to a pharmacist, please'. They might have a cold, or they might have a rash, or they might have taken some tablets and they feel dizzy.

Ultimately, they want some help and advice, and they wanted it fairly quickly and without having to make an appointment with their GP.

Pharmacists go through four years of training and generally have extensive knowledge about the suitability of medications, and what medicines work well with another.

We are the final gate post before the drug gets to the patient, and often the first person a patient comes to if they have any questions.

New plans, which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to consider, include allowing technicians to supervise a pharmacy and hand out prescription-only medication without a pharmacist being present.

These plans have understandably caused controversy and a real fear that patients will suffer.

To put it simply, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians go through very different training and have very different skill sets.

Technicians are trained in accuracy. They are trained to make sure the right sticker is on the right box.

Pharmacists are trained in pharmacology. We don't just check prescriptions, but clinically assess the suitability of a medicine for the patient, and whether one medicine matches another.

If mistakes were to occur, in the most extreme cases it could mean life or death. This isn't an over exaggeration.

It's all too easy for government ministers to make decisions based on cost and balancing the books, without spending time fully getting to grips with what a pharmacist actually does.

If given the go ahead, the current legislation will need to be amended to allow 'pharmacy professionals' to take responsibility for the supply and sale of prescription only medicines.

This is simply a push-back and will put more pressure on over-stretched GP surgeries.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health previously said they wanted to ""optimise"" the skills of technicians and ""make the best use of staff"".

They added no changes would be made without proper consultation.

In response, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society recently produced an eight-point position statement setting out their objection to any plans which would involve 'pharmacies run without pharmacists'.

Among the points, they said they wanted to see ""the law constructed so as to ensure the pharmacist always has the opportunity to undertake the clinical assessment or check"".

They added they did not want to see any law changes ""which could be used to operate pharmacies without pharmacists being present for anything other than very short periods of time"".

I couldn't agree with this more.

Much ink has been spilled about India's tumultuous relationship with women's virginity and its trusty gatekeeper—the hymen. We've heard of prospective brides, newly-married women and even rape victims being subjected to thoroughly unscientific and humiliating 'virginity tests', such as the 'two-finger test' (in which elder women/doctors probe the woman's vagina with two fingers to detect the presence of a hymen) and inspection of the sheets after a couple's wedding night to determine if the bride broke her hymen and bled, proving she was a virgin.

There are other equally gross, if not as popular, 'tests' to establish a woman's virgin status. In several parts of Rajasthan, women are made to undergo trials by fire, where they must walk with red-hot iron rod on a plate of seven betel leaves and a thin layer of dough to shield their hands. 'Impure' women are the ones whose palms get burnt. Another one is purity by water, where a woman must prove her virginity by holding her breath under water while a person walks 100 steps. These 'tests' are barbaric, to say the least, but the patriarchy that defines a woman's moral worth by her lack of sexual experience has ensured that even today, men are consumed by the need to secure virgin brides for themselves; while women across the country live in mortal fear of their bodies failing these arbitrary tests. Last year, a village council in Nashik, Maharashtra, allowed a husband to end his marriage barely 48 hours after the ceremony when he showed proof — spotless sheets after the marriage had been consummated — to show that his bride was not a virgin.

via GIPHY

It is no wonder then that the demand for cosmetic surgeries such as hymenoplasty — where the doctor discreetly 'repairs' the hymen so the woman is a virgin 'again' — is gaining popularity among women of marriageable age in conservative Eastern cultures like ours. In the same vein, a less-expensive way of faking virginity is by using a kit that helps women leak fake blood on their wedding night as proof of virginity. One such product — the Artificial Virginity Hymen Kit — caused such an uproar in 2009 that outraged protests calling for its ban went all the way up to the Egyptian parliament. All because the Chinese company that distributed it suddenly started advertising it as available for shipping to Arab countries. The thought of a woman being able to exercise her sexual agency was, and is, too much to stomach for societies obsessed with preserving her virginity.

It is a sad reality of our times that even today the hymen, which is essentially an anatomically useless piece of tissue (doctors haven't yet been able to find any biological purpose for its existence) that surrounds a woman's vaginal opening, continues to be used as proof of her virtue, the 'absence' of which can besmirch and ruin not just her own but her entire family's honour.

Considering how the hymen has historically occupied such an important place in pop culture as well as religion, one would think that it's been studied ad nauseam and we know all there is to know about the membrane that has plagued women's existence and her very first experience of sex. Shockingly, that's not the case. Myths about the hymen are so deep-rooted and pervasive, many of them continue to be propagated by pop culture, unknowingly, and believed widely. Here are four things we definitely need to stop believing about the hymen.

via GIPHY

The hymen is not a 'film' that covers the vaginal opening

Notice how we called the hymen an anatomically useless piece of tissue that surrounds a woman's vaginal opening a couple of paragraphs ago? That's literally true. The hymen surrounds, not covers, the opening. Contrary to popular belief, in most women, the hymen is shaped like a doughnut or a rubber band—basically, it already has a hole in it. In female babies, the hymen is thick, but as she grows older, the tissue stretches, becomes thinner and the hole becomes wider. Daily activities such as walking, running, sports, swimming, even just washing the hymenal tissue can make it wear away.

Since the hymen has a naturally in-built hole in it, it logically follows that ...

via GIPHY

The hymen does not 'break' the first time a woman has sex, denoting the end of virginity

If the hymen covered the entire vaginal opening, virgin women would not be able to menstruate because there would be no outlet to release the menstrual blood. Completely intact hymens, or imperforate hymens, are very rare and would require medical intervention to allow vaginal secretions to come out. And yet, most of us grew up believing that losing our virginity meant shedding a little blood when the hymen was punctured. In reality, by adulthood, only fringes of the hymen remain in most women. The bleeding is far rarer than we've been made to believe because the hymenal tissue is capable of stretching — like a rubber band — to accommodate the penis. The bleeding, if it happens, is more likely to be caused if the woman is too dry during intercourse or if the movements are too rough. In very few cases, the remains of the hymenal tissue in a grown woman are substantial enough for them to tear and bleed. If a woman is well-lubricated, sex, even for the first time, is likely to be painless.

via GIPHY

'Virgins' can get pregnant

A man's single ejaculation (semen) can contain more than 300 million sperm. This sperm has the ability to swim up to the fallopian tubes, through a woman's cervix and womb, and fertilise her egg. Since most hymens have a natural cavity in them, women can get pregnant even without intercourse, if a man ejaculates close to the vaginal opening, not necessarily inside the vaginal canal alone. While the chances of women getting impregnated this way are rare, it is possible. The reason it is important to know this is because many couples believe that as long as the man doesn't penetrate and 'break' the woman's hymen, the sperm will not enter her reproductive tract and they are safe from the risk of unplanned pregnancies.

via GIPHY

The shape, size or structure of a hymen can't tell you anything about a woman's sexual activity

Hymens come in all shapes and sizes, with the most common one being a smooth hymen with a central cavity, or like a doughnut. Some women are even born without a hymen altogether. According to this study, seven different types of hymenal tissues were observed in female infants. An intact hymen, or the one that drapes across the vaginal opening like a protective layer, was observed in less than 0.3% babies. Apart from all the different activities (mentioned above) that can wear out the hymenal tissue, oestrogen, or the female sex hormone, affects the hymenal tissue during puberty to make it more pliable for sexual activity. So, any 'tests' or inspection of a woman's hymen to determine her virgin status are not only unscientific, but absolutely invalid.

In reality, the very idea of 'virginity' as a biological condition is a myth and a social construct. Just like men, 'loss' of ones virginity leaves no physical evidence behind in the case of women either. In addition to being biologically inaccurate, it is also grossly heteronormative, since only penile-vaginal intercourse is considered sex under its narrow definition.

MUMBAI-- Veteran director Kundan Shah, best known for the dark comedy ""Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro"", died at his home early today, family sources said. He was 69.

Shah passed away after suffering a heart attack, sources close to the family told PTI.

He had studied direction at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune and made his feature film debut in 1983 with the cult classic ""Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro"" (1983).

The film did not become a box office success but Shah received his first and only National Award - Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director - for the movie which went on to become one of the most celebrated dark satirical comedies in the history of Indian cinema.

Shah returned the award during the student protest in his alma mater FTII in 2015.

He made his directorial debut on television in 1986 with the popular series ""Nukkad"".

In 1988, he directed the sitcom, ""Wagle Ki Duniya"", based on cartoonist R K Laxman's character, the common man.

The director made his Bollywood comeback in 1993 with Shah Rukh Khan-starrer ""Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa"".

His next film was ""Kya Kehna"" (2000). Starring Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh, the movie became a surprise hit.

Though Shah made several films after that, commercial success eluded him.

The death came less than 24 hours after that of her son Finn and in the weeks to come, the village will attempt to process everything that’s happened and been revealed in the past five days.

Speaking at a press event where HuffPost UK got a sneak peek at the week’s action, ‘Emmerdale’ executive producer Iain MacLeod revealed what viewers can expect from the winter months, hinting at how the Bartons will deal with what’s happened.

Stating that the family will “still be central to the show”, Iain told reporters: Pete, Ross and Moira will soldier on, Moira is in a massive story for the rest of the year. Adam is caught up in the aftermath.

ITV Pictures Moira has a lot to deal with

“They’re more united than not, actually. I love Pete and Ross’s relationship we explore in detail later. Pete left Ross for dead yet now they’re all each other has got – love and hate in equal measure but they’ve got to get through this.

“As a family they’ve been through a lot this will test them but ultimately will bring them closer together.”

He also revealed that it was always the plan to have Emma fall in as her husband James did, when she pushed him in October 2016.

ITV Pictures Finn died on Thursday

“There was just a nice symmetry to that,” Iain said. “Because this week is designed to be the final chapter in the no return story from last year, we actually talked extensively about even making the pictures looking quite similar so that there is a deliberate parallel to be drawn there.

“It was very deliberately an echo of all of that.”

While the whole Barton family have a lot to deal with, Moira and Pete in particular are set for a rollercoaster of emotions as the former gave birth to their baby - having not known she was pregnant - earlier in the week.

Madhukar Pai, McGill University

Tuberculosis (TB) kills more people today than HIV and malaria combined.

In 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases worldwide and 1.8 million TB deaths, according to the World Health Organization. And India is at the epicentre of this global epidemic, with half a million TB deaths annually. India also accounts for 16 per cent of the estimated 480,000 new cases of multi-drug-resistant TB.

Can India turn things around and control this epidemic?

The answer is a conditional yes. The Indian government has already taken several steps over the past few years to address it. This includes making TB a notifiable disease, developing the Standards for TB Care in India, introducing daily drug regimens and rolling out molecular and drug-susceptibility testing.

But there's an opportunity to do more and better, and for India to assume a global leadership role.

India must back ambitions with rupees

Earlier this year, India's Revised National TB Control Program published a draft of a new National Strategic Plan (NSP) for TB Elimination 2017-2025. The NSP, if fully funded and well implemented, could be a game changer in the fight against TB in India.

The plan aims to improve services and outcomes for the 1.5 million patients in the public system and to scale up access to new diagnostics and drugs. It also sets out a bold road map to reach private providers and support the millions of patients treated in the private sector.

Building on promising pilot results, the NSP proposes to do so by providing incentives to providers — for following standard protocols for diagnosis and treatment as well as for notifying the government of cases. Patients referred to the government will in turn receive a cash transfer, to compensate them for direct and indirect costs of undergoing treatment and as an incentive to complete treatment.

The cost of implementing the new NSP is estimated at US$2.5 billion over the first three years, a big increase over the current budget. Historically, despite being a highly cost-effective program and despite having a high absorptive capacity, RNTCP has struggled to receive funding that is commensurate with the scale of India's epidemic.

This simply cannot continue. India must start backing its ambitions with rupees. Therefore, the real test of whether the bold plan by the Health Ministry can be implemented will be whether enough resources can be mobilized — to find, treat and offer quality care to all TB patients, regardless of where they live.

Health spending an urgent priority

TB is one of many diseases that affect Indians, and India is clearly under-performing on several key health indicators, as shown by a recent report on attainment on health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 188 countries. This is an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, which measured 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016.

India did very poorly in this analysis, ranking 127 among 188 countries. In fact, every single other BRICS country (Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa) ranked ahead of India.

This analysis clearly shows that India's economic progress is not reflected in the health of its people. India's National Health Policy, approved this year, proposes to increase health expenditure by the government from the existing 1.15 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the GDP, by 2025.

Ensuring this increase should be an urgent priority for India, and an absolute requirement if India is to make progress towards universal health coverage.

A tradition of excellence

Are there areas of strength that India can leverage to fight TB?

India has made some impressive contributions in global health. India has been polio-free for more than five years and this success has propelled global efforts to eradicate polio. Indian biotech and drug manufacturers dominate the production of TB and HIV medications, accounting for more than 80 per cent of the global market.

The recent launch of a rotavirus vaccine produced in India has underscored the country's leadership role in childhood immunization. India also has huge strengths in IT and software that can be leveraged. And India has a long tradition of excellence in TB research, highlighted by the creation of an India TB Research Consortium.

So, with its strong research expertise in TB, and technological and pharmaceutical capacity, India has the potential to make great progress against this disease.

What is essential is a strong financial and political commitment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to end the TB epidemic, and an overall greater investment in health. When health becomes a priority for India, TB will naturally decline, as will many other conditions that currently make India rank so poorly in health-related SDGs.

Im vorangegangenen Bericht zur ""WELCOME TO HELL""-Demo sahen wir, wie die Versammlung am 6. Juli mit unbilliger Härte aufgelöst wurde und warum die Gesamteinsatzleitung sich dafür explizit den Raum an der Flutschutzmauer aussuchte, um die Vermummten dort zu stellen.

Hier bitte lesen: http://m.huffpost.com/de/entry/17848600

Im Teil 2 der Geschichte geht es noch einmal explizit um die Folgen der Ereignisse inklusive dramatischer Bilder, die zeigen, wie speziell die Hamburger Polizei gezielt auch gegen unvermummte, eher bunt gekleidete Personen vorging, wie Menschen geknüppelt und mit Füßen getreten wurden, von denen keinerlei Gefahr ausging.

Treibjagd am Hamburger Fischmarkt

Es ist kurz nach 20 Uhr und die versprengten Gruppen, die über die cirka 2 Meter hohe Flutschutzmauer fliehen konnten, begaben sich in die Seitenstraßen links vom Fischmarkt und sammelten sich am Ausgangsort der Demo erneut, dort wo der Aufzug ursprünglich mal begann. Dort sichtbar werden ziemlich unschöne Bilder einer regelrechten Treibjagd gegen kleinere Gruppen Versammlungsteilnehmer. Darunter sehr viele bunt gekleidete Personen, von denen absolut keine Gewalt ausging, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen:

Im Zuge dieses Vormarsches der Polizei wurde ein eindeutig unvermummter Mann von der Polizei geprügelt.

Zwei Ecken weiter - unweit der Szenerie - ein ganz ähnliches Bild:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewNZIzw6mKE&t=4m24s

Polizisten stürmen auf Kommando eine Gruppe Demonstranten und prügeln grundlos auf sie ein.



6. Juli - 20:20 Uhr - die Polizei greift einen völlig friedlichen Demozug an

Auch dieses Vorgehen der Einsatzkräfte gehört untersucht. Gewalt ging von diesen Menschen nämlich keine aus. Einziger Aggressor war wieder mal die Polizei selbst, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen.



Wilde Knüppelei gegen friedliche Demonstranten

Rüde Polizeigewalt

Der Mann hinter der Kamera, der dieses Video gemacht hat, kommnentierte diesen Moment mit folgenden Worten: ""Die Polizei stürmt die Demo - so was Krankes habe ich auch noch nicht gesehen"".



Quelle: AbendblattTV - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF12Fsfn2ao&t=12m50s

Schaut man das Video ein paar Minuten länger, sieht man auch die obligatorischen Steine- und Flaschenwerfer - ABER: Man darf nicht vergessen, wie die Schlacht mal begann, nämlich mit einer gewaltsamen Auflösung der Demo 100 Meter weiter vorne und das nur, weil die Leute vermummt waren. Der Spiegel-Autor Markus Feldenkirchen schrieb dazu: ""Es ist falsch, das harmlosere Vergehen zu ahnden, das schlimmere aber nicht"". Der Kollege bezog sich dabei auf einen Vorfall im thüringischen Themar, wo eine Horde Rechsradikaler auf einem Konzert ungestört den Hitlergruß zeigen konnten und die Polizei weder einschritt noch unterband.

Spiegel-Autor kritisiert das zweierlei Maß in Hinblick auf linke und rechte Straftäter

Was dort in Themar passierte, war laut Schilderung der Beobachter um Klassen schlimmer, als sich in Hamburg nur vermummt in die Reihen eines schwarzen Blocks zu stellen und darauf zu warten, dass die Demo losläuft. Ich kann auch verstehen, dass diese Vermummung nicht für Jedermann ""schick"" ist, aber sie ist in keinem Fall schlimmer als das, was bei Nazi-Aufläufen regelmäßig von der Polizei geduldet wird und wer glaubt, vermummte Linke in einem solchen Block stellen und angreifen zu können, ohne dass die sich wehren (mit Steinen und Flaschen), hat die Dynamik solcher Exzesse weder verstanden noch durchdrungen.

Augenzeuge berichtet

Auch Andreas Gerhold, Abgeordneter der PIRATEN im Bezirk Hamburg-Mitte war am 6. Juli vor Ort und berichtet Folgendes: ""Meiner Meinung nach ist das ganz klar ein rechtswidriger Polizeieinsatz gewesen, ich konnte das recht gut beobachten. Es gibt jede Menge Livestreams - Live Video Dokumentationen - anhand derer man die Situation sehr gut nachvollziehen kann und ich habe schon mit Leuten - die an verschiedenen Stellen Augenzeuge waren - die Situation rekonstruiert - was wann zu welchem Zeitpunkt passiert ist und man muss sagen, die Polizei ist da sehr unmittelbar reingegangen mit dem Ziel den Kopf der Demo abzutrennen. Das ist dann aber gründlich schief gegangen. Es waren Leute dort plötzlich in Lebensgefahr. Es gab Situation auf Treppen - wo Leute die Treppen runtergefallen sind - andere sind hinterher gestürmt und es gab dort Situationen, wo Menschen auf scheinbar niedrige Mauern geklettert sind - die auf der anderen Seite aber 3 Meter runter gehen. Es hätte da so viel mehr passieren können, dass Menschen zu Schaden oder gar zu Tode kommen, das war ein absolut unverantwortlicher Einsatz"" - berichtet Gerhold.

Andreas Gerhold

Die Demo sei für ""militante Einsätze"" auch nicht vorgesehen gewesen, ergänzt der Parlamentarier. ""Der Frontblock war sehr diszipliniert - keine Provokation - keine Gewalt - da flog überhaupt nichts - nicht ein Böller - gar nichts - die waren super diszipliniert und auch die Aufforderung, dass dem nicht nachgekommen sei - sich zu entmummen - stimmt nicht. Viele sind der Aufforderung nachgekommen. Einzelne auch nicht. Aber jeder kann sich die Videos anschauen und man wird sehen, wie wenig wirklich Vermummte da sind.""

Zwar habe man Sonnenbrillen und Kapuzen aufgehabt, aber die seien nicht strafbar. Alles bis Unterlippe sei erlaubt und nur sehr Wenige hatten überhaupt noch Tücher vor dem Mund oder gar Skimasken auf und im übrigen vermumme sich ""auch die Polizei und auch da geschehen Straftaten, deren Täter nicht mal ermittelbar sind"", weshalb Gerhold auch eine Kennzeichnungspflicht fordere, damit die Identifizierbarkeit der Beamten gegeben sei. Es müsse auch da niemand sein Gesicht zeigen, aber man muss rückschließen können, welcher Beamte was gemacht hat - anhand seiner Nummer auf der Jacke.



Ein Beamter der Hamburger Polizei in eindeutiger Pose

Mit Füßen getreten

Auffällig in dem Zusammenhang ist, dass in dem Einsatz wie hier geschildert - wo am Boden liegende Demonstranten noch getreten wurden - die Beamten KEINE NUMMER trugen. Nur das Wappen auf der Jacke am Arm zeigte, dass sie zur Hamburger Polizei gehören.

Angesichts dieser Bilder - und gerade erst wurde ja ein Pole zu 6 Monaten Gefängnis auf Bewährung verurteilt, nur weil er ein unerlaubtes Pfefferspray dabei hatte. Bei dieser Härte der Strafe stellt sich natürlich die Frage, ob auch die prügelnden Polizisten (es liegen mehr als 70 Anzeigen vor) ebenso hart bestraft werden, wie die Demonstranten, wenn sie sich denn daneben benommen haben?

Gleiches Recht für Alle

Es geht um GERECHTIGKEIT. Zu Unrecht prügelnde Polizisten müssen genauso hart bestraft werden wie die Steine- und Flaschenwerfer. Auf beiden Seiten gab es Straftaten - nur eine Seite (die der Demonstranten) wurde bislang aber bestraft. Das muss sich ändern.

Eine friedliche Sitzblockade zum Beispiel mit rüder Gewalt aufzulösen ist rechtswidrig. Solange keine Gefahr von den Demonstranten ausgeht, darf die Polizei weder pfeffern, knüppeln noch treten. Letzteres tut sie aber immer wieder - wie auch am 6. Juli an der Kreuzung zum Hamburger Fischmarkt, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen.

Widerstandsrecht

Eine Gruppe Jugendlicher setzte sich auf die Straße und die Hamburger Polizei griff hart durch. Wendet zweifelhafte Polizeigriffe an und tritt mit Füßen nach den am Boden sitzenden - und später auch liegenden Demonstranten. Ist das noch rechtens?



""Wir sind friedlich, was seid ihr"", singt eine Gruppe Sitzblockierer am 6. Juli gegen 20:30 Uhr ein Appell, der ungehört bleibt. Trotz des an dieser Stelle friedlichen Protestes griff die Polizei hart durch.



Man könnte die Sitzblockierer ja lehrbuch-mäßig wegtragen, so wie das am Morgen des 7. Juli an der Schwanenwik-Brücke geschah. Dort verhielt sich die Polizei lehrbuch-mäßig und warum? Weil 8 Kameras und Journalisten beobachteten, was sie taten und schon hielt die Polizei sich zurück.

Die Macht der Presse

Anders am 6. Juli - da waren keine großen Kameras vor Ort und schon wird rüde geprügelt. Und das noch ohne Nummer auf der Jacke.



Zweifelhafter Einsatz gegen Leute, die sich NULL wehren

Das Beispiel zeigt, dass die Polizei meist dann rüde vorgeht, wenn sie keine Konsequenzen befürchten muss - wenn keine unabhänigen Beobachter vor Ort sind. Die beiden Beispiele haben das eindrucksvoll bewiesen und gerne werden solche Szenen vom Mainstream dann auch unterschlagen, weshalb es diesen Zusatz-Blog hier auch gibt.

Keine Polizeigewalt?

Dieser Hamburger Polizist zum Beispiel tritt einen am Boden liegenden Demonstranten mit Füßen!!! Olaf Scholz beteuert dennoch, es gäbe in Hamburg ""keine Polizeigewalt"". Er bleibt der Realität entrückt - ein Trauerspiel für die Hamburger SPD.

Mehr Polizeigewalt hier: www.g20-doku.org

Auch das Fehlverhalten der Polizei muss bestraft werden, nur darum geht´s.

Bauernopfer gesucht?

Meiner Meinung nach werden mit solchen Schauprozessen wie zuletzt ganz klar Bauernopfer gesucht, die erstmal hoch bestraft werden, um Sympathisanten der Szene zu verunsichern und einzuschüchtern. Am Ende traut sich keiner mehr auf die Straße, weil selbst kleinste Vergehen hart geahndet werden. Ist das der Polizeistaat, vor dem Kritiker seit Jahren warnen?



Eine mutige Dame in roten Hosen kletterte auf diesen Räumpanzer. Pfeffern ist offenbar bequemer als sie von da runter zu holen.

Lückenhafte Aufklärung

Inzwischen tagte der Sonderausschuss zwei mal schon und viel Neues wurde dadurch nicht bekannt - im Gegenteil. Da wurden Seiten geschwärzt und Zeugen sagten ab, kommen erst gar nicht, obwohl sie vorgeladen sind. Das zeigt, wie groß das Aufklärungsinteresse von SPD und SENAT wirklich ist - es geht gegen Null.

Dennis Gladiator (CDU) kündigte gar die Einforderung eines ""PUA"" an, sollte Senat und Polizei künftig nicht besser mitarbeiten. Auch von ""Zeugenbeeinflussung"" ist die Rede, weil die an Hartmut Dudde zum Beispiel direkt gerichteten Fragen erstmal von Andy Grote beantwortet werden und dieser somit Einfluss auf die Zeugenaussage von Dudde ninmt. Das dürfe nicht sein, erklärt Christiane Schneider von den Linken.

Unzählige Belege für Gewalt gegen friedliche Demonstranten. Die Verantwortung dafür übernimmt dennoch keiner ... www.g20-doku.org

Dabei liegen die zahlreichen wie auch eklatanten Rechsbrüche offen auf dem Tisch. Es gibt massenhaft Bilder und Videos im Netz, die das unverhältnismäßige Vorgehen der Polizeiführung am 6. Juli zum Beispiel belegen. Verurteilt wurde dafür bislang niemand. ""Nur rund 2% der zur Anzeige gebrachten Fälle von Fehlverhaltens der Polizei endeten mit einer Verurteilung"", teilte ein Protestforscher letzte Woche mit.

Erneuerbare Stromquellen? Einhalt dem Klimawandel? Themen, von denen US-Präsident Donald Trump nichts hält. Im Gegenteil: Es scheint, als sei das Land kurz davor, sich in eine stinkende, rußige Hölle zu verwandeln. Schließlich hat Trump im Juni das Pariser Klimaabkommen aufgekündigt und Förderungen für fossile Energiequellen wie die Kohle versprochen.

Das aber bedeutet nicht, dass die USA in Sachen grüne Energie rückständig wären. Tatsächlich bahnt das Land den Weg für erneuerbare Energien – an den Vorstellungen des Präsidenten vorbei.

Der Ruf des Geldes

Wie das geht? Die Antwort ist das Zitat eines früheren amerikanischen Präsidenten: „It’s the economy, stupid“, also: „Es geht um die Wirtschaft, Dummkopf“. Erneuerbare Energien sind ein Milliardengeschäft. Die Solarindustrie etwa schafft Arbeitsplätze 17-mal schneller als der Rest der Wirtschaft. Mittlerweile beschäftigt sie in den USA 370.000 Menschen – mehr als doppelt so viele wie der Kohlesektor. Schneller wachsen die Photovoltaik-Industrien nur in China und Japan. Durch den rasanten Zuwachs sind auch für amerikanische Firmen die Einkaufspreise gefallen – um mehr als die Hälfte seit 2008.

Zugleich wird Windkraft in den USA zu einer der günstigsten Energieformen, die es gibt. Derzeit wird im Schnitt alle 2,4 Stunden ein neues Windrad in Betrieb genommen. In den kommenden Jahren soll Wind die Wasserkraft als größte erneuerbare Energiequelle ablösen.

Im Bundesstaat Iowa stammen 35% der Energie aus Windkraft, vorn mit dabei sind auch Kansas, North und South Dakota. Überraschend daran: Diese Staaten sind in der Hand der Republikaner – die für grüne Politik notorisch wenig übrighaben. Außer dadurch lassen sich Geld und Jobs machen. Da in den USA noch mehr als 181 Millionen Hektar darauf warten, mit Windrädern bebaut zu werden, kann der Geschäftszweig noch lange Zeit weiterwachsen.

Erneuerbare Meilensteine

Der Boom bei Solar- und Windkraft bewegt etwas. Die Studie einer US-Umweltbehörde hat in diesem Jahr belegt, dass Strom aus nachhaltigen Quellen erstmals die Marke von zehn Prozent beim Anteil der US-Energieproduktion überschritten hat. Klar, im Vergleich zu Europa ist das verschwindend wenig. Vorreiter auf dem alten Kontinent sind Schweden, Norwegen, Dänemark – und wir in Deutschland. An einem Tag im April dieses Jahres stieg hierzulande der Anteil der erneuerbaren Energien auf satte 85 Prozent – erzeugt aus Wind, Sonne, Biomasse und Wasser.

Ein US-Staat ist den europäischen Verhältnissen aber stark auf den Fersen: Kalifornien. Im Mai dieses Jahres waren 80 Prozent des erzeugten Stroms aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Wind- und Solarkraft gibt es hier reichlich. Hinzu kommen die Tech-Konzerne, die sich für Innovationen engagieren. Kalifornien ist die Blaupause für grüne Energie in den USA. Die ganze Nation soll einer Studie zufolge im Jahr 2050 soweit sein.

Zudem eröffnen sich weitere Marktnischen: Aus den erneuerbaren Quellen fallen erhebliche Strommengen an. Die muss das Netz auch verkraften können – eine Stromleitung muss man sich nämlich wie eine Autobahn vorstellen, auf der es zu Spitzenzeiten eng wird. Darum muss der Strom gespeichert werden. In diesem Feld wollen sich viele Firmen etablieren.

In Kalifornien stimmen auch die politischen Rahmenbedingungen. Viele Bürgermeister sind begeistert und gehen voran – etwa mit Projekten wie dem ÖPNV-System BART in San Francisco, das bis 2045 komplett mit sauberer Energie betrieben werden soll. Und in Los Angeles soll bis 2020 ein Drittel sämtlicher Energie grün sein.

Manche Städte wollen noch weiter gehen. Im Juni einigten sich mehr als 250 Bürgermeister auf einer Konferenz in Miami Beach darauf, ihre Städte bis 2035 vollständig aus erneuerbaren Energien zu speisen.

Ein ambitioniertes Ziel. Wichtig ist, dass der Wille da ist. Beispiel Las Vegas: Die Glücksspielstadt ist notorisch für Exzesse. Aber Laternen, Parks, Feuerwachen, Gemeindezentren und Regierungsgebäude werden vollständig mit grünem Strom betrieben. Das deutlich größere Chicago will bis 2025 an dem Punkt sein. New York will bis 2030 die Hälfte seines Bedarfs aus sauberer Quelle decken.

Zukunftssicher

Klar ist: Donald Trump hat die Energieindustrie seines Landes nicht verstanden. Er mag viel darüber reden, dass der Klimawandel ein Mythos ist oder Pläne für eine Wiederbelebung der fossilen Energie schmieden – aber gleichzeitig kümmert sich sein Land darum, in eine Zukunft mit sauberer Energie zu starten.

Im Vergleich mit Europa sind die Vereinigten Staaten noch im Hintertreffen. Aber: Das Land ist für seinen Willen, die weltweite Nummer eins zu werden, bekannt. In einigen Jahrzehnten könnte es soweit sein. Es ist eine ganz andere Interpretation der Populisten-Parole „America First“ – auf eine Weise, bei der jeder gewinnt.",Dieses Land ist Weltmeister der grünen Energie,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/09/05/dieses-land-ist-weltmeister-der-gruenen-energie_n_17910314.html

L'hyperthyroïdie

Elle est beaucoup plus rare et peut entraîner plusieurs symptômes dont:

Des palpitations cardiaques

Une augmentation de la tension artérielle

Une sensation de chaleur même dans un endroit frais

Une sensation soudaine provoquant une moiteur de peau

Une nervosité s'accumule ou un léger tremblement des mains

Une augmentation du rythme d'activité avec fatigue et faiblesse

Une augmentation de l'appétit, plus avec perte de poids

Des insomnies

Des selles fréquentes et des diarrhées

Des yeux bouffis avec larmoiement, sensibilité à la lumière ou encore un regard fixe intense

De l'ostéoporose

L'hyperthyroïdie peut provenir de diverses maladies, dont la maladie de Basedow, le goitre, etc.

L'hypothyroïdie

Elle est beaucoup plus fréquente. On estime qu'ici, en général, environ 1% de la population souffre d'hypothyroïdie, tous âges confondus. Comme la fréquence augmente avec l'âge, ce chiffre peut grimper jusqu'à 20% chez les personnes âgées. Les femmes sont plus à risque. La grossesse peut provoquer une hypothyroïdie passagère qui durera de 6 à 12 mois suivant l'accouchement et disparaîtra d'elle-même. Elle pourrait jouer un rôle d'amplification chez ceux qui souffrent de dépression post-partum.

L'hypothyroïdie peut avoir des conséquences désastreuses quand elle se présente chez les nouveau-nés.

L'hypothyroïdie peut avoir des conséquences désastreuses quand elle se présente chez les nouveau-nés. Une carence en hormones thyroïdiennes à cet âge peut être entraînée aux problèmes de développement sévères. Au niveau physique, la croissance ne peut être exercée normalement et sur tout le confort. Sur le plan intellectuel, le développement normal en souffrira beaucoup et peut provoquer un retard mental et un crétinisme. Ce sont des chercheurs canadiens qui au milieu des années 1970 ont mis au point un test sanguin qui, réalisé dans les 3 premiers jours suivant la naissance, permet de détecter tout d'hypothyroïdie. En présence de la maladie, sur l'administration des hormones thyroïdiennes, le bébé peut se développer tout à fait normalement.

L'hypothyroïdie chez l'adulte et chez la personne âgée peut apporter ces symptômes:

Fatigue

frilosité

faible appétit parfois accompagné d'un gain de poids inexpliqué

rythme cardiaque ralenti

irritabilité et parfois un état dépressif

crampes et raideurs musculaires

constipation

visage enflé

pâleur de peau

perte de cheveux

voix rauque

menstruations irrégulières et plus abondantes

cholestérol sanguin élevé.

difficulté à se concentrer, pertes de mémoire et parfois confusion

enflure à la base du cou (goitre).

En somme, les symptômes sont rattachés au ralentissement du fonctionnement des divers organes du corps. Le plus souvent, ces symptômes apparaissent de manière progressive et certaines personnes ne le ressentent tout simplement pas. Ce n'est que le test sanguin de dosage de la TSH qui apportera la réponse.

Causes

C'est en 1924 au Michigan qu'on effaça la cause principale d'hypothyroïdie. Jusqu'alors, un manque d'iode dans l'organisme constituant la cause principale de cette affection. On décida alors d'ajouter l'iode dans le sel de table.

Facteurs de risques

Parmi les plus fréquents, soulons le tabagisme durant l'allaitement qui pourrait privilégier le bébé de ces hormones. Diverses carences nutritionnelles, particulièrement en iode, en sélénium et en zinc aussi à propos de l'intérieur, de l'opposé, de l'excitation, de l'automobile, de la voiture ici comme ailleurs, trop, c'est comme pas assez. Certains médicaments comme le sel de lithium (traitement du trouble bipolaire et autres) et l'amiodarone (Cordarone® pour traiter l'arythmie cardiaque) peuvent également favoriser l'hypothyroïdie. Finalement une consommation abusive de certains aliments dits goitrigènes peut être en cause. Ces aliments comprennent tous les crucifères (choux de Bruxelles, chou, chou-fleur, brocoli, chou frisé, rutabaga, radis, etc.), le manioc, la patate douce, les graines de soya, les arachides et le millet.

""When it launched in 1990 Lateline was a ground-breaking program, and for almost three decades it has made an enormous contribution to Australian public life,"" ABC director, news Gaven Morris said.

""Many great ABC journalists and production teams have worked with Lateline and the current team has produced an innovative brand of late-evening current affairs. The Link was a bold experiment that has done wonderful, creative work.

""This proposal is no reflection on the excellent work of the program teams. But with audience habits changing, we can deploy these resources more effectively in other ways.""

This is shocking news. Lateline is high quality journalism often the 1st to bring breaking stories. Shameful it is being axed ABC. https://t.co/NrXOKz3okj — Kerry Baker (@KerryB1954) October 4, 2017

Sad news about Lateline being cut. Terrific reporting & bloody great interviews. Many mates got a start there. All the best for the journos. — Here Lies A Berlage (@verbaliza) October 4, 2017

The ABC will establish an investigations unit of 10 investigative reporters, led by editor Jo Puccini, a former executive producer of 7.30 and a specialist reporting team under former Lateline executive producer Lisa Whitby, to work across all platforms.

In the shake up, Alberici will become the ABC's chief economics correspondent while Grant will also take up the position of chief Asia correspondent.

The ABC recently hired John Lyons from The Australian as the head of investigative journalism, to lead the teams across current affairs shows including Lateline.

""Alongside teams such as Four Corners, 7.30 and Background Briefing, the establishment of the largest investigative daily news team in the Australian media reflects the ABC's growing commitment to journalism for television, radio and digital audiences,"" Lyons said.

Very sad news about ABC axing Lateline. Ridiculous decision. — Shannon Molloy (@sleemol) October 4, 2017

Earlier this year, ABC's managing director Michelle Guthrie announced up to 200 job cuts in middle management with an aim to pump the savings into the expansion of ABC's regional coverage.

The ABC have yet to reveal if this overhaul will result in any job cuts.

""These proposals represent a big investment by the ABC in investigative, specialist and in-depth journalism at a time when many other media outlets are retreating from these areas,"" Morris said.

""Public interest journalism on behalf of all Australians is more important to the role of ABC News than ever.""",The ABC Axed Lateline And Tributes To The Program Are Flowing,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/05/the-abc-axed-lateline-and-tributes-to-the-program-are-flowing_a_23233300/

Die Szene seht ihr oben im Video

Ein Mitglied der Jungen Union (JU) hat auf dem Bundestreffen der Parteijugend für einen Eklat gesorgt. Diego Faßnacht fragte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) am Samstag, ob sie bereit sei, ""den Weg frei zu machen für einen inhaltlichen und personellen Neuanfang"".

Die Mehrheit der Delegierten reagierte mit Buhrufen. Lediglich die bayerischen Delegierten applaudierten.

""Vollkommener Kontrollverlust""

Die Kanzlerin sei für einen ""vollkommenen Kontrollverlust"" der Behörden in der Flüchtlingskrise verantwortlich, kritisierte Faßnacht, der aus dem Rheinisch-Bergischen Kreis stammt, dem ehemaligen Wahlkreis des früheren CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Wolfgang Bosbach.

Er habe den Eindruck, dass Merkel entweder nicht bereit oder nicht mehr in der Lage sei, eine Trendwende für die Union zu erreichen. Merkel ging auf die Rücktrittsforderung nicht direkt ein, sondern entgegnete, sie fühle sich durch das Wahlergebnis ""demokratisch legitimiert"", eine Regierung zu bilden.

Merkel kündigt Jamaika-Verhandlungen an

Die CDU-Chefin erklärte auf dem ""Deutschlandtag"" auch, sie wolle ""neue Köpfe"" in ihrer Partei berücksichtigen. Eine öffentliche Personaldiskussion werde sie aber derzeit nicht führen.

Zudem habe sie auch in der Vergangenheit darauf geachtet, dass junge Köpfe in Partei und Regierung Verantwortung hätten. Bestes Beispiel sei der Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Finanzministerium, Jens Spahn. Er hatte am Vorabend kaum verborgen heftige Kritik an ihrem Kurs geäußert. Spahn sei Staatssekretär ""ja nicht geworden, weil ich ihn verstecken wollte"", sagte Merkel.

Die Kanzlerin kündigte in ihrer Rede zudem erstmals offiziell Gespräche mit FDP und Grünen über eine Jamaika-Koalition an.

Es werde schwierige Verhandlungen geben, aber es gehe darum, eine verlässliche Regierung zu bilden, sagte Merkel am Samstag beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union in Dresden. Über einen Koalitionsvertrag werde ein Sonderparteitag entscheiden.

Kurz vor dem Krisentreffen von CDU und CSU zur Abstimmung auf dem Weg nach Jamaika werden die Rufe nach einem Politik- und Personalwechsel in der Union immer lauter.

Die Junge Union (JU) pocht zum Auftakt ihres ""Deutschlandtags"" in Dresden auf eine Schärfung des konservativen Profils - und eine klare Begrenzung der Zuwanderung. In der CDU werden zudem Stimmen lauter, die Basis stärker in die Verabschiedung eines künftigen Koalitionsvertrags einzubeziehen.

There is no doubt that journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh's brutal murder on 5 September shone a spotlight on the dangers faced by writers who critique majoritarian politics and express dissent.

A month after her violent death at the hands of unknown assailants, Lankesh has been posthumously honoured with the Anna Politkovskaya Award, instituted by the Reach All Women in War (RAW in WAR) organisation. She is the first Indian journalist to win the prestigious award, reported Hindustan Times.

Lankesh, 55, shares the award posthumously with Gulalai Ismail, 31, a human rights and peace activist who lives in Pakistan, and who, like Lankesh, is a fierce critic of Islamic extremism. Ismail has received many death threats for speaking out against the Taliban.

RAW in WAR is a London-based, NGO that supports human rights and victims of war. It established the Anna Politkovskaya Award in 2007 to honour the memory of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was murdered in Moscow in 2006 because of her courageous reporting of the second war in Chechnya.

According to a report in The Wire, while announcing Gauri's win, the award committee, in a statement, said, ""RAW in WAR honours Gauri Lankesh and her fearless journalism as a strong critic of right-wing Hindu extremism, campaigner for women's rights, fiercely opposed to the caste system, and campaigner for the rights of Dalits. A senior Indian journalist and activist, Gauri just like Anna Politkovskaya before her, was shot dead outside her home in Bangalore on 5th September 2017 in order to silence her voice and her critical reporting and activism.""

Addressing a press conference about the award, Lankesh's sister, Kavitha, said that the award does not belong to the family but to ""everyone who stood by Gauri"".

""This award is a morale booster for people who want to write, and fight... It honours what Gauri stood for — that you cannot silence me,"" Thomson Reuters Foundation quoted Kavitha as saying.

Talking about her co-winner, Ismail told Thomson Reuters Foundation that Lankesh's murder had left her numb with grief. ""It was heartbreaking that an advocate of democracy, a courageous voice was silenced. This award recognises our common struggle and courage,"" she said.

RAW in WAR also honoured a Rohingya refugee, 25-year-old Jamalida Begum, who spoke out publicly about the horror of being raped by Myanmar security forces after her husband was shot dead in the village of Pyaung Pyaik in north-western Myanmar.

This proposed tax is part of his larger plan to ""urgently manage"" the evolution of robotics and technology for the sake of society. And, while this may seem like a daring statement, it's not exactly the first time it's been proposed. A handful of other leaders around the globe, including Bill Gates and the South Korean government, have quite recently raised similar points. But when broken down, is this hostility towards the evolution of technology really warranted?

Modern Fear

It's no secret that the media has had a huge part to play in the current state of automation. Since the first mention of robots hit the 24-hour news cycle, hundreds of articles have warned of a robotic takeover and an impending meltdown of society. What's usually left out of these articles, however, is the thorough research highlighting the benefits robotics and automation have on society. For example, it has been found that use of robots within manufacturing has increased labour productivity by 0.36%. While that may sound insignificant, it's key to point out that 0.36% accounts for 16% of total productivity growth between 1992 and 2007. And while robotisation has traditionally been adopted by financial and manufacturing sectors, its contribution is not limited to these particular verticals. For example, a report by London's Centre for Economic Research shows that contrary to popular belief, robots have been a huge driver of productivity and economic growth within most markets. This is due to the fact that robots have been able to successful integrate within a number of professions, eliminating the costs, risks and wasted time associated with manual tasks. Yet robots still seem to be the victim of fear mongering rhetoric within the media, mainly due to one particular topic--the dissolution of jobs.

The Question of Employment

There is no denying that with the introduction of robots comes a slight shift in the overall employment landscape. With that said, it's unfair to suggest that automation will be the be all and end all of the job market. As a society, we've been through this before. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, the entire job market went into a frenzy, leaving about half of workers wondering what to do next. But with time came great change. The job market rapidly began to evolve in conjunction with technology, resulting in the creation of jobs that had never even existed before.

While it's difficult to predict the exact outcome, it seems as if history is due to repeat itself. Britain's unemployment rate is currently at a 42-year low, showing that regardless of the increase in automation, jobs seem to be largely unaffected. Luckily, this seems to be a direct representation of the future. According to a recent report by PWC, it's predicted that AI and robotics will both create new jobs, specifically in the digital technology area. These new jobs will generate additional wealth and spending that will then support additional jobs of existing kinds, primarily in sectors that are historically harder to automate.

Arguing Against Robot Tax

In comparison to other leading nations, the U.K unfortunately still slightly lags behind when it comes to robotisation and AI. And while this may be due to our modern fear of the robotic revolution, it's ultimately a dangerous game to play. In order to stay competitive within the global economy, it's extremely important to put an emphasis on the future of technology and innovation. Instead of shying away from what we're uncomfortable with, we should be focusing on where to go next.

Continuous innovation is an essential part of a robust economy. Yes, without a doubt, technology will shift our lives as we know it today. But, why should we approach this change with fear? Measures such as a ""Robot Tax"" are nothing more than a step backwards when it comes to productivity and the overall well-being of society. As a forward thinking society, we have a huge amount of opportunity to utilise this innovative technology to create positive change, not only when it comes to supporting the economy, but to create new channels for society that we may not reach otherwise.",Rethinking The Robot Tax,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/neil-kinson/rethinking-the-robot-tax_b_18192200.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

The award of the $1.1 million prize marks a return to a more mainstream interpretation of literature after it went to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan last year.

BREAKING NEWS The 2017 #NobelPrize in Literature is awarded to the English author Kazuo Ishiguro pic.twitter.com/j9kYaeMZH6 — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 5, 2017

The works of Ishiguro, who moved to Britain as a young child, often touch on memory, time and self-delusion, the Academy said.

“He is a little bit like a mix of Jane Austen, comedy of manners and Franz Kafka. If you mix this a little, not too much, you get Ishiguro in a nutshell,” said Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.

Ishiguro began to gain attention in the 1980s for works such as “A Pale View of the Hills” and won global fame for “The Remains of the Day,” a story of a fastidious and repressed butler in postwar Britain. The movie version starred Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.

Ishiguro takes his place beside Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Doris Lessing and Ernest Hemingway as winner of the world’s most prestigious literary award.

Critics said the decision to give last year’s prize to Dylan was a snub to more deserving candidates and strayed beyond what is traditionally deemed literature.

Es vergeht kaum eine Woche, in der ich nicht auf irgendein Amt renne, in Telefon-Warteschleifen hänge oder Emails an Sachbearbeiter verschicke.

Früher habe ich als Fotograf gearbeitet. Ich bin um die Welt gereist, immer auf der Jagd nach dem bestmöglichen Motiv. Heute sind meine Ziele Ämter und Behörden. Die Kamera und mein Stativ habe ich eingetauscht gegen einen Kugelschreiber und seitenweise Anträge.

Doch warum tue ich das? Der Grund ist einfach: Es geht um das Wohl meines Kindes und tausender anderen Familien, die unser Schicksal teilen.

Denn seit seiner Geburt ist mein Sohn Nico körperlich und geistig schwerstbehindert. Er sitzt in einem Rollstuhl und muss 24-Stunden gepflegt werden.

""Sie können doch in der Zeit arbeiten""

Kinder und Jugendliche wie Nico gibt es in Deutschland viele - es sind etwa 950.000. Rund 90 Prozent von ihnen leben in ihren Familien und werden von ihren Angehörigen zu Hause gepflegt.

Die meisten Eltern können nebenher keinem normalen Job nachgehen. Denn die Pflege eines behinderten Kindes ist eine enorme physische und psychische Belastung, die 24 Stunden am Tag deine volle Aufmerksamkeit benötigt.

Ein Beispiel: Ein Besuch im Jobcenter. Es geht um finanzielle Unterstützung für meine Familie. Ein Sachbearbeiter fragt mich: ""Wie lange pflegen Sie ihren Sohn denn im Schnitt?""

Ich antworte: ""Am Wochenende rund um die Uhr. In der Woche 16 Stunden am Tag.""

Darauf fragt der Beamte, warum ich Nico lediglich 16 Stunden pro Tag pflege.

""Acht Stunden am Tag ist Nico in der Tagesförderung"", antworte ich.

""Na dann können sie doch in der Zeit arbeiten"".

""Ich würde aber auch gern mal schlafen - nachts ist das nicht möglich. Außerdem würde ich dann insgesamt 24 Stunden arbeiten"".

Die Antwort des Beamten ließ mich augenblicklich verstummen: ""Also wissen Sie, ich habe auch drei Kinder großgezogen!""

Es ist diese Art von Unverständnis, auf die ich regelmäßig in Ämtern stoße. Als sei man selbst Schuld daran, dass das Kind mit einer Behinderung auf die Welt gekommen ist: Tja, Pech gehabt!

Wir haben ein Projekt ins Leben gerufen, das es so noch nie gab

Die Mittel, die der Staat in Form des ""Pflegegeldes"" für Familien bereitstellt, reichen bei weitem nicht aus. Je nach Pflegestufe sind das in Deutschland maximal 901 Euro im Monat. Inklusive der 600 Euro Hartz-IV-Zuschuss und den 190 Euro Kindergeld habe ich etwas mehr als 1500 Euro zur Verfügung, um unsere kleine Familie über Wasser zu halten.

Angehörige erhalten für die Pflege keine angemessene monetäre Unterstützung und werden häufig zu Hartz-IV-Empfängern degradiert - besonders wenn die Pflege eine Beschäftigung auf dem Arbeitsmarkt nicht zulässt. Die finanzielle Unterstützung für Angehörige von Pflegebedürftigen ist in Deutschland eine einzige Katastrophe.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Wie die Bürokratie der Sozialämter die Menschen in die Armut treibt, die sich nicht wehren können

In den Jobcentern dürfen wir Eltern uns dann anhören, dass wir faul und arbeitsscheu sind. Mitarbeiter drohen uns mit Sanktionen und Leistungskürzungen. Die Behandlung dort ist schlicht und ergreifend menschenunwürdig.

Doch sich pausenlos über seine Situation zu beschweren, bringt uns auch nichts. Deswegen haben mein Sohn und ich ein Projekt ins Leben gerufen, das es so in Deutschland noch nie gab: Nicos Farm - eine besondere Wohnform, in der Erwachsene zusammen mit ihren Kindern gemeinsam leben können.

Damit möchten Nico und ich die notwendige Revolution in der Pflege von Behinderten einleiten, die Deutschland so dringend nötig hat.

Die Zukunftsangst ist ein ständiger Begleiter

Die Idee ist schnell erklärt: Fast alle Eltern stellen sich die Frage, was aus ihrem Nachwuchs wird, wenn sie selbst nicht mehr als Betreuer und Lebensbegleiter zur Verfügung stehen können.

Muss das Kind dann in ein Heim umziehen? Für die meisten ist das eine schreckliche Vorstellung. Denn in Heimen werden Kinder und Jugendliche isoliert vom Rest der Gesellschaft großgezogen. Sie haben im Erwachsenenalter kaum eine Möglichkeit, einen halbwegs normalen Alltag zu führen.

Das macht die ganze Sache noch schwerer. Schließlich wünschen sich auch oder gerade Eltern von behinderten Kindern, dass ihre Kinder als Erwachsene ein selbstbestimmtes Leben in liebevoller Umgebung führen können.

Insbesondere dann, wenn Vater und Mutter nicht mehr als Betreuer und Lebensbegleiter zur Verfügung stehen. Die Aussicht, dass das eigene Kind später im Pflegeheim endet, weil kein anderer Platz in der Gesellschaft da ist, ist für viele Angehörige quälend.

Besonders vor dem Hintergrund der wachsenden Intoleranz in der Gesellschaft gegenüber Menschen, die nicht den üblichen Normen entsprechen. Darüber hinaus ist die Pflegesituation in den deutschen Heimen auch kritisch.

Neben den zu bewältigenden Alltagsproblemen ist für viele Familien mit behinderten Kindern also die Zukunftsangst ein täglicher Begleiter.

Orte, an denen behinderte Kinder erst mit und später auch ohne ihre Eltern leben können, sind in Deutschland kaum vorhanden.

Wir wollen Elternteilen mehr Freiraum schenken

Nicos Farm soll genau das werden. Eine einmalige ""Insel der Menschlichkeit"", auf der behinderte Kinder mit ihren Eltern in einer Gemeinschaft leben können, die sich durch das gemeinsame Miteinander gegenseitig unterstützt.

Unser Ziel ist ein echtes Miteinander von behinderten und nicht behinderten Menschen in einem normalen Umfeld.

Neben Familien mit behinderten Kindern wollen wir freie Räume auch an ältere Menschen vermieten, die in ihrem bisherigen Wohnumfeld nicht mehr bleiben wollen oder können.

Auf der Farm können Sie dann ihre Erfahrungen einbringen und auch von der Fürsorge aller profitieren. Besonders wichtig ist uns der kooperative, nachbarschaftliche Ansatz, der professionelle Hilfe mit ehrenamtlicher Hilfe verknüpft.

Diese Hilfe kann jede Form annehmen: Kinder beaufsichtigen, bei der Wahrnehmung von Therapiestunden helfen, die Freizeit gestalten, aber auch Lösungen bei beruflichen Schwierigkeiten finden.

Das Ziel dieser Wohnform: Den Elternteilen mehr Freiraum für sich selbst zu schenken und auch die Chance zu geben, immer mehr vom eigenen Kind loslassen zu können.

Unser Projekt soll Vorbild sein

Weil wir in der Gemeinschaft auch viele Probleme zusammen lösen können, würden außerdem die vielen nervtötenden Gänge aufs Amt hinfällig. Gemeinsame Wohnprojekte bestehend aus Familien sind außerdem weitaus günstiger für den Staat als eine Heimunterbringung, die im Monat rund 5.000 Euro kostet. Alleine das Gehalt für Pfleger und Pflegerinnen könnten dadurch teilweise eingespart werden.

Wenn es uns gemeinsam gelingt, dieses Wohnprojekt auf die Beine zu stellen, wird es Vorbild für weitere Projekte in Deutschland sein. Nicos und mein Traum ist ein Land, in dem kein behindertes Kind in einem anonymen Heim leben muss. Durch gemeinsame Wohnprojekte könnte unser Zusammenleben menschlicher werden. Für ein Leben in Würde - für alle!

Nico und sein Vater suchen noch Investoren, die uns bei der Umsetzung der ersten Häuser unterstützen werden. Sie sind guter Hoffnung, dass der erste Spatenstich zum Ende des Jahres 2018 erfolgen kann und die ersten Häuser ab dem Frühjahr 2018 bewohnt werden können. Hier erfahrt ihr mehr über das Projekt.

Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan.","ADVERTISEMENT

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI -- At Hrithik Roshan's sprawling, 3,000-square feet house in Juhu, Mumbai, an entire wall in the living room is covered by a mirror. Hidden away in tiny lettering in a corner of the wall closest to the mirror are the words, ""There are two sides to every story."" You can spot it if you look closely. It is the writing on the wall that matters now as the latest volley of statements and accusations fly thick and fast in his supposed affair-gone-sour story with Kangana Ranaut.

The Rashomon-like narrative is not just about two Indian movie stars squabbling over a past affair. Both of them have indicated that they would rather just ""move on"". Hrithik has claimed he was never romantically involved with Kangana; she has in turn called him a ""silly ex"". What is truly bewildering is that neither of them are ready to actually let go — Kangana has spoken about her alleged affair with the Krrish star in numerous interviews at least two years after it was all supposedly over, and Hrithik has responded with legal notices and police complaints.

Apart from the obvious point of contention — that a woman claims a man dated her and he denies it — the whole controversy also throws the spotlight on certain incidents that border on something much sinister: cyber harassment and stalking.

According to Hrithik, he has had a strictly professional relationship with Kangana. They shot two films together — Kites in 2010 and Krrish 3 in 2013 — and never spent any time in private.

How It Started: 'Queen' Incident

In January, 2014, Kangana sent Hrithik an email and a text message asking him why he hadn't thanked her for a ""special birthday present"" she had sent him. She had also sent a synopsis of a script she had written and wanted to direct some day, which he read around the same time and replied to both emails, saying he hadn't received a present but that he had read her script and was really proud of her.

""This is the only mail I have sent her in my life,"" Hrithik told HuffPost India. He said he encouraged Kangana, who grew up in Himachal Pradesh, to overcome her language barrier. ""Throughout the time I have known her, she has been struggling with her language to learn how to speak in English. And I am coming from a place where I have had a handicap — a stutter — and I have been in a very empowered place to tell her things like 'it doesn't matter'. That is the one thing where maybe I have had a chat with her in my life. I gave her examples like (late) Yash Chopra who doesn't know English but he speaks with his heart.""

""And I am coming from a place where I have had a handicap — a stutter — and I have been in a very empowered place to tell her things like 'it doesn't matter'.""

In the 28 January, 2014, email, Hrithik told her he was proud of her evolution, calling her script a ""storybook romance"".

In response, Kangana offered to buy him an Apple device, according to emails exchanged between them. Hrithik stopped replying. All emails mentioned in this story have been viewed by this HuffPost India reporter who is in possession of copies of most of these written exchanges between the two.

Meanwhile, Hrithik said that Kangana sent him some texts that year. When he went to shoot Bang Bang in Shimla in February 2014, Kangana sent him suggestions of places he could visit near her hometown. He thanked her.

But it was on 24 May, 2014, at a party thrown by Bollywood film director Karan Johar, where Hrithik said an encounter with Kangana ""stunned"" him. Her film Queen had been released to tremendous critical and commercial acclaim in March that year, and he went up to congratulate her at the party.

""I told her I haven't seen the film but I will see the film and I will give you my feedback,"" he said. But the 27-year-old actress looked at him in confusion. ""But you have seen my film,"" she told him.

""I told her I haven't seen the film but I will see the film and I will give you my feedback,"" he said. But the 27-year-old actress looked at him in confusion. ""But you have seen my film,"" she told him. ""No, I haven't, but I will, and I promise to watch it soon and give my honest feedback,"" he remembered replying to her.

""But you've seen my film,"" she insisted, he said. That was when she told him that she had received an email from him, detailing the scenes in Queen he enjoyed the most. He told her he hadn't sent her any email. She walked away, visibly upset, Hrithik recalled, and he followed, disturbed. She refused to speak to him after that, he said.

Kangana's legal team has a very different description of the night — according to her, she confronted Hrithik at the party after suspicions that he had hacked her email, and later believed that he hacked a second email address she had created in order to send himself emails.

Next morning, Hrithik said he woke up to a string of abusive messages from Kangana sent between 3 and 4am.

""I presumed that she had lost her phone and somebody had found it and was playing a prank,"" he said. What followed was even more baffling. Rangoli forwarded him an email he had supposedly sent to Kangana earlier that month. In that email, he refers to them as a ""couple"". Alarmed, the actor thought his email had been hacked. It was only after he alerted his office manager and IT assistant, did he notice that the mail Rangoli had forwarded came from a different ID than the one the actor used.

Imposter At Play?

Hrithik informed Rangoli that his email address was different, and warned her that someone could be posing as him in communication with Kangana. In fact Rangoli herself suggested that they go to the police together. She said Kangana was ""stressed"" because she had sent on that email id ""pictures, videos, mails and messages"" and has received ""a lot of stuff"" from him as well.

An hour later, in an email, Rangoli accused the actor of ""psychologically raping"" her sister.

""When I read words like this, I completely disconnected,"" he said, adding that he refused to engage after the accusations against him.

However, the next morning, Rangoli wrote back to him, saying that she didn't know what was going on, but that Kangana was upset. In an email, dated 26 May, 2014, she wrote Kangana had forwarded to her a mail, supposedly from the actor, to show that the two were indeed in a relationship.

Matters took a turn soon when Rangoli claimed that Kangana's email had been hacked, and all her emails from Hrithik were deleted. Interestingly, both Rangoli and Kangana appeared to be convinced that it was Hrithik who was writing to the actress. Rangoli asked him to delete all old videos and photos that the actress had shared with him over the email ID Hrithik claimed wasn't his. She said she believed he did not have any ""bad intention"" and that she wanted to ""close the matter"".

Hrithik stopped responding.

Five weeks later, in July, Hrithik said he was startled to receive a blank email from Kangana, with a subject line that said she missed him. He didn't respond, and continued to receive dozens of emails from her regularly, following which he said he started sending these emails to his ""junk"" mail folder.

""I just decided that this is very weird, I went through this very weird episode on one day, I don't want to into this and I started to junk them,"" he told HuffPost India. ""All this time I am thinking, oh my god she is extending her relationship with the imposter on to me now.""

""I was just irritated, confused, I showed these mails to all my friends and asked what should i do and they said just ignore.""

""All this time I am thinking, oh my god she is extending her relationship with the imposter on to me now."" Hrithik Roshan

He shared his concerns with his close friends, and even a top police officer in Mumbai, all of whom suggested that he should ignore it, he told HuffPost India.

""At times I thought I would call her and clear the matter once and for all but I could sense from her explicit mails and words that this was a mess and I just didn't want to get myself further involved in something that literally had nothing to do with me,"" he wrote to a friend in the film industry in May, 2016.

""Ninety percent of the mails were explicit in nature.""

""There were times when my kids were travelling with Sussanne (his ex-wife) and [I] used to keep my alerts on at night only to receive such mails from her that used to mess up my mind in the middle of the night,"" he wrote. ""I used to bang my phone down in anger,"" he said.

""There were times when my kids were travelling with Sussanne (his ex-wife) and [I] used to keep my alerts on at night only to receive such mails from her that used to mess up my mind in the middle of the night.""

In some of the emails, which Hrithik said he only read much later, when he was submitting them to the police, she had detailed her day's plans, and sent photos of herself at pujas, unwinding at home, as well as some explicit images. All of these, Hrithik said, were unsolicited, and totalled to about 3,000 by the time he submitted them to police.

Kangana later told the police that her computer was hacked. According to her lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, Hrithik hacked into her account and sent himself these emails. Kangana had complained to Hrithik's father, filmmaker Rakesh Roshan about this incident. Siddiquee told HuffPost India that only a handful of these emails were actually sent by Kangana to Hrithik, and that she did not file a police complaint as the two actors were on cordial terms.

Many of the photos sent in these emails to Hrithik, Siddiquee claimed, were actually older photos of Kangana that she had sent earlier to the ""imposter"" email ID. He alleged that Hrithik had downloaded these emails and sent them to himself from Kangana's email, to establish a one-sided love affair.

Her 'Mystery Man'

After a news report in December 2014 claimed Hrithik was Kangana's ""mystery man"", he decided to lodge a complaint against this imposter who seemed to be communicating with her using his name. It was on the same day that he stopped getting emails from Kangana, he said.

According to Hrithik, there were several times in 2015 when someone in the film fraternity would refer to his supposed relationship with Kangana, which he would deny. ""It began really bothering me,"" he wrote to his friend.

Hrithik said he explored all his legal options, but he was advised that the laws of the country would not work to his advantage. What he was undergoing, he said, was cyberstalking — there was no other way to describe it. And cyberstalking holds a much lower risk of punishment than any law that protects women from harassment.

Early the following year, in January 2016, Kangana referred to Hrithik as a ""silly ex"", which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. The actor sent a legal notice to the actress.

It needs to be said here that this alleged love affair was all happening over mail.

At the time, the actor was convinced that the complaint to the cyber cell in 2014 would help bring out the facts of the case. It was around then that he retrieved from his junk folder emails from Kangana, he said.

""I realised I couldn't do both — maintain clean hands AND wish for the mess to be cleaned on its own. I had to get my hands dirty,"" he wrote to his friend. ""I remember a time in school when crow shit fell on my head, every kid stayed away from me even tho [sic] I had nothing to do with the crow or its shit.""

However, the police could not trace the ""imposter"" in Hrithik's complaint – the US justice department which was trying to trace the account found that it either ""never existed"" or had been automatically deleted because it hadn't been in use for several months, reported The Times of India in November last year.

Kangana did not submit her electronic devices for investigations into her hacking claims. ""She claims that she was receiving emails from an ID which she told us that is not ours. We offered to get to the bottom of the fake identity. The police have told us this ID is registered in New Jersey. She has neither cooperated in getting that ID and we don't know how many emails she got. Nor has she given any of the receiving instrument,"" Hrithik's lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani told HuffPost India in a telephone interview.

In April this year, Hrithik submitted his emails and devices to the police for forensic analysis. Given the nature of delays in forensic examinations in India, he also submitted a report from a private forensic firm where he himself got his devices tested. The report says that none of his devices were used to access the internet domain for the alleged ""imposter"" ID, nor did he have any intimate photos or videos of Kangana in his hard drive, even among his ""deleted files"". The emails with Kangana's photos were mostly sent directly from her iPhone 5s, according to the private forensic report.

The cops still have his laptop.

""I'm a bystander in this entire episode. This shit has just fallen on my lap,"" he said to HuffPost India.

""Testifying for my character, for something I have not done — it looks half guilty.""

Despite repeated requests, Kangana declined comment on the matter. Rangoli did not respond to text messages requesting her comment.

Angela Merkel war am Samstag zu Gast beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union

Merkel zeigte sich in ihrer Rede noch immer ""enttäuscht"" vom Wahlergebnis

Die Kanzlerin kündigte jedoch auch offizielle Gespräche über Verhandlungen zu einer Jamaika-Koalition an

Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat erstmals offiziell Gespräche mit FDP und Grünen über eine Jamaika-Koalition angekündigt.

Es werde schwierige Verhandlungen geben, aber es gehe darum, eine verlässliche Regierung zu bilden, sagte Merkel am Samstag beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union in Dresden. Über einen Koalitionsvertrag werde ein Sonderparteitag entscheiden.

Auf die JU-Forderung nach personeller Erneuerung in einer künftigen Regierung erklärte Merkel, sie wolle ""neue Köpfe"" berücksichtigen. Eine öffentliche Personaldiskussion werde sie aber derzeit nicht führen. Zudem habe sie auch in der Vergangenheit darauf geachtet, dass junge Köpfe in Partei und Regierung Verantwortung hätten.

Bestes Beispiel sei der Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Finanzministerium, Jens Spahn. Er hatte am Vorabend kaum verborgen heftige Kritik an ihrem Kurs geäußert. Spahn sei Staatssekretär ""ja nicht geworden, weil ich ihn verstecken wollte"", sagte Merkel.

Merkel will Wähler wieder für die Union gewinnen

Um jene Wähler, die die Union diesmal nicht gewählt hätten, müsse gekämpft werden. Die Union müsse sich mit dem Ergebnis auseinandersetzen, es ""ist und bleibt enttäuschend"".

Merkel rief ihre Partei eine Woche vor der Niedersachsen-Wahl zu einer Kraftanstrengung im dortigen Wahlkampf auf. ""Lassen Sie uns bitte noch eine Schippe drauflegen, damit Bernd Althusmann Ministerpräsident dieses Landes wird.""

Zuvor hatte Merkel ihrer Partei eine umfassende Aufarbeitung des Unionsdesasters bei der Bundestagswahl zugesagt, zugleich aber ihre umstrittene Reaktion auf das Ergebnis verteidigt. ""Ich rate uns nun allen dazu, gemeinsam demütig zu sein"", sagte Merkel am Samstag.

Talk about their baby -- their baby will be their favourite topic of conversation.","""If they cry, please don't shy away from them. Try a hug instead. Or even better, cry with them.""

With one in four pregnancies ending in miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death, the chances are we all know someone who has lost a baby. When we find out that a friend or relative is pregnant we think of the excitement, the joy and the celebration.

But what happens if it all goes wrong? What happens when the joy of welcoming a baby into the world is replaced by the unnatural death of a child? What, if anything, do you say? It is something I had not put much thought into, until it happened to me.

I was 35 weeks pregnant when my son's heart stopped beating for no reason. Stillborn is what they call it, a horrible and sterile term that can sometimes make us forget that we are talking about a child, a human life, my Benjamin.

One of the things that has surprised me the most on this impossible journey of loss has been the number of people who have ignored the fact that my son Benjamin ever existed. From those who meet us and say nothing, to those who just haven't contacted us at all.

In an alternate universe where Benjamin had survived, these same people would have sent us gifts and messages of congratulations. In this universe, however, there is only silence. The feelings of hurt and rejection, not only for me but for my son, can at times be unbearable. The anger and disappointment temporarily overshadow the sadness.

I think that we are all afraid. I am afraid that they will say nothing and they are afraid to say something.

As a result I haven't been out in groups very much since losing him. I'm afraid of the looks of discomfort and pity. I'm afraid of the small talk and the conversations that so desperately try to steer away from the subject of Benjamin.

The easy thing for me to do is just not go out. That way I can't get hurt. When I step back, however, I realise that by removing myself from these situations I might as well remove myself from life. This is not what Benjamin would want and it is not what I want either.

I know that those who say nothing are not bad people. I know that they are not trying to hurt me. Ironically, I think that we are all afraid. I am afraid that they will say nothing and they are afraid to say something.

I really do understand that it is difficult to know what to say. In the time directly after losing Benjamin I could see that it was hard for those closest to me. They would look at me with hurt in their eyes for what they were witnessing. I so much wanted to be able to tell them that I was okay or at least that I was going to be okay, but I couldn't.

What I want to do now is verbalise what I couldn't back then -- how I was feeling and what I needed. I want to help others who know bereaved parents to have the courage to speak to them and to not choose silence.

So here are my thoughts on what to say to someone who has lost their baby:

Acknowledge that their baby has died. Even if you just say ""I'm so sorry"" or ""I'm thinking of you"". It means a lot to them.

Trying to find the right words is impossible. They have just lost their baby. No words can make the pain go away.

​​Don't worry about reminding them of what has happened -- it is on their mind 100 percent of the time anyway.

Avoid using platitudes. Saying things like, ""It wasn't meant to be"" is not helpful and mostly just hurtful. You are talking about their child, a human being, a part of them. You would not like it if they said that about one of your living children.

It's okay that they're not okay.

If they cry please don't shy away from them. Try a hug instead. Or even better, cry with them.

Use their baby's name -- their biggest fear is that their baby will be forgotten. Keeping their baby's memory alive is now more important to them than anything.

Talk about their baby -- their baby will be their favourite topic of conversation. No matter what happens they will always be parents and will be just as obsessed with their baby as other parents whose babies are alive.

It's okay to just sit in silence with them.

They feel very lonely -- giving them excessive time and space only makes them feel more isolated.

Ask to see photos -- proud parents love to show off their baby.

Another baby will not fix things -- babies are so different and individual. Another 50 babies won't be able to replace the one who has gone. There will always be a hole that will never be able to be filled.

Getting back into life is slow. Please be patient with them.

The list above is not exhaustive nor is it right for everyone. Traumatic grief is complicated and different for every person. If you're not sure you're doing the right thing then just ask. They're still your loved one, they're just really hurting right now so might be acting a little differently.

For those of you who have cried with us, sat in silence with us and missed Benjamin with us, thank you. For those of you who have found it too hard and chose silence instead, we know you are still thinking of us and of Benjamin.

relativiser les actes de Mohammed Merah (""fou"", ""loup solitaire"", ""paumé"", etc) est dans l'air du temps. Vous, de votre côté, avez publié dans Libération (du 4 octobre 2017), une tribune intitulée ""Du Poilu Hertz à Merah, une radicalisation en famille"".

Permettez-moi de vous exprimer mon dégoût.

Oh, vous êtes quelqu'un de très respectable, historien, directeur de recherches au CNRS. Vos recherches semblent fort intéressantes. Travailler sur les rapports de classes dans les tranchées enrichit certainement la science historique. Votre dernier livre paraît tout aussi intéressant. Il est consacré à Robert Hertz, soldat français, intellectuel brillant, officier engagé dans la boucherie de la Grande Guerre, qui choisit avec ardeur de se sacrifier pour la France, encouragé par l'exaltation de sa femme Alice. L'objectif de votre livre, écrivez-vous en quatrième de couverture, consiste à s'interroger sur la raison pour laquelle on ""meurt pour ses idées"". Louable entreprise. Même si, soit dit en passant, je soupçonne que vous aviez une réponse à cette question avant même de vous interroger, tant il apparaît qu'à vos yeux la guerre est absurde et la Grande guerre plus que toute autre. En somme, il fallait donc être un sacré ""radicalisé"" pour vouloir y mourir. C'est un peu votre conclusion. Passons. C'est un autre débat, même si je pense qu'il n'est pas sans lien avec la question qui nous occupe.

Bref, vous êtes intelligent, posé, argumenté. Vous ne ressemblez guère à tous ceux qui, par les temps qui courent, exposent à tout va, de tweets en statuts facebook, le produit d'un étrange mélange de haine, de ressentiment, d'inculture et de bêtise.

Votre intelligence, votre culture, votre savoir-faire ajoutent à votre faute. Cela vous surprend? Vous pensiez que, justement, vos travaux, votre intelligence, votre respectabilité vous mettaient à l'abri et vous donnaient quelque latitude pour établir un parallèle, une ""résonance"" comme vous l'écrivez pompeusement, entre Mohammed Merah, tueur islamiste d'enfants juifs et de militaires, et Robert Hertz, lieutenant engagé dans la Grande Guerre? Vous le pensiez, j'en suis sûr!

Vous êtes trop expérimenté pour méconnaître ce qu'est un contexte historique, vous êtes trop intelligent pour ignorer les limites, voire les dangers, à opérer une telle comparaison. Bien sûr, vous prenez quelques précautions rhétoriques. ""On pensera qu'il y a bien de l'exagération"", ""un peu d'indécence"", écrivez-vous préalablement. Notons le ""un peu"". Et non ""beaucoup"". Mais vous décidez courageusement de passer outre ces risques, ce ""un peu"" d'indécence, car votre faramineuse thèse le mérite: ""Mais les faits sont têtus. Les parallèles trop forts pour être écartés d'un revers de main."" Une tribune dans Libé vaut bien une messe! C'eut été tellement dommage que le risque d'un peu d'indécence vous empêche de faire le malin.

Car le malin, c'est ce que vous faites, sous couvert d'une réflexion atypique. Et quitte à faire le malin, autant le faire jusqu'au bout. Ce Robert Hertz, ce patriote radicalisé, vous choisissez de préciser qu'il est ""juif"". En quoi cela importe, on ne saura pas. Aucune malice de votre part, j'en suis sûr. Ou alors si peu. La croustillante ironie ne vous a pas échappé, hein? Un tueur d'enfants juifs, d'un côté, un lieutenant juif de l'autre. Pas mal. Comprenez-moi bien, je ne suggère pas que vous êtes antisémite. Non. Seulement que vous avez voulu, consciemment ou inconsciemment, rendre votre faramineux exercice de comparaison encore plus difficile. Placer la barre du risque d'indécence un cran plus haut, sous les applaudissements.

J'aimerais être dans votre tête. Il faut toujours essayer de le faire, avant de prendre position. Vous, en revanche, vous ne vous êtes pas mis dans la tête de ceux qui allaient vous lire, les familles des victimes de Merah, accablées de douleur, vous ne vous êtes pas mis dans la tête des millions de Français horrifiés par ses crimes et angoissés par la menace terroriste.

Qu'avez-vous pensé? Qu'avez-vous voulu faire? Comprendre? Relativiser? Je ne sais pas. Je crois que, simplement, fort de votre trouvaille conceptuelle et marketing, vous avez cédé à ce mal contemporain qui consiste, tout simplement, à vouloir exister à tout prix, à donner son avis sur tout et, plus encore, dès que possible, à créer la polémique, à choquer. Vous vous pensiez anti-conformiste, vous n'êtes qu'un cynique et le produit banal d'une époque.

Peut-être, avez-vous également pensé que, effet collatéral bienvenu, ce petit et paresseux texte apporterait un peu de publicité à votre long et intelligent ouvrage, bien trop ignoré du monde. Voyez comme j'essaye de me mettre dans votre tête. A toutes fins utiles, son prix, 25 euros, et son éditeur, le Seuil, sont précisés à la fin de votre tribune. Après tout, si un lecteur, après avoir goûté votre petit parallèle audacieux entre Merah et le lieutenant Hertz, avait envie de se jeter sur vos 448 pages à 25 euros aux éditions du Seuil, eh bien ce serait une externalité positive comme disent les économistes.

Du reste, dans votre tribune, tellement désireux de parler de vous, de parler de votre brillant livre sur le lieutenant Hertz, vous mentionnez le fait que vous l'avez écrit ""alors que des attentats secouaient le pays. Charlie Hebdo, 'les terrasses' et le Bataclan, Nice"". Vous ajoutez ensuite: ""Chaque nouvelle trace sanglante ajoutait un écho supplémentaire à ce que je racontais de l'engagement hors norme des époux Hertz.""

Il faut vous imaginer plongé dans les lettres de Hertz en 1915 sur le front, dans celles de sa femme, dans des archives militaires veilles d'un siècle et des carnets de campagne, levant le nez sur BFMTV et, devant le spectacle d'une salle de concert mitraillé par des terroristes islamistes, devant les images de jeunes gens abattus comme des chiens à des terrasses de café en plein Paris, devant les mares de sang à Nice, vous dire ""hein, hein chaque trace sanglante ajoute un écho supplémentaire à ce que je raconte de l'engagement hors norme des époux Hertz"". J'aimerais vous imaginer ainsi, mais non, mon imagination atteint là ses limites.

Vous auriez dû, suite à vos éclairs de génie devant BFMTV, lever le pied, travailler moins, prendre quelques vacances. Vous auriez dû... On n'en serait pas là: dans Libération, vous osez écrire cette phrase définitive à propos de Hertz et de Merah, ""radicalisation, patriotique chez l'un, islamiste chez l'autre.""

Vous êtes trop intelligent et trop historien pour ne pas savoir qu'on ne compare pas l'incomparable. Mais vous n'êtes manifestement incapable de comprendre ce que vos comparaisons et autres savantes ""résonances"" ont de détestables, de moralement abjectes et de politiquement dangereuses.

En sont également incapables, ceux à qui vous avez, derrière votre ordinateur, bien content de vous, envoyé votre texte et qui ont décidé de le publier. Eux aussi, trop contents de l'audacieux parallèle, du ""buzz"", de cette réflexion originale propre à susciter le débat –ah, que d'indignités au nom de ce fameux ""débat""!– et cela grâce à un historien breveté d'état-major, CNRS qui plus est. Ils sont autant responsables que vous. Et ils le sont même plus que vous, car eux sont censés savoir quelle est leur responsabilité médiatique.

Vous êtes le produit d'une époque. Eux aussi. Vous tous avez voulu faire les malins, faire le ""buzz"". Vous tous apportez votre petite contribution au relativisme, à la confusion, au cynisme ambiant.

Une dernière chose. Apothéose de votre fulgurance scientifique, vous justifiez votre détestable comparaison par cette trouvaille: ""Les parallèles sont trop forts pour être écartés d'un revers de main. A voir les Hertz s'enfoncer dans le sacrifice, j'en déduisais au moins trois 'règles' qui semblaient pouvoir s'appliquer plus généralement à qui veut comprendre un 'processus de radicalisation': on ne se sacrifie pas seul, et souvent en famille; on se sacrifie quand on a le choix et qu'on peut dire non; on se sacrifie pour des idées.""

Tout ça pour ça! J'espère qu'à tête reposée vous mesurerez la pauvreté de votre conclusion, l'indigence de votre contribution à... à quoi, en fait? À la sociologie, à l'anti-terrorisme, à la psychologie, à l'Histoire, au café du commerce?

Jedes Kind entwickelt sich unterschiedlich""Stattdessen ist es mein Ziel, den Eltern zu erklären, wie ihr Kind tickt und welche Bedürfnisse es hat.","Soll ich mein Baby bei mir im Bett schlafen lassen? Darf ich es schreien lassen, wenn es nachts aufwacht? Bis zu welchem Alter soll ich mein Kind stillen? Und soll es lieber Brei bekommen oder gleich feste Nahrung?

Junge Eltern stellen sich viele Fragen. Ihre größte Angst ist es, Fehler zu machen. Fehler, die sich womöglich nie wieder rückgängig machen lassen. Und die Antworten auf ihre Frage finden viele von ihnen in Erziehungsratgebern.

Die Regale mit solchen Publikationen für Eltern in den Buchhandlungen sind daher meterlang.

Doch Pädagogen sehen den Ratgeber-Boom mit Skepsis. Wenn Eltern sich zu sehr auf diese Literatur fixieren, warnen die Experten, können sie ihren Kindern schlimmstenfalls sogar schaden.

Largo hält die meisten Erziehungsratgeber für kontraproduktiv

Der wahrscheinlich bekannteste Kritiker von Erziehungsratgebern ist der Schweizer Kinderarzt Remo Largo. Nur wenige Experten im deutschsprachigen Raum haben sich so intensiv mit dem Thema Kindesentwicklung beschäftigt wie er. Sein Buch ""Babyjahre"" gehört seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten zur Grundausstattung junger Eltern.

Den Großteil der neuen Erziehungsratgeber hält Largo für kontraproduktiv. ""Die meisten dieser Bücher behandeln nur ein bestimmtes Thema und sind problemorientiert"", sagte er der HuffPost.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Kinderarzt Remo Largo erklärt: Mit diesem Fehler schaden Eltern ihren Kindern

""Was mache ich, wenn mein Baby nicht durchschläft? Was, wenn es den Brei nicht essen will? Ich halte von dieser Art von Ratgeber nicht viel.""

Sie seien sehr direktiv geschrieben und versprächen, dass es auf das eine Problem auch die eine Lösung gebe. ""Doch DIE Lösung in dem Sinne gibt es beim Thema Erziehung nicht"", sagt er.

""Diese Form von Erziehungsratgebern macht die Eltern hilflos""

Die Folge, so warnt Largo, seien Ratlosigkeit bei den Eltern und Schaden für die Kinder. ""Diese Form von Erziehungsratgebern macht die Eltern hilflos - und die Kinder leiden darunter, dass die Eltern ihr Problem nicht lösen können.""

Der Kinderarzt erläutert das an einem Beispiel: ""Nehmen Sie etwa einen Ratgeber zum Thema Schlafstörung. Da wird den Eltern also direktiv gesagt, was sie tun sollen. Doch was ist, wenn diese eine Methode nicht funktioniert? Dann können die Eltern ein weiteres Buch kaufen oder sich irgendwann Hilfe bei einem Experten suchen.""

➨ Das könnte euch interessieren: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt, was Kinder mehr als alles andere von ihren Eltern brauchen

Dass Ratgeber in vielen Fällen mehr Negatives ausrichten als sie nützen, kritisieren auch andere Experten. ""Viele Eltern, die unsere Beratungsstelle aufsuchen, sind durch die vielen unterschiedlichen Ratgeber verunsichert"", sagte Bettina Lamm, Familientherapeutin und Entwicklungspsychologin an der Universität Osnabrück, der ""Rhein Main Presse"".

Fehlende praktische Erfahrung verunsichert Eltern

Sie und andere Wissenschaftler beobachten, dass das Phänomen vor allem die gebildete, gut situierte Mittelschicht betrifft. ""Die Familiengründung findet meist Ende 20 oder Anfang 30 statt und oft haben Mutter und Vater dann zum ersten Mal in ihrem Leben ein Baby im Arm"", sagte Lamm.

Die fehlende praktische Erfahrung verunsichere die Eltern, der Griff ins Bücherregal sei eine logische Folge. Das Problem, so warnt sie: Diese Eltern suchten oft nach der einen, allgemeingültigen Lösung für eine Erziehungsfrage - die nicht existiere, wie auch Largo betont.

Statt nach Patentrezepten zu suchen, sollten Eltern lieber eines tun, rät der Kinderarzt: versuchen, das Kind zu verstehen.

""Ich habe Hunderten von Kindern dabei zugesehen, wie sie groß geworden sind"", sagt Largo. Er habe immer versucht, kein Ratgeber zu sein und auch keine zu schreiben.

Jedes Kind entwickelt sich unterschiedlich

""Stattdessen ist es mein Ziel, den Eltern zu erklären, wie ihr Kind tickt und welche Bedürfnisse es hat. Denn nur wenn die Eltern ihre Kinder verstehen, können sie auch ihre Probleme lösen.""

Die Paar- und Familienberaterin Ursula Keller ist sehr ähnlicher Ansicht. ""Ein guter Erziehungsratgeber berücksichtigt, dass Kinder sich unterschiedlich entwickeln"", sagte sie dem Onlineportal ""familienleben.ch"".

""Vorsichtig sollten Eltern immer dann auf einen Erziehungsratgeber reagieren, wenn er versucht, Patentrezepte zu verkaufen. Denn Patentrezepte, die für alle Familien gelten, gibt es nicht.""

➨ Das könnte euch interessieren: Das passiert mit Kindern, die früh in die Kita kommen

Sie nennt außerdem einen weiteren Punkt, der aus Ihrer Sicht gegen die Lektüre vieler Erziehungsratgeber spricht: ""Die Ratgeber sind oft sehr unterschiedlich. Auf gleiche Fragen bieten sie unterschiedliche Antworten. Das kann Eltern zusätzlich verwirren.""

""Die eine Lösung für die Probleme aller Kinder gibt es nicht""

Entwicklungspsychologin Lamm rät verunsicherten Eltern, die zu ihr in die Familientherapie kommen: ""Packt die Bücher weg und vertraut eurem Bauch"" - auch wenn sie wisse, dass das nicht einfach sei und meist erst beim zweiten oder gar dritten Kind gelinge, wie sie selbst sagt.

Auch für Kinderarzt Largo ist die Sache klar: ""Jedes Kind ist einmalig"", sagt er. ""Die eine Lösung für die Probleme aller Kinder gibt es nicht. Wenn Eltern ihr Kind und seine Entwicklung verstehen, brauchen sie all die Erziehungsratgeber nicht.""

The actor played dastardly under-butler Thomas Barrow in all six series of the ITV show, which aired its last episode in 2015.

In an interview with the Radio Times, Rob claimed casting producers have found it difficult to see him as a “heterosexual love interest”.

PA Archive/PA Images Rob James-Collier

He said: “I think audiences in the US can identify quite easily with the quintessential English gent and English lady, whereas a neurotic, dark, gay character like Thomas is a hard thing to put into the American market. It can lead to typecasting.

“Because Thomas Barrow is gay and is, essentially, the bad guy for much of the show, a lot of people within the industry can only see you as that.

“They might not be in a rush to see you as a heterosexual love interest. That takes time.”

He went on to reveal he had since turned down theatre roles as gay characters because he “really wanted to show something different”.

After the interview was picked up by various other news outlets, his comments caused a stir online, where he faced a backlash.

Some pointed out he had no problem with playing the role while he was being paid for it, while others pointed out how it shows how more LBGT+ actors should be awarded LGBT+ roles.

One of Rob’s biggest storylines on ‘Downton Abbey’ saw Thomas attempt to ‘cure’ his homosexuality.

The actor previously said that depicting the difficulties LGBT+ can face while coming to terms with their sexuality had led to him receiving messages from people in a similar position, saying it helped them.

At the time, he described it as “the greatest compliment of all”, adding to the International Business Times that they were “very humbling, poignant and heartfelt”.

""I can never afford to buy cheap.""

Of course, she was talking about why buying more expensive goods would last longer than cheap ones destined to break, saving her cash in the long run.

But that phrase also has important repercussions when it comes to ethical or green practice for us all right now.

And if we want to protect our planet, we need to abide by them.

Bear this in mind: According to research by the United Nation's International Resource Panel, the global population, which is set to grow by 28%, is predicted to use 71% more resources per capita by 2050.

Without urgent steps to increase efficiency, the global use of metals, biomass, minerals - such as sand and other materials - will increase from 85 to 186 billion tonnes per year by 2050.

That increased level of production isn't good for emissions, and it won't be too clever when it comes to climate change, either.

So what can we do to help?

One thing is to move away from a culture of buying cheap without questioning where the product in your hand came from - or what it's doing to the environment as a whole.

And the good news is that things are slowly changing for the better.

More and more consumers understand the consequences of their consumption habits and therefore increasingly pay attention to the responsibility of their preferred companies and the brands they use in their purchasing decisions.

The raging debates about climate change, carbon offsetting, ocean pollution, human rights and child labour has made consumers more aware of the ecological, ethical and financial insecurity of our current consumption.

And it's vital we convince more to follow suit if we're going to move to a more sustainable future.

What we're seeing in some quarters is a new 'premium consumer' - who's not afraid to spend more money on an item if they know it's been ethically sourced and ethically produced.

We want to get people pay the premium price with a big smile on their face and be proud about it.

It's an ethos companies like my own have embraced.

For us, there's a reason our products - eco-friendly underpants - command a higher price than other undies on the shelves.

The material we use is not particularly cheap because of its origin; it's made from recycled materials, including salvaged ocean plastics and by-products of the manufacturing industry.

It's labour intensive.

Yet we also want to make a product that lasts, one that sticks two fingers up to modern 'throw-away-ism' habits.

And it's our hope that as more people start using this material in their own manufacturing, the price to the consumer will come down, making it even more appealing.

Let's say no to disposable culture and fast fashion and let's start thinking about the bigger picture.

Because if we don't, we'll all ultimately shoulder the cost.

While it seems silly that a magazine should be lauded for acknowledging that women over 60 are people, fashion is a notoriously exclusive industry. In Hutton’s accompanying Vogue Italia interview, she talks about thinking her career was over when she hit 40.

“When I was 47 I returned to modeling and I asked that my photos shouldn’t be retouched,” she said. “Women stopped me on the street and told me that for a long time they felt ignored and invisible and seeing me in magazines made them feel that they weren’t invisible anymore.”

And while Hutton has been modeling for decades, she said she’s “never felt prouder in [her] life” after landing this particular Vogue cover.

“I’ve had a record, 27 covers of American Vogue, and I’ve had 13 other Vogue covers, but this is the most important I have ever done, the one that has made me feel most useful,” Hutton said. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but it took Vogue Italia’s courage to make it true.”

She added, “This is a cover that can change society, because it shows a woman who is vibrant, attractive, who still laughs, and who for the first time is a woman my age.”

Formel 1 im Live-Stream: Der Grand-Prix der Formel 1 findet am Sonntag in Japan statt. Sebastian Vettel könnte mit einem Podestplatz in Japan zu Fernando Alonso in der ewigen Formel-1-Bestenliste aufschließen.

Landet der Ferrari-Fahrer am Sonntag in Suzuka unter den ersten drei Piloten, hätte er es zum 97. Mal auf's Treppchen geschafft. Alonso belegt derzeit den vierten Platz.

► Den Rekord hält aber auch hier der siebenmalige Weltmeister Michael Schumacher, der es in 155 Grand-Prix unter die besten Drei schaffte.

Das Freitagstraining für den Grand-Prix mussten die Piloten der Formel 1 im Dauerregen abhalten. Nach der Bestzeit des deutschen Ferrari-Fahrers im Auftakttraining sicherte sich der britische Mercedes-Pilot die schnellste Runde in einer nassen Mini-Einheit.

“Im zweiten Training war viel Regen, es hat sich aber sehr wichtig angefühlt da rauszugehen, um die Strecke einschätzen zu können und zu sehen, wie sich das Auto anfühlt”, sagte WM-Spitzenreiter Hamilton nach seiner vier Runden langen Nassfahrt. “Der Wagen fühlt sich wieder normal an, ich bin bereit zu fahren.”

Sebastian Vettel gibt sich siegessicher

Vor dem fünftletzten Grand-Prix der Saison liegt der zuletzt von Pech und Pleiten verfolgte Hesse 34 Punkte hinter seinem Kontrahenten Hamilton.

An der Zuversicht Vettels ändert das nichts. “Ich glaube, wir sind stark, wir haben allen Grund, selbstbewusst zu sein”, beteuerte der 30-Jährige. “Ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, wir können am Sonntag zeigen, was wir können.”

Lewis Hamilton hat gute Chancen auf den WM-Titel

Seine starke Form will Hamilton weiter unter Beweis stellen. Die ersten drei Rennen nach der Sommerpause gewann der 32-Jährige, zuletzt sicherte er sich in Malaysia mit seinem bisweilen störrischen Silberpfeil Position zwei.

“Ich will dieses Ding einfach gewinnen”, betonte Hamilton, der auf seinen vierten WM-Titel zusteuern will. “Vielleicht habe ich den Nagel schon ein bisschen eingeschlagen, ich muss aber weiter draufhauen.”

Created by 101-North Marketing in partnership with former Vice President Joe Biden’s It’s On Us organization, the three PSAs are each around one minute long. Each video features an ordinary setting in which one character uses victim-blaming behavior to excuse their problematic actions, similar to the victim-blaming actions in cases of sexual assault.

The PSAs were published earlier this month but recently got more attention when model and women’s advocate Amber Rose posted one to her Instagram.

The three clips show a wedding cake baker appreciating his newest creation, two young women perusing an art gallery and a toilet bowl salesman who gets an unlikely surprise from a customer who needs to go to the bathroom.

“Wow that is a beautiful cake. Did you make it? It looks so delicious!” the woman exclaims before taking a huge handful to eat.

When the baker, who looks absolutely horrified, asks why she would ruin his cake, the woman responds: “Oh come on. You knew what you were doing, you were the one that made it so tempting. Tahitian vanilla icing and pretty little flowers? It’s like you were begging me to taste it.”

Und die SPD?
Irgendwie scheint die SPD selbst zu spüren, dass ihre Begründung, warum sie sich einfach vom Acker macht, nicht sehr glaubwürdig ist.
Als die Linke vor vier Jahren erstmals einen Sitz mehr hatte als die Grünen, rief sich der große Taktiker Gysi zum Oppositionsführer aus.","Die Stimmen waren am 24. September kurz nach 18 Uhr noch nicht ausgezählt, da ließ die SPD ihre Wähler und die gesamte Öffentlichkeit wissen: Ihr habt uns ein so schlechtes Ergebnis beschert, dass wir uns für nichts und niemanden mehr verantwortlich fühlen. Deshalb gehen wir in die Opposition. Macht euren Dreck alleene. Basta.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Historisch schlechtes Wahlergebnis: SPD will in die Opposition gehen

Seitdem intonieren alle SPD-Größen dieselbe Melodie. Die 20,5 Prozent waren eine Absage an die Große Koalition. Deshalb werden wir auf keinen Fall eine neue eingehen. Opposition ist nicht mehr Mist, wie einst Franz Müntefering meinte, sondern sozusagen die Krönung parteipolitischer Existenz. Mit uns zieht die neue Zeit: Erst die Partei, dann der Staat.

Die SPD macht sich einfach vom Acker

Natürlich kann keine Partei gezwungen werden, in eine Regierung einzutreten, Verantwortung zu übernehmen, gegebenenfalls auch die Prügel für unpopuläre, aber unumgängliche Entscheidungen einzustecken. Auch reine Protestparteien wirken an der politischen Willensbildung mit und erfüllen insofern einen Auftrag des Grundgesetzes.

Doch es gibt eben einen Unterschied zwischen Parteien, die Wutbürger und Wutwähler einsammeln, um es den ""Altparteien"" mal so richtig zu zeigen, und Gestaltungsparteien, die Verantwortung für Staat und Gesellschaft übernehmen. Auch die Grünen und Die Linke alias PDS haben einst als Protestparteien angefangen. Heute wollen sie ganz selbstverständlich regieren.

Die AfD verkörpert den Typus der Protestpartei geradezu perfekt. Und die SPD? Die alte Volkspartei, die immer bereit war, Verantwortung zu übernehmen - schon im Kaiserreich, dann in der Weimarer Republik und schließlich in der Bundesrepublik? Die wandelt sich unter ihrem entzauberten Gottkanzler Martin Schulz zur Ohne-mich-Truppe. Die SPD macht sich einfach vom Acker.

Ja, die GroKo ist vom Wähler nicht bestätigt worden. Der Anteil der drei Parteien CDU, SPD und CSU ist von 67 Prozent im Jahr 2013 auf 53 Prozent geschrumpft. Gleichwohl: Auch jetzt verfügt Schwarz-Rot noch deutlich über mehr als die Hälfte der Sitze. Dass die GroKo also kein Mandat mehr hätte, stimmt einfach nicht.

Union hat noch mehr verloren

Die Kanzlerin sei ""die größte Verliererin"", fauchte er am Wahlabend in der Elefantenrunde. Das stimmt sogar: Der Rückgang der CDU/CSU von 41,5 auf 32,9 Prozent entspricht einem Minus von 8,6 Prozentpunkten oder 20,7 Prozent. Bei der SPD führt der Rückgang von 25,7 auf 20,5 Prozent zu einem Minus von 20,2 Prozent. Schulz hat also recht: Die Union hat noch etwas mehr verloren als seine eigene Partei.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Merkels Schröder-Moment"": Warum der CDU ein Absturz wie der SPD droht

Doch Schulz' Schlussfolgerung ist nicht nachvollziehbar. Weil die Sozialdemokraten 20,2 Prozent eingebüßt haben, haben sie angeblich kein Regierungsmandat mehr. Die CDU/CSU hingegen mit einem etwas größeren Minus von 20,7 Prozent soll und muss regieren? Wo bleibt da die Logik, Herr Schulz?

Irgendwie scheint die SPD selbst zu spüren, dass ihre Begründung, warum sie sich einfach vom Acker macht, nicht sehr glaubwürdig ist. Also wird der Vorrang der Protest-Politik vor der Verantwortungs-Politik staatspolitisch verbrämt. Es gelte, die AfD als ""Oppositionsführerin"" zu verhindern. Denn sollten Union und SPD abermals koalieren, käme diese Rolle der AfD als drittstärkster Kraft zu.

Flucht aus der Verantwortung

Das Problem ist nur: Die Geschäftsordnung des Parlaments kennt eine besondere Rolle der ""Oppositionsführerin"" gar nicht. Redezeiten und Ausschussvorsitze werden strikt nach der Größe der Fraktionen vergeben, ganz gleich, ob eine Fraktion die Regierung stützt oder gegen sie opponiert. Wer stärkste Oppositionsfraktion ist, macht sich vor allem in der Reihenfolge der Redner bemerkbar.

Auf eine Rede des Kanzlers oder der Kanzlerin darf die stärkste Oppositionsfraktion zuerst antworten; sie darf bestimmte Debatten auch eröffnen. Das bekommt außerhalb des Parlaments jedoch kaum jemand mit. Was in den Fernsehnachrichten aus dem Parlament gesendet und was in den Zeitungen berichtet wird, bestimmt sich nie nach der Reihenfolge der Redner.

""Oppositionsführer"", das ist in gewisser Weise eine Erfindung von Gregor Gysi. Als die Linke vor vier Jahren erstmals einen Sitz mehr hatte als die Grünen, rief sich der große Taktiker Gysi zum Oppositionsführer aus. Er füllte diese Rolle auch aus. Aber nicht dank seines Status, sondern weil er einer der besten Redner unter der Reichstagskuppel war und ist.

Seine beiden Nachfolger an der Spitze der Linke-Fraktion, Sahra Wagenknecht und Dietmar Bartsch, fielen da weniger auf - auch wenn sie gelegentlich direkt auf Angela Merkel antworten konnten.

Da mögen Martin Schulz und Genossen erzählen was sie wollen: Ihr Drang in die Opposition ist eine Flucht aus der Verantwortung. Mit dem Kampf gegen „die Nazis"", wie Schulz die Auseinandersetzung mit der AfD nennt, hat das nichts zu tun. Der gescheiterte Kanzlerkandidat Schulz will seine Position als SPD-Vorsitzender retten.

Sein Dreiklang lautet so: Erstens die Person, zweitens die Partei, drittens das Land. Das sind neue Töne.

UTTAR PRADESH-- A 30-year-old woman was gang raped by four men in front of her husband and infant son in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, police said on Saturday.

The criminals intercepted the family which was on a bike on a deserted stretch of road and dragged them to a sugarcane field. They tied her husband to a tree and threatened to harm their child if they raised an alarm, the victim told the police.

They then reportedly took turns to rape the woman.

The attack took place when the victim and her family was on their way back from a doctor's clinic after a medical check up of their child.

Farmers from a nearby field heard their cries for help and came to their rescue but the four men had escaped by then.

JUSTICE - Le parquet national financier (PNF) requiert le renvoi devant un tribunal correctionnel de l'ancien président Nicolas Sarkozy ainsi que de son avocat et d'un ex-magistrat dans l'affaire dite des écoutes, a révélé ce vendredi 6 octobre le quotidien Le Parisien.

Selon le journal, le parquet réclame un procès contre l'ancien chef de l'Etat pour ""corruption, trafic d'influence et recel de violation du secret professionnel"". Il demande également le renvoi de son avocat Thierry Herzog et de l'avocat général, désormais à la retraite, Gilbert Azibert, également mis en examen dans ce dossier ouvert il y a plus de trois ans.

La procureur Eliane Houlette a signé jeudi ce réquisitoire, qui n'a pas encore été notifié aux principaux intéressés, affirme Le Parisien. Il revient désormais aux juges d'instruction de prendre leur décision.

""Force est de constater que le réquisitoire a été diffusé dans la presse avant même d'avoir été porté à la connaissance des parties"", ont réagi les avocats de l'ancien président, Jacqueline Laffont et Pierre Haïk, auprès de l'AFP. ""C'est assez regrettable et cocasse dans une procédure dans laquelle des violations du secret de l'enquête et de l'instruction ont été reprochées"", ont-ils ajouté.

Nicolas Sarkozy, déjà renvoyé devant le tribunal dans une autre affaire, est soupçonné dans ce dossier d'avoir tenté d'obtenir en 2014, via son avocat Thierry Herzog, des informations secrètes auprès d'un haut magistrat de la Cour de cassation, Gilbert Azibert, dans une procédure où il demandait la restitution de ses agendas saisis dans l'affaire Bettencourt. Une affaire qui s'est soldée pour lui par un non-lieu en 2013.

Enquête bouclée il y a un an

A l'origine de l'affaire, des écoutes téléphoniques de l'ancien président ordonnées dans une autre enquête, celle sur les accusations de financement libyen de sa campagne de 2007.

Dans les conversations avec son avocat, Nicolas Sarkozy semble s'engager à intervenir en faveur du magistrat pour qu'il obtienne un poste de prestige à Monaco. Mais après avoir répété le 25 février qu'il fera cette démarche, il explique le lendemain à Thierry Herzog qu'il a finalement renoncé.

Pour les enquêteurs, ce revirement peut s'expliquer par le fait que les deux hommes viennent d'apprendre que leurs téléphones non officiels, dont celui ouvert sous le nom de Paul Bismuth, avaient été placés sur écoute.

Les deux magistrates chargées de cette instruction avaient notifié la fin de leur enquête en octobre 2016, après une longue bataille judiciaire.

Nicolas Sarkozy a été renvoyé début février devant le tribunal pour le financement illégal de sa campagne électorale de 2012, avec treize autres protagonistes de l'affaire Bygmalion. La date de leur procès n'a pas encore été fixée, des recours ayant été déposés contre l'ordonnance de renvoi qu'un seul des deux juges d'instruction à signé.

Hypochlorhydria is a familiar condition today, one caused by decreased levels of hydrochloric acid (HCl), an essential stomach or gastric acid that, under ideal conditions, performs two very significant functions in the human body. HCl initiates the breakdown of proteins that we ingest and it activates the enzyme pepsin to dissolve proteins and ultimately promote easy and proper digestion of food.

Sounds good so far — what could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot, when you consider our fast-paced world and its endless array of quick and easy packaged foods, snacks and convenient meals on the run. Hypochlorhydria is triggered in a variety of ways, including consumption of fried or processed food, foods containing gluten or dairy products, and alcohol or caffeine-based drinks. People with auto-immune conditions or food sensitivities and intolerances can be particularly vulnerable. Contributing to this condition is the simple and unfortunate fact that as we age, the body's production of HCl tends to slow down, thus making easy digestion less predictable and harder to manage.

The symptoms of hypochlorhydria? They are diverse but certainly hard to miss. They include abdominal pain, heartburn, nausea, gas, bloating, constipation and even vomiting of sour liquid known as ""water brash."" Other common symptoms include loss of appetite, offensive breath, a sense of fullness and discomfort during or after meals, and difficulty digesting fruits and vegetables. Blood tests can also reveal symptoms such as elevated serum protein or globulin, or decreased phosphorus levels.

This condition should never be ignored or left untreated.

While it might seem easy to simply dismiss these common symptoms as the occasional cost of eating on the run or paying too little attention to your diet, this condition should never be ignored or left untreated.

Reaching for an easy Band-Aid solution is not the answer

Untreated — or treated with typical Band-Aid solutions such as antacid tablets and other over-the-counter remedies — this condition can lead to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yeast overgrowth, deficiencies involving important nutrients like B12, magnesium and calcium, as well as parasites or anxiety and depression. Hypochlorhydria can also lead to an auto-immune disease, which develops when your immune system begins to attack healthy cells that it mistakenly recognizes as unhealthy. There are as many as 80 types of auto-immune diseases, many displaying similar symptoms and making them extremely difficult to diagnose.

Traditional medicine typically deals with auto-immune conditions by suppressing the immune system with the help of an array of medical experts, including a GI specialist for the stomach, neurologists for balance problems or migraines, endocrinologists for blood sugar imbalances or adrenal issues, rheumatologists for joint pain, and so on. This may be for just one patient!

Today's integrative medicine professionals are taking a different approach. Integrative medicine — which should be considered complementary rather than alternative — looks at how these systems are related, seeking to find the roots of the issue and remove the causes for all chronic conditions. This means taking a more systemic approach that transcends simply trying to manage or control individual symptoms.

It also means recognizing that one organ can and will affect another and create numerous diverse and recurring symptoms. The integrative approach uses medical testing to identify the issue, and addresses this via dietary changes and custom nutrition plans, along with supplementation, medication and even brain-based therapy for neurological compromise.

While that pain in the gut might seem temporary and easy enough to self-medicate with a simple tablet, hypochlorhydria and its implications for worsening health should be treated with great care. Being proactive with efforts to identify and treat the root causes of a condition will in turn evade the potential threat of far more serious health issues.

Unless you are royalty or Beyoncé, your children can absolutely share a nanny.
This can easily be learnt when a child has to share a nanny with a sibling.","I had a nanny for several years and she was awesome. Having someone on payroll allowed me to work from home and start my career as a parenting expert. When my kids went off to school full time, I had to let our beloved nanny go, which was difficult because she was an integral part of our family.

But sometimes there is a blurry boundary between what nannies provide in a family and our roles and responsibilities as parents. Wonderfully loved and competent nannies are desirable, but it also means we are more likely to rely on them too much.

Previously on HuffPost:

After all, the kids are having a good time and being looked after, while you're able to go about your business. But without being aware, we can accidentally slide down a slippery slope until we are so dependent on our nannies that instead of providing much needed family help, we allow the presence of a nanny to deteriorate how healthy families should function.

So, to help you avoid this, here are six signs you have fallen into the nanny dependency rabbit hole:

You're secretly jealous of the nanny

You may find yourself experiencing unpleasant feelings of jealousy because the nanny seems to be emotionally closer to your children and their friends and teachers than you are. You may begin to feel like an outsider to your own family.

This feeling, while understandable, is not healthy, so if you do feel jealous, ask yourself what can be done to get rid of these feelings in a healthy manner. It may be that you're not spending as much time with the kids as you want to, and while this is perfectly normal and fine, it may mean that you should try to spend a bit more quality time with your little ones instead of relying on the nanny to be there all the time.

Your kids aren't learning to be independent and responsible

If your school-aged children still expect someone to clear their plate from the table, or hang up their coats after they dump them on the floor, it could be that they are still reliant on the care their nanny provides.

Rather than letting this happen (after all, it's not fair for the nanny nor for the kids), as parents we should be taking this time to educate them on managing their responsibilities on their own. We all want our kids to grow up to be self-sufficient and thoughtful.

You have to consult your nanny about everything

If you have to ask for a lot personal information about your children, like what they want for their birthday, if they like chocolate or vanilla cake, and who to invite to their party, you may be a bit too dependent on the nanny. These are questions a nanny should be asking you, not the other way around.

You're debating hiring a second nanny for the baby that is due

Believe me — you do not need to have one nanny per child in the household. Unless you are royalty or Beyoncé, your children can absolutely share a nanny.

One of the most important lessons a child can learn is that when others are busy they need to be a team player and wait while other peoples' needs are being met. This can easily be learnt when a child has to share a nanny with a sibling.

It's time to re-think how much care our children really need and by whom.

You haven't done a chore with a child in tow for a long time

When exactly was the last time you were inconvenienced by the presence of your kids and didn't hand them off to the nanny? Let's face it, doing the grocery shopping is faster without a kid in tow. Yes, it's much easier to leave the kids behind and head out solo, however, we can't ditch the kids for efficiency reasons every single time you need to be out and about.

The reality is, you have kids and life doesn't run as smoothly as when you were childless — but that is what you signed up for.

The reality is, you have kids and life doesn't run as smoothly as when you were childless — but that is what you signed up for.

You haven't played with your child, had a meal with them, or been home for tuck-ins in a long time

""I can never afford to buy cheap.""

Of course, she was talking about why buying more expensive goods would last longer than cheap ones destined to break, saving her cash in the long run.

But that phrase also has important repercussions when it comes to ethical or green practice for us all right now.

And if we want to protect our planet, we need to abide by them.

Bear this in mind: According to research by the United Nation's International Resource Panel, the global population, which is set to grow by 28%, is predicted to use 71% more resources per capita by 2050.

Without urgent steps to increase efficiency, the global use of metals, biomass, minerals - such as sand and other materials - will increase from 85 to 186 billion tonnes per year by 2050.

That increased level of production isn't good for emissions, and it won't be too clever when it comes to climate change, either.

So what can we do to help?

One thing is to move away from a culture of buying cheap without questioning where the product in your hand came from - or what it's doing to the environment as a whole.

And the good news is that things are slowly changing for the better.

More and more consumers understand the consequences of their consumption habits and therefore increasingly pay attention to the responsibility of their preferred companies and the brands they use in their purchasing decisions.

The raging debates about climate change, carbon offsetting, ocean pollution, human rights and child labour has made consumers more aware of the ecological, ethical and financial insecurity of our current consumption.

And it's vital we convince more to follow suit if we're going to move to a more sustainable future.

What we're seeing in some quarters is a new 'premium consumer' - who's not afraid to spend more money on an item if they know it's been ethically sourced and ethically produced.

We want to get people pay the premium price with a big smile on their face and be proud about it.

It's an ethos companies like my own have embraced.

For us, there's a reason our products - eco-friendly underpants - command a higher price than other undies on the shelves.

The material we use is not particularly cheap because of its origin; it's made from recycled materials, including salvaged ocean plastics and by-products of the manufacturing industry.

It's labour intensive.

Yet we also want to make a product that lasts, one that sticks two fingers up to modern 'throw-away-ism' habits.

And it's our hope that as more people start using this material in their own manufacturing, the price to the consumer will come down, making it even more appealing.

Let's say no to disposable culture and fast fashion and let's start thinking about the bigger picture.

Because if we don't, we'll all ultimately shoulder the cost.

According to Breakwell, the Exploding Unicorn name came from a line in a fake Biblical book he wrote in high school. He explained: “For reasons that have been lost to time, I included a passage about unicorns filled with hydrogen. It ended with the line, ‘...and that’s where we get the saying, “It exploded like a unicorn.”’ Clearly I had too much time on my hands, but the mental image stuck.”

Through the Exploding Unicorn comedy brand, Breakwell has built up his audience with funny and honest accounts of parenting his four daughters. “When you read about my kids, you’re not really reading about my kids. You’re reading about your own children,” says Breakwell. “All kids are weird and quirky and unintentionally funny.”

James Breakwell Parents need help during the zombie apocalypse, too.

For Breakwell’s newest comedy project, he’s written a helpful book titled Only Dead on the Inside: A Parent’s Guide to Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse. The impetus behind the book was simple: “Most parenting guides are too serious, and most zombie survival guides don’t tell you what to do if you have a family,” he explains. “Only Dead on the Inside fills in that gap and combines two genres in a book no one asked for but everyone needs.” At the moment, Breakwell notes that no one who’s read the book has died in a zombie attack, so the book really offers a 100 percent survival rate.

And more good news: Breakwell also believes that being a parent is an inherent advantage during a zombie apocalypse. “The apocalypse can’t break us. As the title of the book suggests, we’re already dead on the inside,” says Breakwell.

In honor of his new book out this month, we’ve gathered some of @XplodingUnicorns funniest tweets about parenting. Enjoy, and check out his book if you’re hoping to survive any future zombie apocalypses (or just looking for a good laugh).

This proposed tax is part of his larger plan to ""urgently manage"" the evolution of robotics and technology for the sake of society. And, while this may seem like a daring statement, it's not exactly the first time it's been proposed. A handful of other leaders around the globe, including Bill Gates and the South Korean government, have quite recently raised similar points. But when broken down, is this hostility towards the evolution of technology really warranted?

Modern Fear

It's no secret that the media has had a huge part to play in the current state of automation. Since the first mention of robots hit the 24-hour news cycle, hundreds of articles have warned of a robotic takeover and an impending meltdown of society. What's usually left out of these articles, however, is the thorough research highlighting the benefits robotics and automation have on society. For example, it has been found that use of robots within manufacturing has increased labour productivity by 0.36%. While that may sound insignificant, it's key to point out that 0.36% accounts for 16% of total productivity growth between 1992 and 2007. And while robotisation has traditionally been adopted by financial and manufacturing sectors, its contribution is not limited to these particular verticals. For example, a report by London's Centre for Economic Research shows that contrary to popular belief, robots have been a huge driver of productivity and economic growth within most markets. This is due to the fact that robots have been able to successful integrate within a number of professions, eliminating the costs, risks and wasted time associated with manual tasks. Yet robots still seem to be the victim of fear mongering rhetoric within the media, mainly due to one particular topic--the dissolution of jobs.

The Question of Employment

There is no denying that with the introduction of robots comes a slight shift in the overall employment landscape. With that said, it's unfair to suggest that automation will be the be all and end all of the job market. As a society, we've been through this before. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, the entire job market went into a frenzy, leaving about half of workers wondering what to do next. But with time came great change. The job market rapidly began to evolve in conjunction with technology, resulting in the creation of jobs that had never even existed before.

While it's difficult to predict the exact outcome, it seems as if history is due to repeat itself. Britain's unemployment rate is currently at a 42-year low, showing that regardless of the increase in automation, jobs seem to be largely unaffected. Luckily, this seems to be a direct representation of the future. According to a recent report by PWC, it's predicted that AI and robotics will both create new jobs, specifically in the digital technology area. These new jobs will generate additional wealth and spending that will then support additional jobs of existing kinds, primarily in sectors that are historically harder to automate.

Arguing Against Robot Tax

In comparison to other leading nations, the U.K unfortunately still slightly lags behind when it comes to robotisation and AI. And while this may be due to our modern fear of the robotic revolution, it's ultimately a dangerous game to play. In order to stay competitive within the global economy, it's extremely important to put an emphasis on the future of technology and innovation. Instead of shying away from what we're uncomfortable with, we should be focusing on where to go next.

Continuous innovation is an essential part of a robust economy. Yes, without a doubt, technology will shift our lives as we know it today. But, why should we approach this change with fear? Measures such as a ""Robot Tax"" are nothing more than a step backwards when it comes to productivity and the overall well-being of society. As a forward thinking society, we have a huge amount of opportunity to utilise this innovative technology to create positive change, not only when it comes to supporting the economy, but to create new channels for society that we may not reach otherwise.",Rethinking The Robot Tax,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/neil-kinson/rethinking-the-robot-tax_b_18192200.html

Erneuerbare Stromquellen? Einhalt dem Klimawandel? Themen, von denen US-Präsident Donald Trump nichts hält. Im Gegenteil: Es scheint, als sei das Land kurz davor, sich in eine stinkende, rußige Hölle zu verwandeln. Schließlich hat Trump im Juni das Pariser Klimaabkommen aufgekündigt und Förderungen für fossile Energiequellen wie die Kohle versprochen.

Das aber bedeutet nicht, dass die USA in Sachen grüne Energie rückständig wären. Tatsächlich bahnt das Land den Weg für erneuerbare Energien – an den Vorstellungen des Präsidenten vorbei.

Der Ruf des Geldes

Wie das geht? Die Antwort ist das Zitat eines früheren amerikanischen Präsidenten: „It’s the economy, stupid“, also: „Es geht um die Wirtschaft, Dummkopf“. Erneuerbare Energien sind ein Milliardengeschäft. Die Solarindustrie etwa schafft Arbeitsplätze 17-mal schneller als der Rest der Wirtschaft. Mittlerweile beschäftigt sie in den USA 370.000 Menschen – mehr als doppelt so viele wie der Kohlesektor. Schneller wachsen die Photovoltaik-Industrien nur in China und Japan. Durch den rasanten Zuwachs sind auch für amerikanische Firmen die Einkaufspreise gefallen – um mehr als die Hälfte seit 2008.

Zugleich wird Windkraft in den USA zu einer der günstigsten Energieformen, die es gibt. Derzeit wird im Schnitt alle 2,4 Stunden ein neues Windrad in Betrieb genommen. In den kommenden Jahren soll Wind die Wasserkraft als größte erneuerbare Energiequelle ablösen.

Im Bundesstaat Iowa stammen 35% der Energie aus Windkraft, vorn mit dabei sind auch Kansas, North und South Dakota. Überraschend daran: Diese Staaten sind in der Hand der Republikaner – die für grüne Politik notorisch wenig übrighaben. Außer dadurch lassen sich Geld und Jobs machen. Da in den USA noch mehr als 181 Millionen Hektar darauf warten, mit Windrädern bebaut zu werden, kann der Geschäftszweig noch lange Zeit weiterwachsen.

Erneuerbare Meilensteine

Der Boom bei Solar- und Windkraft bewegt etwas. Die Studie einer US-Umweltbehörde hat in diesem Jahr belegt, dass Strom aus nachhaltigen Quellen erstmals die Marke von zehn Prozent beim Anteil der US-Energieproduktion überschritten hat. Klar, im Vergleich zu Europa ist das verschwindend wenig. Vorreiter auf dem alten Kontinent sind Schweden, Norwegen, Dänemark – und wir in Deutschland. An einem Tag im April dieses Jahres stieg hierzulande der Anteil der erneuerbaren Energien auf satte 85 Prozent – erzeugt aus Wind, Sonne, Biomasse und Wasser.

Ein US-Staat ist den europäischen Verhältnissen aber stark auf den Fersen: Kalifornien. Im Mai dieses Jahres waren 80 Prozent des erzeugten Stroms aus erneuerbaren Quellen. Wind- und Solarkraft gibt es hier reichlich. Hinzu kommen die Tech-Konzerne, die sich für Innovationen engagieren. Kalifornien ist die Blaupause für grüne Energie in den USA. Die ganze Nation soll einer Studie zufolge im Jahr 2050 soweit sein.

Zudem eröffnen sich weitere Marktnischen: Aus den erneuerbaren Quellen fallen erhebliche Strommengen an. Die muss das Netz auch verkraften können – eine Stromleitung muss man sich nämlich wie eine Autobahn vorstellen, auf der es zu Spitzenzeiten eng wird. Darum muss der Strom gespeichert werden. In diesem Feld wollen sich viele Firmen etablieren.

In Kalifornien stimmen auch die politischen Rahmenbedingungen. Viele Bürgermeister sind begeistert und gehen voran – etwa mit Projekten wie dem ÖPNV-System BART in San Francisco, das bis 2045 komplett mit sauberer Energie betrieben werden soll. Und in Los Angeles soll bis 2020 ein Drittel sämtlicher Energie grün sein.

Manche Städte wollen noch weiter gehen. Im Juni einigten sich mehr als 250 Bürgermeister auf einer Konferenz in Miami Beach darauf, ihre Städte bis 2035 vollständig aus erneuerbaren Energien zu speisen.

Ein ambitioniertes Ziel. Wichtig ist, dass der Wille da ist. Beispiel Las Vegas: Die Glücksspielstadt ist notorisch für Exzesse. Aber Laternen, Parks, Feuerwachen, Gemeindezentren und Regierungsgebäude werden vollständig mit grünem Strom betrieben. Das deutlich größere Chicago will bis 2025 an dem Punkt sein. New York will bis 2030 die Hälfte seines Bedarfs aus sauberer Quelle decken.

Zukunftssicher

Klar ist: Donald Trump hat die Energieindustrie seines Landes nicht verstanden. Er mag viel darüber reden, dass der Klimawandel ein Mythos ist oder Pläne für eine Wiederbelebung der fossilen Energie schmieden – aber gleichzeitig kümmert sich sein Land darum, in eine Zukunft mit sauberer Energie zu starten.

Im Vergleich mit Europa sind die Vereinigten Staaten noch im Hintertreffen. Aber: Das Land ist für seinen Willen, die weltweite Nummer eins zu werden, bekannt. In einigen Jahrzehnten könnte es soweit sein. Es ist eine ganz andere Interpretation der Populisten-Parole „America First“ – auf eine Weise, bei der jeder gewinnt.",Dieses Land ist Weltmeister der grünen Energie,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2017/09/05/dieses-land-ist-weltmeister-der-gruenen-energie_n_17910314.html#comments

Cook your own fresh meals where possible and use herbs and spices for flavour.","We know foods like chips, pretzels and deli meats contain high levels of salt, but many people would be surprised to know sodium is lurking in unsuspecting items like bread, pasta sauce and salad dressing.

The most recent shocking salt discovery are ready meals found on the supermarket shelves, fridges and freezers, such as mac and cheese, noodle dishes and curries.

As part of the Unpack The Salt Campaign led by the Heart Foundation and VicHealth, The George Institute analysed nearly 1,500 ready meals from Woolworths, Coles, ALDI and IGA, and found some contained almost a whole day's worth of salt in just one serve. The average ready meal from the supermarket freezer, fridge and shelf contains 50 percent of an adult's recommended daily salt intake.

Seeing as convenience/ready meals are a booming industry (currently worth $900 million), this is a huge health worry.

To find out the supermarket meals containing the highest (and lowest) amount of salt, HuffPost Australia spoke to Clare Farrand, The George Institute's public health nutritionist and senior project manager for Salt Reduction.

Salt is found in a vast amount of foods and can add up quickly across the day.

Why is too much salt dangerous?

""At the moment we're all eating too much salt around the world,"" Farrand told HuffPost Australia. ""There's a global target that we shouldn't eat any more than five grams of salt per day. In Australia we're eating about double this.

""Salt increases our blood pressure and this puts us at increased risk of stroke, heart attack and heart disease. These are called cardiovascular diseases which are the biggest killer worldwide.""

The reason salt is a particular concern is there are no symptoms for high blood pressure, so you don't know you have the condition unless you get your blood pressure checked regularly.

Why is salt added to food?

Although salt is an effective preservative, the main reason food manufacturers add salt is to make food more tasty.

""This amount of salt isn't needed for preservative and texture. The amount of salt put in these meals is designed to improve or mask the taste,"" Farrand said.

""We have a drive to want to eat salt, and the more salt we eat the more we crave. Food manufacturers add lots of salt to food because it increases our drive to eat more of these foods. It hits those pleasure centres in our brain, much like sugar does.""

What are the saltiest (and least salty) supermarket meals?

In the study the researchers looked at the highest and lowest salt content within the three ready meal categories: frozen, chilled and shelf.

""The results of our survey show the amount of ready meals in the store had more than doubled in the last seven years, and that ready meals are packed with salt,"" Farrand said.

""The average ready meal contains about half of our daily recommended maximum salt intake, and that's just in one meal -- we usually have three meals a day so this would certainly push us over our daily recommended limit. Even more staggering is some of the ready meals we surveyed contained an entire day's worth of salt in a single meal.

""These meals don't necessarily taste salty so many people aren't aware of how much salt the product really contains.""

It's important to note this study analysed the salt content, not the overall nutrition, in ready meals.

Cook your own fresh meals where possible and use herbs and spices for flavour.

Tips for reducing salt intake

1. Read the labels. Choose lower salt options by comparing the sodium content in the 'per 100g' column on the nutrition information panel. Low salt/sodium is considered to be less than 130mg per 100 grams. Up to 400mg is an 'okay' option;

2. Eat more fresh foods and reduce intake of processed and packaged foods;

3. Use herbs and spices for flavour instead of relying on salt when cooking at home;

4. Use the FoodSwitch app when food shopping to scan and find food products with lower sodium content.",These Supermarket Meals Contain A Whole Day's Worth Of Salt,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/05/these-supermarket-meals-contain-a-whole-days-worth-of-salt_a_23231817/

Einer seiner Peiniger wurde nun in Deutschland verurteilt

Und Campeau erzählt eindringlich, wie er in Gefangenschaft für sein Leben kämpfte

Im Video-Interview mit der HuffPost erklärt er, warum aber nicht alles getan hätte, um seine Haut zu retten

Sie hatten ihn gefangen. Eingesperrt. Gequält. Aber seine Seele, die sollten sie nie bekommen. Das hatte sich Carl Campeau geschworen.

Es war der 17. Februar 2013 als der UN-Jurist aus Kanada das Camp südwestlich von Damaskus verließ, von dem aus die Vereinten Nationen die Golanhöhen überwachen. Er wollte zu einem Termin in die syrische Hauptstadt. Dinge klären, die man nicht am Telefon bespricht oder mailt. Und zu einem Physiotherapeuten, der sich um sein frisch operiertes Knie kümmern sollte.

Leben und sterben lagen da schon sehr nahe beieinander in Syrien. Das Camp war zwar noch nicht von Al-Qaida-nahen Rebellen überrannt. Aber in der Region kämpfte das Assad-Regime gegen die Rebellen. Und die Rebellen gegen wieder andere Rebellen.

Campeaus Frau, selbst Syrerin, hatte ihn angefleht, die Fahrt nach Damaskus nicht anzutreten. Aber Campeau arbeitet seit vielen Jahren in Krisengebieten. Angehörige zu beruhigen, das gehört zum Job, findet er. Ein gepanzerter Wagen war keiner frei, also nahm Campeau ein normales Auto, Helm und schusssichere Weste, und fuhr los.

In einem Vorort der syrischen Hauptstadt, Khan al-Shih, stoppten ihn zwei Männer, Kämpfer der islamistischen Al-Nusra-Front, die Gewehre im Anschlag. Sie zerrten ihn ums Auto, zwangen in auf den Rücksitz, karrten ihn zu einer Villa, die sie besetzt hatten. Campeaus dachte, sie würden ihn jetzt umbringen. (Wie er die Entführung erlebt hat, könnt ihr hier in einem Buchauszug lesen.)

Einer der Dschihadisten wurde nun in Deutschland verurteilt

Heute ist Campeau 53 und versucht, das Erlebte zu verarbeiten. Den Zwang, zum Islam zu konvertieren. Acht Monate Angst bis zu seiner Flucht. Die Erfahrung, dass weder der Arbeitgeber noch der Heimatstaat Lösegeld zahlen wollten, dass sie auch sonst kaum halfen. Das Wissen, dass die Gefahr für ihn heute kleiner geworden ist – aber nicht vorbei.

Einer der vielen Dschihadisten, mit denen Campeau während seiner Geiselhaft zu tun hatte, kam als Flüchtling nach Deutschland. Vor drei Wochen hat das Oberlandesgericht Suliman al S. verurteilt, zu drei Jahren und sechs Monaten Gefängnis. Die Bundesanwaltschaft hatte sieben Jahre gefordert. Nach ihren Angaben war es das erste Mal, dass in Deutschland ein Flüchtling wegen Kriegsverbrechen vor Gericht stand.

Suliman al-S. sitzt schon seit Anfang 2016 in Untersuchungshaft, bei guter Führung könnte er bald wieder frei kommen. Außer, die Bundesanwaltschaft, die in Revision gehen will, hat Erfolg.

Die Angst vor Rache

Wer Campeau, markante Brille, schwarzer Rollkragenpulli, an diesem windigen Herbsttag in München trifft, der lernt einen Menschen kennen, der sich wegen des Prozesses sorgt.

Nicht weil er das Urteil für zu milde hält. Sondern weil er fürchtet, dass Suliman al-S. sich weiter radikalisieren und rächen wird, wenn er noch länger eingesperrt bleibt. ""An mir, meiner Familie oder der deutschen Gesellschaft.""

Nach Syrien abschieben, sagt der Jurist, wird Deutschland Suliman al-S. nicht können. Das könnte dessen Tod bedeuten. Und das würde er auch nicht wollen, sagt Campeau.

Er weiß, dass der Versuch, ehemalige Dschihadisten zu resozialisieren, teuer wird. Es ist der Versuch, ""Zeitbomben"", wie er sie nennt, zu entschärfen. Vor allem, wenn sie wie Suliman al-S. auch von Deutschland aus noch Kontakt gehalten haben zu ihren Kumpanen, wie Campeau sagt.

Aber er findet, die Gesellschaft habe keine andere Wahl, als ""gute Imame"" zu suchen, die die Dschihadisten religiös aufklären. Und Psychiater zu bezahlen, die ihnen helfen, ihre eigenen Traumata aufzuarbeiten.

Campeau hält nich alle seiner Entführer für schlechte Menschen

Der Vater von inzwischen drei Kindern sucht, tastet nach Worten, wenn er über seine Entführer spricht oder schreibt. Überhaupt, wenn er über Menschen urteilen soll.

Denn eines will er unbedingt vermeiden: Er will nicht in so eine Spirale des Hasses geraten wie viele seiner Entführer. Er wollte nie so undifferenziert urteilen wie viele von ihnen.

""Wenn ich Abneigung oder Hass empfinde, dann nicht so sehr gegen meine Kidnapper, sondern gegen ihre Ideologie"", sagt er. ""Es ist eine totalitäre Ideologie.""

Nicht alle seiner Entführer seien schlechte Menschen. ""Es gibt Gründe, warum sie in diese Sache hineingeraten sind und manchmal gute Gründe.""

Campeau erzählt von einem jungen Mann, der von Soldaten gefangen und drei Monate jeden Tag gefoltert wurde, bevor er sich den Rebellen anschloss. Er findet die Reaktion nachvollziehbar. Rebellion an sich sei auch nicht das Problem. ""Aber man muss sich fragen, was diese Rebellion erreichen will.""

Junge Menschen aber hätten oft nicht die Weisheit, das zu sehen.

Gratwanderung zwischen Selbstaufgabe und Hass

Was der Jurist da macht, ist eine schwierige Gratwanderung. Eine auf einem Grat zwischen Abgründen aus Stockholm-Syndrom und Islamhass.

Und nicht immer gelingt Campeau das. In seinem Buch ""Meine Seele kriegt ihr nie"" schreibt er, dass er immer wieder Sätze durchstreichen musste, in denen die Gefühle stärker wurden als der Verstand. Aber diese ""intellektuelle Faulheit"", wie er es nennt, wollte und will er sich nicht gestatten.

Denn dann, so empfindet er es, hätten seine Kidnapper gewonnen. Sie hätten nicht nur acht Monate die Gewalt über seinen Körper gehabt, sondern lebenslang über seine Seele.

""Ich hätte keinen Unschuldigen getötet""

""Ich fragte mich nicht nur einmal, wer hier eigentlich in Wahrheit der Gefangene war. Inzwischen scheint mir die Antwort klar"", schreibt er in seinem Buch über die Entführung.

""Wenn sie mich gezwungen hätten, einen Unschuldigen zu töten oder eine Frau zu vergewaltigen, das hätte ich nicht getan, nur um meine Haut zu retten"", sagt er im Gespräch mit der HuffPost. Denn mit so einer Tat hätte er immer leben müssen. ""Und wenn man an das Leben nach dem Tod glaubt, dann könnte es da auch Konsequenzen geben.""

Die verzweifelte Hoffnung auf Hilfe, wenn schon nicht von Menschen, dann vom Erzengel

Campeau hält sich nicht für einen besonders religiösen Menschen. Aber in der Verzweiflung fing er an zu beten. ""Ich dachte mir, was habe ich zu verlieren?""

Tatsächlich hätte er sein Leben verloren, wenn die Entführer gemerkt hätten, zu wem er da betete.

Aber Campeau bat den Erzengel Michael, er möge ihm die Flucht ermöglichen.

Am 16. Oktober, einem hohen muslimischen Feiertag, vergaßen die Entführer dann tatsächlich, die Tür zu seinem Zimmer abzusperren und verschwanden zum Sporttraining. Campeau floh zu Fuß durch die zerbombten, zerschossenen Straßen, rannte und wanderte Stunden, bis er auf Soldaten des Regimes traf, die ihn erst für einen Spion hielten. Erst nach langen Befragungen ließen sie ihn frei.

""Es ist egal, ob der Erzengel eine Idee oder Wirklichkeit ist, denn es hat mir geholfen, ihn um Hilfe zu bitten"", sagt Campeau. ""Es hat mir Hoffnung gegeben.""

Als der 53-Jährige diese Sätze gesagt hat, bleibt es eine kurze Weile still im Raum. So beherrscht er über seine Erfahrungen spricht, so ruhig, so sehr quält ihn die Erinnerung, die ihm noch immer den Schlaf raubt. Und die jetzt seine Augen feucht werden lässt.

""Ich hätte ihn gern gefragt, ob es ihm gut geht""

Er weiß nicht, was passiert ist, nachdem er geflohen ist. Wann seine Entführer es gemerkt haben, ob sie ihm auf den Fersen waren.

Er hat nach seiner Rückkehr jedoch eine Anfrage über Facebook bekommen. Er vermutet, dass sie von einem der Entführer ist, wohl von einem, den er als einen der ""guten"" in Erinnerung hat. ""Ich hätte ihn gern gefragt, ob es ihm gut geht"", sagt Campeau. Aber aus Sicherheitsgründen ließ er es bleiben.

Um der Sicherheit willen darf die Öffentlichkeit auch nicht wissen, wo die UN ihn jetzt eingesetzt haben.

Seine Seele, die haben sie wohl nicht bekommen

Er arbeitet noch immer für die Organisation, die ihn nach seiner Einschätzung so hängen ließ, als sein Leben davon abhing. Die zuließ, dass eine Ehefrau maßgeblich die Verhandlungen führen musste mit Entführern und Behörden.

Selbst der Richter, der Suliman al-S. in Stuttgart verurteilte, machte den UN und dem kanadischen Geheimdienst laut der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"" massive Vorwürfe: ""Man mag es kaum glauben, aber die UN hat kein Interesse daran gezeigt, die Entführung ihres Mitarbeiters aufzuklären“, so Richter Anderer.

Am 17. Oktober 2013, einen Tag nach der Flucht, übergibt der syrische Vize-Außenminister Faisal al-Makdad (r.) Campeau (M.) in die Obhut an den UN-Vertreter Yacoub El Hillo. Foto: Reuters.

""Ich arbeite noch dort, weil ich eine Familie habe und eine Job brauche. Und weil ich an die Ideale der UN glaube, daran, dass man die Menschen unterstützen und Staaten ein Diskussionsforum bieten muss.""

Wer Campeau so zuhört, der hört einen ebenso rationalen wie verletzlichen Menschen, der viel Dinge erlebt hat, die niemand jemals hätte erleben sollen. Aber er hört eben immer noch einen Menschen. Einen, dessen Seele die Entführer verwundet haben. Aber bestimmt nicht besiegt.

Vor allem dann, wenn man sich vorstellt, dass LINKS und RECHTS so neu erstarkt dann irgendwann auf der Straße aufeinanderprallen. Die AfD forderte unlängst ja die Bewaffnung eines jeden Bürgers und nicht Wenige gehen davon aus, dass am 6. Juli am Hamburg Fischmarkt sogar die Aufstandsbekämpfung geprobt, respektive trainiert wurde - und zwar am lebenden Objekt.

Eine Zusammenfassung von Max Bryan

Im vorangegangenen Bericht zur ""WELCOME TO HELL""-Demo sahen wir, wie die Versammlung am 6. Juli mit unbilliger Härte aufgelöst wurde und warum die Gesamteinsatzleitung sich dafür explizit den Raum an der Flutschutzmauer aussuchte, um die Vermummten dort zu stellen.

Hier bitte lesen: http://m.huffpost.com/de/entry/17848600

Im Teil 2 der Geschichte geht es noch einmal explizit um die Folgen der Ereignisse inklusive dramatischer Bilder, die zeigen, wie speziell die Hamburger Polizei gezielt auch gegen unvermummte, eher bunt gekleidete Personen vorging, wie Menschen geknüppelt und mit Füßen getreten wurden, von denen keinerlei Gefahr ausging.

Treibjagd am Hamburger Fischmarkt

Es ist kurz nach 20 Uhr und die versprengten Gruppen, die über die cirka 2 Meter hohe Flutschutzmauer fliehen konnten, begaben sich in die Seitenstraßen links vom Fischmarkt und sammelten sich am Ausgangsort der Demo erneut, dort wo der Aufzug ursprünglich mal begann. Dort sichtbar werden ziemlich unschöne Bilder einer regelrechten Treibjagd gegen kleinere Gruppen Versammlungsteilnehmer. Darunter sehr viele bunt gekleidete Personen, von denen absolut keine Gewalt ausging, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF12Fsfn2ao&t=9m33s

Im Zuge dieses Vormarsches der Polizei wurde ein eindeutig unvermummter Mann von der Polizei geprügelt.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF12Fsfn2ao&t=10m00s

Zwei Ecken weiter - unweit der Szenerie - ein ganz ähnliches Bild:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewNZIzw6mKE&t=4m24s

Polizisten stürmen auf Kommando eine Gruppe Demonstranten und prügeln grundlos auf sie ein.



6. Juli - 20:20 Uhr - die Polizei greift einen völlig friedlichen Demozug an

Auch dieses Vorgehen der Einsatzkräfte gehört untersucht. Gewalt ging von diesen Menschen nämlich keine aus. Einziger Aggressor war wieder mal die Polizei selbst, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen.



Wilde Knüppelei gegen friedliche Demonstranten

Rüde Polizeigewalt

Der Mann hinter der Kamera, der dieses Video gemacht hat, kommnentierte diesen Moment mit folgenden Worten: ""Die Polizei stürmt die Demo - so was Krankes habe ich auch noch nicht gesehen"".



Quelle: AbendblattTV - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF12Fsfn2ao&t=12m50s

Schaut man das Video ein paar Minuten länger, sieht man auch die obligatorischen Steine- und Flaschenwerfer - ABER: Man darf nicht vergessen, wie die Schlacht mal begann, nämlich mit einer gewaltsamen Auflösung der Demo 100 Meter weiter vorne und das nur, weil die Leute vermummt waren. Der Spiegel-Autor Markus Feldenkirchen schrieb dazu: ""Es ist falsch, das harmlosere Vergehen zu ahnden, das schlimmere aber nicht"". Der Kollege bezog sich dabei auf einen Vorfall im thüringischen Themar, wo eine Horde Rechsradikaler auf einem Konzert ungestört den Hitlergruß zeigen konnten und die Polizei weder einschritt noch unterband.



https://magazin.spiegel.de/SP/2017/30/152270397/index.html?utm_source=spon&utm_campaign=centerpage



Spiegel-Autor kritisiert das zweierlei Maß in Hinblick auf linke und rechte Straftäter

Was dort in Themar passierte, war laut Schilderung der Beobachter um Klassen schlimmer, als sich in Hamburg nur vermummt in die Reihen eines schwarzen Blocks zu stellen und darauf zu warten, dass die Demo losläuft. Ich kann auch verstehen, dass diese Vermummung nicht für Jedermann ""schick"" ist, aber sie ist in keinem Fall schlimmer als das, was bei Nazi-Aufläufen regelmäßig von der Polizei geduldet wird und wer glaubt, vermummte Linke in einem solchen Block stellen und angreifen zu können, ohne dass die sich wehren (mit Steinen und Flaschen), hat die Dynamik solcher Exzesse weder verstanden noch durchdrungen.

Augenzeuge berichtet

Auch Andreas Gerhold, Abgeordneter der PIRATEN im Bezirk Hamburg-Mitte war am 6. Juli vor Ort und berichtet Folgendes: ""Meiner Meinung nach ist das ganz klar ein rechtswidriger Polizeieinsatz gewesen, ich konnte das recht gut beobachten. Es gibt jede Menge Livestreams - Live Video Dokumentationen - anhand derer man die Situation sehr gut nachvollziehen kann und ich habe schon mit Leuten - die an verschiedenen Stellen Augenzeuge waren - die Situation rekonstruiert - was wann zu welchem Zeitpunkt passiert ist und man muss sagen, die Polizei ist da sehr unmittelbar reingegangen mit dem Ziel den Kopf der Demo abzutrennen. Das ist dann aber gründlich schief gegangen. Es waren Leute dort plötzlich in Lebensgefahr. Es gab Situation auf Treppen - wo Leute die Treppen runtergefallen sind - andere sind hinterher gestürmt und es gab dort Situationen, wo Menschen auf scheinbar niedrige Mauern geklettert sind - die auf der anderen Seite aber 3 Meter runter gehen. Es hätte da so viel mehr passieren können, dass Menschen zu Schaden oder gar zu Tode kommen, das war ein absolut unverantwortlicher Einsatz"" - berichtet Gerhold.

Andreas Gerhold

Die Demo sei für ""militante Einsätze"" auch nicht vorgesehen gewesen, ergänzt der Parlamentarier. ""Der Frontblock war sehr diszipliniert - keine Provokation - keine Gewalt - da flog überhaupt nichts - nicht ein Böller - gar nichts - die waren super diszipliniert und auch die Aufforderung, dass dem nicht nachgekommen sei - sich zu entmummen - stimmt nicht. Viele sind der Aufforderung nachgekommen. Einzelne auch nicht. Aber jeder kann sich die Videos anschauen und man wird sehen, wie wenig wirklich Vermummte da sind.""

Zwar habe man Sonnenbrillen und Kapuzen aufgehabt, aber die seien nicht strafbar. Alles bis Unterlippe sei erlaubt und nur sehr Wenige hatten überhaupt noch Tücher vor dem Mund oder gar Skimasken auf und im übrigen vermumme sich ""auch die Polizei und auch da geschehen Straftaten, deren Täter nicht mal ermittelbar sind"", weshalb Gerhold auch eine Kennzeichnungspflicht fordere, damit die Identifizierbarkeit der Beamten gegeben sei. Es müsse auch da niemand sein Gesicht zeigen, aber man muss rückschließen können, welcher Beamte was gemacht hat - anhand seiner Nummer auf der Jacke.



Ein Beamter der Hamburger Polizei in eindeutiger Pose

Mit Füßen getreten

Auffällig in dem Zusammenhang ist, dass in dem Einsatz wie hier geschildert - wo am Boden liegende Demonstranten noch getreten wurden - die Beamten KEINE NUMMER trugen. Nur das Wappen auf der Jacke am Arm zeigte, dass sie zur Hamburger Polizei gehören.

Angesichts dieser Bilder - und gerade erst wurde ja ein Pole zu 6 Monaten Gefängnis auf Bewährung verurteilt, nur weil er ein unerlaubtes Pfefferspray dabei hatte. Bei dieser Härte der Strafe stellt sich natürlich die Frage, ob auch die prügelnden Polizisten (es liegen mehr als 70 Anzeigen vor) ebenso hart bestraft werden, wie die Demonstranten, wenn sie sich denn daneben benommen haben?

Gleiches Recht für Alle

Es geht um GERECHTIGKEIT. Zu Unrecht prügelnde Polizisten müssen genauso hart bestraft werden wie die Steine- und Flaschenwerfer. Auf beiden Seiten gab es Straftaten - nur eine Seite (die der Demonstranten) wurde bislang aber bestraft. Das muss sich ändern.

Eine friedliche Sitzblockade zum Beispiel mit rüder Gewalt aufzulösen ist rechtswidrig. Solange keine Gefahr von den Demonstranten ausgeht, darf die Polizei weder pfeffern, knüppeln noch treten. Letzteres tut sie aber immer wieder - wie auch am 6. Juli an der Kreuzung zum Hamburger Fischmarkt, wie diese Aufnahmen belegen.

Widerstandsrecht

Eine Gruppe Jugendlicher setzte sich auf die Straße und die Hamburger Polizei griff hart durch. Wendet zweifelhafte Polizeigriffe an und tritt mit Füßen nach den am Boden sitzenden - und später auch liegenden Demonstranten. Ist das noch rechtens?



""Wir sind friedlich, was seid ihr"", singt eine Gruppe Sitzblockierer am 6. Juli gegen 20:30 Uhr ein Appell, der ungehört bleibt. Trotz des an dieser Stelle friedlichen Protestes griff die Polizei hart durch.



Man könnte die Sitzblockierer ja lehrbuch-mäßig wegtragen, so wie das am Morgen des 7. Juli an der Schwanenwik-Brücke geschah. Dort verhielt sich die Polizei lehrbuch-mäßig und warum? Weil 8 Kameras und Journalisten beobachteten, was sie taten und schon hielt die Polizei sich zurück.

Die Macht der Presse

Anders am 6. Juli - da waren keine großen Kameras vor Ort und schon wird rüde geprügelt. Und das noch ohne Nummer auf der Jacke.



Zweifelhafter Einsatz gegen Leute, die sich NULL wehren

Das Beispiel zeigt, dass die Polizei meist dann rüde vorgeht, wenn sie keine Konsequenzen befürchten muss - wenn keine unabhänigen Beobachter vor Ort sind. Die beiden Beispiele haben das eindrucksvoll bewiesen und gerne werden solche Szenen vom Mainstream dann auch unterschlagen, weshalb es diesen Zusatz-Blog hier auch gibt.

Keine Polizeigewalt?

Dieser Hamburger Polizist zum Beispiel tritt einen am Boden liegenden Demonstranten mit Füßen!!! Olaf Scholz beteuert dennoch, es gäbe in Hamburg ""keine Polizeigewalt"". Er bleibt der Realität entrückt - ein Trauerspiel für die Hamburger SPD.

Mehr Polizeigewalt hier: www.g20-doku.org

Auch das Fehlverhalten der Polizei muss bestraft werden, nur darum geht´s.

Bauernopfer gesucht?

Meiner Meinung nach werden mit solchen Schauprozessen wie zuletzt ganz klar Bauernopfer gesucht, die erstmal hoch bestraft werden, um Sympathisanten der Szene zu verunsichern und einzuschüchtern. Am Ende traut sich keiner mehr auf die Straße, weil selbst kleinste Vergehen hart geahndet werden. Ist das der Polizeistaat, vor dem Kritiker seit Jahren warnen?



Eine mutige Dame in roten Hosen kletterte auf diesen Räumpanzer. Pfeffern ist offenbar bequemer als sie von da runter zu holen.

Lückenhafte Aufklärung

Inzwischen tagte der Sonderausschuss zwei mal schon und viel Neues wurde dadurch nicht bekannt - im Gegenteil. Da wurden Seiten geschwärzt und Zeugen sagten ab, kommen erst gar nicht, obwohl sie vorgeladen sind. Das zeigt, wie groß das Aufklärungsinteresse von SPD und SENAT wirklich ist - es geht gegen Null.

Dennis Gladiator (CDU) kündigte gar die Einforderung eines ""PUA"" an, sollte Senat und Polizei künftig nicht besser mitarbeiten. Auch von ""Zeugenbeeinflussung"" ist die Rede, weil die an Hartmut Dudde zum Beispiel direkt gerichteten Fragen erstmal von Andy Grote beantwortet werden und dieser somit Einfluss auf die Zeugenaussage von Dudde ninmt. Das dürfe nicht sein, erklärt Christiane Schneider von den Linken.

https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article212060709/Sonderausschuss-zu-Ausschreitungen-droht-zu-platzen.html



Unzählige Belege für Gewalt gegen friedliche Demonstranten. Die Verantwortung dafür übernimmt dennoch keiner ... www.g20-doku.org

Dabei liegen die zahlreichen wie auch eklatanten Rechsbrüche offen auf dem Tisch. Es gibt massenhaft Bilder und Videos im Netz, die das unverhältnismäßige Vorgehen der Polizeiführung am 6. Juli zum Beispiel belegen. Verurteilt wurde dafür bislang niemand. ""Nur rund 2% der zur Anzeige gebrachten Fälle von Fehlverhaltens der Polizei endeten mit einer Verurteilung"", teilte ein Protestforscher letzte Woche mit.

Claude Seignolle, Laurent Lefeuvre, Comme une odeur de Diable, Mosquito.","Quand j'entends le nom de Claude Seignolle, vénérable écrivain et spécialiste du folklore qui a soufflé en juin dernier ses 100 bougies, j'ai toujours un petit frisson nostalgique. Je me revois, jeune adolescent, parcourant les rayons de la bibliothèque de Rosemont à la recherche du roman qui pourrait remplacer les Bob Morane et les Doc Savage que j'avais tout lus. Soudainement au hasard de mes pérégrinations romanesques j'ai entendu l'appel d'Histoires Maléfiques, recueil de nouvelles au titre évocateur qu'il signait. Sans le savoir, le folkloriste venait de réveiller une passion pour les nouvelles d'horreur, les légendes d'outre-tombe et la mythique collection fantastique de Marabout, qui, comme les créatures de Lovecraft, sommeillaient depuis toujours en moi. Depuis, même si je suis un peu moins l'actualité «claudeseignollesque» je lui reste toujours attaché. On n'oublie jamais son premier amour.

Le Yâble est dans la cabane

Ce premier amour pour Claude Seignolles, Laurent Lefeuvre l'a ravivé avec Comme une odeur de Diable, sa très belle adaptation bd de quelques-uns de ses contes. Même si j'en parlais avec enthousiasme à chaque fois que je rencontrais Jacques Lamontagne, un de ses grands fans, je dois avouer qu'il ne me restait que quelques souvenirs imprécis de ses écrits. Et ce sont non seulement la réminiscence de ces moments heureux partagés avec l'auteur que Lefeuvre a ressuscité, mais c'est surtout toute la richesse de sa langue qu'il m'a fait redécouvrir.

Il faut dire qu'avec le graphisme sombre du bédéiste et sa mise en page dynamique, les deux hérités de la grande époque de Tales From the Crypt et des adaptations « lovecraftiennes » d'Horacio Lalia et d'Alberto Breccia, Seignolle ne pouvait rêver d'un meilleur allié pour exprimer toute l'intelligence et la verve de ses contes nourris à la tradition millénaire.

Sous ses pinceaux et ses plumes, les légendes «seignollesques» retrouvent une nouvelle jeunesse et le soupçon d'une terrifiante tragédie fataliste que je ne percevais pas à ce moment, néophyte en fantastique que j'étais.

Loin de n'être que des objets patrimoniaux qui prennent la poussière sur les rayons tristes des bibliothèques communales françaises et qui titillent à l'occasion les touristes perdus, les chercheurs solitaires et les amateurs un peu fous du patrimoine à la Des racines et des ailes, ses contes, grâce à Lefeuvre, renouent avec cette modernité et cette pertinence qu'ils ont toujours eu mais que notre mémoire défaillante à repoussé dans ses plus profonds tréfonds tant nous étions ébahies par les promesses mirifiques des nouveaux auteurs fantastiques, qui au fond ne faisaient que répéter ce que le Périgourdin avait déjà écrit.

Un coup de maître de Laurent Lefeuvre.

À la fin de l'envoi, je touche!

Si Seignolle retrouve son droit de cité avec la bédé de Lefeuvre, on aimerait en dire autant de Joseph Conrad dont Renaud Farace vient de mettre en image son exceptionnelle nouvelle, Le duel, un récit militaire publié en 1908. On aimerait le dire, hélas, on ne peut pas. Et il ne faudrait pas penser que c'est à cause de l'adaptation de Farace, qui est une œuvre inspirante et de grande qualité, oh que non! On ne peut pas le dire tout simplement parce que le génial auteur britannique inspire depuis des lustres les plus prolifiques scénaristes, réalisateurs, bédéistes et metteurs en scène. Qui n'a pas en mémoire le puissant et troublant Heart of Darkness, librement adapté par Coppola (Apocalypse Now) et Robert Morin (Wendigo), ou encore l'excellent Lord Jim.

Conrad n'avait donc pas besoin du bédéiste zagrébois pour ramener son Duel sous les feux de la rampe, d'autant plus que Ridley Scott en avait déjà fait une très belle adaptation cinématographique. Si Conrad n'en n'avait pas besoin, nous, nous en avions pourtant besoin, tant la vision qu'en tire Farace est captivante et intelligente.

À Strasbourg, en pleine épopée napoléonienne, le lieutenant d'Hubert est chargé de mettre aux arrêts le lieutenant Féraud coupable d'avoir participé à un duel. Un geste que le bouillant militaire Gascon assimile à un affront à son honneur qui doit être lavé par le sang. Dès lors, au hasard des affections de la Grande Armée et d'un empire qui se tisse et s'effiloche, les deux hommes se retrouvent occasionnellement pour terminer ce duel constamment interrompu. Une histoire d'obsession et d'honneur dépassé et mal placé que seul un génie comme Conrad pouvait mettre en scène et qu'un talentueux bédéiste comme Farace pouvait adapter et éclairer sous un nouveau jour.

Parce que c'est exactement ce qu'il fait. Avec son trait économe, nerveux et quelques fois d'une volontaire imprécision évocatrice, le créateur redonne une dimension émotive à la nouvelle de Conrad que Ridley Scott avait moins exploité dans son film, trop préoccupé qu'il fût par la rigueur historique de la quête obsessionnelle des deux protagonistes.

Il faut dire qu'avec sa formation en psychologie et ses années comme escrimeur le bédéiste était le mieux placé pour se mettre au service de l'orgueil démesuré d'Hubert et de Féraud qui les amènent à ne vivre que pour cette ultime rencontre. Comme un Howard Carter du 9e art, Farace explore avec une précision chirurgicale et brutale les méandres les plus obscurs de leurs âmes pour comprendre ce qui nourrit cette obsession qui, comme la révolution, les dévore.

Personnages fiers, orgueilleux, fait d'un bloc, idéalistes avec leur conception poussiéreuse et personnelle de l'honneur militaire, incapables de négocier avec les petites compromissions ordinaires et les grandes inhérentes à l'exercice du pouvoir, Féraud et Hubert, tout comme le colonel Kurtz, deviennent des anachronismes ambulants dans cette fin d'empire peuplée de revanchards, d'envieux et d'opportunistes prêts à tout brader pour quelques miettes de pouvoir, de privilèges et d'avantages pécuniaires.

Une tragédie que Farace a très bien compris et qu'il traduit avec enthousiasme, dureté et brio.

In her 30 previous starts (of which she'd won 24, including the previous 20 straight), the Sydney-trained mare had never visited the course which is synonymous with Australia's most famous race, the Melbourne Cup.

And now she has. And that makes 21. And wasn't it worth the wait.

Winx had laboured a little in her three runs in Sydney since resuming from a spell in late winter. She missed the jump at her first outing, and had to make up serious ground on the leaders in her other two runs as well.

Sure, she won easily enough in the end in those races, but you had genuine reason to be worried mid-race.

Not this time. Not even a bit. Winx won the 2000m Group One Turnbull as commandingly as any race in her career, making Caulfield Cup favourite Humidor -- who ran third -- look second rate.

Winx won by six lengths with Ventura Storm second and Humidor third. Actually forget the official placings. Daylight was second. Winx really put on a show this week, showing exactly why her trainer, the canny Kiwi Chris Waller, says she's better in the anti-clockwise Melbourne way of racing.

""I'm running out of words,"" Jockey Hugh Bowman said. ""She's developed physically and mentally as she's gone on.""

Reporters are running out of words too, as are racegoers, and non-racegoers alike. There are rare times in Australian life when horse racing breaks out of its little sporting niche and enters mainstream culture.

It happens once a year at the Melbourne Cup, but otherwise, it takes an incredible horse. We've been lucky in recent years. First there was Makybe Diva, who won the third of her three straight Melbourne Cups in 2005. Then there was Black Caviar, who famously won all of her 25 races, including one at Royal Ascot when she was barely fit to race.

But this is different. This is a horse winning over a wide range of distances, and doing it in a different way each time -- sometimes from near the front, other times from stone last. It's a hell of a thing to see, and the impeccable way her trainer handles himself makes the story all the sweeter.

Pero después de que el abogado personal de Donald Trump, Marc Kasowitz, interviniera, la investigación se deshechó, según un informe de ProPublica, The New Yorker y WNYC publicado el miércoles.

Los hijos mayores del presidente estaban siendo investigados por denuncias de que usaron información falsa para atraer a posibles compradores en el hotel y desarrollo de condominios Trump SoHo. Los fiscales estaban investigando si sus acciones violaban la Ley Martin, una ley de Nueva York que prohibe dar declaraciones falsas sobre ventas de bienes raíces, y la acusación ""parecía una posibilidad real"", según el informe.

Una demanda interpuesta por los compradores de los condominios se resolvió en 2011, informó The New York Times, pero la investigación criminal de la fiscalía continuó. El acuerdo prohibió a los demandantes cooperar con la investigación del DA (Fiscal de Distrito, por sus siglas en inglés).

Kasowitz se unió al caso en la primavera de 2012. Se dirigió a la oficina de Vance en mayo para argumentar que cualquier reclamación hecha por los Trumps no equivalía a mala conducta criminal.

Tres meses después, Vance le dijo a su oficina que abandonara la investigación, según el informe, que citó a 20 fuentes familiarizadas con la investigación, registros judiciales y otros documentos públicos.

A principios de 2012, Kasowitz donó 25 mil dólares a la campaña de reelección de Vance, según el informe. Vance habría devuelto la donación justo antes de su reunión con Kasowitz.

""Yo no creía en ese momento más allá de una duda razonable de que se había cometido un crimen"", dijo Vance a los reporteros para el artículo del miércoles. ""Tuve que hacer una llamada y hice la llamada, y creo que hice la llamada correcta"". Kasowitz ""no tuvo influencia, y sus contribuciones no tuvieron influencia alguna en mi toma de decisiones en el caso"".

Kasowitz afirmó que ""nunca hizo una contribución a la campaña de nadie, incluyendo a Cy Vance, como un"" quid-pro-quo ""para nada.""

Meses después de que el fiscal abandonara la investigación, Kasowitz lanzó a Vance un recaudador de fondos y donó personalmente casi 32 mil dólares, según el informe. Él recibió otro el año siguiente por18 mil adicionales. Vance dijo que ahora planea devolver las contribuciones.

""Esta fue una investigación de dos años que nunca produjo suficiente evidencia para apoyar un procesamiento criminal"", dijo Joan Vollero, director de comunicaciones de Vance, a HuffPost en un comunicado. ""Durante la investigación, los compradores de apartamentos de lujo se revirtieron y tomaron la posición de que los vendedores no habían cometido ningún crimen contra ellos. Ningún abogado externo influyó en ninguna decisión en este asunto"".

Pour elle, le pari est plutôt réussi: la galette de légumes n'a aucune prétention à remplacer un steak en imitant son goût mais apporte un vrai plus à ce burger. Et surtout, la sauce au pesto rosso est délicieuse. Petit bémol: l'emmental, qui est mélangé à la galette de légumes, ne se fait pas trop sentir. Et l'ensemble, sans la sauce, serait très compact voire un peu sec. Mais sans aucun doute, c'est un burger qu'on aimerait manger à nouveau.

Si la sauce a aussi eu son petit succès, elle préférerait de très loin déguster la galette de légumes dans un autre plat qu'un burger.

Sa sortie en France, qui était une rumeur depuis la fin de l'été, arrive assez tardivement par rapport à d'autres pays, comme l'Allemagne, l'Italie, la Belgique, la Norvège ou l'Inde, qui proposent déjà une formule végétarienne.

La galette de légumes, qui est là pour ""remplacer"" le steak, est composée, entre autres, de carottes, de salsifis et d'emmental. Elle est panée. Pour l'accompagner, on retrouve une sauce pesto rosso ainsi que du choux rouge et blanc, des jeunes pousses d'épinard, de salade et de roquette ainsi que des tomates. Sur le pain sont parsemées quelques graines de courge, de sésame et de pavot.

Cette recette est pensée pour les végétariens mais aussi pour toutes celles et ceux qui songent à réduire leur consommation de viande ou tout simplement qui ont parfois envie de manger d'autres sortes de produits.

Secularism may not be the panacea for all the ills confronting many Muslim societies but it is still an essential step.","ADVERTISEMENT

In Pakistan and, in fact, most of the Islamic world, the very concept of secularism is completely misunderstood. Somehow the concept has been thoroughly confused and amalgamated with atheism. An overwhelming majority of politicians, and even intellectuals, often try to defend themselves when ""accused"" of being secular, particularly on mainstream online media and Urdu print media. To declare oneself as a secular is considered equivalent to being considered an atheist in the public imagination.

The atmosphere is riddled with severe misconceptions about secularism. Due to fear of being branded an atheist and anti-Islamic, the word 'secular', in both letter and spirit, is virtually absent from the discourse. Even those who understand that secularism is fundamentally different from atheism often raise the question: ""what good is secularism?"" and ""all we need is the right interpretation of religion.""

Because most of the Muslim countries simply do not have a tradition of liberal discourse on religion.

What these ""reinterpretation"" folks fail to understand is that there are often multiple interpretations of religious text and while at the individual level, one has the option to choose one over the other without infringing on anyone's freedom, laws have to be uniformly applied across the board. So if we want to base our laws on Shariah, eventually we will have to privilege one interpretation over the other since law cannot be selectively applied.

Since one interpretation has to be preferred, the question arises that which one? Once implemented, laws apply to everyone, therefore, it is impossible to favour one over the other without causing acrimony.

Besides horizontal differences (for example between Shiites and Sunnis, or Barelvis and Wahabis), there is also a substantial disagreement between the so-called literalists and reformists. Since many a time, some Islamic laws come under criticism for being harsh, some who claim to be progressive have this point of view that we could have current laws modified according to some liberal interpretation of religion.

To a certain extent, this reinterpretation approach is understandable because frankly, this is apparently the only one available. But here the issue will be no less problematic because most of the Muslim countries simply do not have a tradition of liberal discourse on religion. In fact, liberal religious scholars virtually do not exist. Those who were talking of renaissance, like Javed Ahmed Ghamidi (a Pakistani scholar), have been forced to relocate. Some of their colleagues, like Dr Farooq Khan, have been killed.

Right now, the discourse is dominated by ultra conservatives no matter what school of thought they may belong to. How are we going to make sure that the ""liberal"" version will be acceptable to all? Who can guarantee that ultra-conservative version does not win? Another issue would be to intellectually justify what criteria is used to reinterpret. Mind you, reinterpretation has to be consistent to be convincing, as opposed to a pick-and-choose policy.

Secularism does not essentially result in a secularised society.

A secular State by being religiously neutral will actually benefit all as it won't impose any version over another and would actually allow freedom to various sects.

And the fear that secularism would eliminate religion from the public sphere (some religious people have this fear and they oppose it because of that) is actually unfounded. A secular state does not mean a secularised society.

Here I would like to distinguish between the two concepts of secularism and secularisation. The former is the separation of State and religion, whereas the latter is the process by which religion loses its overall significance in society. Two are related and yet distinct.

Secularism does not necessarily result in a secularised society. Turkey can be cited as an example where constitution embodies secularism, but the society is still not secularised. A secular state, at least theoretically, is religiously neutral and does not try to infringe the religious freedoms of the religious lot. So fears that secularism would lead to the elimination of religious freedom or even loss of significance are largely misplaced.

Let me be clear: Secularism does not mean atheism and nor does it mean that the State forces people to simply discard religion. Turkey is a prime example that secularism does not create a secularised society.

Secularism may not be the panacea for all the ills confronting many Muslim societies, but it is still an essential step.

Secularism merely means that religion is to be treated as a personal matter and not to be used by the State to either discriminate among various religious groups or impose one religion over another.

And yet due to all the misconceptions, the case for secularism is virtually absent from the discourse. Even those who are relatively progressive usually refrain from making such a case. Consequently, there is no wonder that the appeal for secularism is virtually non-existent in society.

This is tragic because right now the entire Muslim world is in the spotlight due to strict Islamic laws and growing sectarianism within its borders. What many of us need to understand is that trying to impose strict 'literally interpreted' Islamic laws in modern times will always lead to problems within Islamic societies and negative repute in the international arena. Either you have to reinterpret the laws (the problems with that approach have already been discussed), or you have to separate the legal code from religion – which in essence is secularism.

Secularism does have its limitations. It may not prevent radical Islam from emerging but it will (in the longer run) delink the legal system with religion and hence the laws will be in line with modern times. Further, it will also make the State neutral with respect to the faith of its inhabitants and this neutrality over the longer run will reduce internal sectarian tensions.

Treating religion as a personal matter is extremely essential as its projection into the public sphere is what causes discrimination and also leads to varying patterns of State sanctioned benefits and costs. By treating religion as a personal affair, a society tries to at least reduce such possibilities and reduce chances that a religious minority feels excluded.

Muslim followers are not monolithic (as they are divided into sects), therefore, a secular State, by being neutral (at least theoretically), ensures neutrality on religious grounds. It will also protect non-Muslims living within Muslim countries and thus promote internal cohesion and also improve the image of Muslim societies in the international arena. Secularism may not be the panacea for all the ills confronting many Muslim societies but it is still an essential step. I sincerely think that we need to address the misconceptions about secularism among Muslims. If anything, it will give various sects within Islam more religious freedom and also protect minorities.

Schon nach der ersten Frage der Interviewerin lachten die beiden Schauspieler - und Gosling packte eine Whiskey-Flasche aus

""Ist das wirklich ein Interview?""

Zwischen hysterischen Lachanfällen stellt Schauspieler Ryan Gosling diese Frage. Denn das Gespräch mit der Journalistin Alison Hammond von der britischen TV-Show ""The Morning"" ist zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits völlig außer Kontrolle geraten.

Eigentlich sollte Gosling zusammen mit seinem Kollegen Harrison Ford Fragen zu ihrem Film ""Blade Runner 2049” beantworten. Doch schon die ersten Sätze von Journalistin Hammond lösen bei den beiden Schauspielern hysterisches Gelächter aus.

""Das ist uns nicht gesagt worden!""

""Trostlos, öde, ein absoluter Albtraum, um ehrlich zu sein - und das sind nur meine Interview-Methoden"", sagt Hammond. ""Aber lassen Sie uns über den Film reden.""

""Mach dich mal locker"", witzelte Harrison. ""Das ist nicht die Einführung, die uns versprochen wurde."" Harrison Ford ist bekannt für seine Scherze in Interviews.

Bei der nächsten Frage öffnet Gosling eine kleine Whiskey-Flasche und schenkt sich etwas Alkohol ein. ""Fühlt sich an, als ob es in diese Richtung geht"", sagt er trocken. Viel ernsthafter wurde es in der Folge tatsächlich nicht.

Was habe er gedacht, als er erfahren habe, dass es einen neuen ""Blade Runner""-Film geben solle, fragt Hammond Ford. ""Na und?"" Harrison Ford war 1982, dem Erscheinungsjahr des ersten ""Blade Runner"", bereits berühmt, den ""Star Wars""-Filmen sei dank. Doch ""Blade Runner"" wurde zu einem Kult-Film - und Ford zum Filmstar.

Hysterische fünf Minuten

Das Interview dauert fünf Minuten, immer wieder ist das Gespräch von den Lachern der drei Beteiligten unterbrochen. Mal klaut Ford das Whiskey-Glas von Gosling, dann erzählen beide, wie Ford aus Versehen Gosling beim Dreh ins Gesicht schlug - und irgendwann steht Gosling auf und tut so, als ob er das Interview abbrechen würde.

Viel erfährt der Zuschauer nicht über ""Blade Runner"" in diesen fünf verrückten Minuten. Unterhaltsam ist das Interview aber allemal.

White Walkers are ice zombies in the series Game of Thrones, who relentlessly march on the orders of their Night King to destroy the human species. They don't seem to have much of a brain of their own, and their actions are dictated solely by order of the Night King. Since they primarily live in the frigid northern region, other kingdoms don't seem to believe in their existence and are busy fighting their own battles.

In popular culture, the threat from White Walkers is often compared to climate change, and how difficult it has been to convince all countries that the threat of climate change is real and humanity must unite to tackle this challenge.

In India though we may face a similar albeit a much eminent threat that might come from people around us. A lot has been written about India's demographic dividend. Demographic dividend implies that India will benefit from its large young population as she will have a lot of workers who contribute to the GDP and grow the economy in the process. It seemed to have been true so far, as after 1991 a lot of Indians got jobs with their IT education and lifted their families out of poverty. During this time India's GDP also grew six-fold.

However, we have recently seen a slowdown in our growth, especially in the informal sector. We already have about 12 million jobseekers every year, and demonetisation and the implementation of GST haven't helped the unemployment situation either. What makes the situation more worrying is machine learning and automation of jobs which might imply that the lucrative IT sector of yesteryears has limited jobs available in the years to come.

IT specialisations which offer jobs in the coming decades may require highly skilled engineers or programmers something that, except in a few premium institutes, education may lag in providing as educational institutions often follow what market develops. This could create a gulf between a few highly skilled employable youth, and their relatively low-skilled unemployed peers. This gulf will inadvertently translate into inequality between their earning potentials.

So what does this inequality lead to?

Experts touted inequality as one of the reasons why people voted in favour of seemingly adverse political decisions, for Trump in the United States, Brexit in the United Kingdom, and the rise of Right-wing parties in France and Germany. People who did not seem to have benefited from the globalisation of the past three decades chose a more conservative, nationalist, and direct talking politician who appealed to the racial, ethnic or economic insecurities.

When socio-political and economic systems fail to deliver social security and opportunity to its citizens, people tend to opt for extremist ideologues.

Deficiency of either rational or logical inference in that politician did not seem to deter their choice. When socio-political and economic systems fail to deliver social security and opportunity to its citizens, people tend to opt for extremist ideologues in search for someone who imposes their identity or even seek acknowledgement of their existence.

In developing countries like India, public goods like affordable health care and quality education are expected from the government. Research shows that out of pocket expenditure on health is one of the biggest reasons why people cannot get out of poverty and lack of quality education is what prevents them from accessing opportunities to climb the socioeconomic ladder. In our politics, these issues seldom become election issues.

Except for caste and religious consolidation, nothing much really mobilises the masses, especially in state elections. While our politicians keep reminding us of our caste and religious identities, we are on the verge of facing a large number of poor, unemployed youth turning our dividend into a demographic nightmare. A scenario where we have more employment seeking youth than we can manage.

Unemployment is fodder for 'Godmen' to thrive on

If unemployment remains high in future and individuals are stressed, they could seek 'safe havens' under the tutelage of 'godmen'. When people find themselves entrapped in health and/or financial burden arising from information asymmetry about those issues or their inability to pay, they turn to godmen in search of 'miracles'. Low education and a vastly unscientific attitude in our country offer a large audience to these 'godmen'. In return, they offer followers a new-found sense of belonging to a community in times of personal stress. Compounded with a recall and confirmation biases, the 'godmen' instil a blind faith in themselves. When these godmen are questioned, the followers march to protect their safe havens against critical thinking of the outside world.

What we saw during the trial of Gurmeet Ram Rahim of Dera Sacha Sauda was a manifestation of a similar scenario with a unique scale and urgency. It did not seem to matter to his followers that their leader was found guilty of rape. They marched against the judiciary's decision as if blind faith in a personality had dazed them away from critical thinking. They were not very different from the White Walkers in Game of Thrones who march on the orders of their king and cannot figure out for themselves either the reason or purpose of their incessant killings.

India has thousands of 'Gurmeets', big and small. Each time a godman is questioned, his followers may march against our institutions. While politicians focus on reminding us of our identities, a large section of our population may march against our institutions like those ice zombies controlled by their Night King. The only difference is that there are many Night Kings in India, their followers may not be white, but they sure can walk.

Ce qui m'étonne, je dois bien le dire, c'est que le chef Sol Zanetti soit parvenu à arracher une entente à QS qui respecte en tous points les conditions toujours posées par les Onistes pour ce faire. Considérant le faible poids politique que représente aujourd'hui ON sur la scène politique québécoise, on aurait facilement pu imaginer qu'ON eût dû reculer sur quelques points essentiels concernant ses exigences pour se voir concéder une place digne de ce nom à l'intérieur de QS.

Depuis des lustres, on entend des gens dire, à tort et souvent à raison, que QS n'est pas un parti vraiment indépendantiste. Que la liberté, il ne l'a toujours défendue que du bout des lèvres, sans vraiment y croire. Force est d'admettre, à la lumière de cette entente de principe, que le QS-nouvelle-mouture semble résolument prêt à adopter les changements qui s'imposent afin de faire taire ces critiques. Après tout, devenir résolument indépendantiste est la meilleure façon pour ce parti - pour ne pas dire l'unique - de sortir enfin de l'Est de Montréal et partir à la conquête des régions du Québec.

Il faut dire que l'arrivée de Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois aux plus hauts échelons de ce parti a insufflé un vent de fraîcheur sur la formation jadis fondée par Françoise David.

Il faut dire que l'arrivée de Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois aux plus hauts échelons de ce parti a insufflé un vent de fraîcheur sur la formation jadis fondée par Françoise David. On peut reprocher bien des choses au jeune homme, mais certainement pas d'être un fédéraliste qui joue à l'indépendantiste seulement quand ça fait son affaire. GND est un vrai indépendantiste. De grosse gauche certes. Mais un indépendantiste pareil. Et brillant qui plus est.

Mais que dit au juste cette entente de principe qui devra, pour devenir officielle, être adoptée lors des prochains congrès des deux partis? Grosso modo, et c'est là le plus gros morceau de l'entente, QS accepte de modifier l'article 1 de son programme afin que le projet d'assemblée constituante qui serait mise sur pied à la suite de l'élection d'un gouvernement QS concerne désormais, et strictement, l'adoption d'une constitution pour un Québec indépendant. Auparavant, cette assemblée constituante aurait pu déboucher sur une constitution d'un Québec-province si telle avait été la décision des délégués ainsi réunis. Il faut bien le dire, un tel changement dans le programme de QS est majeur. C'est un engagement ferme envers la réalisation de l'indépendance dès l'accession de QS au pouvoir! Ce n'est pas rien! J'étais d'ailleurs convaincu que là se trouverait la pierre d'achoppement qui aurait forcé l'abandon des négociations entre les deux partis.

ON, qui deviendra sous le coup de cette entente un club à l'intérieur de QS, avec des fonds pour promouvoir l'indépendance, et dont les principaux représentants occuperont des postes à l'intérieur du nouveau parti unifié, n'avait d'autre choix que d'accepter une telle entente. Il s'est époumoné à dire, des années durant, qu'il serait prêt à fusionner avec tout parti prêt à s'engager clairement en faveur de la réalisation de l'indépendance. Il force QS à le faire maintenant. Le Parti Québécois non. ON n'avait d'autres choix que de plier bagage et de rentrer dans les rangs de QS.

C'est la sortie de scène la plus honorable qu'on pouvait espérer, dans les circonstances actuelles, pour ce parti réduit à peau de chagrin.

Depuis le départ du fondateur du parti, Jean-Martin Aussant, ON était à bout de souffle et ne pouvait espérer meilleur dénouement que celui-là. C'est la sortie de scène la plus honorable qu'on pouvait espérer, dans les circonstances actuelles, pour ce parti réduit à peau de chagrin. Il faudra maintenant voir si les militants de ce parti accepteront majoritairement d'emboîter le pas à leur direction et d'entrer chez QS. Mais considérant tout ce que j'ai souligné plus haut, je crois bien que plusieurs le feront. Ce qui est une bonne nouvelle pour QS, car ce parti héritera de la sorte de militants aguerris, déterminés et compétents en ce qui concerne la question indépendantiste.

Ceci étant dit, mes réserves maintenant.

Il y a quelques années de cela déjà, je m'étais engagé auprès d'un groupe qui plaidait en faveur d'une fusion d'ON et de QS. Dans ma tête d'alors, c'était le meilleur moyen d'accroître le rapport de force de ces deux petits partis sur le PQ, pour que celui-ci reprenne enfin sa marche vers le pays.

En tant qu'ancien membre de la délégation internationale en Catalogne (tournant des années 2010), j'avais vu comment les petits partis de ce pays appelé à le devenir vraiment étaient parvenus à forcer le grand parti d'alors qu'était Convergencia i unio à abandonner, pour un temps au moins, son ambiguïté eu égard au projet de pays catalan. Je rêvais de faire de même au Québec. C'est-à-dire forcer, à l'aide d'un QS revigoré et franchement indépendantiste, ce PQ qui demeure à ce jour le navire amiral du mouvement indépendantiste à militer à nouveau pour le pays du Québec.

Cette différence énorme de perception en ce qui concerne le PQ risque de créer des remous à l'intérieur du nouveau parti unifié qui s'appellera toujours Québec solidaire.

Jamais dans ma tête je ne souhaitais alors donner de la force à QS pour mieux détruire le PQ et ainsi le remplacer dans la courte liste des partis pouvant aspirer au pouvoir. Or, bien des gens chez QS, je m'en rends bien compte aujourd'hui, n'ont que cet objectif en tête. Je ne puis en être. Et je ne crois pas que la majorité des militants et membres d'ON partagent davantage cette volonté. Cette différence énorme de perception en ce qui concerne le PQ risque de créer des remous à l'intérieur du nouveau parti unifié qui s'appellera toujours Québec solidaire.

Si ce projet de fusion devait donner suffisamment de force à QS pour miner d'autant le PQ dans les prochaines années, et ce, alors que le parti de GND conserverait la même fermeture à l'égard du PQ de Jean-François Lisée, je crois que le Québec n'y gagnerait pas au change. De mon vivant, je ne crois pas voir QS au pouvoir, que le PQ survive ou non aux prochains événements qui s'appellent surtout les élections de 2018. Pour le bien du Québec, QS devra plus tôt que tard cesser de rêver à la destruction du PQ. Il devra plutôt chercher le moyen de s'entendre avec celui-ci. Et vice et versa évidemment, puisqu'au chapitre de la division du mouvement indépendantiste, le PQ est responsable de bien des maux.

La Catalogne nous sert ces jours-ci et à nouveau de grandes leçons: il n'y a qu'ensemble qu'on peut rêver sérieusement au pays. Et même tous ensemble, la route que nous souhaitons emprunter vers le pays du Québec nous sera difficile et éreintante. Les forces de chacun seront nécessaires pour arriver un jour à bon port. J'en demeure convaincu.

Si la fusion est avalisée, ils devront devenir des militants de l'intérieur ayant pour mission de convaincre les solidaires de l'importance de la convergence indépendantiste, seule façon de mener un jour le Québec à sa libération pleine et assumée.

Ce qui revient à dire que Sol Zanetti et les siens ne sont pas sortis du bois. La mission qui les attend à la suite des congrès des deux partis devant confirmer la fusion sera tout aussi difficile que ce ne le fut pour eux de faire la promotion de l'indépendance à la tête d'un très petit parti, et ce, dans un vaste« champs de ruines » (dixit Jacques Parizeau). Si la fusion est avalisée, ils devront devenir des militants de l'intérieur ayant pour mission de convaincre les solidaires de l'importance de la convergence indépendantiste, seule façon de mener un jour le Québec à sa libération pleine et assumée. Ils pourront agir à titre d'agents de la réconciliation.

A notification issued by the Maharashtra government on 27 September have left allopathy doctors fuming. Mumbai Mirror reports that the state's Medical Education and Drugs Department recently announced that qualified homeopaths can practice 'modern medicine', which means they would be entirely within legal parameters while prescribing allopathic medicines to patients.

Mirror reports: ""According to the notification, doctors who obtained the Licentiate of the Court of Examiners of Homeopathy (LCEH) degree from 1951-1982, can register with the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC)."" The report explains that anyone who is registered with the said organisation is legally permitted to practice 'modern scientific medicine'.

The tussle between allopathy doctors and practitioners of homeopathy over the right to prescribe allopathy medicine has been long. In 2012, according to this report, the Supreme Court had forbidden homeopathy doctors from prescribing allopathy medicines. But in the subsequent years, the court rejected the Indian Medical Association's (IMA) appeals to stop homeopathy doctors from continue practicing allopathy.

In January 2014, the Maharashtra government -- then a Congress government -- had announced that qualified homeopathic doctors can take an one-year course at the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences and practice some form of allopathic medicine. The Hindu reported that the government cited the lack of medical care and facilities in rural areas as a reason behind the move. The government felt that the 62,000 homeopathy doctors -- who have cleared their bachelors in homeopathy medicine -- could be valuable addition to the state's medical infrastructure. However, qualified allopathy practitioners opposed the move tooth and nail saying it was dangerous to let them practice allopathy as a one-year course was not enough to familiarise them with the complete nature of that school of medicine.

The IMA moved court, the case is still pending.

Meanwhile, as the case filed at the Bombay HC took its own time with hearings etc, the IMA also filed a special leave petition (SLP) at the Supreme Court of India, seeking an injunction on homeopaths from practicing allopathy. The Supreme Court, in 2015, rejected the petition on the ground that Ayurveda practitioners have been allowed to practice allopathy in Maharashtra since 1992. So, under such circumstances, it didn't make sense to stop homeopaths from doing the same, especially if such a move helps allay the medical crisis in the state.

It was reported in July this year that the IMA has moved to trademark a symbol which will help patients differentiate between practitioners of Ayurveda, homeopathy and so on and 'modern medicine' i.e. doctors with MBBS degrees. Once the sign is registered and approved, all MBBS doctors will proceed to use it.

The Maharashtra government's new notification seems to have added to the IMA's existent woes. The latter has said that it already has two pending cases on the issue and will now have to act against another move it does not agree with.

Chloé Thomas, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Vincennes

Au dîner, j'essaie toujours de manger des légumes, des féculents et des protéines. Quand je cuisine la veille, j'essaie d'en faire un peu plus pour pouvoir m'apporter une gamelle le lendemain. Par exemple, en ce moment, il commence à faire plus frais, j'ai besoin de manger chaud. Ce midi, j'ai mangé des courgettes et des carottes poêlées, du riz complet et des crevettes. Le tout était revenu avec un peu de crème fraîche et du curry. Au dessert, c'était du fromage blanc.

Quand je vais dans des brasseries, j'aime prendre des grandes salades composées. Pour avoir aussi des féculents, je mange un morceau de pain. En dessert, je peux commander une panna cotta, des sorbets ou des fruits en sirop. Si elle est maison, je mange aussi volontiers une tarte aux pommes.

Valérie Legrand, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Lyon

Au déjeuner, je prends toujours le temps de me préparer à manger à l'avance. Je fais en sorte d'avoir dans mon assiette des protéines, des légumes et des féculents. Il y a une recette que j'aime beaucoup me faire. Je prépare du riz aux oignons, à la tomate et avec des courgettes. J'ajoute de l'ail et des herbes aromatiques ainsi qu'une escalope de poulet émincée, des moules ou des crevettes.

En dessert, je mange un fruit frais.

Ariane Grumbach, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Paris

J'essaie de faire un mix entre les repas maison et les repas pris à l'extérieur. Se dire qu'on se prépare à dîner tous les jours, c'est beaucoup de pression et d'organisation. Je congèle pas mal de restes et quand je me prépare à manger, je fais beaucoup de repas végétariens, la plupart sont des assemblages de produits déjà cuits.

Ce midi j'ai mangé un mélange de quinoa et de riz, du concombre, du basilic, des graines et une vinaigrette huile d'olive et citron. J'avais fait cuire ces féculents la veille pour un plat de poivrons farcis. Il m'a suffi de les assembler avec autre chose pour avoir un repas différent le lendemain.

Quand je mange à l'extérieur, je prends rarement une entrée, un plat et un dessert. Je préfère me concentrer sur un très bon plat. Un restaurant à côté de mon cabinet fait de très bons et complets bols repas. Le dernier en date c'était du quinoa, des poivrons, du pesto et des courgettes. Je préfère manger moins souvent à l'extérieur mais manger un plat qui me fera vraiment plaisir et qui sera donc un peu plus cher.

Anaïs Lala, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Paris

J'ai trois configurations, soit je mange un repas maison, soit un plat surgelé, soit un plat acheté dans un supermarché. Dans le premier cas de figure, comme ce midi, je peux manger une poêlée de légumes avec du quinoa et des fèves avec une vinaigrette. J'ai complété avec deux tranches de jambon et un yaourt nature ou au citron.

De temps en temps, je prends du surgelé mais les plats offrent peu de variétés donc pour ne pas me lasser, je me limite. Au supermarché, je peux acheter une salade de carottes, une barquette de tomates cerises et des protéines comme du jambon. Si je vais dans une boulangerie, je vais acheter une salade et un bon petit pain aux noix pour les féculents par exemple plutôt qu'un sandwich.

Au déjeuner, je mange des féculents. En ce moment, j'aime beaucoup le boulgour que je décline en salade l'été et que je mange chaud autrement. Je le mélange avec des courgettes, de l'avocat, de l'aubergine, du potiron. J'aime aussi beaucoup l'alliance: boulgour, pastèque, pamplemousse, oignons jeunes, raisins secs et coriandre.

Si le temps manque, le boulgour c'est aussi très bon avec une noix de beurre et un jus de viande.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday called ""love jihad"" a dangerous thing and told the Kerala government that it should act against it.

According to the News18 report, Adityanath, who is in Kerala for a rally protesting the murders of RSS workers in the state, said ""Love jihad is a dangerous trend. The Supreme Court has already passed an order on it and the NIA is investigating it.""

The chief minister was referring to the case of a 24-year-old Hindu girl who converted to marry a Muslim man. The Kerala HC had annulled their marriage.

Adityanath, a vocal opponent of so-called ""love jihad"" also urged the state government to take action against such incidents.

""Kerala government should make its stand clear about love jihad,"" TOI quoted him saying.

'Love jihad' is a term used by radical Hindu outfits. They claim it is a conspiracy by Muslims to convert Hindu women through marriage.

It seems like Adityanath is unaware that the Supreme Court on Tuesday questioned has the HC's order and ruled that ""a father can't have control over a 24-year-old girl."" The apex court also questioned the NIA probe into her marriage.

Meanwhile, Adityanath's history with the Muslims hasn't been very friendly. He has time and again made controversial statements against the particular community, from comparing Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed to lauding Donald Trump on banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.

While it might be admirable to display such an interest in world affairs, I wonder how healthy it is.","We have global news at our fingertips, constant updates on social media and 24-hour services -- the news is so pervasive that sometimes it seems as though, rather than consuming it, it is consuming us. And perhaps it is.

The continuous news cycle and the loss of many community news sources news means that war, natural disaster and political turmoil have become constant presences on the newsreel, and in our lives. While there is no doubt that some knowledge of current affairs is valuable, and even a responsibility of those who live in relatively safe and affluent countries like Australia, how much news is too much? Is there a healthier way of consuming information about global affairs and human realities?

In the New Yorker Magazine, a researcher into the connection between media consumption and stress, Mary McNaughton-Cassill, said that the continuous news cycle affected audiences in different ways. Often, rather than making people more generous or empathetic, it made them feel a sense of helplessness in the face of international affairs, and reluctant to do anything at all.

It also wired the brain to believe that things are worse than they were. While McNaughton-Cassill's research indicated most people, regardless of their circumstances, had a positive outlook on their immediate environment, in the absence of any in-depth knowledge about the wider world, people relied what they see happening on the news to determine their world view. As a result, they have a sense that the outside world is a malevolent place, regardless of the broader reality. This in turn tended to impact on people's decision-making, as they felt under threat, from the comfort and safety of their own living rooms.

So, how do we counteract this effect, and find a healthier way of absorbing the reality of our world?

The best thing we can do is pick up a book that will offer us an alternative vision of our world,

For me, books are an obvious and attractive alternative. Like the slow food movement in the culinary world, literature offers a slower method of digesting global and human realities. While they might not inform us of the latest act of terrorism or natural disaster half a world away, they do provide insights into the world in which we live, often presented with extensive thought and in great depth.

It is the skill of writers to zero in on the essential truths of the human condition -- the information of meaning and significance -- and present it to readers in an accessible form. Ideas and events are explored at length, rather than being thrown at the reader indiscriminately in the form of distressing images and footage and urgent voice overs.

Instead of heightening our fear about the world we live in, books deepen our understanding of it and its people. Their characters are not just soldiers or victims, but individuals with complex histories, circumstances and inner worlds. They give us the opportunity to empathise with other people, rather than to fear them. Unlike the news, books offer solace and calm, insight and understanding.

Literature can also offer an escape from the anxieties that the daily news might ignite, providing the opportunity for us to leave our own lives and visit other places or times. They distract us from the fast news cycles and everyday concerns and help us see a bigger picture.

I am not the only one who prefers fiction to copious news. In an interview with Vanity Fair, actor Paul Bettany said that he consciously turned to books to drown out some of the noise made by the media.

""To distract from the relentless news cycle, he is currently reading 'Homo Deus', the sequel to Yuval Noah Harari's cult best-seller 'Sapiens'.""

It is a far cry from Bianca Jagger's claim in the same magazine that her morning routine involves listening to BBC Radio 4's Today program, reading the Financial Times, The Guardian and The New York Times, and doing social media. All this before heading to work. While it might be admirable to display such an interest in world affairs, I wonder how healthy it is.

In an appearance at The School of Life, best-selling writer and blogger Mark Manson said that the abundance of information on the internet made it very difficult to determine what was important, or even real.

He advised media consumers to ensure their choices were made consciously, so they weren't becoming immersed in everything put in front of them, regardless of its value, relevance or reliability.

Unfortunately, making these choices or switching off the constant noise of the news is no easy feat. After all, it comes at us from so many angles, emerging unbidden from Facebook and Twitter, flashing from city buildings and interrupting our favourite television programs.

The best thing we can do is pick up a book that will offer us an alternative vision of our world, whether we want a chance to escape our anxieties or more deeply explore our realities and that of the people we live among.

But many questions remain.

What was Paddock’s motive?

More than two days after the shooting, law enforcement officials are still mostly at a loss understanding why Paddock decided to attack the Route 91 Harvest Festival’s crowd of about 22,000 people.

The attack, from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was meticulously planned, police said. Paddock, who checked into the hotel last week, set up a ring of video cameras in and around his suite, and stocked it with almost two dozen weapons.

“I anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,” Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Tuesday.

At least 12 of the rifles in his possession at the time of the shooting were outfitted with a legal modification called a “bump stock” that turned them into machine gun-like weaponry capable of firing hundreds of rounds a minute.

Lombardo said that, with all signs pointing to the attack being highly premeditated, investigators are now focused on finding any details on a potential motive.

Courtesy of Eric Paddock Stephen Paddock is seen in this undated photo released by his brother Eric Paddock.

Who was Paddock, and what did he do the days before the shooting?

Friends and relatives of Paddock said they were shocked to learn police had named him as the attacker. His brother, Eric, said he “couldn’t be more dumbfounded” by the shooting.

They described Paddock as an avid gambler, recognizable at the high-stakes tables in Vegas, who lived in an upscale retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada. But he drew little attention to himself at home and had no serious criminal record. He was one of four brothers raised by a single mother; his father was a bank robber featured on the FBI’s Most Wanted List after breaking out of prison.

Paddock wasn’t aggressive, or openly political or religious, according to his family. One brother, Patrick Paddock, told The New York Times that Stephen Paddock “was the least violent in the family during my childhood,” before continuing: “So, it’s kind of like, ‘Who?’”

Investigators say Paddock had been seen gambling more than $10,000 a day multiple times in recent weeks, including some transactions topping $30,000, NBC reported.

Lombardo told reporters that various hotel staff members had gone into his room in the days before the attack without thinking anything was imminent.

“I can’t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,” Lombardo said Monday.

How did he obtain so many guns?

SWAT officers found Paddock in his room at the Mandalay Bay dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was surrounded by 23 weapons, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and several gun accessories. Photographs obtained by Boston 25′s Jacqui Heinrich show some of the assault-style weaponry found in his room.

Explosives, thousands of rounds of ammunition and 19 other firearms were found at his primary residence. Including those from the hotel and a second home, Paddock had at least 47 weapons.

Several gun shop owners have told news outlets that Paddock complied with all required background checks and purchase procedures. “He was an average everyday Joe Blow guy,” Chris Michel, the owner of Dixie Gunworx, told ABC News. “I remember his face, his name, him coming in.”

The “bump stocks” found on the weapons in Paddock’s hotel room were completely legal and relatively affordable, although they are controversial. While fully automatic weapons are strictly regulated under federal law, bump stock modifications make “converting a semiautomatic to fully automatic ... very, very easy,” John Sullivan, lead engineer for the gun advocacy group Defense Distributed, told Wired.

Did Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, know anything about his plans?

Marilou Danley, Paddock’s girlfriend, was traveling in the Philippines at the time of the attack, and investigators met her upon her return at the Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night. A federal official told the Los Angeles Times that Danley was expected to be questioned.

“We anticipate some information from her shortly,” Lombardo said. “She is currently a person of interest.”

Danley’s two sisters told an Australian TV station that Paddock had unexpectedly bought his girlfriend a plane ticket to the Philippines, telling her he’d found a cheap deal. He’d also reportedly transferred $100,000 to a bank account in the Philippines. The sisters said that Danley had no idea what her partner was planning.

Paddock’s brother described the pair’s relationship positively, but other reports suggest Paddock may have been verbally abusive to Danley. Starbucks employees who served the pair near their home in Mesquite said Paddock would regularly berate Danley in public.

“It happened a lot,” Esperanza Mendoza, a supervisor of the Starbucks in the Virgin River Casino, said. “He was so rude to her in front of us.”

Paddock met Danley, who is originally from the Philippines but also holds Australian citizenship, while she was working at Club Paradise, part of the Atlantis Casino Resort and Spa in Reno, Nevada. She worked as a high-limit hostess and often gambled with Paddock, according to The Washington Post.

Danley, who moved to the U.S. in 1989, was married when she met Paddock, according to The New York Times. She divorced her husband of 25 years, Geary Danley, in 2015.

Danley has a daughter and grandchildren, and was described as very friendly by her neighbors.

Is there anything behind Paddock’s $100,000 transfer to the Philippines?

Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines, NBC News reported on Tuesday, but the recipient and the reason for the transfer was unclear.

His brother, Eric, speculated that the money was for Danley. He said that kind of money wasn’t a “huge amount” for Paddock, elaborating: “Steve took care of the people he loved. He made me and my family wealthy.”",What We Know And Don't Know About Stephen Paddock And The Las Vegas Massacre,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-what-we-know_us_59d480d3e4b04b9f9206039d

Mehr als ein Drittel der Deutschen will, dass Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel keine vollen vier Jahre mehr im Amt bleibt. In der Unionspartei hat Merkel noch einen recht großen Rückhalt. In den anderen Parteien sinkt das Vertrauen jedoch.

In einer YouGov-Umfrage im Auftrag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur plädierten 36 Prozent dafür, dass die CDU-Vorsitzende ihren Platz an der Regierungsspitze vor Ende der Wahlperiode 2021 räumt und an einen Nachfolger oder eine Nachfolgerin übergibt. 44 Prozent sind für eine volle Amtszeit der Kanzlerin. 20 Prozent machten keine Angaben.

Die Union hatte mit Merkel an der Spitze bei der Bundestagswahl am 24. September starke Verluste erlitten und war nur noch auf 32,9 Prozent der Stimmen gekommen.

Trotzdem ist sie stärkste Kraft im neuen Bundestag und wird mit Merkel die Kanzlerin stellen, falls es bei einem Scheitern der Regierungsbildung nicht doch noch eine Neuwahl gibt.

Unter den Wählern der Union hat Merkel laut YouGov-Umfrage noch einen recht großen Rückhalt. 81 Prozent der Befragten sprachen sich dafür aus, dass sie bis zur nächsten Wahl 2021 Kanzlerin bleibt.

Das Bundestreffen der Parteijugend am Samstag hat gezeigt: Eine Annäherung wird beiden nicht leicht fallen

Die Revolte ist ausgeblieben. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat den ""Deutschlandtag"", das Bundestreffen der Jungen Union, souverän überstanden.

""Die erste Runde im parteiinternen ‘Endspiel’ geht ganz klar an Angela Merkel"", kommentierte die ""Welt"" den Tag der Kanzlerin mit der Parteijugend, der als Tag der Abrechnung ausgerufen worden war.



Für Aufregung sorgte ein JU-Mitglied aus Bergisch Gladbach. Diego Faßnacht forderte die Kanzlerin zum Rücktritt auf.

Merkel konterte kühl. Der junge Mann wurde ausgebuht - nur von den Delegierten aus Bayern kam Applaus.

Am Ende klatschten alle für die Kanzerlin - zumindest fast alle. ""Nur die Delegierten aus Bayern bleiben wieder demonstrativ sitzen"", berichtet die ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"".

Tatsächlich zeigten die Bayern mit blau-weißen Schildern deutlich, was sie von der Kanzlerin erwarten. Auf den Schildern standen Aufschriften wie ""Wir haben verstanden. Sie auch?"" und ""Zuwanderung begrenzen"".

Bis zu einer Versöhnung mit den Mitgliedern der CSU scheint es nach dem desaströsen Wahlergebnis der Union noch ein weiter Weg zu sein.

Ist die Lösung im Streit um die Obergrenze gefunden?

Am Sonntag trifft Merkel den bayerischen Ministerpräsident Horst Seehofer, um eine Verhandlungslinie für eine Jamaika-Koalition festzulegen.

Das größte Streitthema, eine Obergrenze für die Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen, könnte dabei ansatzweise schon aus dem Weg geräumt werden. ""Welt""-Korrespondent Robin Alexander berichtet, wie die grobe Lösung an diesem Sonntag aussehen könnte.

Die CSU gestehe zunächst zu, dass das Recht auf Asyl für politisch Verfolgte - wie es auch im Grundgesetz verankert ist - nicht begrenzt werden könne. Das hatten CSU-Politiker zuletzt in Interviews mehrfach gesagt.

Für die vielen Migranten, die als Flüchtlinge nach der Genfer Konvention nach Deutschland kommen, sollen dann Kontingente festgelegt werden, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter. Die Regelung könnte Teil eines Einwanderungsgesetzes werden, das von der Jamaika-Regierung erarbeitet wird.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Größte Hürde für Jamaika: Was die Parteien über die Obergrenze sagen - und wo ein Kompromiss möglich ist

Merkel versucht die Annäherung - aber reicht das?

Merkel machte auf dem Deutschlandtag in ihrer Rhetorik deutlich, dass auch sie zu einer Annäherung an die Partner in Bayern bereit ist.

Sie sagte den Rechtspopulisten von der AfD eine harte Auseinandersetzung zu. ""Ich stehe dazu, dass rechts von der Union keine Partei sein sollte"", sagte die CDU-Chefin auf Nachfrage der Delegierten. Die entsprechende Aussage stammt bekanntermaßen von der CSU-Legende Franz Josef Strauß.

Doch reichen diese zaghaften Schritte als Annäherung? “Die Bundeskanzlerin will auf keinen Fall ihre Politik aus der Zeit der offenen Grenzen relativieren”, kommentiert die ""Welt"" die anstehenden Verhandlungen um die Obergrenze.

Und: Der ""Deutschlandtag"" hat gezeigt, wie tief der Graben zwischen bayerischer Basis und Berliner Kanzlerin sein kann.

A group of residents, race equality organisations, academics, lawyers and experts have put in a submission to the panel and may ask to become core participants. Our community is bruised, confidence in public authorities is at its lowest and we cannot cope with any further disappointment, any further rejection. We want our views to be taken into account for a change. Chair of Bramley House Residents’ Association

Grenfell Tower: Still Burning With Anger I just hope that the survivors and the relatives and friends of all those who died - and we will probably never know for sure exactly how many perished - will not have to wait 28 years for justice to be done, as have the families affected by the Hillsborough stadium disaster of 1989.

The Hillsborough Prosecutions Are A Victory For Our Grassroots Campaign Twenty eight years is a long time to sustain a fight for justice.

It is fair to say that some were better at it than others. Researcher, Hillsborough Justice Campaign

Grenfell Tower Reveals It's Really The Middle-Class Who're Guilty Of The Politics Of Envy The residents of South Kensington complaining about rehousing Grenfell Tower victims in their neighbourhood need a reality check. Be grateful that nothing like this has happened to you. Not just the fire, but the sheer poverty that comes with living on a council estate. Instead of moaning that these people are getting help you've never needed, try being grateful for the fact that you have, in fact, never needed that help. Contributing Editor, The Gay UK Magazine

After Grenfell, Tenants Must Take Control Of Their Housing The most uncomfortable truth lurking within this tragedy is that there is a stigma attached to people who live in social housing. Narrowly, this means that a discount is applied to their views when they are expressed to the relevant authorities. Broadly it also means that the lives and wellbeing of people who live in council blocks are seen as having less value than home owners.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday has questioned the order of the Kerala High Court that annulled the marriage of a Hindu woman in the state to a Muslim man.

While the HC had called the marriage 'love jihad' and the woman was sent to stay with her parents, the SC said that a father could not have control over his adult daughter.

Hindustan Times quoted the Supreme Court as saying, ""A father can't have control over 24-year-old girl. It might send the girl to a custodian or an organisation.""

Live Law reported that senior lawyer Dushyant Dave also made scathing arguments agains the NIA proble.

""This investigation shakes the foundation of this multi-religious country. Two high functionaries of BJP have married members of minority community. Will Your Lordships order NIA probe into it? This order sends terrible signals all over the world,"" Dave said.

Born Akhila Ashokan, Hadiya had converted to Islam before her marriage to Shafin Jahan. Hadiya's marriage was annulled after a petition by her parents.

Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, the newspaper reported, also questioned the earlier apex court order for an NIA probe into the matter.

This observation by the court is probably a breather for Hadiya who is said to be held forcibly by her parents in their home in Kottayam.

Jahan had moved the SC in July saying that the HC order was an insult to the independence of women in India.

Love jihad is a term used by radical Hindu outfits that claim that it is a conspiracy for Muslims to convert Hindu women and forcing them to take up Islam.

In his petition, Jahan had said that his wife had converted two years before their marriage, so there was no question of force.

Her conversion to Islam was accepted because Hadiya was an adult when she converted. Her parents have however claimed that she had been forced to convert to Islam, an allegation that Hadiya had herself denied.","Father Can't Have Control Over 24-Year-Old Girl, Says SC Question Annulment Of Hadiya's Marriage",http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/03/breather-for-hadiya-as-supreme-court-questions-kerala-hcs-order-to-annul-her-marriage_a_23230719/

단편과 장편 극작을 넘나드는 가즈오 이시구로는 1954년 일본 나가사키에서 태어나 가족과 함께 1960년에 영국으로 이주했다.

1978년 영국 캔터베리의 켄트 대학교에서 영문학과 철학으로 학사를 마쳤으며 이후 이스트 앵글리아 대학에서 문예 창작 마스터 과정을 수료했다.

일본을 배경으로 태평양 전쟁 이후의 상처와 현재를 절묘하게 엮어낸 첫 소설 '창백한 언덕 풍경'(1982년)으로 위니프레드 홀트비 기념상을 받았으며 이후 '부유하는 세상의 예술가'(1986년), '남아 있는 나날'(1989년) 등을 발표하며 세계적인 작가로 떠올랐다(참조 : 민음사 작가소개).

특히 그에게 맨부커상을 안겨 준 1989년 작 '남아 있는 나날'은 1993년 앤서니 홉킨스와 엠마 톰슨이 주연을 맡고 제임스 아이보리가 메가폰을 잡아 동명의 명작으로 재탄생한 바 있다.

이날 이시구로의 수상을 발표한 한림원의 종신 사무 차관이자 미학자인 사라 다니우스(노벨 문학상 발표자로 유명하다)는 이시구로의 문학 스타일을 아래와 같이 표현했다.

""제인 오스틴과 프란츠 카프카를 섞으면 가즈오 이시구로를 만들 수 있다. 그러나 거기다가 마르셀 프루스트를 약간 더해줘야 한다. 그리고 너무 많이 말고 살짝 저어 주면 이시구로의 작품이 된다.""

다니우스의 말은 언뜻 섞일 수 없을 것 같은 상반된 스타일과 세계관이 가즈오 이시구로 작품 속에 어떤 방식으로 공존하는지에 대한 나름의 해석으로 보인다.

이어 다니우스는 ""(이시구로는) 위대한 진실성을 가진 작가""라며 ""자신만의 미학적 우주를 만들었다""고 평했다.

For over two decades, Jantar Mantar has been the official protest venue in New Delhi for activists raising their voices for various causes. Politically-charged banners, reporters milling about, wary police guards feigning disinterest, and make-shift tents shielding hunger-strikers from the harsh Delhi sun, are common sights at the ground in the heart of the national capital where democracy expresses itself daily in dissent.

But that might soon end. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) shifted the protest venue to the Ram Lila grounds near Ajmeri Gate citing noise pollution and disturbance caused to the residents who live nearby.

Before Jantar Mantar became the nerve centre that drew Delhi's discontent, protests were held at the Boat Club in Rajpath. It was only in 1993 the official site of protest was shifted from the Boat Club to Jantar Mantar.

A massive week-long protest that almost brought the capital to a halt in 1988 had prompted the change of protest venues.

At the agitation of Mahendra Singh Tikait, the leader of Jat farmers from Uttar Pradesh, more than five-lakh farmers had occupied the stretch between India Gate and Vijay chowk.

""The Capital had seen the biggest protest of its time. Tikait brought thousands of agitating farmers to the site and for almost a week he had held the place under siege. He had polluted and filled the place with an Army of cattle along with his protesters who even started cooking food there. A new legislation was introduced and protesting at Boat Club was banned since then,"" a senior NDMC official told The Pioneer.

Bhartiya Kisan Union President Mahendra Singh Tikait leading a protest at Jantar Mantar.

The Telegraph, describing the intensity of Tikait's protests, reported that while the netas in Delhi were first dismissive of him, they sat up and took notice when the lush lawns of the heart of the capital were taken over by cattle, and the roads were covered in tents put up by farmers.

The Telegraph reported:

They sang and danced by night; by day they sat listening rapt to their leader's extended harangues. Delhi's classes frowned at the chaotic disarray that broke out on the showpiece green lung of the capital. The government was at a loss to cope with the sudden avalanche of peasants in its well-ordered official district.

After Tikait's protests, the government cited security reasons — the Boat Club is very close to the Prime Minister's office, Finance and External Affairs Ministry — to move it a bit further away from the seat of government in Lutyen's Delhi.

Since then, Jantar Mantar has seen protests that has changed the course of Indian laws and Indian politics.

Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement that later spread to different parts of the country was anchored from Jantar Mantar. It was at Jantar Mantar now political rivals Arvind Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi shared the stage with Hazare.

It was at Jantar Mantar the seed of a political party — that was to storm Delhi Assembly elections in 2015 — was planted, and nurtured by the ambitions of Kejriwal, a former tax commissioner.

Jantar Mantar was the place where youths of Delhi gathered to demand that Indian laws be changed after the gruesome gangrape of a young woman on a bus on the night of 13 December, 2012.

Protesters hold placards as they gather for a 'Not in my name' silent protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on June 28, 2017.

In more recent months we have seen Tamil Nadu farmers protest with the skulls and bones of other farmers who had committed suicide. Delhi also united to protest at Jantar Mantar after the murder of Junaid Khan in a train on his way back from Eid shopping. While the ""Not In My Name"" protests took place all of over the country, one of the largest congregations was at Delhi.

However, historians say that the change of venue of protests in Delhi has changed the nature of dissent.

""Those mass mobilisations on Rajpath were an opportunity for the people to communicate their anger directly to the government. Now, it's no longer possible to do anything more than a symbolic protest,"" Sohail Hashmi told Outlook.

The Ramlila ground has always been the fall-back venue for protests too large for Jantar Mantar. It has seen the historic India Against Corruption movement of Gandhian Anna Hazare, joined by Ramdev.

He said between 50 and 60 people ran into the station after the alarm.

Essential HuffPost

In the rush over Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October every year, it is easy to forget the legacy of another leader of modern India, Lal Bahadhur Shastri. What made the second prime minister of independent India special? An insight into his life, career and mysterious death here.

A wheelchair-user at a multiplex in Guwahati was called a ""Pakistani"" for not standing up while the national anthem was playing. The incident comes in a long line of aggressive behaviour to promote jingoism among the people that has sharply risen over the last several months.

Children's writer Paro Anand speaks to Murtaza Ali Khan for the HuffPost Blog about writing for young people, putting sex and romance in her books and her continuing interest in the lives of kids living in Kashmir and other conflict zones.

Im Video oben seht ihr, wie Hartz-IV-Empfänger in Deutschland leben.

Aber von vorn.

Ich war so jung und dumm, wie man es nur sein kann, als ich mein Studium begann. Als der Erste aus meiner Familie, der es an die Uni geschafft hat, hatte ich ein riesig aufgeblähtes Ego.

Ich wollte es den ganzen ""Bonzenkindern"" an der Uni zeigen. Sie sollten lernen, wie ""die harte Realität"" da draußen ist.

Stattdessen war ich es, der etwas Wichtiges lernen musste. Und zwar, dass ich in einer geschönten Filterblase aufgewachsen war. Und diese Erfahrung war ziemlich schmerzhaft. Sie begann an dem Tag, an dem meine Freundin in mein Leben trat - mittlerweile ist sie meine Ex.

Seit ihrem 18. Lebensjahr lebte sie abwechselnd von Bafög, Hartz IV und Kellner-Jobs

Ich lernte sie über eine Studiengruppe an der Uni kennen. Sofort ist mir aufgefallen, wie hübsch sie war. Doch von ihr überzeugt hat mich letztendlich etwas ganz Anderes.

Noch nie hatte ich jemanden getroffen, der so tough war, so leidenschaftlich in allen Dingen. Sie hatte meist so gut wie kein Geld und immer Stress mit dem Bafög-Amt. Von ihren Eltern bekam sie keine Unterstützung. Also suchte sie sich einen Job als Kellnerin - und geriet an einen Chef, der ununterbrochen anzügliche Witze machte. Zu guter letzt hatte sie auch noch im Studium zu kämpfen.

Auch wenn sie mit ihrer Situation nicht glücklich war, hat sie all das immer sehr gut gemeistert. Selbst als das Bafög-Amt Probleme machte und sie zeitweise nicht mal mehr Geld für Essen hatte, kam sie irgendwie klar.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: 2,8 Millionen Kinder in Deutschland von Armut bedroht - so erklärt die Regierung den Anstieg

Diese Probleme waren nichts Neues für sie. Ihre Eltern hatten nie Geld und haben sich mit Gelegenheitsjobs wie Putzen, Pakete ausliefern und Regale einräumen über Wasser gehalten. Irgendwann rutschten sie in Hartz IV ab.

Sie wohnte seit ihrem 18. Lebensjahr allein, finanzierte sich während der Schule abwechselnd durch Bafög, Hartz IV und Kellner-Jobs.

Trotzdem bekam sie ein Abi-Zeugnis, von dem ich nur hätte träumen können. Sie sprach drei Sprachen fließend und zwei weitere gut genug, um in den jeweiligen Ländern klar zu kommen.

Ihr Start ins Leben war weit schwerer als meiner, doch als wir uns kennenlernten, hatte sie schon weit mehr daraus gemacht.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich habe mir angeschaut, wie in Deutschland über Armut geredet wird und Erschreckendes festgestellt

Das imponierte mir. Um nicht zu sagen: Ich war total verknallt. So sehr wie noch nie zuvor.

Neben ihr kam ich mir klein und unbedeutend vor. Nicht mehr wie das kluge Arbeiterkind, das es den Bonzen zeigen würde. Ich fühlte mich bloß noch wie ein Kind.

Ihr Leben war ein stetiger Kampf, den sie nur verlieren konnte

Irgendwie hab ich es geschafft, dass auch sie mich gut fand. Und aus ""betrunken auf Feiern rummachen"" wurde eine richtige Beziehung. Weil ich so verliebt war und es uns beiden finanziell half, zogen wir zusammen.

Jetzt - wo eigentlich der Teil der Geschichte kommen müsste, wie sie trotz ihrer Vergangenheit erfolgreich wurde und wie toll es mit ihr und uns weiter ging, muss ich kurz innehalten.

Denn ich hab das damals wirklich geglaubt. Ich dachte: Sie ist so stark, der ganze Ballast kann ihr nichts anhaben, sie lässt das alles gar nicht an sich ran. Ich lag falsch.

Wer ein Leben lang kämpft, der fängt sich Narben ein. Wunden, die nie ganz verheilen und die plötzlich wieder aufgehen. Ich war zu jung und zu unerfahren, um damit richtig umzugehen.

In ihrem Leben gab es feste Regeln - eine Abweichung bedeutete Angst und Wut

Mit jemandem zusammenzuleben, der es gewohnt war, mit einem Minimum an Geld auszukommen, ist anders.

Da gab es die kleinen Dinge. Sie hat keine Getränke im Supermarkt gekauft, Wasser aus der Leitung reichte völlig. Penibel achtete sie darauf, dass sofort das Licht ausgeschaltet wurde, wenn man einen Raum verließ. Sie wusste genau, was das Minimum an Waschmittel war, das man benötigt, um die Kleidung sauber zu bekommen.

Das mag sich nur nach Marotten anhören. Doch es hatte etwas Zwanghaftes. Und wurde problematisch, wenn man sich nicht an ihre Regeln hielt.

In unserem Haushalt wurde lautstark darüber gestritten, wie lang das Licht an sein darf, dass die Cola auf dem Heimweg unnötig und das Waschmittel schon wieder leer war.

Für sie waren das keine lustigen Spartipps - für sie waren das lebenswichtige Regeln. Die sie sogar so tief verinnerlicht hatte, dass selbst wenn wir finanziell ganz gut dastanden, eine Abweichung von diesen Regeln Angst und Wut in ihr hervorrief.

Und da ging es nur um Kleinigkeiten. Das größte Problem war ein anderes: Das Essen.

In ihrer Familie war Essen immer ein Mittel, den Stress, den die prekäre Lebenssituation mit sich brachte, zu bekämpfen. Viel Fast-Food, viele Chips - typisches Wohlfühl-Stressessen.

Als wir zusammen wohnten, hat sie zu Beginn eigentlich nur Fischstäbchen gegessen. Wenn es stressig wurde, kamen noch Chips hinzu.

Es war nicht so, dass sie nicht wusste, dass es auch anders geht - aber sie konnte einfach nicht anders.

Sie fühlte sich danach immer schlecht, weil sie ja eigentlich nicht so wie ihre Familie leben wollte. Die starke, intelligente, erfolgreiche Frau, die sie war, kam nicht damit klar, hier so eine ""Schwäche"" zu zeigen.

Das Ergebnis war, dass sie sich nach dem Essen oft übergab. Über Umwege hat die Armut ihr also eine gefährliche Essstörung beschert.

Depressionen, Wutanfälle und selbstverletzendes Verhalten

Das Gefühl, immer die Beste sein zu müssen, um ja nicht so wie die Eltern zu enden, hat sie auch tief beeinflusst. Sie entwickelte einen großen Perfektionismus und hat sich selbst nichts verzeihen können.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Die Armut macht sie psychisch krank"": Kinderarzt warnt, so geht es Kindern in armen Familien

Darunter litt sie sehr. Die Folge waren Depressionen, Wutanfälle und selbstverletzendes Verhalten. Offen zeigte sie nie etwas, doch als ihr Partner kannte ich die Narben an ihren Beinen, wo sie sich selbst geschnitten hatte.

Ich wusste nicht, wie ich damit umgehen sollte. Wann ich mit ihr weinen und wann ich hart bleiben musste. Womit ich ihr hätte helfen können, womit ich ihr geschadet hätte.

Wir haben uns oft gestritten. Damals dachte ich, es gehe wirklich darum, ob ich das Licht angelassen hatte. Jetzt weiß ich, dass sie einfach nur jemanden gebraucht hatte, der sie ernst nimmt und versteht. Das konnte ich damals jedoch nicht. Zu anders war meine Biografie, als dass ich verstehen hätte können, was sie durchgemacht hat.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: ""Politisch gewollt"" - ein Betroffener erklärt, wie menschenverachtend das Hartz-IV-System tatsächlich ist

Irgendwann trennten wir uns. Das hatte viele Gründe - wir waren zu jung zusammengekommen, ich hatte noch viel zu sehr mit mir selbst zu tun. Und auch wenn wir uns immer noch mögen, mussten wir uns damals eingestehen, dass wir nicht das sind, was der andere braucht.

Kein Märchen und kein Happy End

Aufhalten konnte sie das alles trotzdem nicht. Sie machte auch an der Uni einen Abschluss, von dem die meisten nur träumen können, lernte noch zwei weitere Sprachen fließend und ging auch beruflich ihren eigenen Weg.

Das klingt nach einem Happy End. Wir haben noch immer viel Kontakt und ich weiß: Sie ist nicht glücklich.

Ihre Kindheit und ihre Armut lassen sie nicht los, nur weil sie nicht mehr arm ist. Sie kämpft noch weiter, aber irgendwann - so sagt sie - ist auch ihre Kraft aufgebraucht.

Ich bin dankbar für die Zeit, die wir zusammen verbracht haben. Ich habe viel gelernt, ich bin weniger verschwenderisch und viel dankbarer für das, was ich habe. Ich verstehe auch viel besser, was es heißt, arm zu sein.

Lebenslange Armut hat weit weniger mit Geld zu tun, als man glaubt. Armut ist etwas, was man sein Leben lang in sich trägt. Es ist, wie wenn man in einen anderen Kulturkreis zieht. Man lernt die Regeln der anderen, kommt vielleicht sehr gut damit klar, doch da bleibt etwas, was die anderen nicht verstehen können.

Ich habe auch gelernt, dass die Menschen, die Arme und Hartz-IV-Empfänger pauschal für faul und dumm halten, einfach keine Ahnung haben.

Und vor allem habe ich gelernt, dass Armut uns allen schadet. Eine Frau wie meine Ex-Freundin ist stark und intelligent und hat der Welt viel zu bieten. Wenn sie Unterstützung bekommen hätte, wäre sie jetzt vielleicht jemand, über den man in der Zeitung lesen würde.

Aber weil sie in einer armen Familie aufwuchs, war ihr Weg steinig und sie wird ihr Leben lang kämpfen müssen.

Dadurch, dass wir in Deutschland solche Armut zulassen, zerstören wir nicht nur das Glück einzelner Individuen - es bleibt auch so viel Potential auf der Strecke, von dem wir alle profitieren könnten.

Da Armut noch immer mit vielen Vorurteilen verbunden ist, hat der Autor diesen Text unter Pseudonym geschrieben, um sich und seine ehemalige Freundin zu schützen.

Charlotte and Brendan were lucky to avoid the public vote last weekend and will be hoping to do better with their ‘Top Gun’-themed Tango.

Alexandra Burke

The former ‘X Factor’ star was left with a split lip after butting heads with her pro partner Gorka Marquez.

Alexandra explained the mishap on spin-off show ‘It Takes Two’, revealing that it took place in the final run-through ahead of last week’s live show.

“In the dress run, not many people know this but we really did butt heads,” she said. “I was left with a massive cut lip. We were that into it!”

Alexandra will also perform an American Smooth for week two.

Ruth Langsford

While Alexandra was left injured after her run through, a pulled hamstring meant ruth couldn’t even take part in hers.

In a video posted to Twitter the night before last Saturday’s live show, Ruth explained: “Just before I went down I was in my dressing room and I thought, ‘I’ll just walk through my steps and… make sure I know the routine’, and I kicked my leg out and pulled a hamstring.”

While the injury healed in time, Ruth’s Charleston sadly failed to set the ballroom alight. For movie week, she’s transforming into a Bond girl and dancing a rumba.

Die Gratwanderung zwischen Unabhängigkeitsstreben und Neo-Nationalismus ist dabei gefährlich. Freunde der Freiheit müssen darauf Antworten finden.

Nicht „die oder wir"", sondern „Zwang oder Freiheit""

Wäre das schottische Referendum vor drei Jahren positiv ausgegangen, hätte Schottland sicherlich einen deutlichen Links-Schwenk vorgenommen (was jetzt freilich das gesamte Land unter May und Corbyn ohnehin tut). Die Befürworter des katalonischen Referendums befinden sich in einem Dauerkonflikt mit Verfassung und Rechtsstaat und kooperieren mit Linksextremen. Und die Bevölkerungsminderheiten in den kurdischen Gebieten des Irak fürchten sich davor, in einem kurdischen Staat marginalisiert, unterdrückt und vertrieben zu werden. Durch die Sezession entstünden also keineswegs lauter paradiesische Zustände.

Die erste Erkenntnis, die man mitnehmen sollte, lautet: Das Streben nach Unabhängigkeit von einer größeren Einheit geht durchaus nicht immer einher mit einem umfassenden Freiheitsdrang. Selten fallen die Vertreter der Unabhängigkeitsbewegungen auf durch das Versprechen, die individuelle und ökonomische Freiheit zu stärken. Viel gewichtiger ist in der Regel das Argument, dann mehr Geld zur Verfügung zu haben, um es mit den eigenen Leuten zu teilen.

Nun soll hier wahrlich nicht eine Lanze für Länderfinanzausgleiche und Solidarzahlungen gebrochen werden. Tatsächlich könnte man wohl mancherlei Absetzbewegungen eindämmen, wenn man nicht innerhalb von Staaten und Staatenverbünden die große Umverteilungsmaschine in Gang setzen würde. Es sollte aber klar sein, dass Sezessionen an sich noch nicht unbedingt etwas Gutes sein müssen, sondern häufig auch von Nationalisten und Sozialisten für ihre Zwecke instrumentalisiert werden.

Der Ökonom Ludwig von Mises, der den Zerfall des mitteleuropäischen Vielvölkerstaates in nationalistische und autoritäre kleinere Staaten miterlebt hatte, warnte 1927 unmissverständlich: „Es handelt sich nicht um das Selbstbestimmungsrecht einer national geschlossenen Einheit, sondern es handelt sich darum, dass die Bewohner eines jeden Gebietes darüber zu entscheiden haben, welchem Staatsverband sie angehören wollen."" Mit anderen Worten: Nicht die angebliche gemeinsame Volkszugehörigkeit von Kurden oder Katalanen sollte das entscheidende Argument für die Trennung sein, sondern die Abwehr von Übergriffen und Willkür einer Zentralregierung. Für den Liberalen ist die Frage, auf die es ankommt, nicht „die oder wir"", sondern „Zwang oder Freiheit"".

Kooperation statt Abschottung

Wenn das Ergebnis einer Sezession das Entstehen eines mächtigen und ausgabenfreudigen kleineren Staates ist, der darüber hinaus wegen seiner geringeren Größe noch mehr Kontroll- und Zugriffsmöglichkeiten auf die Bürger hat, war die politische Entscheidung kein Gewinn für die Sache der Freiheit, sondern ein Rückschlag. Gleichwohl bleibt natürlich die kleine Einheit für den Freund der Freiheit in vielerlei Hinsicht eine ganz entscheidende Referenzgröße. Die Kleinstaaterei ist für ihn nicht unbedingt ein Schimpfwort, sondern eher ein positives Ziel - allerdings nur dann, wenn die Betonung nicht auf Staat liegt, sondern auf klein. Kleinstaaterei kann eben auch Abschottung bedeuten.

Das widerspricht aber dem liberalen Verständnis von zwischenmenschlicher Ordnung. Denn, wie Mises formuliert, „als letztes Ideal schwebt immer der Gedanke einer vollständigen Kooperation der ganzen Menschheit vor ... Das Denken des Liberalen hat immer das Ganze der Menschheit im Auge, ... es endet nicht an den Grenzen des Dorfes, der Landschaft, des Staates und des Erdteils. Es ist ein kosmopolitisches ... Denken, das alle Menschen und die ganze Erde umspannt.""

Die Kleinstaaterei der Neo-Nationalisten, die sich von anderen abschotten wollen, ist davon nicht gedeckt. Wohl aber die Kleinstaaterei der Freunde der Freiheit, die die kleinen Einheiten bevorzugen, weil sie flexibler sind und besser auf konkrete Fragen reagieren können; weil sie sich im Wettbewerb mit anderen bewähren müssen und daran wachsen können; weil sie mitunter besser kontrolliert werden können und Verantwortlichkeiten klarer zuzuordnen sind. Es gibt Modelle der kleinen Einheiten, die zukunftsweisend sind - von den baltischen Staaten bis zu dem Modell der Private Cities. Dies sind Modelle, die Liberale aus vollem Herzen unterstützen können. Einfach unbedacht jeder Sezessionsbewegung zuzujubeln, kann jedoch dazu führen, dass man Feinde der freien und offenen Gesellschaft unterstützt.

Es kommt nicht auf die Größe an, sondern auf die Technik

Die Gefühle und Wünsche der Menschen in Katalonien und Kurdistan, im Kosovo und vielleicht auch auf der Krim sind natürlich oft bestimmt von einem echten Streben nach Selbständigkeit, und nicht nur vom Streben nach einer Vorzugsrolle bei der großen Umverteilung oder von dumpfem Neo-Nationalismus. Gerade die Drohungen Erdogans gegenüber den irakischen Kurden und die Gewaltexzesse der spanischen Polizei in Katalonien lassen Verständnis aufkommen für das Bedürfnis, jetzt erst recht auf eigene Füße zu kommen. Sowohl die EU als auch Institutionen, die das Völkerrecht schreiben und sprechen, sind dringend aufgerufen, für solche Situationen zufriedenstellende Lösungen zu finden.

Schwelende Dauerkonflikte können Länder auf Dauer in ihrer Gesamtheit zerrütten. Für den Irak etwa wäre ein freundschaftlicher Nachbar Kurdistan wahrscheinlich auf Dauer besser als ein Unruheherd im eigenen Land. Und gerade innerhalb der EU, wo Grenzen ohnehin marginalisiert sind, dürften die Beziehungen zwischen Katalonien und Spanien kaum große Unterschiede zum status quo aufweisen - außer, dass weniger Gelder vom einen ins andere fließen.

Und die Liberalen allenthalben sind aufgerufen, für sich selbst ein konsistentes und gut vermittelbares Konzept von gelingender Kleinstaaterei zu formulieren. Sonst werden sie sich, wenn sie dieses Anliegen formulieren, viel zu oft in der unangenehmen Gesellschaft von Sozialisten und Nationalisten wiederfinden. Es gibt spannende Denkansätze wie etwa den Polyzentrismus, zu dem junge Wissenschaftler wie Julian F. Müller und David Thunder forschen. Hier richtet sich dann auch der Fokus weg vom Staat - wer wüsste schließlich besser als Liberale, dass er bei weitem nicht die einzige Organisationsform für uns Menschen sein muss?

Das oberste Ziel muss stets die individuelle Freiheit sein und im Zusammenhang damit möglichst große Freiheitsräume für Gruppen von Menschen, die untereinander kooperieren. Wenn Sezession das Mittel der Wahl ist, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, dann kann man die Bestrebung durchaus unterstützen. Aber letztlich zählt, dass es nicht auf die Größe ankommt, sondern auf die Technik. Und deshalb sind kleine zentralistische Staaten oft nicht die bessere Lösung im Vergleich mit größeren, aber insgesamt freiheitlicheren.

Moderator Plasberg hat im Interview mit dem ""Spiegel"" über die Sendung mit AfD-Mann Gauland gesprochen

Eine Antwort zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit der AfD immer noch fällt

Auch Wochen nach der Wahl ist das starke Abschneiden der AfD immer noch eines der beherrschenden Themen in den Medien. ""Hart aber fair""-Moderator Frank Plasberg nennt das Resultat der Bundestagswahl im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" einen ""gesellschaftlichen Hammer"".

Nicht wenige Politiker und Journalisten haben den Medien eine Mitschuld am Erstarken der Rechtspopulisten gegeben.

Noch-Familienministerin Katarina Barley (SPD) etwa kritisierte Plasberg hart, als sie kürzlich zu Gast in dessen Sendung war. ""Mich hat das rasend gemacht"", schimpfte sie darüber, dass die Themen der AfD - Migration und Flüchtlingspolitik - so häufig Thema in den Talkshows der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen gewesen seien.

Im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" weist Plasberg die Vorwürfe zurück, ARD und ZDF hätten die AfD erst groß gemacht. Er gestand aber auch, dass ihm der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten nicht leicht falle.

Vor allem Plasbergs Schilderung des Auftritts des AfD-Spitzenkandidaten Alexander Gauland bei ""Hart aber fair"" im August offenbart, wie hilflos der Moderator teilweise der AfD gegenüber stand.

""Die spielen irgendwie anders""

""Wir ha­ben früh fest­ge­stellt, dass die ir­gend­wie an­ders spie­len"", sagt ""Hart aber fair""-Redaktionsleiter Georg Diedenhofen über die AfD im Doppelinterview mit dem ""Spiegel"". Die Rechtspopulisten hätten die Regeln verändert.

""Sie wol­len nicht ein­mal mit den an­de­ren Gäs­ten dis­ku­tie­ren, lie­ber set­zen sie sich mit dem Mo­dera­tor aus­ein­an­der, weil so die Op­fer­rol­le schnel­ler her­stell­bar ist"", erklärt Plasberg.

Für ihn als Moderator sei das ein Dilemma, weil er immer beherrscht sein müsse - und sich nicht zum Richter über den AfD-Gast aufschwingen dürfe.

Wie dieses Dilemma in der Wirklichkeit dann aussieht, sahen ARD-Zuschauer im August bei “Hart aber fair”. Zu Gast war damals der Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland. Kurz zuvor hatte er für einen Skandal gesorgt, als er sagte, die Integrationsbeauftragte Aydan Özoguz könne in Anatolien entsorgt werden.

""Wie dämlich muss man denn sein..."" - Plasberg in der Kritik

Immer wieder versuchte Gauland, den Fragen Plasbergs auszuweichen. Journalisten wie ""Welt""-Autor Thomas Schmid empörten sich hinterher, dass die “Hart aber fair”-Redaktion Gauland überhaupt eine Bühne geboten habe.

“Wie dämlich muss man denn sein, einem solchen kühl kalkulierenden Provokateur, der sich als Unschuldslamm gibt, einen derart breiten und für Gaulands Partei unbezahlbaren öffentlich-rechtlichen Wahlkampfauftritt zu verschaffen”, schimpfte Schmid damals in einem Facebook-Post.

Im “Spiegel”-Interview schildert Plasberg, die Redaktion habe das ganze Wochenende vor der Sendung mit Gauland überlegt, ob sie den Politiker ausladen solle.

Plasberg hat keine eindeutige Antwort parat

Eine eindeutige Antwort auf die Frage nach dem richtigen Umgang mit der AfD kann Plasberg nicht geben. Sollte die AfD wie jede andere Partei behandelt werden?

“Ja. Und nein”, antwortet Plasberg da. Es würden jedenfalls die gleichen journalistischen Standards gelten. Man dürfe der AfD nicht den Gefallen tun, “eine spezielle Umgangsweise für sie zu entwickeln”.

Dass AfD-Politiker als Talkshow-Gäste allerdings doch eine ""besondere Vorbereitung"" bräuchten, wie Redaktionsleiter Diedenhofen sagt, oder einen ""besonderen Energieaufwand"", wie Plasberg meint, zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten doch fällt.

Plasberg verrät auch, was die Zuschauer der Sendung nicht mehr sahen, als Gauland eingeladen war.

Gauland privat nach der Sendung

Nach der Aufzeichnung sei er zu dem Politiker gegangen und habe ihm erklärt:

""Ab heu­te bin ich je­dem böse, der die­se Par­tei wählt, nach­dem er Sie, Herr Gau­land, heu­te bei 'Hart aber fair' ge­se­hen hat.""

Gauland sei klug, rhetorisch fit, verleugne aber seine eigene Intellektualität, wenn er sage, ""er habe nicht ge­wusst, was der Be­griff ‘Ent­sor­gen’ be­deu­tet.""

Gauland habe nur dagestanden, mit einem Glas in der Hand und habe das ""mit großer Gelassenheit zur Kenntnis"" genommen.

Viele Mütter haben Gewissensbisse, wenn sie nach der Geburt ihres Babys schnell wieder in den Job zurückkehren

Dabei zeigen Studien: Kinder profitieren in den meisten Fällen sogar davon

Ein größeres Selbstvertrauen und bessere Leistungen in der Schule sind nur zwei der vielen positiven Effekte

Viele Mütter, die nach der Geburt ihres Kindes früh in den Job zurückkehren, plagen sich Monate, manchmal Jahre mit einem schlechten Gewissen: Schade ich meinem Kind, wenn es früh in die Kita kommt? Würde es sich besser entwickeln, wenn ich den ganzen Tag da gewesen wäre? Hat mein Kind dadurch womöglich eines Tages Bindungsprobleme?

Der vorwurfsvolle Blick vieler Mütter, die später (oder gar nicht) wieder anfangen zu arbeiten, macht die Sache nicht besser. Sogar die “New York Times” stellte kürzlich fest, dass Deutschland ein merkwürdiges Verhältnis zu arbeitenden Müttern habe. Kein Wunder, dass es Ausdrücke wie ""Rabenmutter"" in anderen Sprachen nicht gibt.

Dabei zeigen Studien: Es schadet Kindern nicht, wenn Mütter - aus welchen Gründen auch immer - schnell in die Arbeitswelt zurückkehren. Im Gegenteil.

1. Ein früher Kita-Besuch beeinflusst die Psyche von Kindern positiv

Die meisten Kinder, deren Mütter kurz nach der Geburt in den Job zurückkehren, kommen mit einem Jahr oder früher in die Kita.

Die Angst vieler Eltern: Die Kinder könnten noch nicht weit genug sein. Schaden nehmen.

Doch solange die Kleinen in der Kita gut betreut werden, ist die Sorge laut Experten unbegründet. Wissenschaftler stellten im Gegenteil fest: Für die Entwicklung der Kinder wirkt es sich in den meisten Fällen eher positiv aus, wenn sie außer Haus betreut werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die berufstätige Mama: Du bist meine Heldin

So leiden sie etwa später seltener an psychischen Störungen, wenn sie schon in den ersten zwei Lebensjahren fremdbetreut werden, wie Veit Roessner, Leiter der Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie der Uniklinik Dresden, 2016 in einer Untersuchung herausfand.

Eine Studie der London School of Economics und der Oxford University zeigte 2016 außerdem: Kinder, die ganztags von ihren Müttern betreut werden, haben schlechtere Sprachkenntnisse und motorische Fähigkeiten als Kinder, die eine Kita besuchen.

""Das Ergebnis der Erhebung sollte Eltern zeigen, dass Kitas ihren Kindern nicht schaden werden und ihnen wahrscheinlich sogar gut tun"", sagte Studienautor Laurence Roope vom Health Economics Research Centre in Oxford der britischen Zeitung ""Telegraph"".

2. Kinder, deren Mütter arbeiten gehen, sind intelligenter und mutiger

Ebenso erstaunlich: Kinder schneiden in Intelligenztests besser ab, wenn ihre Mutter früh an den Arbeitsplatz zurückkehrt.

Zu diesem Ergebnis kamen Forscher der Universität Minnesota in einer Untersuchung, für die sie mehrere Einzelstudien seit 1960 auswerteten.

Die untersuchten Kinder konnten sich außerdem besser anpassen, zeigten ein kooperativeres Verhalten und waren auch seltener ängstlich als die Kinder von Müttern, die nicht arbeiteten.

3. Sie haben mehr Selbstvertrauen

Spätestens in der Schule zeigt sich nach Ansicht von Experten der positive Effekt deutlich.

In einem Papier mit dem Titel ""Wie viel Mutter braucht das Kind?"" stellte die ansonsten konservative Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) 2015 fest: In der Schule zeigen Kinder berufstätiger Mütter mehr Selbstvertrauen als die anderen.

Das Papier greift mehrere Studien aus Nordamerika und verschiedenen europäischen Ländern auf. Allein an Teilstudien aus Deutschland waren 7000 Familien beteiligt.

4. Sie haben bessere Chancen in der Schule

Die Experten der KAS konnten außerdem nachweisen: Kinder von berufstätigen Müttern sind nicht nur selbstbewusster in der Schule, sie sind auch leistungsbereiter.

Zudem schaffen sie häufiger den Sprung aufs Gymnasium als Kinder von Müttern, die zuhause bleiben.

Die KAS kommt zu der Erkenntnis: Kinder lernen so von Beginn an, dass sich mit Engagement im Leben positive Resultate erzielen lassen.

So wie beide Eltern täglich arbeiten, um Geld für die Familie mit nach Hause bringen zu können, bekommen Kinder in der Schule für ihre Bemühungen gute Noten.

5. Sie denken weniger stark in Rollenklischees

""Kinder profitieren nachweislich davon, wenn ihre Mütter arbeiten gehen"", sagte Petra Timm, Arbeitsmarktexpertin vom Personaldienstleister Randstad, zu den Ergebnissen der KAS. ""Wenn Eltern ein entsprechendes Rollenbild vorleben, verinnerlichen ihre Kinder dies von Beginn an. Denn Vater und Mutter sind immer auch Vor- und Leitbilder.""

Forscher der Harvard Business School kamen 2015 in diesem Zusammenhang zu erstaunlichen Ergebnissen. ""Kaum etwas hat unserer Erkenntnis nach einen derart großen Einfluss auf die Überwindung von Geschlechterungleichheit wie von einer berufstätigen Mutter großgezogen zu werden"", sagte die Hauptverantwortliche der Studie, Kathleen L. McGinn.

Für die Untersuchung werteten sie und ihre Kollegen die Aussagen von über 13.000 Frauen und 18.000 Männer aus 24 Industriestaaten aus.

6. Sie sind entscheidungsfreudiger und können sich besser organisieren

Laut KAS haben Kinder von berufstätigen Eltern außerdem eine realistischere Vorstellung vom Arbeitsalltag. Deshalb falle es ihnen leichter, sich nach der Schule für einen Ausbildungsweg zu entscheiden, schreiben die Experten in ihrem Papier.

""Mütter, die den Umgang mit beruflichen Anforderungen und Wissen über unterschiedliche Aspekte beruflichen Lebens vermitteln können, fördern schon dadurch ihre Kinder"", heißt es.

Außerdem kommen die Experten zu dem Ergebnis: Wenn eine berufstätige Mutter etwa in Teilzeit arbeite, lerne ihr Kind von Anfang an, dass zur Arbeit auch die Selbstorganisation gehöre und wie sich Beruf und Privatleben trennen lassen. Vorausgesetzt natürlich die Mutter ist in diesen beiden Bereichen selbst ein Vorbild.

7. Speziell Mädchen sind später erfolgreicher in ihrem eigenen Beruf

Speziell bei Mädchen stellten McGinn und ihre Kollegen von der Harvard Business School einen erstaunlich positiven Effekt fest: Frauen, deren Mutter berufstätig war, entscheiden sich später häufiger, mit Kind ebenfalls in den Job zurückzukehren.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Studie beweist: Berufstätige Mütter haben erfolgreichere Töchter

Außerdem sind sie öfter in verantwortungsvollen Positionen zu finden und verdienen mehr als Frauen, deren Mutter Vollzeit zuhause war, als sie Kind waren.

8. Jungen hingegen bringen sich später stärker in der Familie ein

Auch einen auffälligen Effekt auf Jungs beobachteten die Forscher von der Harvard Business School: Wenn sie von einer berufstätigen Mutter erzogen werden, bringen sie sich später stärker im Haushalt ein und verbringen mehr Zeit mit ihrer Familie als Männer, deren Mutter nicht arbeiten ging.

➨ Das könnte euch auch interessieren: Die wahre Ursache von Sucht geht auf diese 6 Erlebnisse aus der Kindheit zurück

9. Berufstätige Mütter sind zufriedener - und das wirkt sich positiv auf die Kinder aus

Um schließlich auch die Perspektive der Mutter noch zu berücksichtigen: Wenn Mütter rasch nach der Geburt wieder ihrem Beruf nachgehen, steigert das häufig deren Zufriedenheit. Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt eine 2013 veröffentlichte Langzeitstudie der Bochumer Ruhr-Universität, eine der am größten angelegten Familienstudien in Deutschland überhaupt.

Die Hauptfrage der Untersuchung war: Welche Faktoren tragen zum Wohlergehen von Kindern bei und wie spielen staatliche Rahmenbedingungen, Persönlichkeits- und Bildungsmerkmale der Eltern sowie wirtschaftliche und Einkommensverhältnisse der Familie dabei zusammen?

Das Ergebnis: Schon Babys profitieren, wenn die Mutter sich nicht ausschließlich dem Muttersein widmet. Die Studie belegt einen signifikant positiven Effekt auf Neugeborene und Einjährige, wenn die Mutter bis zu 20 Stunden pro Woche arbeitet und sie außer Haus betreut werden.

Die Forscher führen das auf die bereits erwähnte größere Zufriedenheit berufstätiger Mütter zurück - und die, so schlussfolgern die Experten, wirke sich direkt auf das Wohlergehen des Kindes aus.

""Insofern erscheint im Hinblick auf das Wohlergehen von Kindern eine Ausweitung der Partizipation an der Arbeitswelt von Müttern als frei von negativen Wirkungen"", summieren die Autorinnen und Autoren der Studie.

Im Klartext: Wenn ihr arbeiten wollt, geht arbeiten. Es schadet euren Kindern nicht. Im Gegenteil.

SRINAGAR -- A group of militants on Tuesday launched a suicide attack on a BSF camp near the Srinagar international airport, killing an assistant sub-inspector of the BSF and leaving four security personnel injured.

Two militants were killed in the gun-battle that is raging near the airport, forcing brief suspension of air traffic and closure of schools in the vicinity.

A police official said that a group of militants, whose exact number could not be known immediately, stormed the BSF camp located just outside the main gate of the high-security Srinagar International Airport at 4.00 am.

Two militants have been killed so far while a BSF jawan identified as B K Yadav laid down his life while battling the attackers, officials said.

Three other BSF personnel were injured in the firefight while a policeman guarding the residence of a retired police officer nearby sustained superficial injuries due to a stray bullet, the official said.

Intermittent exchange of firing was going on, he added.

The remaining terrorists are holed up inside the building campus of the 182nd Battalion camp, BSF officials said.

Airport operations were suspended in the morning due to the gunfight but later resumed as security forces managed to limit the action around the building where the militants are holed up.

""Normal flight operations have resumed and passengers were boarding flights,"" said Director, Airport Authority of India, Srinagar, Sharad Kumar.

The 182 battalion is entrusted with the security of runway of the Srinagar airport.

Adjacent to the camp is the old Srinagar airfield which is been run by the Indian Air Force. The area also houses training centers of the BSF and CRPF. Schools in the vicinity of the airport have been closed.

Jaish-e-Mohammad militant outfit has claimed responsibility for the attack.

A caller identifying himself as spokesman of the outfit told local news gathering agencies that Jaish militants carried out the attack.

Last month, the Daily Mail claimed that Kim had pulled out of playing Samantha Jones in a third big-screen adaptation of ‘Sex And The City’, due to producers failing to meet her apparent “diva demands”.

In response, Kim said she’d made no “demands” but had simply decided not to do the film.

‘Sex And The City’ fans have been divided over the news, with some arguing that Kim should give them one last outing as Samantha (particularly after ‘Sex And The City 2’ proved to be such a dud), and others claiming it’s her right to not take part if she doesn’t want to.

But it seems Kim is done with the conversation completely now, publicly urging one fan to “move on” from the topic.

One fan tweeted her saying he was “confused” after reading she said she was “too old” to play Samantha, despite her having spoken out about Hollywood ageism in the past, to which she responded: “I’ve played ‘SAM’ for 20 years. Am moving on & so should you.”

Perhaps sensing the tweet would get media attention (or maybe we shouldn’t be so cynical), she then urged him to watch her more recent series, ‘Sensitive Skin’, on Netflix.

‘Sex And The City’ cast members Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis have both expressed their disappointment that the film was ultimately canned, with SJP saying: “We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.

“It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.”

By way of response, Kim admitted she thinks her former co-star “could have been nicer” about her decision not to return.

POLITIQUE - Ils ne se passent plus rien. Adversaires ""irréconciliables"", Jean-Luc Mélenchon et Manuel Valls ne ratent plus une occasion de dire tout le mal qu'ils pensent l'un de l'autre. Les tensions sont telles que le chef de file de la France insoumise a démissionné ce vendredi de la mission parlementaire sur la Nouvelle-Calédonie au motif que celle-ci sera présidée par l'ancien premier ministre.

Dans une lettre de démission au vitriol adressée au président de l'Assemblée François de Rugy, Jean-Luc Mélenchon étrille le député apparenté LREM, dénonçant notamment sa proximité avec les thèses de l'extrême droite. ""Un accord d'origine inconnue a décidé de confier la présidence de cette mission à monsieur Manuel Valls. On ne saurait faire choix plus inapproprié. Monsieur Valls est un personnage extrêmement clivant, qui suscite de forts rejets du fait de sa proximité avec les thèses ethnicistes de l'extrême droite"", s'étrangle le député des Bouches-du-Rhône.

Mardi dernier, lorsque la présidence de cette mission avait été attribuée à Manuel Valls, Jean-Luc Mélenchon avait déjà réagi en qualifiant de ""corvée"" le fait de siéger à ses côtés. ""Ici, qui vient-il trahir?"", avait-il tweeté dans une allusion au soutien apporté par Manuel Valls à Emmanuel Macron, au mépris de ses engagements de la primaire de soutenir Benoît Hamon.

Corvée : siéger avec l'ignoble Valls à la commission Nouvelle-Calédonie. Ici, qui vient-il trahir ? — Jean-Luc Mélenchon (@JLMelenchon) 3 octobre 2017

Selon lui, cette nomination n'est qu'une ""opération de repêchage d'un ancien premier ministre"" alors même que ""celui-ci a déjà été désavoué de toutes les façons possibles dans un passé trop récent"".

""Extrême droite israélienne"", ""factieux"" et ""islamo-gauchiste""

Le cofondateur de la France insoumise n'en reste pas là, pointant les propos de Manuel Valls sur les ""white"" et ""blancos"", saisis par une caméra en 2009, et sa ""proximité"" avec les dirigeants ""de l'extrême droite israélienne"".

Si le ton est corrosif, celui qu'emploie Manuel Valls pour s'attaquer à la France insoumise l'est tout autant. L'ancien premier ministre, partisan d'une laïcité intransigeante, a accusé à plusieurs reprises les députés de la France Insoumise de porter ""un discours islamo-gauchiste"" et de se rendre coupables de ""complaisance vis-à-vis du communautarisme"", de ""l'islam politique"".

""M. Valls ne saurait être le personnage unifiant et tolérant qu'une telle mission impose (...). Nous en voyons un signe supplémentaire quand nous l'entendons accuser notre groupe de complaisance pour les assassins islamistes"", s'indigne Jean-Luc Mélenchon dans son courrier.

Lors des élections législatives, la France insoumise s'est mobilisée pour faire battre Manuel Valls dans son fief de l'Essonne, allant jusqu'à contester son élection sur le fil. La mobilisation contre la réforme du code du travail voulue par Emmanuel Macron n'a fait qu'exacerber les tensions nées lors de l'adoption de la loi El Khomri. Jean-Luc Mélenchon ""se comporte en factieux"", a taclé Manuel Valls. ""Si Valls existait encore, ça vaudrait le coup de lui faire un procès"", avait ironisé le député LFI Alexis Corbière.

The late afternoon sun sizzled over my head as I stepped into the dilapidated compound of a school in a run-down neighbourhood in an eastern suburb of Mumbai. Directly overlooking the main street, the school was a single-storeyed building with a large playground and no signs of any security guard at the gate.

""After school hours, the premises turn into a shady haunt for violence-prone drug and alcohol abusers. And everybody in the administration turns a blind eye to it. We tried bringing it up with local authorities, but gave up as they didn't respond. I don't send my daughter to school anymore,"" rued a mother I spoke to while exploring the scope of this community as an operational location for the non-profit I was working with.

I remember thinking, what kind of a miserable society have we been reduced to, if we are unable to safeguard the basic rights of children in our so-called safe havens of learning? And how such collapses can trigger a domino effect on other social development issues.

Parents must recognise the power of vigilance as the key to protecting them.

When a 7-year-old child was murdered inside the toilet of his school in Gurugram recently, it threw open the usual blame-game and outrage. As always, we sprung into action only after getting stung. Anxious parents rallied against the school management, media reports exposed the negligent behaviour of the school authorities, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued safety guidelines to all schools, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the state government stepped in to take over the probe. To make matters worse, there were reports of a 5-year-old girl raped by a peon in another school a few days later.

Are these the first cases of violence against children in schools? No. In 2014, a six-year-old girl was reportedly sexually assaulted by two gym instructors in a Bangalore school. Before that, in 2012, a three-and-a-half year old child was allegedly raped by the husband of her playschool's owner. Clearly, there are many similar cases that may have gone unreported.

So where did we slip up?

Following the public uproar sparked by the Gurugram murder, and the mounting pressure calling for action, checklists and protocols for school safety were circulated, from installing CCTV cameras in the premises, verifying the background of staff, to providing training to students and teachers on safety, and so on. But are these safety procedures enough to ensure that every child is safe in school? While these directions demand a decent amount of accountability from educational institutions, they fall short of a holistic approach for tackling this issue.

As primary stakeholders of the safety of children, parents must recognise the power of vigilance as the key to protecting them. Given the history of violence against children in the last few years, can parents really afford to assume that their children are safe from the clutches of abuse once they step inside the school gates? When one is vigilant, untoward incidents ring alarm bells and start the possibility of confrontation and action. Engaging with teachers and fellow parents regularly helps exchange concerns. This joint ownership goes beyond just discussing grades and lessons. It calls for a proactive collaboration on establishing and monitoring safety procedures applicable to infrastructure, resources, transport, as well as the emotional and physical well-being of children within the school campus to create a safe learning environment.

Like every other child safety protocol dictates, honest communication between parents and children is an indispensable approach towards preventing abuse. Being as involved as possible in their school routine builds up a solid support system that thrives on trust and protection.

It is only after the crime has been committed that investigations reveal the extent to which rules were violated.

At the larger level, there is also a need for the government to enforce safety policies across urban and rural settings. What good are these pragmatic regulations if they remain only on paper? More often than not, it is only after the crime has already been committed that investigation reveals the extent to which rules were violated. It's high time that non-compliance is dealt with seriously. Audits and surveillance should go hand-in-hand with implementation of child protection policies to identify lapses and bring errant schools to justice.

An integrated approach to child safety may not be a foolproof mechanism of always keeping them safe from harm, but it is certainly more fitting than unrealistically pegging all responsibilities on a single institution.

Viele Menschen haben in ihrem Leben Phasen, in denen sie weniger Lust auf Sex haben

Das kann sowohl psychische als auch physische Gründe haben

Ein Sextherapeut verrät, was ihr gegen die Unlust tun könnt

Frauen verlieren häufiger das Interesse an Sex als Männer. Zu diesem Ergebnis ist eine aktuelle britische Studie gekommen. 34 Prozent der Frauen aber nur 15 Prozent der befragten Männer beklagten mangelndes Interesse an Sex.

Und für mehr als die Hälfte - 62 Prozent Frauen und 53 Prozent Männer - ist dieses mangelnde Interesse ein großes Problem.

Aber: Die Lust kann zurückkehren.

Es gibt eine Reihe an Gründen, wieso Frauen das Interesse an Sex verlieren, erklärt Sex-Therapeut Peter Saddington - von Mutterschaft bis zu psychischen Problemen.

""Typisch ist die Unlust, wenn jemand gerade Kinder bekommen hat oder junge Kinder hat und sich müde fühlt oder nicht viel Zeit hat oder sich nicht so attraktiv fühlt wie früher”, sagt Saddington. ""Ein anderer häufiger Grund, über den nicht viel geredet wird, ist psychische Gesundheit und Depressionen. Wenn du dich depressiv fühlt, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich, dass deine Libido weniger wird.""

Mit diesen sechs Tipps kannst du deine Lust steigern:

1. Kommuniziert mehr

“Als erstes muss man merken, dass tatsächlich etwas anders ist. Es reicht nicht, wenn das Problem nur der Partner anspricht oder wenn man es ignoriert”, sagt Saddington. “Danach solltet ihr mit eurem Partner sprechen. Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass er etwas bemerkt hat und dass das vielleicht Spannungen in eurer Beziehung erzeugt"", rät der Therapeut.

""Darüber zu reden bringt das Problem von Innen nach Außen, ihr erkennt an, dass euer sexuelles Verlangen weniger ist. Dann habt ihr die Chance, darüber nachzudenken, was ihr machen könnt um das Verlangen zurückzubekommen.”

Außerdem sind Menschen, für die es leicht ist, mit ihrem Partner über Sex zu sprechen, weniger anfällig für sexuelle Unlust, wie die Studie herausfand.

2. Nehmt euch Zeit für Date-Nights

Saddington glaubt an die Kraft von Date Nights. “Denkt darüber nach, eine Date Night einzuführen und nehmt euch Zeit, statt zu erwarten, dass es schnell zum Sex kommt”, rät er Frauen.

“Wenn ihr es euch erlaubt zu entspannen und euch gut zu fühlen und euch nicht nur als Mutter, die gestresst ist und zu wenig Zeit hat, dann bemerkt ihr vielleicht, wie das Interesse wieder auflebt.""

3. Baut eine emotionale Verbindung auf

Date Nights sind auch wichtig, um eine emotionale Bindung aufzubauen. ""Männer können durch Bilder oder Gedanken an sie erregt werden, das ist viel visueller. Frauen brauchen eine emotionale Verbindung"", sagt er.

""Wenn ihr Zeit miteinander verbringt und miteinander sprecht, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass ihr Sex haben wollt. Es ist außerdem wichtig, alle Probleme zu lösen, weil unterschwelliger Groll euch daran hindern wird, Verlangen zu spüren.”

4. Konzentriert euch auf eure mentale Gesundheit

Menschen, deren Libido unter ihrer Depression oder Unsicherheit leidet, kann es helfen, sich mit der Krankheit auseinanderzusetzen oder mit dem Hausarzt zu sprechen.

Um die Erregung zurückzubringen, rät Saddington, Sport zu treiben und sich auf Aktivitäten zu konzentrieren, die euer Wohlbefinden steigern.

""Sport ist im Allgemeinen etwas Gutes. Denn Sport treiben setzt Endorphine, die dich selbst gut fühlen lassen werden. Wer sich gut fühlt, fühlt sich auch eher sexuell.""

5. Arbeite daran

Er habe schon viele ältere Frauen erlebt, die neue Beziehungen eingegangen seien, deren Verlangen aber dann nach einer Zeit gesunken sei, sagt der Sextherapeut. Es sei wichtig, sich daran zu erinnern, dass man an Beziehungen und an der Libido arbeiten muss.

""Am Anfang ist Lust da, man will eine Verbindung eingehen, aber entwickelt sich schnell weiter. Und es ist ein Teil des Alterungsprozesses, dass wir nicht immer so eine hohe Libido haben"", sagt er.

""In diesen Fällen muss man sich Zeit nehmen um Möglichkeiten zu schaffen. Ihr müsst daran arbeiten.""

6. Macht euch keine Sorgen

Wenn ihr euch über mangelnde sexuelle Lust Sorgen macht, bitte lasst es.

""Es ist sowohl für Männer als auch Frauen nicht ungewöhnlich, wenn die Libido einmal einbricht"", sagt Saddington. Es könne physische Gründe dafür geben: ""schlechte Gesundheit, Müdigkeit, Unsicherheit, sich überarbeitet zu fühlen.""

Und es gebe psychologische Gründe: ""Eltern werden, Stress in der Arbeit, Depression."" Es könne eine Mischung aus allen Gründen sein und es müsse einfach auch nicht sein, dass jeder immer das gleiche Level an Lust habe.

""Es muss normal werden, dass jeder Zeiten hat, in denen er keine Lust hat. Es geht darum, wie man damit umgeht und darum, darüber zu reden. Und es nicht ignoriert oder vergisst - das ist wichtig.""

Clifford Fleming told HuffPost UK he and his friends were evacuated and he saw “lots of police with guns and ambulances and a police helicopter”.

Tom Smith, who was in South Kensington tube station shortly after the incident, said an alarm told customers to evacuate.

He said between 50 and 60 people ran into the station after the alarm.

“People were running and screaming and even running down the wrong escalator, so we assumed the worst and ran on the next Piccadilly train,” he told HuffPost.

Downing Street said the prime minister was being “kept up to date on events”.

Moderator Plasberg hat im Interview mit dem ""Spiegel"" über die Sendung mit AfD-Mann Gauland gesprochen

Eine Antwort zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit der AfD immer noch fällt

Auch Wochen nach der Wahl ist das starke Abschneiden der AfD immer noch eines der beherrschenden Themen in den Medien. ""Hart aber fair""-Moderator Frank Plasberg nennt das Resultat der Bundestagswahl im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" einen ""gesellschaftlichen Hammer"".

Nicht wenige Politiker und Journalisten haben den Medien eine Mitschuld am Erstarken der Rechtspopulisten gegeben.

Noch-Familienministerin Katarina Barley (SPD) etwa kritisierte Plasberg hart, als sie kürzlich zu Gast in dessen Sendung war. ""Mich hat das rasend gemacht"", schimpfte sie darüber, dass die Themen der AfD - Migration und Flüchtlingspolitik - so häufig Thema in den Talkshows der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen gewesen seien.

Im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" weist Plasberg die Vorwürfe zurück, ARD und ZDF hätten die AfD erst groß gemacht. Er gestand aber auch, dass ihm der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten nicht leicht falle.

Vor allem Plasbergs Schilderung des Auftritts des AfD-Spitzenkandidaten Alexander Gauland bei ""Hart aber fair"" im August offenbart, wie hilflos der Moderator teilweise der AfD gegenüber stand.

""Die spielen irgendwie anders""

""Wir ha­ben früh fest­ge­stellt, dass die ir­gend­wie an­ders spie­len"", sagt ""Hart aber fair""-Redaktionsleiter Georg Diedenhofen über die AfD im Doppelinterview mit dem ""Spiegel"". Die Rechtspopulisten hätten die Regeln verändert.

""Sie wol­len nicht ein­mal mit den an­de­ren Gäs­ten dis­ku­tie­ren, lie­ber set­zen sie sich mit dem Mo­dera­tor aus­ein­an­der, weil so die Op­fer­rol­le schnel­ler her­stell­bar ist"", erklärt Plasberg.

Für ihn als Moderator sei das ein Dilemma, weil er immer beherrscht sein müsse - und sich nicht zum Richter über den AfD-Gast aufschwingen dürfe.

Wie dieses Dilemma in der Wirklichkeit dann aussieht, sahen ARD-Zuschauer im August bei “Hart aber fair”. Zu Gast war damals der Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland. Kurz zuvor hatte er für einen Skandal gesorgt, als er sagte, die Integrationsbeauftragte Aydan Özoguz könne in Anatolien entsorgt werden.

""Wie dämlich muss man denn sein..."" - Plasberg in der Kritik

Immer wieder versuchte Gauland, den Fragen Plasbergs auszuweichen. Journalisten wie ""Welt""-Autor Thomas Schmid empörten sich hinterher, dass die “Hart aber fair”-Redaktion Gauland überhaupt eine Bühne geboten habe.

“Wie dämlich muss man denn sein, einem solchen kühl kalkulierenden Provokateur, der sich als Unschuldslamm gibt, einen derart breiten und für Gaulands Partei unbezahlbaren öffentlich-rechtlichen Wahlkampfauftritt zu verschaffen”, schimpfte Schmid damals in einem Facebook-Post.

Im “Spiegel”-Interview schildert Plasberg, die Redaktion habe das ganze Wochenende vor der Sendung mit Gauland überlegt, ob sie den Politiker ausladen solle.

Plasberg hat keine eindeutige Antwort parat

Eine eindeutige Antwort auf die Frage nach dem richtigen Umgang mit der AfD kann Plasberg nicht geben. Sollte die AfD wie jede andere Partei behandelt werden?

“Ja. Und nein”, antwortet Plasberg da. Es würden jedenfalls die gleichen journalistischen Standards gelten. Man dürfe der AfD nicht den Gefallen tun, “eine spezielle Umgangsweise für sie zu entwickeln”.

Dass AfD-Politiker als Talkshow-Gäste allerdings doch eine ""besondere Vorbereitung"" bräuchten, wie Redaktionsleiter Diedenhofen sagt, oder einen ""besonderen Energieaufwand"", wie Plasberg meint, zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten doch fällt.

Plasberg verrät auch, was die Zuschauer der Sendung nicht mehr sahen, als Gauland eingeladen war.

Gauland privat nach der Sendung

Nach der Aufzeichnung sei er zu dem Politiker gegangen und habe ihm erklärt:

""Ab heu­te bin ich je­dem böse, der die­se Par­tei wählt, nach­dem er Sie, Herr Gau­land, heu­te bei 'Hart aber fair' ge­se­hen hat.""

Gauland sei klug, rhetorisch fit, verleugne aber seine eigene Intellektualität, wenn er sage, ""er habe nicht ge­wusst, was der Be­griff ‘Ent­sor­gen’ be­deu­tet.""

Gauland habe nur dagestanden, mit einem Glas in der Hand und habe das ""mit großer Gelassenheit zur Kenntnis"" genommen.

La Nouvelle-Orléans à risque

Le niveau de la mer devrait gonfler jusqu'à 3,35 mètres et jusqu'à près de 26 centimètres de précipitations devraient tomber sur certaines régions.

La Nouvelle-Orléans, dévastée par l'ouragan Katrina en 2005 qui a causé au moins 1800 morts, se mobilisait tout particulièrement.

Située en-dessous du niveau de la mer, elle est très exposée aux inondations et subissait déjà les premiers assauts de la tempête samedi après-midi avec de forts vents et une pluie drue.

""La pire menace n'est pas nécessairement la pluie mais des vents forts et des vagues"", a précisé le maire de la ville, Mitch Landrieu.

Des habitants se hâtaient de remplir des sacs de sable tandis que d'autres obéissaient aux ordres d'évacuation, les véhicules chargés au maximum.

""J'ai vécu Katrina et je sais à quoi ça ressemble"", a confié Jackie Daigre, 69 ans, habitante de La Nouvelle-Orléans depuis 41 ans où elle a subi déjà trois ouragans.

Elle faisait quelques provisions avant que le supermarché, bondé et quasiment dévalisé de ses bouteilles d'eau, ne ferme à 15 heures.

Juanita Stovall, 57 ans, a acheté quelques conserves mais assure avoir déjà l'essentiel: ""J'ai des torches. J'ai une radio fonctionnant avec des piles. J'ai des bougies. Et nous avons des jeux"", dit celle qui n'en est pas à son premier ouragan non plus et qui prévoit de quitter la ville avec ses trois fils.

Le sud-est des États-Unis a déjà été durement frappé en août par deux ouragans: Harvey au Texas et en Louisiane, qui a fait 42 morts et causé des dégâts matériels considérables, et Irma, qui a fait 12 morts en Floride. Et l'ouragan Maria a lui laminé le territoire américain de Porto Rico, et fait au moins 34 morts.

Par précaution, des plateformes pétrolières et gazières, très nombreuses dans le Golfe du Mexique, ont été évacuées avant l'arrivée de Nate.

Dévastation en Amérique centrale

Ponts détruits, routes inondées, arbres au sol et glissements de terrain: Nate a causé d'importants dégâts lors de son passage en Amérique centrale.

Le Costa Rica, le Nicaragua et le Honduras -- pays les plus durement touchés -- commençaient à évaluer les destructions mais des villages entiers restaient coupés du monde.

Selon les derniers bilans officiels des services de secours, la tempête a fait seize morts au Nicaragua, dix au Costa Rica, trois au Honduras et deux au Salvador.

Au Costa Rica, où plus de 5000 personnes se sont réfugiées dans des abris temporaires, les secouristes recherchaient plus de 30 personnes.

Le président du pays Luis Guillermo Solis a décrété trois jours de deuil national en hommage aux victimes et a prévenu que le risque d'inondations et de glissements de terrain allait persister ces prochains jours.

Le Nicaragua semble être le pays le plus touché avec, d'après la vice-présidente et porte-parole du gouvernement, Rosario Murillo, plus de 10 000 personnes affectées par des inondations et coulées de boue tandis que des milliers de familles étaient privées d'électricité.

La région Caraïbes est encore traumatisée par des puissants ouragans -- Harvey, Irma, José et Maria -- qui ont frappé depuis mi-août, laissant des paysages de désolation et de nombreuses victimes derrière eux.

But in the wake of the Parson's Green bomb and the arrest of teenage suspects in the days following, we need to wake up to the reality of extremism.

At its core radicalisation of children is yet another form of online grooming; exploiting a child for a particular use or purpose.

So the same way parents warn their children about sexual predators online, they have a responsibility to make sure their children are aware extremists may be using the web as a tool to push their ideologies.

Our recent Cybersafe study found that in the past three years there was a 28% rise* in the amount of parents concerned about radicalisation, which reiterates that it is something we need to openly address.

Adolescence is a time where young people are particularly vulnerable as they are at their most impulsive which can leave them open to being influenced by peers, older people and the web. Not to mention, they are keen to discover their own identity and their curiosity can lead them to explore new ideas and issues online.

So where do they find radical content?

Children may choose to actively seek out the content or they could be persuaded by others. Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Ask FM have been used by extremists looking to target youngsters. Like grooming, the person may not say who they really are and their true identity may be concealed as they encourage them to embrace extreme views and beliefs.

If you have concerns about radicalisation there are number of signs you can look out for. Be mindful that a lot of the signs can be fairly common among teenagers so you should look out for increased instances of any of the below.

A conviction that their religion, culture or beliefs are under threat and treated unjustly

A tendency to look for conspiracy theories and distrust of mainstream media

The need for identity and belonging

Being secretive about who they've been talking to online and what sites they visit

Switching screens when you come near the phone, tablet or computer

Possessing items - electronic devices or phones - you haven't given them

Becoming emotionally volatile.

Script-talking - Expressing views that you feel don't sound very them and sound as though they are someone else talking.

If you have spotted any of the above signs - Here's some handy tips on tackling the subject with your child:

Be Approachable:

Let them know you're there to help them if they get into trouble online - and if they're concerned about something they can come to you.

Be calm and don't get angry

Your child is far more likely to be open and honest with you if you remain calm about the situation.

Talk to them about their online friendships.

Find out what sites they go to, where they met their online friends, how they communicate. Talk to them about being cautious about what they share with people online. Remind them that even though people they've met online might feel like friends they may not be who they say they are, and that they may have ulterior motives for befriending them

Don't be confrontational

Your child's beliefs are a sensitive subject and need handling carefully as you don't want to push them away or shut them out.

Be safe in real life

Teach your child to never arrange to meet someone they only know online without a parent present.

Encourage them to share their ideas and opinions

Many young people are often not aware of the realities and consequences of the radical ideas they have formed or the arguments against them.

Where to go if you think your child is being radicalised?

Visit www.gov.uk/report-terrorism to report illegal or harmful information, pictures or videos you've found on the internet. You can make your report anonymously.

Further information can be found at Educate Against Hate here.

You can report any concerns about online grooming to the National Crime Agency's CEOP Command

If you feel your child or another child may be in immediate danger, a threat to others - contact the police.

It's worth remarking that this is quite a distance travelled. A few years ago, government policy was staunchly against building homes for social rent. Between 2010-2016, it reduced funding dramatically and even proposed selling off the few social homes we had left.

The government deserves credit for changing its course. It's good news that it is now acting to ease the misery of at least some private renters. If delivered, the new social homes promised will benefit some of the very people Shelter exists to help - those facing bad housing and homelessness.

It's true that the £2billion worth of funding that's been put forward is nowhere near enough by itself, especially when you consider that £10billion has been put behind boosting Help to Buy - a policy that does not help those on lower incomes who are in the greatest need of support.

The government has said that an investment of £2billion will buy the country an extra 25,000 social homes for rent. This will be 25,000 precious homes for families currently languishing in homeless hostels or those barely scraping by in expensive, unstable private renting.

But the job is not done. The new investment is a fraction of what's needed to address the sheer scale of the problem. There are currently 1.2million households on council house waiting lists, so let's hope the change of heart is worth more than the money currently on offer. This must be the start and not the end of the government's building ambitions.

We will be urging the government to ensure that this shift is more significant than the numbers behind it. We hope it represents a revived commitment to build a new generation of social housing with rents that are low enough to be genuinely affordable.

What is needed now is for the government to match its new rhetoric with policies designed to cope with how bad the housing crisis has become. This means a considerable increase in funding and a long-term investment plan, plus new powers for councils to help get land into development much more cheaply.

Only time will tell if ministers have the metal to turn these ambitions into reality, and finally deliver the homes that people on lower incomes desperately need. We will be working with them and campaigning hard to make sure that happens.

Strength to you Ntsiki, all the best in whatever you decide to do from here.","COMMENT

When poet and singer, Ntsiki Mazwai took to Twitter on Friday morning, to let people know that she was also a victim of rape allegedly at the hands of kwaito star Brickz, real name Sipho Ndlovu, she was not ready for the replies that followed and neither were we.

While the comments were a mixed bag with many supporting and applauding her for speaking out, others attacked Ntsiki and questioned why she had not spoken out many years ago when the alleged rape took place.

It was these responses that were more than heartbreaking -- on the one hand, women are encouraged to speak out and report sexual abuse regardless of how long it may have been since it happened, but when Ntsiki speaks out we want to question her. How?

In July, Ndlovu was found guilty of raping his 16-year-old niece at his Ruimsug home in 2013.

During his sentencing proceedings, a letter penned by the teenager was read where she wrote about how he had broken her.

""Malume you have broken me deeply and I can't put everything that I am feeling into writing but my heart is bleeding of anger sadness and brokenness. I trusted you and treated you like my father. When I cry at night I ask myself what did I ever do for you to come and rape me,"" read parts of the letter.

It is worth noting how throughout Ndlovu's trial, the family stood by the teenager -- it was his wife who helped the victim lay charges against him, which is highly commendable.

People have been questioning Ntsiki's ""timing"" asking why she's only talking about it now -- because he's already going to jail, right?

Well, perhaps it is for that same reason that she found the courage to speak out.

It is wrong for people to want to dictate how others, especially rape victims, should deal with their pain.

How or when Ntsiki decides to speak about her experience and pain has nothing to do with us. The time rape victims take to report rape is not our business either, even if it's Ntsiki Mazwai -- that vocal woman who very often finds herself in the firing line because of her (unpopular) views.

Some of the responses to @ntsikimazwai's revelation confirm that many SA'ns don't understand rape/ sexual violence. Need to educate masses — Andile Gaelesiwe (@GaelesiweAndile) October 6, 2017

We need to understand that the veracity of Ntsiki's allegations does not lie in whether or not people believe her. With that said, people still have a choice not to believe her, but calling her names is wrong. Perhaps we could keep those opinions to self? Especially considering how rife victim shaming is our society?

Some have asked how it could be that someone like her would keep quiet for so long about the alleged incident, again, that's none of people's business. We can't assume that because she portrays herself as an independent, strong individual who's highly opinionated, then she cannot be vulnerable and scared of being victim shamed.

One of the things that hurt me was one of her comments:

Society is the ONLY reason women don't report rape — ntsikimazwai.com (@ntsikimazwai) October 6, 2017

And this could not be truer, that's why it's so sad.

I applaud people including celebrities who have come out in support of Ntsiki.

Living and pushing forward while carrying such within you must have been incredibly hard. I'm sorry Ntsiki. #IBelieveHer#BreakTheSilencehttps://t.co/ODtNFLp6qy — Portia Gumede (@portiagumedesa) October 6, 2017

@ntsikimazwai I salute you. — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) October 6, 2017

Again, whether she spoke about the alleged incident today or in another 10 years from now, still has nothing to do with anyone, it's her pain, her story, her life.

In one of her latest tweets on Saturday morning, Ntsiki hinted she could be laying charges against Brickz.

So I guess that answers everyone who questioned why she tweeted it instead of going to the police?

They say when life gives you lemons, make lemonade out of it. When Sujay Sohani lost his job in 2009 after the recession in London, he approached Subodh Joshi, his classmate at Bandra's Rizvi College in 1999. Together, they made vada pavs and turned their life around, reports Bengali daily Ananda Bazar Patrika.

A year after the economic recession, the two friends kickstarted a vada-pav stall in 2010. Seven years later, they have earned an annual turnover of 5,00,000 pounds (₹ 4.39 crore, approx) by selling the perfect quick-fix snack to Londoners.

Sohani was a food and beverage manager at a five-star hotel in London. When he lost his job, a heartbroken Sohani called his friend back in Mumbai and told him that he was so broke that he didn't even have the money to buy a vada-pav.

They didn't expect that conversation would eventually turn into an idea of a vada pao chain.

When they started off, a Polish ice-cream cafe hesitatingly allowed them to set up their new business in return for a monthly rent of ₹35,000. The duo had a hard time arranging for that money every month.

They began selling their vada pav for 1 pound (₹80) and Dabeli for 1.50 pounds (₹131). Now, their sole restaurant has turned into a chain, they take orders for weddings and parties and have added over 60 varieties of Indian street food dishes to their menu.

Immer mehr Menschen greifen zu Vitaminpräparaten anstatt zu frischem Obst und sind der Meinung, sich so gesund zu ernähren. Das ist nicht immer der Fall, denn wie eine Untersuchung jetzt zeigt, nehmen viele Menschen dadurch Vitamine in einer viel zu hohen Dosierung zu sich. Vitamine sind zwar gesund, wenn sie in der richtigen Menge zugeführt werden, oft werden sie aber viel zu hoch dosiert, wie die Stiftung Warentest jetzt herausgefunden hat.

Kaum Kontrolle

Anders als bei Medikamenten wird der Handel mit Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln deutlich weniger reguliert. Es gibt in Deutschland keine Regel, die die Dosis an Vitaminpräparaten eingrenzt, aber das ist offenbar dringend erforderlich. Jedem, der sich über einen Vitaminratgeber informiert, sollte schnell klar sein, dass zusätzliche Vitamine nicht in jedem Fall notwendig sind. Viele Lebensmittel, die täglich auf den Tisch kommen, sind mit Vitaminen angereichert, außerdem essen viele Menschen frisches Obst, wenn auch unregelmäßig. Dazu kommt, dass der Markt für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel mehr als groß ist. Wer sich mit den vermeintlich gesunden Vitaminen in Tablettenform versorgen möchte, der verliert sehr schnell den Überblick. Studien, die es zu diesem Thema gibt, sind leider oftmals nicht sehr hilfreich. Sie schüren teilweise die Angst vor Krankheiten, die entstehen können, wenn Vitamine fehlen.

Gut informiert mit der Stiftung Warentest

Die Stiftung Warentest hat sich die angebotenen Vitaminpräparate in ihrer aktuellen Ausgabe einmal genauer angesehen. Im Artikel ist unter anderem eine Tabelle zu finden, in der die 35 am häufigsten gekauften Vitaminpräparate in Deutschland aufgeführt sind. Der Leser kann sich auf diese Weise einfach, übersichtlich und vor allem ausführlich über den Namen des Produkts wie über den Preis und die empfohlene Tagesdosis informieren. Zudem bietet die Stiftung Warentest genaues Hintergrundwissen. Was ist beim Einkauf von Vitaminpräparaten besonders wichtig und welche gesetzlichen Vorgaben gibt es eigentlich für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel? Ausführlich berichtet die Stiftung Warentest zudem über die einzelnen Vitamine A, C, D, E, K sowie die B-Vitamine, und wofür der Körper sie benötigt.

Sind Vitamine als Nahrungsergänzung sinnvoll?

Rund 30 % der Menschen in Deutschland nehmen mehr oder weniger regelmäßig Vitaminpräparate zu sich. Sie fürchten sich davor, unterversorgt zu sein und dass die Ration an Obst nicht ausreicht, um den Vitaminhaushalt zu decken. In den meisten Fällen ist diese Sorge unbegründet. Leider ersetzt die Vitamintablette allein zudem keine gesunde ausgewogene Ernährung mit Obst und Gemüse. Die tägliche Dosis Vitamine kann aber auch hilfreich sein. Menschen, die krank sind oder wenn der Arzt es verordnet, können ihren Mangel an Vitaminen mit den entsprechenden Mitteln ausgleichen. Wie so oft, gilt auch hier: Die Dosis macht das Gift. Zu viele Vitamine wirken kontraproduktiv und sind nicht mehr gesund, zu wenige Vitamine hingegen lösen Mangelerscheinungen hervor.

Wer sich ganz sicher sein möchte, der sollte mit seinem Arzt darüber sprechen, welche Vitamine in welcher Menge sinnvoll sind.

'Anger rooms' are all the rage, according to an article this August in New York Times Style section that mentions three such places where people go to smash things. As one proprietor put it: ""That's the cool thing about addressing an instinct, everyone's got it.""

Anger, jealousy, envy, greed, competitiveness... all our problems are very small, but our ego magnifies them, makes them as big as it can.

There's nothing new in understanding that venting rage in a safe environment is better for you than dumping it on someone or taking it out on the brand new flatscreen. The growing popularity of anger rooms reflects the world we live in today, a world where not only is awareness growing over how to deal with anger, but also where people are taking responsibility for themselves.

What if there's another way of dealing with feelings of rage?

Here's what Osho says in response to a question about it: ""How can I be aware during anger? This feeling is so strong it's like thousands of wild horses are running away with me!

""Anger is a very small thing. If you can just wait and watch, you will not find 'thousands of wild horses.' If you can find even a small donkey, that will be enough! Just watch it, and it will go, slowly. It will enter from this side and will go out from the other side. You just have to keep a little patience not to ride on it.

""Anger, jealousy, envy, greed, competitiveness... all our problems are very small, but our ego magnifies them, makes them as big as it can. The ego cannot do otherwise; its anger has also to be great. By its great anger, and great misery, and great greed, and great ambition it becomes great.

""But you are not the ego, you are only a watcher. Just stand by the side and let all the thousands of horses pass – let us see how long it takes for them to pass. There is no need to be worried. As they come – they are wild – they will go. But we don't miss even a small donkey; we immediately jump on it! You don't need thousands of wild horses. Just a small thing, and you are full of anger and fire. You will laugh about it later on, at how stupid you were.

""If you can watch, without getting involved, as if it is something on the screen of a movie house or of a TV screen... something is passing; watch it. You are not supposed to do anything to prevent it, to repress it, to destroy it, to pull out a sword and kill it, because from where will you get the sword? – from the same source as the anger is coming. It is all imagination.

""Just watch, and don't do anything – for or against. And you will be surprised: that which was looking very big becomes very small. But our habit is to exaggerate.

""A small boy comes home running, and tells his mother – he is not more than three years old – 'mum, a great lion, roaring loudly, was running after me for miles! But somehow I managed to escape. Many times he came very close. He was just about to attack me when I started running faster.'

""The mother looked at the boy and said, 'Tommy, I have told you a million times not to exaggerate! How can you find a lion in the city... and you have been running for miles? And where is the lion?'

""The boy looked outside the door. He said, 'he is standing there. But, to tell you the truth, it is just a small dog – very small! But when it was running after me, it appeared... You tell me not to exaggerate, and right now you have been exaggerating that you have told me millions of times.'

""Our minds are very exaggerating. You have small problems, and if you can stop exaggerating and just see, then by the door a poor small dog is standing. And there is no need to run miles; your life is not in danger.

PULL: And when anger disappears without any struggle, it leaves behind it a tremendously beautiful and silent and loving state.

""When anger comes to you, it is not going to kill you. It has been with you many times before, and you have survived perfectly well. It is the same anger that you have been through before. Just do one thing new – which you have never done; every time you get involved with it, fighting. This time just watch, as if it does not belong to you as if it is somebody else's anger. And you are in for a great surprise: it will disappear within seconds.

""And when anger disappears without any struggle, it leaves behind it a tremendously beautiful and silent and loving state. The same energy that could have become a fight with the anger is left within you. Pure energy is delight – I am quoting William Blake: 'Energy is delight' – just energy, without any name, without any adjective. But you never allow energy to be pure. Either it is anger, or hate, or love, or greed, or desire. It is always involved in something; you never allow it in its purity.

""Every time anything arises in you is a great chance to experience pure energy. Just watch, and the donkey will go. It may raise a little dust, but that dust also settles on its own; you don't have to settle it. You simply wait. Don't move from waiting and watching, and soon you will find yourself surrounded by a pure energy that has not been used in fighting, in repressing, or in being angry.

""And energy is certainly delight. Once you know the secret of delight, you will enjoy every emotion; and every emotion arising in you is a great opportunity. Just watch, and bring a shower of delight on your being. Slowly, slowly all these emotions will disappear; they will not come anymore – they don't come uninvited. Watchfulness, or alertness, or awareness, or consciousness, are all different names of the same phenomenon: witnessing. That is the keyword.""

On Sept. 26, the brand posted a video on its Facebook page that features food blogger Bev Weidner explaining her method for making peanut butter sandwiches.

“Behold the brilliant peanut butter hack you never knew you needed!” Food Network captioned the video, which has more than 6 million views as of Friday afternoon.

The trick, according to the tutorial, is to spread peanut butter on parchment paper, freeze it and then cut it into slices. Weidner explained that her hack reduces the mess and keeps her from ripping the slices of bread.

“There’s this whole convenience thing with sandwiches ― little slices of meat, slices of cheese, pickle slices,” Weidner said in the video. “Why aren’t there peanut butter slices?”

Naturally, several Facebook commenters who watched the video had questions. Most pointed out that they didn't have a problem simply spreading peanut butter on the bread, which is much easier. Others offered their own lengthy (and sarcastic) ways of making other dishes. One commenter joked that the tutorial finally offered a use for parchment paper.

On the other hand, some commenters thought the critics were being too harsh. One mentioned the hack could be “a fun activity” to do with the kids and “break out of the ordinary routine.” Others noted that the idea could come in handy when using soft bread and crunchy peanut butter and could minimize the mess. Another important take was that the hack could be an ideal solution for people with limited motor skills if they received help freezing the peanut butter beforehand.

The video at least brought another sandwich problem to attention, as one commenter encouraged everyone to avoid getting peanut butter and jelly in the wrong jars and to “WIPE THE KNIFE ON THE BREAD BETWEEN APPLICATIONS!”",This Peanut Butter Sandwich 'Hack' Is Causing Quite A Stir,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-peanut-butter-sandwich-hack-is-causing-quite-a-stir_us_59d79c88e4b046f5ad97d92c

Local authorities claim that funding measures from their own budgets would mean less money to invest in new council homes or pay for running repairs on existing stock, the Press Association reports.

Jane Urquhart, who holds the housing portfolio on Nottingham City Council, said the works planned on high-rises in her area were considered “additional rather than essential” by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Empics Entertainment Sajid Javid's Department for Communities And Local Government is refusing to meet promises to fund fire safety improvements, councils claim

“We found that really difficult to understand given that in the refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament sprinklers are considered essential, so we thought it was quite incredible that they were essential for the Houses of Parliament but not essential for residents of high-rises,” she told The Today programme.

The Labour councillor said: “Safety must come at the top of the list and the works that we have considered will be done; the impact will be that fewer new homes will be built and our other housing will not have the repairs that it needs.”

Adam Hug, leader of the Labour opposition group on Westminster City Council, said his authority faced similar problems getting money from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid’s department to pay for the installation of sprinklers and removal of cladding.

“Ultimately these are things that the London Fire Brigade says have to be done and ultimately the cost is having to be borne by the housing revenue account, which is tenants’ rents and service charge fees,” he told Today.

“Councils across the country are asking the Government for the help that Sajid Javid promised and they are being told ‘no, only in exceptional circumstances when you literally don’t have the money in any form’.”

He said Westminster stood to lose about £20 million to pay for the work: “That means either 100 affordable homes can’t get built or it means that for 20 or 30 years our residents are going to not have their damp dealt with, when things break not being repaired.”

He added: “It’s a national civil emergency across the country, councils have complied with the regulations that have been there and the Government is not stepping up to the plate.”

The Guardian reported that other councils, including Croydon and Wandsworth, had also had requests for funding declined.

Poniamo che una lista vada così bene da conquistare il 40% nel proporzionale, prenderebbe 155 collegi.","I più avvezzi si esercitano, calcolatrice alla mano. Quelli che lo sono meno, chiedono delucidazioni a quelli di cui sopra. Ora che il Rosatellum bis ha preso definitivamente forma e si accinge a superare la prova delle prove, ovvero il voto dell'aula (e dei franchi tiratori), nei corridoi di Montecitorio è tutto un fare di conto.

In commissione il patto a quattro tra Pd, Fi, Lega e Ap ha retto senza alcun problema, ma d'altra parte sarebbe stato strano il contrario: zero voti segreti, zero rischi. Ma quando martedì il testo approderà nell'emiciclo, si prevede che di scrutini non palesi ce ne saranno circa una novantina. E a quel punto la disciplina di partito finirà inevitabilmente per scontrarsi con le esigenze personali. Questa legge, infatti, grazie anche ai listini bloccati nella parte proporzionale, dà molto potere ai leader di partito di stabilire chi con ogni probabilità conquisterà un seggio. Tradotto: chi per varie ragioni si sente a rischio diventa automaticamente scheggia impazzita.

Chi sta ragionando sugli scenari possibili, ha messo nel mirino soprattutto gli emendamenti che riguardano la richiesta di voto disgiunto (ossia la possibilità di votare in modo diverso per il candidato del collegio uninominale e per la parte proporzionale, facoltà non prevista in questa proposta) e le preferenze.

Quello del voto disgiunto è un tema a cui è sensibile parte della minoranza Pd come ha più volte ribadito Gianni Cuperlo. Quanto all'inserimento delle preferenze, beh, lì c'è un ""partito nei partiti"" abbastanza trasversale, che si concentra però più che altro tra i centristi.

Ma, come già accaduto sul tedesco a giugno, l'inciampo si potrebbe determinare anche su modifiche relative alle minoranze linguistiche. C'è poi il tema delle quote di genere su cui, però, come in passato, è altamente probabile che in aula si scateni una lotta altrettanto di genere con deputate da una parte e deputati dall'altra. Sulla carta, comunque, la maggioranza dispone di circa 420 voti, di franchi tiratori ce ne vorrebbero dunque un centinaio.

Ma il tema che sta dominando il dibattito politico è: chi e come è avvantaggiato da questa legge? E, soprattutto, quali scenari apre? Ed è proprio su questo punto che si concentrano buona parte delle critiche di chi avversa il Rosatellum bis. L'apertura alle coalizioni fatta ieri da Matteo Renzi non ha affatto ""ammorbidito"" Mdp. D'altra parte, il segretario Pd guarda più a Pisapia e alla Bonino che agli ex compagni di partito. Ma, anche per ragioni interne, non vuole che l'accusa di aver fatto saltare il banco venga attribuita a lui. Questa legge, risponde però D'Attorre, ""allontana la costruzione del centrosinistra"". La proposta, in effetti, prevede che si formino delle coalizioni (anche perché il 34% dei collegi è uninominale) ma non stabilisce nessun obbligo di leader e programma comune. Dettaglio che non è dispiaciuto affatto a Silvio Berlusconi.

Detto questo, il Rosatellum bis sicuramente avvantaggia chi si mette insieme rispetto a chi va da solo. Per questo il M5S, scegliendo di volta in volta un nome peggiorativo e ai limiti del buon gusto, accusa: è una legge fatta per impedirci di vincere. Stesso problema che, d'altra parte, riguarda Mdp: le possibilità di una coalizione con i dem sono prossime allo zero, la strada dovrebbe essere invece quella di un listone della sinistra. Questo ragionamento viene poi rafforzato dall'assenza di voto disgiunto.

Chi trae sicuramente vantaggio dal Rosatellum bis è la Lega, grazie al suo radicamento territoriale e alla grande spinta delle Regioni del Nord, può provare non soltanto a trattare da posizioni di forza per la scelta dei candidati nell'uninominale ma anche a fare il pieno di voti nel proporzionale. Il rischio che lì il centrodestra faccia man bassa, ha messo in allerta i parlamentari settentrionali dem che temono di ritrovarsi solo con le briciole. Specularmente, dentro Forza Italia ad agitarsi sono gli esponenti del Sud perché nel Meridione bisognerà fare i conti con i vari partitini forti sul territorio che, per portare in dote il proprio patrimonio, chiederanno collegi ""sicuri"" nell'uninominale, sottraendoli agli azzurri. Il Rosatellum bis, infatti, prevede una soglia di sbarramento del 3%, ma poiché i voti dei partiti o delle liste che non superano quel tetto vengono comunque distribuiti alla coalizione di riferimento, si capisce bene come il potere dei ""cespugli"" sia più forte. Quanto ad Alternativa popolare, ha ottenuto uno sbarramento del 3% (nel tedesco era il 5%) e anche non dovesse raggiungere quell'obiettivo potrà rivendicare qualche collegio sicuro. In più, le chance dei big del partito di entrare sono state aumentate portando a 5 le pluricandidature.

Ma l'obiezione delle obiezioni che viene fatta a questa legge è quella di puntare dritto all'inciucio, ossia a una grossa coalizione tra Renzi e Berlusconi. Ignazio La Russa lo dice esplicitamente. ""Questa legge - afferma - è studiata perché non vinca nessuno. Altrimenti non si spiega perché non preveda un premietto anche piccolo"". C'è qualcuno che il calcolo di questa questa impossibilità di ottenere una maggioranza si è preso la briga di tradurla in numeri. È il deputato Domenico Menorello, gruppo Civici e innovatori ma anche coordinatore in Veneto di Energie per l'Italia di Stefano Parisi. ""Il calcolo - spiega - è presto fatto. Alla Camera ci sono 231 collegi uninominali e 386 plurinominali. Poniamo che una lista vada così bene da conquistare il 40% nel proporzionale, prenderebbe 155 collegi. Dunque, per arrivare alla maggioranza di 316 dovrebbe vincere in 161 collegi uninominali, praticamente il 70%. Un'impresa. E del Senato non parlo proprio perché lì bisognerebbe rivolgersi a un mago"".","Il patto a quattro Pd-Ap-Lega-Fi regge.

The FDA stated the two most common types of sleep positioners feature raised supports or pillows that are attached to each side of a mat to raise a baby’s head. The positioners are intended to keep a baby in a specific position while sleeping.

They advised: “To reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths, including accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants sleep on their backs, positioned on a firm, empty surface.

“This surface should not contain soft objects, toys, pillows, or loose bedding.”

It comes amid reports that backbenchers will pressure May to “impose some discipline” and fire Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary for his repeated interventions in which he set out his own vision for Brexit.

The coup attempt follows the disastrous snap general election result and May’s difficult conference speech, which have left her so weak she appears unable to contain Johnson, leading the press to suggest he is “unsackable”.

May was forced to make a statement saying she would not go and that she was providing “calm and stable” leadership.

Davidson added there were “an awful lot of people in our party who need to settle down”.

She praised May’s “grit and determination” and hinted she found the move against her had a hint of sexism.

Una situación que en las campañas fue calificada como ""inmoral"" por Rodríguez y detonó la molestia de los ciudadanos regiomontanos,

Durante las campañas para la gubernatura de Nuevo León en 2015, el Bronco aseguró tajante que abandonar su cargo para saltar a otro (cual chapulín), era algo ""inmoral"". Pero a menos de dos años, el gobernador neoleonés pareciera haber cambiado de opinión.

El chapulineo es inmoral, no puedes dejar abandonado tu responsabilidad, no puedes hacerle eso al Estado"". Jaime Rodriguez 'El Bronco', en 2015

Una frase que los ciudadanos, organizaciones y medios de comunicación de Nuevo León le han echado en cara, luego de que El Bronco anunció que el próximo sábado 7 de octubre iniciará los trámites ante el Instituto Nacional Electoral para lanzarse como candidato independiente a la presidencia de la República.

""Si de aquí a diciembre yo logro, en Nuevo León, un número mayor de firmas que el que conseguí para registrarme como candidato independiente en Nuevo León, estaré tomando la decisión de pedir licencia por seis meses para ir a la elección, si cumplo con los requisitos que establece el INE"", dijo Rodríguez en entrevista para Radio Fórmula.

""Yo creo que sí voy a buscar esa posibilidad, primero hacer acá en Nuevo León un referéndum y creo que las firmas me darían esa posibilidad de iniciar a Nuevo León en ese sentido. Yo dije que tengo un compromiso con Nuevo León y quiero cumplirlo, pero quiero pedirle permiso a los ciudadanos de Nuevo León, no sé si me lo den"", agregó.

Entre las principales críticas en lo que va de la administración de Rodríguez, destacan los pobres resultados en materia de transparencia, combate a la corrupción y austeridad.

Así, el Bronco buscará la presidencia de la República pese a los muchos pendientes que ha dejado su administración, entre los cuales destaca su promesa de encarcelar al exgobernador Rodrigo Medina. Algo que no ha podido cumplir, luego de que el exgobernador priista permaneciera apenas 19 horas en prisión preventiva, luego de que un juez ordenara su liberación ante el incumplimiento de una suspensión provisional que congelaba la orden de detención en contra de Medina.

Un caso que fue impugnado por el gobierno de Rodríguez ante la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación, la cual desechó por ""notoriamente improcedente"" la impugnación del gobierno de Nuevo León contra las investigaciones de la Procuraduría General de la República en materia de anticorrupción.

""El encarcelamiento de Rodrigo Medina era su bandera de campaña y además, tuvo ya sus propios casos de corrupción, como el cobijagate, una compra de cobijas a precio inflado recién llegado su gobierno, en diciembre de 2015, donde se documentó un sobreprecio de cerca de 20 millones de pesos. No se castigó. Solicitó la renunica del servidor público y todavía dos años después seguimos esperando la resolución del caso"", explica Juan Manuel Ramos, director de la organización Redes Quinto Poder, en entrevista con HuffPost.

Pero el cobijagate no ha sido el único caso de corrupción en el que se ha visto involucrado el mandatario neoleonés. En septiembre, se dio a conocer que la suegra del Gobernador, Teresa Martínez, utilizó despensas que el DIF estatal entrega a una asociación civil para promoverse como aspirante a la alcaldía de Santa Catarina. El gobernador dijo que se investigaría el caso pero al mismo tiempo adelantó que no había ninguna irregularidad.

""Él tiene un gran pendiente en el tema de transparencia. Como muchos, creímos que la llegada de un gobernador que no tuviera esta atadura a partidos políticos iba a ser una cosa distinta. Pero hemos encontrado no sólo un estancamiento, sino en algunos caso ha habido un retroceso en el tema de transparencia"", agrega.

Una derrota legal que se da la misma semana que el Bronco anunció su intención formal de contender por la presidencia.

En términos de obra pública, Rodríguez tampoco ha podido concluir la Línea 3 del Metro de Monterrey, a pesar de que la adminsitración anterior dejó la obraterminada en un 80%.

Otro tema preocupante en Nuevo León, es el incremento de la violencia. De acuerdo a datos oficiales de la Procuraduría General de Justicia de la entidad, la entidad ha registrado un repunte de homicidios dolosos desde que Rodríguez asumió el cargo, siendo febrero de 2016 y mayo de 2017, los dos meses con más asesinatos en lo que va de su gestión.

La popularidad con la que el Bronco asumió el cargo también se ha visto afectada por polémicas declaraciones en actos públicos, tales como considerar que los recientes terremotos que azotaron el centro y sur del país fueron provocados por ser demasiado ""liberales"", o considerar que ""a las niñas gordas nadie las quiere"".

Todos estamos viviendo esto de los desastres naturales contra los que no tenemos defensa, evidentemente porque no hemos sido corresponsables con la naturaleza y hemos sido demasiado liberales en el tema de la fe"". Jaime Rodríguez, gobernador de Nuevo León

Y mientras el Bronco aseguró que la solicitud de firmas en Nuevo León será una especie de referéndum en que los ciudadanos aprobarán o desaprobarán su candidatura presidencial. Rodríguez requiere 864 mil 536 firmas en todo el país para poder registrarse como candidato independiente a la presidencia del país.

""Approximately half of the edible food waste are fruits and vegetables.

One group is taking that mindset to the next level, and offering up a free Thanksgiving feast in Toronto made by chefs — all from food that would have otherwise been thrown out.

As part of the city's new EDIT (Expo for Design, Innovation & Technology) festival, the global group Feedback has decided to bring their ""Feeding the 5000"" concept to Canada for the first time.

Launched in London's Trafalgar Square in 2009, and spread worldwide from there, the non-profit dedicated to eliminating food waste gets local chefs and communities involved in their large-scale endeavours. They aim to feed (you guessed it) 5,000 people, a reference to the Biblical miracle of Jesus feeding 5,000 people with five barley loaves and two fish.

In Toronto, they've enlisted chefs Joshna Maharaj, Bob Blumer, Cory Vitiello, Tyler Newsom and Nick Liu to get involved, with Second Harvest providing the 2,000 pounds of food that would otherwise be discarded, ""mostly for aesthetic reasons,"" writes organizer Tammara Soma in a HuffPost blog.

Second Harvest has been doing this kind of work for decades, but it's often behind the scenes. They retrieve food from distribution centres and deliver it to shelters and at-risk communities.

Second Harvest founders Ina Andre and Joan Clayton rescuing food in the 1980s.

""All of the food is perfectly edible. A lot of it has been mislabeled,"" Second Harvest communications director Cori MacPhee told HuffPost Canada last year. ""Some is close to its due date and therefore it isn't really economical for them to send it out to a store and have it going on to the shelf but we're able to take it and turn it around within 48 hours.""

A similar event, Trashed and Wasted, was held in Toronto earlier this year, with upscale chefs and restaurants raising money for Second Harvest by selling food made with ingredients that would have gone in the garbage.

The menu for the EDIT event, according to the Facebook invite, is almost fully vegetarian, including fall minestrone (the stock will be made with leftover lamb bones), green herb pistou and potato focaccia bread, and vegan options will be available too.

For those who already have Thanksgiving plans, but want to get in on the action, they're also hosting a chopping event on Friday night at George Brown College.

But what organizers want, more than anything, is to remind people that so much of the food that's considered garbage can in fact be put to use, something that's important to keep in mind as huge feasts are being prepared at homes across Canada this weekend.

Approximately half of the edible food waste are fruits and vegetables.

""Toronto households on average throw away about 223 kg of food per year at home, of which about 62 per cent could have been eaten,"" Soma notes. ""Approximately half of the edible food waste are fruits and vegetables. That's a huge waste of energy, water, land and labour! This massive food waste is even more shocking considering that approximately one in eight households in the city experience food insecurity.""

So this Thanksgiving weekend, as you appreciate the land of plenty in which we live, try to take a moment to think about how you're using the food you have on hand — and if it means inviting an extra guest or two or making sure you piece something together with leftovers, all the better.","Toronto Is Throwing A Free 5,000-Person Thanksgiving Meal Made From Food Waste",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/06/thanksgiving-meal-food-waste_a_23235139/

Wir machten uns damals nicht so große Sorgen. Sie war sehr blass geworden und wir nahmen alle an, sie hätte bloß eine Anämie. Charlotte war ebenso unbesorgt. Sie forderte uns sogar auf, nach Hause zu gehen, als der Arzt sie über Nacht im Krankenhaus behalten wollte.

Mit Charlotte zu streiten ist nicht immer einfach, also taten wir, was sie sagte.

Um Mitternacht jedoch bekamen wir einen Anruf vom Krankenhaus, der unser Leben verändern sollte. Und für uns begann der schlimmste Albtraum jeder Eltern.

Bei den Untersuchungen kam heraus, dass Charlotte an einer extrem seltenen und aggressiven Krebsart litt: Akuter myeloischer Leukämie. Wie erklärt man einem jungen Mädchen, das gerade die High School angefangen hat, dass sie ihr schönes goldenes Haar verlieren wird? Und dass ihr Leben nie wieder dasselbe sein wird?

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Diagnose Krebs: Diese 4 Kinder sprechen über ihre Krankheit und ihre Stärke ist inspirierend

Die Chemo brachte überhaupt nichts

Wir konnten ihr noch nicht einmal garantieren, dass sie bald gesund werden würde. Wir sagten ihr, sie hätte Leukämie und stellten sicher, dass sie wusste, was das bedeutete. Außer sehr still zu werden, reagierte sie nicht darauf. Wir fragten sie, ob sie okay sei. Sie antwortete nur: ""Es ist so, also müssen wir irgendwie damit klarkommen.""

Sie behielt diese Einstellung die ganze Zeit bei.

Am Freitag, den 31. Januar wurde Charlotte in das Royal Manchester Kinderkrankenhaus verlegt. Sie blieb dort 18 Wochen.

Nach ihrer ersten Chemotherapie beschloss ihr Krebs, sich nicht behandeln zu lassen. Es ging ihr zu schlecht, um das Krankenhaus zu verlassen. Charlotte sah mit einem Mal extrem schlecht aus und bekam jede mögliche Nebenwirkung.

Sie entwickelte eine aggressive Pilzinfektion, die ihre Leber befiel, bekam Cellulitis im Gesicht und einen undefinierbaren Hautausschlag. Die erste Chemo brachte also überhaupt nichts.

Letztendlich ging Charlotte durch drei Runden Chemotherapie - jede stärker als die letzte. Manche Behandlungen dabei waren gar nicht für Kinder gemacht.

Sie wollte immer, dass es den anderen gut geht

Charlotte durfte die ganze Zeit über nicht von der Krankenstation, aber sie schloss Freundschaften mit den anderen Kindern und ihren Eltern. Sie unterstützte sie und erklärte, wie man sich nach bestimmten Eingriffen und Behandlungen fühlen würde. Obwohl sie um ihr Leben kämpfte, spendete sie anderen Eltern Trost und ließ sie an ihrer Schulter weinen.

In Charlottes Sicht ging es immer jedem schlechter als ihr. Sie wollte immer, dass es den anderen gut ging.

Während ihres Langzeitaufenthalts im Krankenhaus sammelte sie 2000 Pfund für die Krankenstation. Sie wollte, dass sich die Kinder mehr wie zuhause fühlen.

Sie forderte freies Wlan und bessere Fernseher für alle. ""Wir sind keine normalen Kinder, wir sind manchmal die ganze Nacht wach, wir müssen kostenlos fernsehen und in Kontakt mit unseren Freunden bleiben können"", sagte sie.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Liebe Krankenschwestern, erst als mein Sohn Krebs bekam, begriff ich, wie viel ihr leistet

In dieser Zeit waren mein Mann Paul und ich selbstständig. Wir entschieden, dass Paul sich um Charlotte kümmern würde, sodass ich arbeiten und die Rechnungen bezahlen konnte. Das bedeutet, Paul blieb bei ihr von Sonntag bis Donnerstag - ich Freitag- und Samstagabend.

Nach ihren Chemotherapien war die nächste Herausforderung für Charlotte eine Knochenmarktransplantation. Sie musste dafür in ein anderes Krankenhaus gebracht werden. Trotz ihrer sonst so positiven Einstellung hatte sie dort eine schwere Zeit. Wegen des hohen Infektionsrisikos müssen die Kinder dort in isolierten Zellen bleiben. Nur ihre Eltern dürfen sie besuchen, sonst niemand.

Sie hörte nie auf, entschlossen für ihre Ziele zu kämpfen

Charlotte blieb dort acht Wochen und die meiste Zeit war ihr unglaublich langweilig. Die Kinder auf dieser Station leiden große Schmerzen und die Zimmer waren kahl und steril. Aus ihrer Frustration hat Charlotte jedoch den Antrieb gezogen, etwas verändern zu wollen.

Mit den Spendengeldern setzte sie sich dafür ein, dass die Isolationskabinen gemütlicher gemacht werden. Als sie sah, wie dieses Projekt seinen Lauf nahm, spornte sie das unglaublich an. Ich habe keinen Zweifel daran, dass ihr das beim Kampf gegen ihre schreckliche Krankheit geholfen hat.

Charlotte lebt heute mit einer Behinderung. Diesen Tribut forderte ihre Behandlung. Ihre Knie, Knöchel und Handgelenke müssen irgendwann ersetzt werden.

Trotzdem hörte sie nie auf, entschlossen für ihre Ziele zu kämpfen. Sie verpasste drei Schuljahre, schaffte es jedoch, mit ihrem Jahrgang mitzuhalten. Ihren Abschluss wird sie mit zusammen mit ihren Schulfreunden machen.

Bisher sammelte sie schon 18000 Pfund für ihre erste Krankenstation. Sie ist selbstlos, verzichtete auf Geburtstagsparties oder Geschenke und organisierte dafür Wohltätigkeitsevents.

Sie will etwas zurückgeben und anderen Kindern, die an Krebs leiden, helfen. Momentan organisiert sie eine Spendenparty zu ihrem sechzehnten Geburtstag im April nächsten Jahres. Charlotte ist unglaublich leidenschaftlich und will auf Krebs bei Kindern mehr aufmerksam machen.

Wir sind überglücklich, dass sie jetzt als Botschafterin für die Organisation Kidscan ausgewählt wurde.

Du kennst meinen Namen, aber nicht meine Geschichte. Das galt auch für die Rettungssanitäter und den Polizeibeamten, welche mich an einem warmen Sommerabend in die Notfallambulanz begleiteten.

Diagnose: F33.3

(Rezidivierende depressive Störung, gegenwärtig schwere Episode mit psychotischen Symptomen)

Die Schnittwunden am Unterarm bluteten und ich hatte die Befürchtung, dass ich an meinen Tränen ersticken könnte. Ich versuchte, mich zu beruhigen, doch es gelang mir nicht. Jeder Versuch, mich zu beschwichtigen, führte dazu, dass ich panisch nach Luft schnappte und das Weinen immer intensiver wurde. Ich spürte nun sehr deutlich, dass ich ohne Hilfe diesen Abend nicht überleben würde. Es fühlte sich wahrhaftig so an, als hätte ich den Verstand verloren. Als ob mich jeglicher gesunder Menschenverstand verlassen hätte und ich mir selbst - ohne himmlischen Beistand - überlassen sein würde.



Amnesie

Im Rettungswagen stellten mir die Einsatzkräfte noch viele weitere Fragen. Manche davon grenzten auch an Ironie. „Begleiten Sie gegenwertig suizidale Gedanken und wie geht es Ihnen?"", wurde ich mehrfach gefragt. Da meine Situation für Sarkasmus keinen Raum bot, sparte ich mir hierauf die Antworten. In der Notfallambulanz der Klinik für Psychiatrie angekommen, wurde ich von sehr freundlichem Personal begrüßt und an die diensthabende Assistenzärztin übergeben. Nach einer kurzen Anamnese wurde entschieden, dass ein Aufenthalt auf der geschützten Station der Psychiatrie ratsam wäre. Was diese Entscheidung für mich bedeutete, realisierte ich zunächst überhaupt nicht.

Zwei Pfleger des Krankenhauses baten mich, mich auf das freiliegende Bett vor mir zu legen. „Wir wechseln nun das Stockwerk"", hieß es. Kaum hatte ich mich hingelegt, fühlte es sich an, als ob sich die Gänge drehen würden. Dieses grelle Licht, dieser unverkennbare Klang der Automatiktüren, und dieser latente Gestank von Desinfektionsmittel gaben mir zusätzlich den Rest. Sie rollten mich mit meinem Bett durch die Gänge und hielten vor einer breiten, weißen Tür. Ich wurde gebeten aufzustehen und mich meiner Kleidung zu entledigen. Im Gegensatz überreichten sie mir ein Patientenhemd mit dezentem Muster. Es wurde sichergestellt, dass ich keine Gegenstände mit mir führte, mit denen ich mich hätte verletzen können.

Nun öffneten die Pfleger die geheimnisvolle breite, weiße Tür und schoben mich, samt meinem Bett in das Zimmer. Der Raum wirkte kühl und steril. Auf der rechten oberen Seite befand sich eine Videokamera. Ich war zu erschöpft, um noch weitere Eindrücke aufzunehmen, denn inzwischen war bereits ein neuer Morgen angebrochen.

Ich habe nur sehr wenige Stunden schlafen können, als mich um neun Uhr morgens der diensthabende Stationsarzt begrüßte. Auch er stellte mir Fragen zu meinem Wohlbefinden, meinen psychotischen Gedanken und zu meinen suizidalen Absichten.

Ich erinnere mich wie gestern: Ich blickte diesem Arzt nur fragend in die Augen, schüttelte mit dem Kopf und sagte nur „Ich verstehe nicht"".

Einmal Hölle und zurück - ich erzähl dir meine Geschichte.

Die Szene seht ihr oben im Video

Ein Mitglied der Jungen Union (JU) hat auf dem Bundestreffen der Parteijugend für einen Eklat gesorgt. Diego Faßnacht fragte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) am Samstag, ob sie bereit sei, ""den Weg frei zu machen für einen inhaltlichen und personellen Neuanfang"".

Die Mehrheit der Delegierten reagierte mit Buhrufen. Lediglich die bayerischen Delegierten applaudierten.

""Vollkommener Kontrollverlust""

Die Kanzlerin sei für einen ""vollkommenen Kontrollverlust"" der Behörden in der Flüchtlingskrise verantwortlich, kritisierte Faßnacht, der aus dem Rheinisch-Bergischen Kreis stammt, dem ehemaligen Wahlkreis des früheren CDU-Bundestagsabgeordneten Wolfgang Bosbach.

Er habe den Eindruck, dass Merkel entweder nicht bereit oder nicht mehr in der Lage sei, eine Trendwende für die Union zu erreichen. Merkel ging auf die Rücktrittsforderung nicht direkt ein, sondern entgegnete, sie fühle sich durch das Wahlergebnis ""demokratisch legitimiert"", eine Regierung zu bilden.

Merkel kündigt Jamaika-Verhandlungen an

Die CDU-Chefin erklärte auf dem ""Deutschlandtag"" auch, sie wolle ""neue Köpfe"" in ihrer Partei berücksichtigen. Eine öffentliche Personaldiskussion werde sie aber derzeit nicht führen.

Zudem habe sie auch in der Vergangenheit darauf geachtet, dass junge Köpfe in Partei und Regierung Verantwortung hätten. Bestes Beispiel sei der Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Finanzministerium, Jens Spahn. Er hatte am Vorabend kaum verborgen heftige Kritik an ihrem Kurs geäußert. Spahn sei Staatssekretär ""ja nicht geworden, weil ich ihn verstecken wollte"", sagte Merkel.

Die Kanzlerin kündigte in ihrer Rede zudem erstmals offiziell Gespräche mit FDP und Grünen über eine Jamaika-Koalition an.

Es werde schwierige Verhandlungen geben, aber es gehe darum, eine verlässliche Regierung zu bilden, sagte Merkel am Samstag beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union in Dresden. Über einen Koalitionsvertrag werde ein Sonderparteitag entscheiden.

Giovanni Maria Flick, per nove anni giudice della Consulta ed ex ministro di Grazia e Giustizia con Romano Prodi, più che entrare nel merito del Rosatellum bis in discussione alla Camera, preferisce parlare del metodo. ""Sono perplesso perché mi sembra che tutti gli sforzi siano impiegati per varare una legge elettorale che non si ponga l'obiettivo di trovare un equilibrio tra governabilità e rappresentatività, ma che abbia come scopo primario di eliminare e comprimere l'avversario. Assisto solo a polemiche su 'penalizza Tizio, Caio o Sempronio'. Politicamente è legittimo ma questo distorce l'obiettivo"".

Si riferisce al Movimento 5 Stelle?

Io dico che il dibattito su questa legge è tutto orientato così. Il M5S dice 'ci state ammazzando', gli altri dicono che non è vero, si lamenta anche Mdp.

Come si trova l'equilibrio tra governabilità e rappresentatività?

L'obiettivo della legge elettorale è quello di trovare un sistema che trasformi i voti in seggi, cercando un equilibrio tra due sistemi che possono a loro volta condurre a degli sbagli: con un eccesso di proporzionalismo si privilegia solo il tema della rappresentatività, con un eccesso di maggioritario c'è una ricerca di governabilità e stabilità che può compromettere la rappresentatività.

Ma il Rosatellum bis è proprio un sistema misto di maggioritario e proporzionale.

È vero, questo è un sistema misto, ma il problema è come sono mescolati gli ingredienti, non si allontana il sospetto che la legge sia fatta soprattutto per combattere l'avversario. Mi pare si usi la legge elettorale come arma politica di scontro tra i partiti, a cominciare dalla fissazione di una soglia. È certamente giusto che ci sia, ma se io la calcolo basandomi sulla percentuale di quei partiti che voglio penalizzare o favorire non faccio gli interessi dei cittadini. I padri costituenti, a Dio piacendo, non inserirono il sistema elettorale nella Carta perché temevano si irrigidisse troppo, ma nessuno immaginava che le regole potessero cambiare a ogni stormire di foglia. Con queste motivazioni poi, mi chiedo se la gente capisca, è difficile anche per uno che un po' di diritto lo mastica come me. E poi, la piantassero di usare quei termini latini che non si capisce se vogliono essere romantici o buffi. Fanno il paio con la intitolazione di tanti decreti legge sull'Italia che cresce, vola, avanza.

Molti degli oppositori di questa legge la definiscono incostituzionale. Da ex giudice cosa ne pensa?

La Corte ha sempre sottolineato che la Costituzione non prende posizione sull'alternativa tra proporzionale e maggioritario. Non è vero che la Costituzione è tendenzialmente proporzionale, infatti la Corte costituzionale ha riconosciuto la legittimità di leggi maggioritarie. Qui, però, per esempio c'è il problema delle liste bloccate: organizzare le cose in modo che, nonostante le apparenze, la scelta in realtà non la fa l'elettore ma il partito è totalmente negativa. E non mi dicano che ci sono le primarie, perché per come sono organizzate da noi non mi pare che siano testimonianza di vera democrazia. E poi c'è un altro problema.

Quale?

Con questo collegio misto, senza voto disgiunto, se esercito la mia libertà di scelta nell'uninominale, voto anche le altre persone che sono nel listino e che sono designate dai partiti. In passato c'è stato un eccesso e una deformazione delle preferenze, per cui hanno finito per essere oggetto di iniziative della criminalità. Però adesso che abbiamo abolito le preferenze, la Corte ci ha ricordato che anche un eccesso di distacco tra elettore ed eletto è contrario al principio di rappresentatività.

Giuristi e professori che si erano già riconosciuti nella battaglia anti-Italicum, sostengono che un sistema proporzionale sarebbe più adatto. Condivide?

Il sistema proporzionale per chi si occupa della materia è quello che ha meno rischi di incostituzionalità; il maggioritario corre più rischi ma anche un eccesso di proporzionale può favorire frammentazione e questo pone un problema di governabilità. Detto questo, la rappresentatività dovrebbe forse avere una priorità, anche se di poco, ma tra i due criteri forse è più giusto sacrificare entro certi limiti la governabilità.

A questo punto la domanda che tutti si pongono è: andrà in porto questa legge? Nonostante i suoi dubbi, questo è auspicabile?

Ho perso la palla di vetro proprio ieri... No, scherzo. La politica deve produrre una legge elettorale, altrimenti rinuncerebbe all'atto di nascita del proprio modo di esprimersi. Ora noi abbiamo due tronconi che sono il frutto di due sentenze della Corte. E voglio ricordare che si è arrivati a questo punto dopo il Porcellum, che sembrava fatto apposta per avvelenare i pozzi e sfavorire la parte avversa, e dopo una legge elettorale, l'Italicum, che era stata pensata solo per la Camera dando per scontato che la riforma costituzionale andasse in porto. Poi questo non è successo e siamo rimasti tutti con il cerino in mano. Eppure si era detto che era uno dei sistemi migliori del mondo, ricordo anche che è passato con il voto di fiducia, non dimentichiamoci mai le premesse di quello che è stato pomposamente chiamato Italicum. Sarebbe comunque problematico votare con due tronconi risultato dell'attività della Corte, non è normale. Così come non è normale che sappiamo che si vota in primavera ma non sappiamo ancora con quale legge.","Giovanni Maria Flick all'Huffpost: ""La legge elettorale viene usata come arma politica di scontro fra i partiti""",http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/10/07/giovanni-maria-flick-allhuffpost-la-legge-elettorale-viene-usata-come-arma-politica-di-scontro-fra-i-partiti_a_23235825/?utm_hp_ref=it-homepage

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives.
Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""
And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""
The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer.","The addiction we never even think about.

We're helplessly, hopelessly hooked. Virtually all of us have an insatiable thirst for some of the most fantastically addictive products humanity has ever invented.

These are products we rarely think about in terms of being addicted, because everyone uses them, and we largely take them for granted. They are products which fuel our busy lifestyles, yet which ironically now threaten them.

The products are fossil fuels, and this is the story of one man doing his utmost to cut them from his life.

Peter Kalmus is a climate scientist with NASA's jet propulsion lab. We profiled him in our climate change podcast Breaking The Ice a little earlier this year. As we said then, despite his line of work, Kalmus is unlikely ever to take a jet anywhere ever again.

Kalmus started giving up fossil fuels a few years ago now. Through a mixture of dietary, transport and other lifestyle changes, he's cut down to about 10 percent of the fossil fuel he once consumed.

The really amazing thing about cutting back?

If Peter Kalmus is any guide, it might just make you a whole lot happier.

Kalmus is living a much more satisfying life without fossil fuels than he ever dreamed. He's incredibly upbeat in person, and that attitude shines through in his new book Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate Revolution.

If you could stop global warming with a smile, Kalmus would have frozen years ago.

The book's title says it all. Peter Kalmus really is being the change. He's being the internal change, living his best life by farming bees in his backyard, cycling to work, and skipping exhausting work trips interstate and abroad. And he's living the external change, doing his bit for the climate system, and through it, the earth.

For Kalmus, personal and global transformation are intertwined: As he writes in the intro to Being The Change:

""Global warming touches every aspect of our lives. It connects gardening to population growth, bicycling to flying in a plane. Most of all, global warming challenges us to rethink humanity's place in the web of life on this beautiful planet -- to reimagine what it means to be human. Global warming is, perhaps first and foremost, a failure of humanity's collective imagination.""

And as he told us in the podcast:

""Increasingly I sense that people are gaining an awareness that the social media, the flying around and the career pressure, all the running around and the rat race and the speed that life has taken on, that somehow we've been misled, that something isn't quite right. ""We're consuming more than ever and yet life seems less satisfying than ever. So all I'm saying is if we look inside ourselves a little bit more instead of consuming, maybe slow down a little bit instead of speeding up. And that plays into using less fossil fuels, which are kind of there to make us zoom around really fast.""

This really is a book like no other.

Climate science literature is often too dense, difficult or depressing. As Kalmus points out, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report was a whopping 4,852 pages. Who's going to read that?

Kalmus makes it easy for us. He sums up the science in 34 pages. His stated goal is to ""give the context necessary for a basic understanding of the global warming that's happening at this moment, but not to overwhelm you with more than that"".

And he pulls it off. For example, his description of the greenhouse effect is simple enough for anyone to understand:

""Greenhouse gases like CO2 act like a blanket warming the planet. We need this blanket. Without it the Earth's average surface temperature would be −18°C (0°F) and there could be no life as we know it. So the greenhouse effect per se is not a bad thing. The problem is that by burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere we're causing the blanket to become warmer. By 2014 we'd already in creased the atmospheric CO2 fraction by 43% over pre-industrial levels, and this increase is accelerating exponentially.""

The climate section is about 10 percent of the book. The rest is mostly about Kalmus' personal transformation. It's often pretty funny stuff. Wait till you read about Kalmus family holidays with their beaten up old car which runs on veggie fuel. It's not quite the Griswolds, but it's close.

It's not preachy or narcissistic. Phew.

Personal transformation books are often trite exercises in ego-driven vanity. Being The Change is not that. It's one guy's journey, written honestly, openly, with gallons of facts underpinning it all.

Kalmus has an easy, optimistic style which makes you want to hang out with him.

Not all of us are going to give up flying overnight like he did. We'll likely still be racing around tomorrow living our fossil fuel-charged lives. But who knows? Maybe we'll be inspired to make a small change or two. And that, says Kalmus, is the thing he hopes for.

As he writes:

""I'm aware that the changes I'm making to my daily life will not solve global warming or stave off global economic collapse. How could they? We're rapidly approaching eight billion people on the planet, and I am only one of them. However, my actions do make me happier, and that's reason enough to do them. I also suspect that for most of us, individual and local-scale actions are the most skillful means to effect global-scale change. This is a paradox of scale. Our individual actions don't make much of an immediate difference in the global response to our predicament, but they are pieces in a vast puzzle. As more pieces get added, more people will get excited by the emerging picture and begin to add their own pieces. The prevailing mindset in our industrial society is to search for a silver bullet solution, some brilliant techno-fix that allows us to avoid personal change (which is assumed to be undesirable). After decades of searching by the world's brightest minds, however, it seems likely that there is no such silver bullet. Personal change will therefore likely be necessary.""

And as Kalmus has shown, personal change is so much more than ""necessary"". It can be enjoyable too.

L'élection de Trump a exacerbé les tensions

""L'élection du président Donald Trump a mis beaucoup de gens très mal à l'aise, à l'idée qu'il peut, à lui seul, autoriser l'utilisation des armes nucléaires"", a elle-même déclaré la directrice de l'ICAN, Beatrice Fihn, critiquant le fait que le nouvel occupant de la Maison Blanche avait montré qu'il ""n'écoute pas"" toujours les experts.

Interview with Beatrice Fihn, Executive Director of ICAN, coming very soon! Stay tuned. #NobelPrize #NobelPeacePrize pic.twitter.com/GR4d8Eh167 — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 6, 2017

""La guerre froide est si loin derrière nous que nous ne pouvons plus accepter ces armes"", déclare Beatrice Fihn, directrice exécutive de l'ICAN.

L'arrivée de Donald Trump à la Maison blanche a certes exacerbé les tensions avec la Corée du Nord et l'Iran. Le président américain a d'abord désavoué l'accord sur le nucléaire iranien. Lors de sa campagne, il parlait même de ""déchirer cet accord"".

Selon lui, Téhéran n'aurait pas respecté les termes du plan, qui prévoyait de garantir le caractère pacifique et à usage civil du programme nucléaire iranien, contre une levée sur dix ans des sanctions internationales qui frappent le pays depuis plus de trente ans. Mais l'exercice du pouvoir a minoré sa belligérance et l'homme a préféré opter pour de nouvelles sanctions. Pour l'instant.

Le président américain doit s'exprimer ""dans les jours à venir"" sur le sujet, alors que la Maison Blanche cherche un moyen d'accroître la pression sur Téhéran sans faire voler le texte en éclats.

D'un autre côté, c'est bien sûr la Corée du Nord qui inquiète. En août, le régime de Pyongyang affirmait vouloir tirer quatre missiles sur l'île américaine de Guam, dans le Pacifique, déclarant que seule la force fonctionne avec Donald Trump, ""un gars qui a perdu la raison"".

""La Corée du Nord ferait mieux de ne plus proférer de menaces envers les Etats-Unis"", avait rétorqué Donald Trump, promettant ""le feu et la colère, comme le monde ne l'a jamais vu jusqu'ici"" en cas de poursuite des actions belliqueuses de Pyongyang. Donald Trump a même rappelé que l'arsenal nucléaire américain était ""plus fort et plus puissant que jamais auparavant"".

De plus, le club très fermé des puissances nucléaires n'a cessé de grossir. Malgré le Traité de Non-Prolifération nucléaire (TNP), quatre Etats se sont dotés officieusement de la bombe nucléaire: le Pakistan, l'Inde, Israël (qui n'a jamais ni confirmé ni démenti détenir l'arme atomique), non signataires du traité, et plus récemment la Corée du Nord, qui s'est retirée du TNP en 2003.

L'""encouragement"" du comité Nobel

Mais où était l'ICAN quand la Corée du sud se préparait au pire, tout en apprenant à constituer un kit de survie antinucléaire? Où était la coalition quand il a fallu calmer les envolées de Trump et de Kim Jong-Un? Qu'a-t-elle soufflé à l'oreille du président américain quand ce dernier a désavoué l'accord sur le nucléaire iranien?

Récompenser l'ICAN peut paraître surprenant à l'heure où la menace nucléaire est la plus grande. Mais le comité Nobel a prévenu:

""Le prix de la paix cette année est incontestablement un encouragement (aux non-signataires, ndlr) de rester fidèles à leurs obligations liées au traité de non-prolifération dans lequel ils se sont engagés à atteindre l'objectif d'un monde dénucléarisé"", a souligné Mme Reiss-Andersen.

Ce prix Nobel est avant tout un encouragement et un coup de projecteur inespéré pour cette jeune coalition, née en 2007, qui réunit dans des dizaines de pays des centaines d'organisations humanitaires, environnementales, de protection des droits de l'homme, pacifistes et pour le développement. A travers des actions de lobbying et des manifestations, elle tire la sonnette d'alarme pour réclamer ""l'élimination"" des armes nucléaires.

Ce combat acharné a permis à l'organisation de remporter une première importante victoire symbolique en juillet à l'ONU, lorsqu'une cinquantaine de pays ont lancé la signature d'un traité bannissant l'arme atomique.

Sa portée reste certes limitée, en raison du boycott du texte par les neuf puissances nucléaires (Etats-Unis, Russie, Royaume-Uni, France, Chine, Inde, Pakistan, Israël et Corée du Nord), qui possèdent au total environ 15.000 armes nucléaires. Les occidentaux accusent notamment les défenseurs du traité de ""naïveté"" face à la menace nord-coréenne.

""Nous n'en avons pas encore fini. Le travail ne sera pas terminé tant qu'il y aura des armes nucléaires"", a d'ailleurs affirmé à l'AFP Beatrice Fihn. Encore un prix Nobel décerné avant que l'action du lauréat n'ait eu les répercussions attendues, comme ce fut le cas en 2016. Le président colombien avait alors été récompensé pour ses efforts en faveur du processus de paix dans son pays, malgré l'échec du référendum. Depuis, le processus a été relancé, avec des progrès notables.

Doch Doug Sosnik, einer der renommiertesten Politikstrategen des Landes, glaubt: Trump wird wiedergewählt werden

Im Video oben seht ihr, warum zudem ein vorzeitiges Ende von Trumps Amtszeit unwahrscheinlich

Was soll man noch schreiben, über einen Mann, der auf jedem Meter derart aneckt, dass die ganze Welt erzittert? Über Donald Trump, der sich mit seinem Rassismus, seiner Kriegstreiberei und seiner Unfähigkeit zu Regieren zum unbeliebtesten US-Präsidenten der Neuzeit gemacht hat?

Doug Sosnik hat diese Frage in einem Artikel für die ""Washington Post"" für sich beantwortet: Er schreibt, dass Donald Trump seine Wiederwahl im Jahr 2020 gelingen wird. Obwohl 56 Prozent der US-Bürger ihn für ungeeignet halten, sein Amt auszuführen. Und obwohl Trumps Beliebtheitswerte am Freitag wieder einmal auf ein Rekordtief fielen.

Sosnik war jahrelang Top-Berater des ehemaligen US-Präsidenten Bill Clinton. Er ist als Politstratege für die Demokratische Partei in den USA tätig.

Laut ihm gibt es gleich vier Gründe, warum Trump sich Hoffnungen auf eine zweite Amtszeit im Weißen Haus machen kann:

Grund 1: Trump braucht keine Mehrheit für den Wahlsieg

Die Mehrheit der US-Amerikaner hat Donald Trump nicht gewählt. Seine Konkurrentin Hillary Clinton hat bei der Wahl drei Millionen Stimmen mehr bekommen als der jetzige US-Präsident.

Trump gewann, weil es bei Wahlen in den USA darum geht, mehr Wahlmänner und -frauen für sich zu gewinnen als der Gegner.

Und das tat Trump. Mit Wahlsiegen in wichtigen Staaten wie Florida, die besonders viele Wahlmandate stellen. Doug Sosnik argumentiert nun: Bei der Wahl im Jahr 2020 könnte Trump auf die gleiche Weise gewinnen. ""Trump weiß, dass die absolute Mehrheit zu gewinnen keine Voraussetzung ist, sondern höchstens ein Anspruch"", schreibt Sosnik.

Tatsächlich seien aber zwei der letzten drei Präsidenten ohne absolute Mehrheit gewählt worden: George W. Bush - und eben Trump.

Grund 2: Die Politikverdrossenheit in den USA hilft Trump

Das Vertrauen in die Politik ist in den USA schwer beschädigt. Nicht nur die Demokraten haben damit zu kämpfen, sondern auch die Republikaner. Donald Trumps Wahlsieg war Ausdruck dieses Frusts, dieser Wut auf das politische Establishment in Washington.

Sosnik schreibt, dass diese Stimmung im Land die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöhe, dass 2020 ein dritter, unabhängiger Kandidat sich um den Posten im Weißen Haus bemühen werde. Außerdem könnten noch weitere Kandidaten vom politischen Rand das Duell von Republikanern und Demokraten stören.

""So ein breites Kandidatenfeld könnte dafür sorgen, dass die Anti-Trump-Front aufgespalten wird"", schreib Sosnik. ""Das würde ihm die Wiederwahl sichern, wenn seine Anhänger gleichzeitig weiter zu ihm halten.""

Grund 3: Trumps Beliebtheit wird unterschätzt

Und danach sieht es aus.

Zwar sehen nur 32 Prozent der US-Bürger Donald laut einer Umfrage der Nachrichtenagentur AP Donald Trumps Präsidentschaft derzeit positiv - doch Sosnik glaubt, dass Erhebungen wie diese Trumps Beliebtheit unterschätzen. So würden die Umfragen alle Wahlberechtigten berücksichtigen. Und nicht nur diejenigen, die tatsächlich als Wähler registriert und gewillt sind, zur Wahl zu gehen.

Hinzu kommt laut Sosnik: ""Viele Wähler wollen einfach nicht offen zugeben, dass sie Trump gewählt haben und unterstützen.""

Grund 4: Der fanatische Kern von Trumps Anhängerschaft

Dem harten Kern von Donald Trumps Anhängerschaft geht das anders. Sie halten eisern und lautstark zu ihrem Präsidenten. Egal, was dieser macht. Sosnik erinnert in diesem Zusammenhang daran, dass Trump einmal im Wahlkampf sagte, er könne mitten auf der Fifth Avenue in Manhattan jemanden erschießen, und seine Fans würden weiter zu ihm halten.

Und noch einer weiteren Gruppe an Anhängern könne der US-Präsident sich gewiss sein: ""Denen, die ihm weiter die Treue halten, weil sie fest davon überzeugt sind, dass er das System in die Luft jagen und echte Veränderungen bewirken wird.""

Sosniks Fazit: In einem gespaltenem Land wird Trump gewinnen

Ob Trump dies gelingen wird, bleibt höchst fraglich. Auf jeden Fall hat der US-Präsident mit einer Rekordfülle an politischen Traditionen in den Vereinigten Staaten gebrochen. Warum sollte er also nicht wiedergewählt werden, obwohl er so unbeliebt ist, wie noch nie ein Präsident zuvor?

Für Sosnik ist klar, dass Trump dies in einem politisch gespaltenem Land gelingen kann. ""Wenn die Demokraten Trump schlagen wollen, müssen sie sich hinter einem Kandidaten vereinen"", schreibt der Wahlkampf-Stratege.

Soll heißen: Einen innerparteilichen Grabenkampf, wie er 2016 zwischen Hillary Clinton und dem Senator Bernie Sanders stattfand, können sich die Demokraten bei der nächsten Wahl nicht erlauben.

Die Demokraten dürfen Trump auf keinen Fall unterschätzen, warnt Sosnik. Er schreibt: ""Es wäre ein Fehler zu glauben, Trump könnte 2020 nicht gewinnen. Genau so, wie es ein Fehler war zu glauben, er würde erst gar nicht Präsident werden.""

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a problem that exists in many men. However very few are willing to acknowledge that they have a problem, even though it can cause immense personal distress and even shatter relationships. Much has been said by experts urging couples to seek help, especially since most cases of ED are treatable. Here, however, I would like to touch upon a less known aspect of erectile dysfunction—the fact that it is often one of the first signs of an underlying serious medical condition.

ED and heart problems

A large number of patients experience erectile dysfunction about two years before the onset of a heart attack. This is because the blood vessels in the heart and penis are similar, except that the ones in the penis are 1cm wide while those in the heart are 3cm. When arterial plaque buildup begins, it is the 1cm blood vessels that tend to get blocked first, affecting a man's ability to get or sustain an erection.

Today, erectile dysfunction is more prevalent than we would like to believe and even more worrying is its rising incidence amongst those below 50 years of age.

The diabetes link

In patients with undiagnosed diabetes, poor control of blood sugar damages nerves and blood vessels all through the body. People with diabetes usually have other associated clinical conditions such as being overweight or obese, or suffering from hypertension, or they could be smokers, all of which are risk factors on their own for sexual dysfunction.

Neurological disease

ED is often the first apparent symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that causes nerve damage and results in pain and impaired coordination. MS damages the signal system that runs along the nerves of the spinal cord, interrupting signals that the brain sends to the sexual organs. As a result, men with MS often experience erectile dysfunction or delayed ejaculation.

***

Today, erectile dysfunction is more prevalent than we would like to believe and even more worrying is its rising incidence amongst those below 50 years of age. I have observed the onset of andropause, or male menopause, in men as young as 30, when earlier this was more prevalent in the 40-45 years age bracket. A number of reasons are to blame for this, including stress, work pressure and leading an unhealthy lifestyle.

The point I want to make is this: if you do experience ED more often than you would consider normal, consult a medical professional at the earliest. The benefits of this timely intervention are twofold—the doctor will evaluate you and find the most suitable treatment option, and he or she can also investigate if your ED is a sign of another underlying medical condition.

Depending on the patient's age, lifestyle and medical history, treatment for erectile dysfunction varies and could consist of counselling, oral medication and intrapenile injections. In the event that these do not work, penile prosthetics are another option, successfully helping patients achieve and sustain an erection. Most problems affecting male sexual health are treatable, with higher success rates seen in recent years.

For once, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was on target in its understanding of the economic tangle the Centre has knotted itself in and more importantly, in offering suggestions to untangle the mess emanating largely from the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime. For once, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was off the mark on both the counts.

Modi seemed obsessed with cleaning up the fiscal structures when the problems called for solutions that had little or nothing to do with his fixation over the repatriation of black money stashed away abroad and the ""benami sampatti"" (ill-gotten wealth) laws. Micro, small and medium entrepreneurs agonised over the procedural glitches GST brought with it and exporters felt threatened from being squeezed out of a competitive market thanks to the huge taxes they were called on to pay. Consumers were again burdened with the additional but substantial hikes in the cost of just about everything during a festive season.

Doubtless, Modi spoke like a quintessential RSS ""pracharak"" (whole-timer), a role he never disowned or discarded even after the paterfamilias ""loaned"" him to the BJP.

But when Modi broke his silence on the state of the economy while addressing the Institute of Company Secretaries on October 4, his speech sounded like a tutorial in moral philosophy. He quoted from the Mahabharata and invoked Chanakya to remind the audience that Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, was aware and knowledgeable about religion but chose not to walk the righteous path. Modi also said that the author of the ""Arthashastra"" had warned that just as a spark could light up and destruct an entire forest, a flawed individual demolished a country's integrity. Therefore, to eliminate the undesirable characters, he had embarked on a ""cleanliness"" campaign. Chalk talk that might have brightened up faces if the economy's fundamentals were strong and right.

Doubtless, Modi spoke like a quintessential RSS ""pracharak"" (whole-timer), a role he never disowned or discarded even after the paterfamilias ""loaned"" him to the BJP. The RSS has always cloaked its political ambitions and agendas in sacred writ that sounds resolute about what's right and wrong in its world view. Earning wealth per se is acceptable. But tweaking the system in ""dishonourable"" ways to secure wealth is not. The certitude has a veneer of pretence because from its origin, the RSS drew its core support from the traders living in provincial towns who didn't exactly adhere to the rule book when conducting business.

The RSS was obsessive about ""cleansing"" corruption which is why the high-decibel campaign it carried out on the Bofors gun deal with VP Singh as the face of morality when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister resonated with the urban and semi-urban voters.

However, the RSS ""sarsanghachalak"" (supremo) Mohanrao Bhagwat figured out that if he had to sound credible in an ambience of near-despair over slackening growth and job losses, he must offset ethics with pragmatism. This is just what Bhagwat did when he addressed the RSS on the occasion of ""Vijayadashami"" at Nagpur on September 30.

He lauded the government for ""controlling"" corruption. But in a wake-up call to Modi, he cautioned that an ""integrated and holistic policy"" would have to factor the needs of ""industry, agriculture and environment"" as well as protect the interests of medium and small industries, small retailers, farmers and the landless. These are diverse sections but they are not disparate because they are linked by a chain in the economy that threatens to come apart under the weight of demonetisation and now, the GST.

Prodded by Bhagwat and scorched by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha's attack on the mismanagement of the economy, Modi and his Finance minister Arun Jaitley sat up and resorted to damage-control. However, these were not the only inputs shaping their reflexes.

Modi is off to poll-bound Gujarat on October 7. The textile traders and jewellers of his home state are seething over GST and the mandatory use of PAN cards for purchases in excess of Rs two lakh for months. The BJP directed its MPs to address these constituents and assure them of ""solutions"". In the absence of a concrete response, the traders and jewellers, loyal to the party since 1995, warned they would boycott voting or root for the Congress. More pertinently, after the bellicose Patels recently disrupted BJP president Amit Shah's meetings in Gujarat, Shah was privy to information that they planned to display black flags before the PM.

Shah curtailed his Kerala sojourn and rushed to Delhi to meet Modi and Jaitley before the GST council met. The outcome was a slew of palliatives the government unveiled for the traders and consumers on the eve of Modi's Gujarat visit, hoping to neutralise their opposition.

In the absence of a concrete response, the traders and jewellers, loyal to the party since 1995, warned they would boycott voting or root for the Congress.

Interestingly, amidst this political churn, Modi refused to turn his focus away from the morality of fighting corruption. Just as Arjuna's gaze resolutely remained fixed on the eyes of a bird his teacher Dronacharya had set up while teaching him martial art in the Mahabharata, Modi only saw the virtues of demonetisation.

On October 5, the government issued a press note, stating that 13 banks had supplied information on the financial operations and post-demonetisation transactions of over two lakh companies blackballed by the Registrar of Companies earlier this year. The companies were being scrutinised by the investigators, it said. The move was billed as a ""major breakthrough"" in the government's ""fight"" against black money in the hope that the ""country and its honest citizens may well look forward to a cleaner tomorrow"".

Le visage de Che Guevara exprime autant la fermeté (face aux Etats-Unis) que la confiance (en l'avenir de la révolution), la négligence (barbe, cheveux longs au vent) que le sérieux de l'engagement (l'étoile de commandant sur son béret)"".

Mais à qui profite le business de cette image omniprésente sur les produits du quotidien?

L'idée fructueuse d'un éditeur italien

L'histoire de ce célèbre cliché remonte au 5 mars 1960. Le photographe cubain Alberto Korda capture le visage de Che Guevara à La Havane, durant l'enterrement des victimes de l'explosion du cargo français La Coubre. Selon le site juridique Le Village de la Justice, la photographie est restée dans les archives de Korda pendant sept ans, après que le journal cubain ""Revolución"" a refusé de la publier.

C'est en 1967 que le cliché ressort: Korda a en effet offert un tirage à l'éditeur italien Giangiacomo Feltrinelli. Celui-ci décide d'en faire imprimer un million d'exemplaires à la mort du Che, assassiné par l'armée bolivienne. Alberto Korda, lui, autorise la libre utilisation de la photographie et n'a pratiquement jamais perçu aucun royalties.

En 1968, l'artiste irlandais Jim Fitzpatrick retravaille la photographie pour la styliser. Il n'a, lui non plus, jamais touché d'argent pour son oeuvre, non protégée par un copyright, précise Agoravox. Face à cet absence d'encadrement juridique, l'image a donc été utilisée et exploitée sans fin par les marques.

C'est seulement en 2000 qu'Alberto Korda décide d'attaquer en justice la marque de vodka Smirnoff, pour s'opposer à l'utilisation de son oeuvre dans leur campagne publicitaire. L'artiste évoque une atteinte au nom et à la mémoire du Che. Il expliquait:

""En tant que partisan des idéaux pour lesquels Che Guevara est mort, je ne suis pas opposé à sa reproduction par ceux qui souhaitent propager sa mémoire et la cause de la justice sociale à travers le monde, mais je suis catégoriquement contre l'exploitation de l'image du Che pour la promotion de produits comme l'alcool, ou pour tout autre objet qui dénigre la réputation du Che"", relate l'Obs.

Le site Le Village de la Justice précise que ""ce litige aurait fait l'objet d'une transaction à hauteur de 50.000$"" (environ 43.000 euros ndlr).

L'éternel combat des héritiers

A la mort de Korda en 2001, ses enfants deviennent les héritiers des droits de la photo. Un article de La Dépêche, datant d'octobre 2007, indique que sa fille, Diana Diaz-Lopez, ""multiplie avec succès les procès pour contester l'utilisation abusive de ce cliché"", y compris en France.

Contactée par Le HuffPost, Joëlle Verbrugge, avocate, photographe et auteure du blog www.droit-et-photographie.com explique: ""Korda, de son vivant, avait manifesté son accord pour des utilisations qui restaient dans l'esprit révolutionnaire du sujet de la photo. Ce n'est qu'après son décès que ses héritiers ont multiplié les procédures. C'est ce qui explique que dans les procédures actuelles, les magistrats prennent parfois le temps d'examiner si l'utilisation faite de la photo entre ou non dans un champ qui aurait pu être admis par l'auteur"".

En 2004, Diana Diaz-Lopez avait attaqué l'organisation non gouvernementale Reporters Sans Frontières et avait remporté la bataille. RSF relate sur son site internet: ""La procédure avait pour objet de 'faire cesser et d'interdire la publication, la diffusion et la commercialisation' de cette photographie, dont un pastiche devait être utilisé par Reporters sans frontières dans le cadre d'une campagne visant à sensibiliser l'opinion publique sur la liberté de la presse à Cuba"".

En septembre 2007, elle avait aussi poursuivi l'Union sportive d'Ivry Handball, condamnée à payer ""5000 euros de dommages-intérêts à Diana Diaz-Lopez, plus 3000 euros à la société Légende, détentrice des droits d'exploitation du cliché, plus enfin 5000 euros au titre des frais de justice"", relate l'article de La Dépêche.

La fille du photographe estimait en effet que l'oeuvre avait été reproduite sans autorisation et dénaturée. Sur la campagne de publicité du club, la tenue initiale du Che avait été remplacée par le maillot du club local.

Ainsi, de nombreuses marques ont surfé sur la popularité des objets du quotidien à l'effigie du Che, et se sont appropriées l'image: Louis Vuitton, Converse, Gap, Urban Outfitters, et même Mercedes Benz, rapporte le site Dazed. Le constructeur automobile avait d'ailleurs provoqué un tollé, notamment auprès des exilés cubains de Miami, et avait été contraint de s'excuser par la suite.

Les stars telles que Jay-Z, Johnny Depp et le Prince Harry ont arboré l'incontournable t-shirt imprimé de son portrait, et même Madonna s'en est inspirée pour la pochette de son album ""American Life"". Sur le site de vente en ligne Ebay, plus de 43.000 objets en rapport avec le Che sont vendus.

L'écrivain et journaliste Christopher Hitchens a analysé cet engouement auprès d'Agoravox:

""L'admiration pour Che Guevara revêt aujourd'hui une dimension romantique qui occulte ses idées politiques. Sa personnalité est complexe; il était à la fois exemplaire et arrogant, provocateur et réfléchi, impitoyable et humaniste, idéaliste et extrémiste, communiste mais électron libre, idéologue mais dénué de toute diplomatie et calcul politique. Ces contradictions sont séduisantes. Le statut d'icône du Che vient du fait qu'il a échoué. Son histoire est une histoire de défaite et d'isolement. C'est un révolutionnaire qui n'a plus ni griffes ni crocs; il incarne une révolte qui ne blesse personne. Aurait-il vécu plus vieux, aurait-il été associé au pouvoir, le mythe du Che serait mort depuis longtemps"".

Une lucrative société basée à Chypre

L'avocate Joëlle Verbrugge précise au HuffPost que désormais, les droits patrimoniaux, à savoir ceux qui concernent l'exploitation de l'oeuvre elle-même et les autorisations à donner pour qu'elle puisse être reproduite, ont été cédés par la veuve d'Alberto Korda à une société établie à Chypre, gérée par son fils.

Pour pouvoir utiliser la photographie sur les divers objets de la vie quotidienne, ""les sociétés commerciales doivent demander une autorisation préalable et bien sûr négocier le montant des droits d'auteur, poursuit l'avocate. Ce montant va varier en fonction du type d'utilisation, la durée, l'étendue géographique etc. En outre, la société basée à Chypre n'est pas obligée d'accepter la cession"".

Pour l'heure, ""les juridictions françaises considèrent que la photo est toujours protégée par le droit d'auteur (et n'est donc pas encore tombée dans le domaine public)"", développe Joëlle Verbrugge. Un vif débat existe d'ailleurs quant à ce sujet. L'auteure du blog www.droit-et-photographie.com détaille: ""Même si celle-ci tombe dans le domaine public, d'autres actions en justice resteront possibles, mais cette fois pour les seuls aspects moraux du droit. C'est-à-dire à chaque fois que la photo aura été publiée sans le nom de l'auteur (ce qui est fréquent, voire systématique) et/ou modifiée"".

La signora le stringe la mano: ""Apprezzo il suo coraggio e la sua onestà"", le dice. Il giovane è più rock: ""Vai Emma, ora pure i ministri fanno lo sciopero della fame, tanto hanno già 'mangiato'"". Sul treno che la porta a Foggia, per un'altra affollatissima assemblea per la campagna ""Ero straniero"", la leader radicale, già ministra degli Esteri e Commissaria europea, parla, in questa intervista concessa all'HuffPost, dei temi più caldi dell'attualità politica che la vede al centro di corteggiamenti politici (""madre della patria"", la definisce Michele Emiliano a Foggia, tra gli applausi) in tutto l'arco del centrosinistra: Giuliano Pisapia, il Pd, e altro ancora. Non svicola, non è nella sua natura, ma Emma Bonino è per il ""noi"" e non per l'""io"": ""Sarò vintage - dice - ma credo ancora nell'importanza dei partiti, e noi Radicali siamo abituati a dibattere, magari 'azzuffarci' ma alla fine scegliamo insieme. Sarà così anche per le prossime elezioni"". Intanto, spiega dove pianterà la sua ""tenda"", metafora prodiana per definire la collocazione politica, e soprattutto perché.

Ius soli, ""Ero straniero"": quelle che sembravano battaglie di testimonianza stanno diventando temi centrali nel dibattito politico. Emma Bonino dove pianterebbe la ""tenda""?

""La pianterei, la pianteremmo come Radicali, su una legge elettorale decente, che non c'è, pianteremmo la nostra tenda su una agibilità politica ed elettorale possibile anche per chi non è già in Parlamento, cosa attualmente esclusa"".

Perché?

""Il numero delle firme da raccogliere, a mano con l'autenticatore da poi consegnare si suppone digitalizzate, sono all'incirca 180 mila. Riuscirci, in breve tempo, è un'impresa impossibile. Ma questo non è un problema dei Radicali, è un problema dei cittadini, è un vulnus del nostro sistema democratico. Io non so in quale Paese, a qualche mese dal voto, non si conoscono le regole, le date. È come se 'chi c'è c'è, chi non c'è non c'è', e chi c'è a ogni elezione si confeziona la legge di sua o di loro convenienza. Questo è un degrado. Ora, io non arrivo a pretendere di prendere esempio dalla Germania o dalla Francia, dove vige la stessa legge elettorale, lo stesso sistema istituzionale da tempi immemorabili, ma per lo meno si presti ascolto a quanto chiesto persino dalla Commissione di Venezia sulla good governance democratica, e cioè che da quando si cambia la legge elettorale a quando si va a votare passi almeno 1 anno, dando il tempo a chi vuole partecipare di organizzarsi e ai cittadini di leggerla"".

Non sembra questa la strada percorsa da gran parte delle forze politiche presenti in Parlamento: la discussione è sul Rosatellum sì o no. Come definirebbe la discussione?

""Un incubo. Rischiano di fare peggio tornando al proporzionale, come se non avessimo mai vissuto i guasti prodotti. Noi Radicali siamo per i collegi uninominali all'inglese o doppio turno alla francese, mentre in Italia, dopo un giro dell'oca, stiamo tornando alla casella iniziale, il proporzionale, con le preferenze ovviamente, con l'aggravante che tutto questo s'inserisce in una situazione nella quale, attualmente, le due leggi, quella che vale per la Camera e quella per il Senato, sono talmente contraddittorie per cui alla Camera si ha il premio alla lista, al partito, mentre al Senato va alla coalizione. Non basta: lo sbarramento alla Camera dovrebbe essere il 3% e al Senato l'8%, e diverso è anche il numero di preferenza alla Camera e al Senato. Il risultato è che ci possiamo scordare la governabilità. Viene da sorridere amaro nel pensare che qualcuno diceva, 'vogliamo un sistema per cui la sera che si vota, a urne chiuse sappiamo chi governerà'. Questo gioco stucchevole di spostare le pedine è davvero poco interessante, io lo trovo solo stucchevole, anche se i 'retroscenisti"", gli addetti alla dietrologia in servizio permanente, la pensano diversamente. Si può anche decidere di giocare una partita, noi Radicali non siamo mai stati extraparlamentari o anti-istituzionali, ma si deve essere messi in grado di decidere a bocce ferme e qui non ci stanno neanche le bocce e quelle che ci sono girano di giorno in giorno"".

Lei parla con il ""noi"", ma questa domanda vuol essere molto personale. Quando si avvicinano le elezioni, Emma Bonino viene evocata, ""corteggiata"" politicamente, accostata a ruoli di governo. Bonino come un valore aggiunto di una lista elettorale. Sarà pure strumentale, per￲ò...

""Il però è essenziale. Non sono alla ricerca del miele. E poi vorrei sommessamente far notare che saremmo pure piccoli, ma io sono una militante attiva di una variegata famiglia Radicale, direi di buona tenuta negli ultimi cinquant'anni. Non è mia abitudine né mia vocazione di muovermi 'uti singuli'. Avrò un sapore di antico, per fortuna, ma noi facciamo ancora i congressi come si deve, i comitati o la direzione con tutti i criteri. Tutto questo avrò pure sapore di antico, ma per me è un buon sapore. In questa fase stralunata, in cui tutti, più o meno, pensano che basti un clic, un tweet, ridare invece corpo alla politica - e la campagna 'Ero straniero' va in questa direzione - a me pare un dato fondamentale da tenere. Si discuterà al Congresso il da farsi, ma in questo momento siamo impegnati soprattutto a garantire agli italiani la possibilità di scegliere, sulla base di una legge decente e di una accessibilità democratica non proibitiva che oggi è negata da una legge escludente che spinge agli inciuci. Le regole non si barattano con i posti. Saremo strani, ma noi siamo fatti così"".

Poter decidere. Questo vale anche per la legge sullo ius soli. Da leader storica dei Radicali, come vive gli scioperi della fame annunciati da ministri e politici vari?

""Stiamo scoprendo troppo tardi che la politica non è solo l'aritmetica e che a una posizione conservatrice, da tempo si doveva contrapporre una analisi e una proposta diversa di gestione di questo complessissimo problema che è l'integrazione e la mobilità globale. Su questo il ritardo è stato enorme e a creare confusione ci si sono messi anche diversi esimi colleghi giornalisti, per cui sembra che lo ius soli venga dato direttamente sui barconi, insieme col salvagente. Ora, anche se con colpevole ritardo, un po' di gente, anche con livello di responsabilità, si sta accorgendo che se si continua a seguire una politica che si identifica con l'aritmetica, questo non va bene. Sia chiaro: io non sto affatto sottovalutando il problema di avere una maggioranza, dico per￲ò che reazioni tempestive avrebbero forse creato anche un clima diverso attorno ad una vicenda che non è stata gestita. Io continuo a sentirmi addosso l'onore e l'onere, ahimè, di aver fallito, ma di aver proposto un referendum per la modifica della Bossi-Fini nel lontano 2013, salvo che siamo arrivati solo a 300-400mila firme. Non è che allora avessi la palla di vetro: basta guardare un attimo fuori dal Grande Raccordo Anulare, alzare lo sguardo verso il Sud del Mediterraneo, leggere qualche cifra, per capire che non si trattava di un fenomeno emergenziale dell'estate 2013, ma era un problema strutturale. Non è un caso che l'Italia sia uno dei pochi Paesi che non abbia lo 'ius culturae"", perché quello su cui oggi si discute non è lo 'ius soli', perché lo 'ius soli' intende che se tu nasci in un Paese di quel Paese sei cittadino. Il nostro è uno 'ius soli' ultramoderato, per cui si deve essere figli di almeno un genitore italiano, aver abitato in Italia per almeno sei anni, aver fatto un percorso scolastico, etc. Uno 'ius soli' molto rigoroso, persino troppo da certi punti di vista"".

Il ministro Alfano non la pensa così.

""Alfano, per l'appunto. Lui sostiene che è una buona legge ma inopportuna. Inopportuna, deduco, dal punto di vista elettorale. Ma se ogni problema va assoggettato alle esigenze elettorali, a partire dalla legge elettorale, allora francamente la situazione in termini di assunzione di responsabilità e di guida del Paese non è brillante"".

Lei sta girando l'Italia in lungo e in largo per la campagna ""Ero straniero"". Che Italia ha potuto testare in questo tour?

""Ho testato assemblee molto partecipate ma che in parte sentivi avverse. E per￲ò alla fine se hai la pazienza e la voglia di far ragionare, non dico che cambino idee ma che comincino a pensare, questo sì. L'importante è dare l'input, le informazioni diverse in modo che le persone possano poi farsi un'opinione. Se invece l'input è uno solo, fatto peraltro di stereotipi, di falsità del tipo 'ci rubano il lavoro', 'ci portano le malattie"", mancavano giusto le zanzare... Il fatto è che tutte le volte che la politica annaspa, il metodo del capro espiatorio è il più facile, peccato che sia anche il più inutile. L'altra cosa che mi fa impazzire èil senso di paura che viene fomentato"".

La paura sembra essere divenuta una categoria della politica.

""Purtroppo è così. Ora, ci sono milioni di persone che hanno paura del buio o dell'aereo ma non per questo abbiamo fermato gli aerei, abbiamo cercato di renderli più sicuri"".

""Quando si parla di Mediterraneo e di migranti è inevitabile almeno un accenno alla Libia. L'Italia ha puntato sul premier Serraj.

""Per la verità, più che su Serraj, che non controlla neanche il quartiere in cui abita a Tripoli, l'Italia, per contenere i migranti, ha puntato, e pagato, le milizie, solo che non ha i soldi per pagarle tutte, sono centinaia, e allora, come sta avvenendo a Sabratha, quelle che non sono state pagate si rivoltano e nella città, dove prosperava il traffico di esseri umani e si arricchivano gli scafisti, è esplosa la guerra civile. Francamente non credo che pagare le milizie aiuti la stabilizzazione della Libia o ponga fine alla vergogna dei lager spacciati per centri di accoglienza"".","Emma Bonino: ""Dove non si conoscono regole e date a pochi mesi dal voto?

Rethinking the plump orange fruit

Yup, pumpkin is a fruit, not a vegetable! Pumpkins belong to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, melons, squash, and gourds. Pumpkin is an extremely nutritious food with lots of health-promoting properties. Going beyond pumpkin pie, there is no shortage of mouth-watering pumpkin recipes, so getting more pumpkin nutrition in your diet is easy, whether it's in salads, soups, desserts, preserves or baked goods like muffins or quick breads. To make it easier, nothing could be more straightforward than seasoning it with a little butter and cinnamon and baking it like you would a sweet potato.

Pumpkin nutrition. Check it out...

Pumpkin is rich in fibre, iron, vitamin B3/niacin, alpha and beta-carotene, vitamin E, lutein and zeaxanthin, and potassium.

One cup of cooked pumpkin [baked, boiled, and roasted] has an impressive:

52 calories (very low)

3 grams of fibre

13 gm of carbohydrate

1.48 milligrams of iron

595 mg potassium

5.4 mg beta-carotene

7 mg alpha-carotene

2.5 mg lutein & zeaxanthin

2 mg vitamin E

No doubt the first food that comes to mind when potassium is mentioned is bananas, thank you banana marketing boards, kudos. But there are loads of other potassium-rich foods out there, not the least of which is pumpkin. The same one-cup measure has a whopping 565 mg of potassium, more than a large banana. Potassium is an under-appreciated mineral; more potassium and less sodium = healthy blood pressure and less cardiovascular disease risk. In fact getting more potassium is more important than lowering sodium intake.

Carotenes are awesome in so many ways too. As a group, they give several plants their respective colours, lycopene is red (tomatoes), lutein is yellow (corn, avocado), and alpha and beta-carotene are orange (pumpkin, mango, peaches, carrots etc).

Carotenoids are anti-cancer and anti-inflammation superstars. They help to reduce the risk for several cancers and the carotenoid lutein helps to reduce the risk for age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause, and one of the most preventable forms, of blindness in those over 50 years of age.

One cup of pumpkin has a boat-load of these awesome carotenoids: 5.4 mg beta-carotene and 7 mg of alpha-carotene and 2.5 mg lutein & zeaxanthin. Take my word for it — that's a lot.

5 delicious health benefits of pumpkin

Cardiovascular disease: Eating more plant foods has been shown over and over to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease — high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease — because plant foods provide a plethora of protective compounds like phytonutrients and blood vessel-loving minerals like potassium and magnesium. Get more heart-loving pumpkin with this warming Pumpkin Soup with Almonds and Sage.

Immunity: Plant foods help the immune system stay strong so that it can respond quickly and adequately to fight off invaders like viruses and bacteria. The immune system is even responsible for killing different types of cancer cells as they form, however, to be vigilant, the immune system needs good nutrition to keep it in tip-top shape. Phytonutrients such as beta and alpha-carotene help it do just that. For something different, try this Pumpkin Pie Smoothie for a twist on the classic Thanksgiving dessert.

The phytonutrients found in pumpkin such as alpha & beta-carotene and lutein show a lot of promise when it comes to protecting our noggins.

Eye health: As an antioxidant, beta-carotene appears to protect the lens from oxidation, helping to reduce the risk for cataracts. Lutein, on the other hand, is concentrated at the back of the eye in the macula where it helps to reduce the risk for macular degeneration by filtering out harmful blue light. The more lutein in your diet, the more lutein in the macula and the better protection your eye has. Nourish your eyes with this amazing Pumpkin Lasagna.

Dementia and cognition: Nutrition plays a huge role in the health of the brain. What we eat and drink affects the structure of the brain which, in turn, affects its function and this is no truer than with dementia and cognition. Several nutrients have been shown to nourish the brain and the phytonutrients found in pumpkin such as alpha and beta-carotene and lutein show a lot of promise when it comes to protecting our noggins. Loving your brain is easy with this simple Roasted Pumpkin and Garlic side dish (personally, I'd load it up with rosemary as well).

Blood pressure: As mentioned above, higher intake of potassium is crucial for a blood pressure-lowering diet. To be specific, the ratio of potassium to sodium appears to be more important than the amount of sodium in your diet, a ratio that is naturally found in diets that include a lot of plant foods and little processed foods. Because most of us don't get enough potassium, a focus on getting more plant foods is the best place to start and these Pumpkin Bran Muffins make it easy to do so.

El expresidente del Gobierno español Felipe González ha asegurado que él hubiera suspendido al Gobierno catalán por violentar la Constitución y el Estatuto de Cataluña tras aprobar las leyes de transitoriedad y del referéndum, y que hubiera tratado de evitar la vía judicial como respuesta.

González realizó estas declaraciones en un encuentro con periodistas en Berlín, donde participa en el 25 aniversario de la muerte del excanciller socialdemócrata alemán Willy Brandt.

El expresidente español criticó al Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy por no actuar y consideró que no hay motivos para solicitar una mediación internacional.

""Yo hubiera suspendido a los responsables que han violentado la Constitución y el estatuto de autonomía en sus funciones y hubiera tratado de excluir la vía penal y la vía de los jueces"", aseguró González, que recalcó que sólo habla en su nombre.

Otegi ha clausurado hoy en Vitoria la Conferencia Política de EH Bildu que ha aprobado con un respaldo de un 98% un documento que aboga por la creación de la República Confederal de Euskal Herria, que englobaría tres realidades administrativo-institucionales: la Comunidad Autónoma de Euskadi, la Comunidad Foral de Navarra y los tres territorios del País Vasco francés.

El expresidente de la Generalitat Artur Mas ha subrayado hoy que pasará ""tiempo"" entre una eventual declaración de independencia, que es solo una ""formulación política"", y el momento en el que Cataluña pueda funcionar ""de forma independiente"".

Tras su entrevista publicada este viernes en el Financial Times, Mas ha hablado con Eldiario.es sobre el proceso soberanistas catalán y ha asegurado que ""no hay un solo país que pueda funcionar de manera independiente de la noche a la mañana"".

Sin concretar cuáles son los próximos pasos, Mas ha afirmado que ""el debate está en cómo se aplica de forma eficaz una declaración que lleve al funcionamiento de un Estado independiente"" y ahí es donde ""hay que aplicar criterio político, inteligencia política, intuir las reacciones del adversario"".

Mas ha subrayado, asimismo, que ""para contar votos"" solo hay dos maneras: O a través de un referéndum aceptado ""por todas las partes"", cosa que recalca que ""no ocurrió el 1 de octubre"", o a través ""de unas elecciones"" que sean ""realmente plebiscitarias"".

El movimiento ciudadano denominado '¿Parlem? ¿Hablamos?' está convocando, a través de las redes sociales, manifestaciones a favor del diálogo ante ayuntamientos de toda España, el próximo sábado día 7, pidiendo que se acuda con ropa, carteles y manos blancas y se dejen de lado las 'banderas'.

A través de redes como Facebook, Twitter y Whatsapp, dicho movimiento está difundiendo un llamamiento a concentrarse el sábado, a través de un manifiesto en el que se subraya que 'es hora de decir que España es un país mejor que sus gobernantes', que 'han sembrado el odio, nos enfrentan y nos dividen'.

'Si no intervenimos como sociedad, España se convertirá en un país difícil de habitar. Por eso, debemos dar un paso adelante toda la ciudadanía y salir el próximo sábado, con ropa blanca, lazos y carteles blancos, para mostrar que no queremos que nos utilicen, nos enfrenten y nos mientan, que somos muchos más y que esto no lo resuelven ellos, sino la gente, el diálogo y la convivencia', se añade en el manifiesto.","En directo: Rajoy asegura que el Gobierno impedirá que la DUI ""se plasme en algo""",http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/10/07/en-directo-convocadas-manifestaciones-a-favor-del-dialogo-en-toda-espana_a_23235777/

Je nachdem, wie dunkel unsere Haare, unsere Augen, unsere Haut ist und ob und wie muslimisch wir sind. All diese Abstufungen spielen für uns Migranten zunehmend eine größere Rolle.

Alles dreht sich um die ""Abgehängten""

Die Wahl hat uns nun eine noch klarere Vorstellung darüber gegeben, wo in Deutschland wir besonders damit rechnen müssen, herabgestuft zu werden, von einem dieser Wähler diskriminiert oder beleidigt zu werden.

Und wir werden misstrauischer, da diese Wähler auch in den meisten unserer Nachbarschaften sind.

Es geht immer nur um die Abgehängten beziehungsweise die in ihrer eigenen Wahrnehmung Abgehängten, neuerdings die ""kulturell Abgehängten"", deren Sorgen und Nöte. Und was ist mit uns Migranten?

Auf einer wissenschaftlichen Konferenz zu den ""Gefühlen der Migration"", auf der ich vorletzte Woche als Referentin eingeladen war, standen auch wieder deren Sorgen und Nöte im Vordergrund, weniger die von Migranten. Wir müssen nun mit Schrecken vernehmen, dass die AfD den Deutschen ihr Volk zurückgeben will.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Lieber eine Fremde im fremden Land, als fremd in der Heimat - warum ich Deutschland verlassen möchte

Die AfD wird sie jagen, die Parteien, die nun die pluralistische Demokratie repräsentieren. Die Linke hat sie zum Teil bereits gekapert: Auch am Wahlabend wiederholt die Spitzenkandidatin, dass man in der Flüchtlingspolitik Fehler gemacht habe und nun die Quittung erhalte.

Die CSU treibt sie vor sich her: auch hier wird bereits am Tag danach die Obergrenze ganz oben aus der Schublade gezogen, wobei das ja durchaus der CSU-Linie entspricht, das darf man nicht vergessen. Und die CDU und Angela Merkel?

Sie arbeiten - gemeinsam mit der SPD - ohnehin bereits seit mehr als einem Jahr daran, Deutschland ""vor Flüchtlingen zu schützen"". Es ist unfassbar, wie sehr alle Seiten ausblenden können, was aktuell etwa in Libyen passiert.

AfD-Wähler sind keine Dumpfbacken - oder?

AfD-Wähler seien ja keine ""Dumpfbacken"" heißt es jetzt von Experten, wir müssen mit ihnen reden. Aber worüber soll man mit ihnen reden? Etwa darüber, dass es nicht in Ordnung ist, das ""deutsche Volk"" davor schützen zu wollen, vollends ein ""Mischvolk"" zu werden?

Wann hört man endlich damit auf, kryptisch von Sorgen und Nöten zu sprechen und sagt offen, dass es diesen Wählern zu einem großen Teil tatsächlich darum geht, den Deutschen ihr Volk zurückzugeben?

Wann wird das offen in der Debatte artikuliert und darüber nachgedacht, warum in einem Land wie Deutschland mit dieser Geschichte - die gerade mal zweiundsiebzig Jahre her ist - weiterhin völkisches Denken existiert und sich nun offen und provokant artikulieren darf?

Warum haben alle Angst vor denen und stellen sich ihnen nicht klar und deutlich entgegen?

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Offener Brief an Alexander Gauland: Alle nennen Sie einen Nazi, aber die meisten sehen nicht, was Sie wirklich sind

Solange das nicht so ist, ist es unvermeidlich, dass bei den Migranten, genau wie Mitte der Neunziger, als Asylheime und die Häuser von türkisch-stämmigen Migranten brannten, trotz der rührigen ""Lichterketten"", Aus- und Abgrenzungsgefühle aufkommen werden.

Und ist es nicht verständlich, dass sich viele fragen werden, wie sehr sie ihren Mitbürgern und Politikern, auch wenn diese zu den ""guten"", ungefähr 87 Prozent des Wahlvolkes und der Gewählten gehören, trauen können, dass sie solidarisch zu ihnen stehen und sich nicht ""jagen lassen"" von dem bösen Greis und seinem kuriosen Tross?

Dass nicht auch sie, oder viele von ihnen, ganz tief im Innern denken, es stimme ja schon, dass dunkle Menschen, muslimische Menschen und letztlich auch die ""europäischen Südländer"" eigentlich nicht wirklich dazugehören, wenn es hart auf hart kommt?

Dass sie eben doch nicht deutsche Eigenschaften, deutsche Kultur, ""deutsches Blut"" besitzen, welche eigentlich dazu berechtigen, die Segnungen Deutschlands genießen zu dürfen? Das führt zu Entfremdungsgefühlen, aber auch zu Trotz und Widerstandswillen.

Und die Geflüchteten? Wie fühlen die sich in einer Gesellschaft, die zum einen aus Menschen besteht, die sie in sozialpädagogischem Übereifer begleiten und betreuen, sie mit Makramee-Kursen, Theaterprojekten und Museumsbesuchen beglücken - neben der substantiellen Hilfe, die sie ihnen bieten -, und jenen, die sie als Gefahr für den Bestand ihres Volkes sehen und denen, die mit letzteren ins Gespräch kommen wollen?

Welches Gefühl wird bei ihnen hängenbleiben, gerade bei jenen, die irgendwann auch Teil des ""deutschen Volkes"" werden wollen?

Macklemore's incredible performance of 'Same Love', along with his other hits at last weekend's NRL Grand Final, was a wonderful moment of cathartic release for so many people across Australia who have been campaigning so hard over the past weeks for marriage equality.

The song focuses on love, which unites us as humans, and the freedom that comes when we're all recognised as equal under the law. Also, it is simply a beautiful song, performed with genuine feeling.

Music plays such a powerful role in our lives and can be an inspiration in so many ways. We use it to celebrate good times with friends and families, at special occasions and, of course, at weddings. Hopefully, with the campaign continuing and everyone doing all they can to get people to post back their 'yes' votes, there will be many more of those being planned for the end of this campaign!

This Sunday, for those in Sydney, there is an opportunity to continue to celebrate our Australian values of a 'fair go' for all with a Street Party in Taylor Square from 2pm. The event will include John Paul Young performing his classic hit 'Love is in the Air', along with live performances from artists such as Alfie Arcuri, Peking Duk and Ricki-Lee.

It will be a great chance to come together, have some fun and keep up the positivity and joy which has marked our campaign. We didn't ask for this survey but we will make sure that we stand together through the process, united, supporting each other.

If you're not in Sydney this weekend, it's still a great time to get some friends and neighbours together for a barbeque or party and listen to some music to keep your energy up and take inspiration from a great playlist.

We have heard stories about people all across Australia -- from Brisbane to Broome -- who have invited friends and families over to do just this and to celebrate the campaign for marriage equality at the same time.

When we look back, let's make sure that we know we did absolutely everything possible to win this reform that means so much to so many Australians.

We have now reached the half-way point of this campaign. We have heard that many survey forms have been returned to the Australian Bureau of Statistics but there are still many more that need to be posted back.

This is a good time to ask people you know whether they've received their survey, as it's very easy to ask the ABS for one if it's gone astray. Check that everyone has definitely posted back their 'yes' because you haven't voted unless you've posted, so make sure it's not buried under a stack of bills or sitting in a handbag or gym bag. It is also a good time to check in with those friends and family members who might be overseas -- have they arranged to get their 'yes' sent in or asked you to do it on their behalf?

This campaign has been an unprecedented experience for Australians. The response from everyday people from across this country who have come together to show their support has been very moving.

We still need to keep up this energy and momentum but we can have fun while we're doing it. When we look back, let's make sure that we know we did absolutely everything possible to win this reform that means so much to so many Australians.

Russland-Experte Boris Reitschuster schreibt ihm zu seinem Ehrentag einen Brief - mit 10 ungewöhnlichen Geburtstagswünschen

Lieber Wladimir Wladimirowitsch,

ich kenne Sie seit mehr als anderthalb Jahrzehnten persönlich; noch länger verfolge ich Ihr Wirken, habe mehrere Bücher darüber geschrieben.

Zu Ihrem heutigen 65. Geburtstag möchte ich Ihnen diese 10 Wünsche mit auf den Weg geben:

1. Dass Sie den Kontakt zur Realität wiederfinden

Macht macht selbst in demokratischen Ländern einsam. Absolute Macht, wie Sie sie haben, koppelt einen von der Wirklichkeit ab.

In Ihrer Umgebung traut sich niemand mehr, Ihnen unangenehme Wahrheiten zu sagen.

Etwa, dass Ihr Auftritt als Sänger und Pianist vor laufenden Kameras nur peinlich war.

Sie erklären Ihren Vertrauten morgens die Welt, die erklären die Welt dann genau so den Chefredakteuren – und abends sehen Sie im Fernsehen genau die Welt, die Sie am Morgen selbst entworfen haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie die Stärke finden, kritische Stimmen nicht mehr zu unterdrücken.

Das wäre zumindest ein erster Schritt.

Für eine grundlegende Rückkehr zur Realität, die ich Ihnen von Herzen wünsche, wäre allerdings die Erfüllung meines zweiten Wunsches notwendig.

Mit 65 Jahren sind sie bereits fünf Jahre über dem Renteneintrittsalter von russischen Männern, und auch wenn Sie Deutscher wären, dürften Sie jetzt bald mit dem Arbeiten aufhören.

2. Ich wünsche Ihnen: Gehen Sie in den Ruhestand

Fast 18 Jahre lange ein und dieselbe Arbeit zu machen, ist auch für weniger qualifizierte Jobs wie Arzt oder Professor ein langer Zeitraum; 18 Jahre an der Spitze Russlands ist für sie als Regierender sicher ebenso ermüdend wie für die Regierten.

Sie haben einmal gesagt, sie würden so hart arbeiten wie ein Sklave auf einer Galeere. Wählen Sie die Freiheit, schmeißen sie ihr Ruder weg!

Sie legen damit nicht nur die Einsamkeit der Macht ab.

Sie lassen immer verbreiten: Russland ist umzingelt, und meinen damit die NATO. In Wirklichkeit sind Sie umzingelt. Von Schönrednern und Claqueuren.

Befreien Sie sich!

3. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie endlich Ihre KGB-Brille ablegen können

Sie haben beim Geheimdienst gelernt, die Welt klar in Schwarz und Weiß zu teilen, in Freund und Feind.

KGB-Offiziere im mittleren Dienst wie Sie wurden darauf abgerichtet, überall Verschwörungen und Verrat, Provokationen und Angriffe zu wittern.

Viele Ihrer weltgewandteren Kameraden haben das abgelegt.

Ihre Politik zeigt, dass Sie bis heute in diesem Denken verfangen sind.

Die russischen Medien, die Sie steuern, lassen den Menschen ständig eintrichtern, die NATO plane einen Überfall auf Russland.

Ich fürchte, dass Sie selbst inzwischen daran glauben. An Ihre eigene Propaganda.

Wenn man überall Verrat, Provokation und Aggression wittert, muss das Leben eine Hölle sein.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie sich aus dieser Hölle befreien.

Russland ist nicht von Feinden umzingelt.

Die NATO plant keinen Angriff auf Ihr Land.

Wir wollen Partnerschaft mit Russland – nur tun wir uns schwer damit, solange Sie Nachbarländer überfallen und Ihre Kritiker gewaltsam ums Leben kommen.

4. Ich wünsche Ihnen ehrliche und freie Wahlen

Niemand zweifelt daran, dass Sie im Frühjahr zum vierten Mal zum russischen Präsident gewählt werden, mit einem überwältigenden Ergebnis.

Jeder, der Russland auch nur halbwegs kennt, ist sich bewusst, dass diese Wahlen massiv manipuliert werden.

Weil Sie Ihre Gegner gar nicht zur Wahl zulassen, sie in den Medien mit Schmutz bewerfen, statt sie zu Wort kommen zu lassen, weil Sie in und um die Wahllokale massiv und dreist betrügen.

So ein Wahlsieg muss so befriedigend sein wie ein Boxkampf, in dem der Sieger seinen Gegner vorab knebeln und auf den Boden fesseln lässt.

Ich wünsche Ihnen den Mut, eine echte Wahl zuzulassen.

Sie würden dann erfahren, was die Menschen wirklich von Ihnen denken.

Und egal, wie die Wahl ausgeht - sie könnten in jedem Fall stolz sein: Auf einen Sieg, der er ehrlich wäre. Und sogar auf eine Niederlage könnten sie stolz sein, weil Sie die Größe gehabt hätten, diese zu riskieren.

5. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie keine Angst mehr haben vor Ihren politischen Konkurrenten

Gerade hat ein Moskauer Gericht wieder in einem peinlichen Schauprozess Ihren bekanntesten Kritiker, Alexej Nawalnij, für 20 Tage einsperren lassen.

Zum wiederholten Male.

Selbst Ihre Marionette Dmitrij Medwedew hat, als er pro forma für Sie Präsident war, zugegeben, dass in Russland""Telefonjustiz"" herrscht – also Gerichtsurteile per Telefon von ganz oben an die Richter diktiert werden.

Es ist deshalb klar, dass auch Sie für das Urteil gegen Nawalnij Verantwortung tragen. Ebenso dafür, dass sein Bruder, der drei kleine Kinder hat, seit Jahren unschuldig in Haft sitzt – de facto als Geisel.

Sehr viele Menschen sitzen in Russland im Straflager, weil Sie gegen Sie sind.

Wer seine Gegner wegsperren lässt, muss große Angst haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie diese Angst besiegen.

Nicht nur Ihre Gegner werden dann frei sein – auch Sie werden sich freier fühlen.

6. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie im 21. Jahrhundert ankommen. Oder zumindest im 17. Jahrhundert

Ihr politisches Denken ist nicht mal in den Zeiten Bismarcks verhaftet – die Grundlagen für die Souveränität von Nationalstaaten wurden bereits 1648 mit dem Westfälischen Frieden gelegt.

Sie hingegen glauben immer noch, dass Russlands Nachbarländer wie kleine Kinder nicht ganz erwachsen sind und Sie über deren Schicksal mitbestimmen müssen.

Sie sind deshalb in diesen Ländern verhasst wie kaum ein anderer Politiker.

Lassen Sie diese Länder in Ruhe.

Akzeptieren Sie, dass nicht Sie, sondern die Menschen in diesen Ländern selbst über ihre Leben und ihr Schicksal entscheiden dürfen.

Ich zweifle, ob die Menschen dort wirklich dankbar sein werden, wenn Sie sie endlich in Ruhe lassen – dafür haben sie zu viel Angst dort ausgelöst, und zu viele Menschen sind gestorben.

Aber zumindest der Hass gegen Sie würde nachlassen.

Und weniger gehasst zu werden, sollte befreiend wirken.

7. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie Ihre Sowjetnostalgie ablegen. Sie ist schlecht für Sie und für Ihr Land

Sie haben den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion als die größte geopolitische Tragödie des 21. Jahrhunderts bezeichnet.

Unter Ihnen ist es in Russland zu einer Stalin-Nostalgie gekommen. Der grausame Massenmörder wird heute wieder gefeiert. Sie lassen Seine Verbrechen relativieren und seine angeblichen Verdienste preisen.

Sie stehen in der sowjetischen Denk-Tradition, wonach der Staat alles und der Mensch nichts ist.

Solange Russland diese Denkweise nicht ablegt, solange Stalin verehrt wird, hat Russland keine Zukunft. So treten Sie und Ihr großartiges Land immer wieder auf die alten Mistgabeln.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie verstehen, dass Russlands Zukunft nicht darin besteht, dass die Nachbarländer es fürchten.

Russland hat eine große Zukunft, wenn die Nachbarn es beneiden.

Wenn die Menschen nicht auf Russlands Bedrohungspotential stolz sind, sondern Stolz sein könnten auf eine funktionierende Gesundheitsversorgung, auf würdige Renten, funktionierende Gesetze und eine erfolgreiche Bekämpfung von Korruption und Willkür.

8. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie in die Geschichtsbücher nicht nur als Krieger eingehen

Sie sind für den Krieg in der Ostukraine verantwortlich, der mehr als 10.000 Menschen das Leben kostete und noch heute fast täglich Opfer fordert.

Die Truppen von Ihnen und Ihrem Verbündeten Assad haben massive Kriegsverbrechen in Syrien begangen.

Sie tragen die politische Verantwortung für den Abschuss des Fluges MH-17 über der Ostukraine mit fast 300 Toten und für die Ermordung des Ex-KGB-Agenten Alexander Litwinenko in London 2006 mit radioaktivem Polonium, wie niederländische Ermittler und ein britischer Richter feststellten.

Die Liste ließe sich lange fortsetzen.

Machen Sie sich ein Geburtstagsgeschenk, indem sie den blutigen Krieg in der Ukraine beenden. Sie müssen dazu nur die Grenzen dichtmachen und aufhören, aus Russland Waffen und Geld an Ihre Befehlsempfänger zu liefern, die Sie als ""pro-russische Rebellen"" ausgeben.

Vielleicht haben Sie Angst, dass Frieden statt Krieg zu beginnen Sie schwächer dastehen lässt.

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie das verstehen.

9. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie nicht nur als Spitze der russischen Korruptions-Pyramide in die Geschichte eingehen – sondern als jemand, der auch einen Teil seines Geldes zurückgibt

Sie müssen ja nicht gleich Robin Hood sein.

Enge Vertraute von Ihnen brachten es auf dubiose Weise zu unvorstellbaren Milliardenvermögen, seit Sie an der Macht sind.

Ihre Kritiker bezeichnen Sie als reichsten Mann der Welt, weil sie sagen, dass Sie auf dieses Geld Zugriff haben.

Geben ist seliger als Nehmen, sagt ein deutsches Sprichwort.

In Russland leben Millionen Menschen in bitterer Armut; viele können sich nicht vollwertig satt essen, vielen fehlt das Geld für dringend benötigte Operationen.

Sagen Sie Ihren Freunden, dass Sie – als Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie, statt Yachten und goldenen Toiletten für Ihre Flugzeuge – zumindest einen Teil Ihrer Milliarden den Menschen in Russland zurückgeben sollen.

Die Dankbarkeit der Menschen wird ein schönes Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie werden.

10. Ich wünsche Ihnen echte Freunde

Nicht solche wie Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder, deren angebliche Freundschaft mit Ihnen einen schalen Beigeschmack hat, weil er von Ihnen – über den Umweg Ihrer Konzerne – Unsummen an Geld verdient.

Genauso wie so viele Ihrer anderen Kumpels, die zu Milliardären wurden, beruhen solche Beziehungen auf Abhängigkeiten – und nicht auf Freundschaft.

Ich wünsche Ihnen Menschen, die kein Geld von Ihnen wollen, keine Macht, keine Posten – sondern die Sie um Ihrer selbst willen wollen.

Paddock shot into a crowd of concertgoers in Las Vegas on Sunday, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 before authorities found him dead in his hotel room with a cache of weapons.

Past mass shooters who were nonwhite or Muslim have been depicted quite differently ― and so have people of color who were victims of gun violence.

“There’s a clear difference in the way this kind of incident is treated and the way it would be treated if it were actually associated with Islam or Muslims,” Ibrahim Hooper, spokesperson at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost. “It would be instantly called an act of domestic or even international terrorism; it wouldn’t be individualized, but collectivized to the entire Muslim community or faith of Islam.”

Here are some ways white shooters are privileged in the media:

Steve Marcus/Reuters First responders gather near a victim of the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017.

White killers are often humanized.

Less than 12 hours after Paddock shot and killed dozens of people, a headline from The Washington Post focused on the fact that he “liked to gamble, listened to country music, lived quiet retired life.”

People on Twitter were quick to point out that nonwhite and Muslim perpetrators of violence don’t often get such humanizing profiles after the fact.

And after Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot by police in 2014, the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown spread on social media as people of color wondered how the media would depict them if they were killed.

What’s more, after Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, at least one headline stated that Paddock “doesn’t fit [the] mass shooter profile,” noting his lack of a known criminal record.

Actually, Paddock precisely fits that profile. Most mass shooters and domestic terrorists in this country have been white, multiple studies show.

I’m sorry, was he not a white man with a shit ton of guns? Because that is the profile. https://t.co/vksR0TBBF5 — Kate Harding (@KateHarding) October 2, 2017

“There is nothing wrong with including human details in reporting, but when we choose to do it is telling,” Farai Chideya, a longtime journalist who has been reporting on white extremism for more than 25 years, told HuffPost in an email.

“In many cases when there is a white mass-shooter or domestic terrorist, we get personal details about them, like the reports that the Las Vegas shooter was a country music fan,” she added. “But how often do we learn personal details about terrorists and mass killers, or even street criminals in the US, when they are not white? Who gets humanized in news coverage is important ― and telling.”

White killers are often described as “lone wolves” with mental health issues.

Just hours after the mass shooting in Vegas, the media was calling Paddock a “lone wolf.” Yet there are clear disparities in who receives this label: After Muslim people commit acts of violence, critics often point to Islam as the root of the problem, and when black people are involved in shootings, they point to the myth of ”black-on-black crime.”

When white people commit mass violence, however, there is often an emphasis on the fact they were acting alone. The implicit assumption is that they are in no way responsible for representing the larger demographic group they belong to.

What’s more, the response to the Las Vegas shooter follows another familiar pattern: White violence is often explained away as a mental health issue.

Jason Miczek/Reuters Police lead Dylann Roof into the courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on June 18, 2015.

White killers are almost never labeled as terrorists.

Part of the problem is that officially labeling a violent event is complicated. For officials to label an act as terrorism, the perpetrator has to be motivated by political or ideological beliefs.

But motive isn’t always easy to determine ― and even when it seems clear, the results aren’t always as expected: Many people condemned the government for not labeling Dylann Roof a terrorist after he killed nine black people in a Charleston church in 2015, even though he said he was there “to shoot black people,” according to witnesses.

Las Vegas police say they are still working to find a motive in Sunday’s mass shooting, and Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated at a Monday news briefing that the shooter could just be “a distraught person just intending to cause mass casualties.” But NPR reports that Undersheriff Kevin McMahill described the shooting as an act of “domestic terrorism.”

White killers often get a pass from the president.

President Donald Trump responded to Sunday’s attack by calling it an “act of pure evil” and tweeted out his “warmest condolences” to the victims and families.

For instance, after the fatal shooting of a policeman in Paris in April, for which the self-described Islamic State claimed responsibility, Trump tweeted that the “people of France will not take much more of this.” And after a truck attack and stabbing in London in June that was also claimed by ISIS, Trump condemned it and called on courts to reinstate a travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries.

Yet after Sunday’s attack on his own soil, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Trump did not call for any action or policy changes to prevent such attacks in the future.",The Double Standard In How The Media Is Portraying The Las Vegas Shooter,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/double-standard-white-privilege-media-las-vegas-shooting_us_59d3da15e4b04b9f92058316

En estos días en los que en México vivimos una historia sísmica que nos provoca esta mezcla de emociones intensas (miedo, sorpresa, anticipación, enojo, alegría, amor, desprecio...) surge un personaje que reúne los rasgos necesarios para convertirse en un símbolo de propios y ajenos: Frida, la perra rescatista.

Un animal hembra, de una raza que nuestro imaginario coloca en la celda de ""noble, inteligente, prudente, buena para cuidar niños"" y que hoy, además, se dedica a entrar a los derrumbes y localizar personas atrapadas entre escombros. La perfecta tensión entre la catástrofe y la salvación, entre el miedo a la muerte (nos pasó cerca) y la salvación esperanzadora.

No importa que uno no viva en la Ciudad de México, ni cerca de la Zona Cero: la emoción hoy viaja en videos de redes sociales y por televisión (en ese orden).

Frida, personaje de la comunicación oficial que no fue

No estoy seguro de que la historia de Frida esté diseñada con anticipación por el gobierno para ser un símbolo, porque surge apenas pasadas 48 horas del terremoto, a partir de uno de los tuits de @PresidenciaMX del 21 de septiembre, y es entonces que el personaje empieza a difundirse en todas las redes.

Entre noticias de rescates, peticiones urgentes de ayuda e historias trágicas, la historia de Frida surge de una de las maneras más empáticas para hacerse memorable: Frida es una perra labrador que se dedica a salvar personas sepultadas en los derrumbes. Ya lo ha hecho con más de 50 en toda su trayectoria como rescatista.

Frida es parte del equipo de la Secretaría de Marina, casualmente la institución oficial con mejor percepción pública en esta época, y que ha aprovechado hasta ahora marginalmente a su personaje, pues el enlace emocional que el personaje de la perra produce es más poderoso que cualquier campaña de programas asistenciales.

Frida pudo haber tenido claramente a su coprotagonista bien definido: Israel, su entrenador.

Frida pudo haber sido un símbolo que ligara los esfuerzos oficiales en la tragedia con la emocionante ola solidaria de los jóvenes civiles, hoy dos figuras antagónicas. Pues aunque en el imaginario colectivo el ejército y la marina se cuecen por separado a la burocracia institucional, la perra rescatista pudo haber sido ese puente en el que, aunque fuera por unos días, las dos partes se dieran la mano y cruzaran juntos el río turbulento de septiembre. Pero no lo catalizaron así.

Frida pudo haber tenido claramente a su coprotagonista bien definido: Israel, su entrenador que, aunque muchos lo vimos en entrevistas, no nos terminaron de dibujar a Israel con las emociones que lo ligaran totalmente a Frida como el humano que la procura y dirige, como el marino patriota. Israel mediáticamente figuró como un marino normal: serio, afable, pero al final muy oficial, y siempre acompañado por su superior, por aquello de respetar las jerarquías, con lo que la historia de los humanos perdió appeal. La marquesina estaba puesta para anunciar a Frida la rescatista, siempre acompañada por su Israel, el marino patriota y valiente, arquetipo de todos los marinos de este país... pero no fue así.

Nuestro mañana rescatado

Y perdón queridos y queridas animalistas, pero Eco, Evil, Titán, Chichí y otros perros rescatistas tienen un reto mayúsculo para posicionarse igual que Frida, pues en la mente emocional del gran público los labradores son los labradores.

Frida hoy entra a la narrativa del momento a partir de generar emociones muy claras, positivas, exaltantes de los valores posmodernos de amor a los animales, solidaridad, alegría de no sentirnos solos, de que entre el miedo y la sorpresa por la catástrofe, hay un ser inteligente y noble que nos puede salvar. Ya quisieran su Frida SEDESOL, SRE o el gobierno de la Ciudad de México, pero no. Frida es hoy parte de la épica nacional ciudadana en la que todos salimos (aunque no hayamos salido, o no hayamos jugado como pasa con los triunfos del TRI) y nos echamos la mano, con ese sentimiento de ""si no lo hacemos nosotros, ¿quién lo hará?""

Frida es un bálsamo en estos días en que las encuestas hablan de que nos sentimos en incertidumbre y pesimismo por el futuro del país. Hoy una perra llegó a rescatarnos un poco del mañana.

She added: “Some states are modernising their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea. Nuclear weapons pose a constant threat to humanity and all life on earth.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.

ICAN is a coalition of non-governmental organisations from 108 countries around the globe, promoting adherence to and implementation of the United Nations nuclear weapon ban treaty. It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007.

ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn said she was “delighted” to have been awarded the prize.

A statement from ICAN added: “This prize is a tribute to the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons, insisting that they can serve no legitimate purpose and must be forever banished from the face of our earth.”

In July, 122 nations adopted a UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, but nuclear-armed states including the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France stayed out of the talks.

The Nobel prize seeks to bolster the case of disarmament amid nuclear tensions between the United States and North Korea and uncertainty over the fate of a 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear program.

US President Donald Trump has called the Iran agreement the “worst deal ever negotiated” and a senior administration official said on Thursday that Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the landmark pact.

The prize, worth $1.10m, will be presented on 10 December.

Formel 1 im Live-Stream: Der Grand-Prix der Formel 1 findet am Sonntag in Japan statt. Sebastian Vettel könnte mit einem Podestplatz in Japan zu Fernando Alonso in der ewigen Formel-1-Bestenliste aufschließen.

Landet der Ferrari-Fahrer am Sonntag in Suzuka unter den ersten drei Piloten, hätte er es zum 97. Mal auf's Treppchen geschafft. Alonso belegt derzeit den vierten Platz.

► Den Rekord hält aber auch hier der siebenmalige Weltmeister Michael Schumacher, der es in 155 Grand-Prix unter die besten Drei schaffte.

Das Freitagstraining für den Grand-Prix mussten die Piloten der Formel 1 im Dauerregen abhalten. Nach der Bestzeit des deutschen Ferrari-Fahrers im Auftakttraining sicherte sich der britische Mercedes-Pilot die schnellste Runde in einer nassen Mini-Einheit.

“Im zweiten Training war viel Regen, es hat sich aber sehr wichtig angefühlt da rauszugehen, um die Strecke einschätzen zu können und zu sehen, wie sich das Auto anfühlt”, sagte WM-Spitzenreiter Hamilton nach seiner vier Runden langen Nassfahrt. “Der Wagen fühlt sich wieder normal an, ich bin bereit zu fahren.”

Sebastian Vettel gibt sich siegessicher

Vor dem fünftletzten Grand-Prix der Saison liegt der zuletzt von Pech und Pleiten verfolgte Hesse 34 Punkte hinter seinem Kontrahenten Hamilton.

An der Zuversicht Vettels ändert das nichts. “Ich glaube, wir sind stark, wir haben allen Grund, selbstbewusst zu sein”, beteuerte der 30-Jährige. “Ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, wir können am Sonntag zeigen, was wir können.”

Lewis Hamilton hat gute Chancen auf den WM-Titel

Seine starke Form will Hamilton weiter unter Beweis stellen. Die ersten drei Rennen nach der Sommerpause gewann der 32-Jährige, zuletzt sicherte er sich in Malaysia mit seinem bisweilen störrischen Silberpfeil Position zwei.

“Ich will dieses Ding einfach gewinnen”, betonte Hamilton, der auf seinen vierten WM-Titel zusteuern will. “Vielleicht habe ich den Nagel schon ein bisschen eingeschlagen, ich muss aber weiter draufhauen.”

""First, in accord with the moral teaching of the Church, it is important that young people be encouraged to avoid any kind of promiscuous behaviour that, along with other negative effects, also can put them in danger of cervical cancer,"" it read.

""Scientific evidence supports the ethical stance that responsible sexual behaviour, abstinence until marriage and then a faithful, monogamous union are the surest way to good health. The teaching of the Church on sexual morality remains a sure guide to our children. It provides for them a path to achieving sound loving relationships and wholeness of life.""

But it turns out that was a decade-old letter that was sent out in error.

Brett Salkeld with the Archdiocese of Regina says ""it was adequate at the time and it was true at the time,"" but there is now more information about the vaccine.

The new letter says it is up to parents to make responsible decisions about their children 'according to their own conscience.'

The new letter says it is up to parents to make responsible decisions about their children ""according to their own conscience,"" while being informed by both ""scientific findings and their faith.""

The letter also says the decisions are a matter of public health.

Salkeld says the bishops talked with cancer researchers and health-care professionals to ensure they were sending out updated and accurate information.

Well, Radhe Maa has a history with controversies. Recently in September, the Punjab and Haryana High Courts ordered FIRs against her after one Surender Mittal alleged that she had been threatening her over the phone with dire consequences if he spoke against her.

Her name also appeared in the list of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad's list of ""fake"" religious heads this year.

Money for mental health only follows bombs, bullets and trauma, says Weissbecker, while a growing mental health crisis remains ignored.
Low-income countries average one psychiatrist for every two million people and spend less than one per cent of their health budgets on mental health.
Typically, when developing countries do invest in mental health, the money doesn't go to outreach and prevention but to mental hospitals.
These are the types of solutions that should be talking points at the World Health Organization annual meeting on mental health, in time for World Mental Health Day on Oct. 10.","A chained mental patient is seen at the psychiatry department of Juba Education Hospital in Juba, South Sudan on October 11, 2016.

Two years after South Sudan gained independence, Dr. Inka Weissbecker toured the young country's only mental health facility.

The hospital looked more like a prison ward. Patients were sedated, living in their own filth; a traumatized young girl wandered the hallways unattended; people with schizophrenia had no medication. Weissbecker, global mental health and psychosocial advisor for the International Medical Corps, brought the tragedy to potential donors, imploring them to fund better mental health services.

Her plea fell on deaf ears.

""They thought, 'South Sudan is not ready for mental health. The country has bigger problems,'"" she recalls with frustration.

Mental health disorders affect one in four people around the world and even more in low-and-middle- income countries riven by strife. Still, the problem is often overlooked in light of other pressing development priorities.

It wasn't until civil war broke out in South Sudan that mental health funding poured in, as the world's attention turned to children with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatized civilians.

Money for mental health only follows bombs, bullets and trauma, says Weissbecker, while a growing mental health crisis remains ignored.

For many, the logic is inescapable. In the hierarchy of needs, lifting people out of poverty and ensuring they are fed comes before mental health treatment.

But this thinking crumbles when you look at the massive ripple effect of untreated mental health disorders.

Studies show a relationship between mental health conditions and unhealthy lifestyles, leading to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. Health-care systems in developing or crisis-plagued regions cannot handle the strain. Low-income countries average one psychiatrist for every two million people and spend less than one per cent of their health budgets on mental health.

Institutions are much more disruptive to patient's lives, and carry a greater stigma in areas where education and awareness are lacking.

Typically, when developing countries do invest in mental health, the money doesn't go to outreach and prevention but to mental hospitals. Institutions are much more disruptive to patient's lives, and carry a greater stigma in areas where education and awareness are lacking.

Donors and international organizations are often no better, explains Weissbecker. ""When conflict breaks out, that's when people start paying attention.""

The international community has made tremendous strides delivering medicines, containing outbreaks and fighting disease around the world.

Now it must do the same for mental health.

Mentally ill people are seen at a psychiatric hospital at Azez town of Aleppo, Syria on Sept. 11, 2016.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals include mental health alongside other focuses of development. This inclusion recognizes mental health treatment as a human right, one that's key to empowering growth and prosperity in all countries.

We need to do more. We need to fund and train more psychiatrists and doctors, build community-based mental health services, and help break the cultural stigma associated with treatment. These are the types of solutions that should be talking points at the World Health Organization annual meeting on mental health, in time for World Mental Health Day on Oct. 10.

In Canada, we're a long way from achieving our goals but we've started to recognize the social and economic benefits of investing in mental health. It's time we applied the same standards around the world. And we don't have to wait for the trauma of conflict.

The erasure of trans and non-binary bodies in the definition of womxnhood is largely due to the conservatism and essentialist assumptions about biology.
In our everyday thinking, sex and gender are directly linked, but there are cases where our sex and gender don't match.","On 28 September this year, Stats SA released The Victims of Crime Survey 2016/2017 for which 30,000 households in nine provinces were interviewed on their perception of crime in South Africa.

The report revealed that sexual offences increased by 117 percent in the last year alone. In the very same vein, due to experience, it is plausible to assume that this statistic refers mostly to womxn* and young children. On 30 August this year, the Centre for Studies in Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) also launched a report titled ""Violence Against Women in South Africa: A Country in Crisis"" -- the report was aimed at interrogating the persistence of gender-based violence in South Africa.

Interestingly, both reports come a few months after South Africa's Universal Periodic Review -- a mechanism the UN Human Rights Council adopted for evaluation of member states' compliance with international human-rights standards. South Africa received a bulk of 243 recommendations, with a majority of the recommendations calling on the country to address its human rights situation, more so with regards to violence and atrocities against women and girls.

Of course, over the years, reports on gender-based violence in South Africa have been produced. However, owing to these reports, the assumption of homogeneous experiences of violence, among others, has largely been inapplicable and mostly archival. Thus, for purposes of effective policies, there has been a growing need for reports that speak to experiences of diverse and marginalised groups. Perhaps a distinct feature about the CSVR report is the adoption of a feminist analytical methodology in collating this research.

The benefits of this approach, as CSVR gender specialist Nonhlanhla Sibanda highlighted, allow for the centring of women's voices and experiences. It took full cognisance of the effects of patriarchy and the problematics of existing VAW/GBV research in perpetuating single stories of womxnhood without considering the diversity of women's experiences, life histories, and institutional, systematic and structural oppression as pivotal factors in understanding VAW.

As part of the feminist analytical methodology, cisgender (people who identify with the sex they were born as) heterosexual and lesbian women were chosen as respondents. For purposes of holistic inclusion, the respondents were chosen from various communities, classes and backgrounds.

The erasure of trans and non-binary bodies in the definition of womxnhood is largely due to the conservatism and essentialist assumptions about biology.

Thus pertinent thematic issues and trends can be obtained from this report that makes it revolutionary for the South African understanding of VAW and GBV in general. A multiplicity of stories and perspectives are evident in the final research, which is critical for analysis of commonalities and divergence in the respondents' experiences.

Without any doubt, the CSVR report is an important contribution to the South African research and feminist catalogue. However, the limited understanding of gender as seen through the exclusion of trans and non-binary women in the scope of defining womxnhood in this VAW report and similar others in South Africa is a growing concern for the future of intersectional politics.

More so in light of the decades of killings and atrocities committed upon non-binary and trans bodies. The erasure of trans and non-binary bodies in the definition of womxnhood is largely due to the conservatism and essentialist assumptions about biology. This can be seen as easily giving effect to the problematic statements similar to the one uttered by feminist scholar and novelist Dr Chimamanda Adichie Ngozi, that ""trans-women are not women"".

In an Interview with Live Magazine, trans-feminist scholar Sandile Ndelu states ""that first of all, you have to be cognisant of the difference between sex and gender. In our everyday thinking, sex and gender are directly linked, but there are cases where our sex and gender don't match. For the transgender body, sex, in terms of your anatomy, does not correlate with your gender identity."" The point Sandile raises is evident in most domestic, regional and international policy documents.

I think it is important that activists, civil society organisations and policymakers constantly make space for difficult conversations, especially around LGBTIQ+ inclusion. Inclusion should not be just a rhetoric, but be practical. We need to ensure that trans and non-binary bodies enjoy the same rights as everyone else, but with a limited conception of gender, this ideal can never be realised.

On the question of feminism and trans exclusion, a feminist scholar and fallist Litsoanelo Zwane stated: ""I personally believe that all of us feminists who are cisgendered, by virtue of being cisgendered are automatically trans-exclusionary in some way or the other. Especially since we actively reinforce systems which benefit us, intentionally and maybe even unintentionally.""

I think it is imperative that in as much as I may merely be regarded as an ally in the feminist movement, I continue being intersectional in my lens.

Zwane goes on to say: ""The bottom line is that we're definitely guilty. Transwomxn have been doing the work for decades and because of our position, we ride the wave of their intellectual labour (and fail to recognise their struggles).""

In summing up, I am a cisgender black queer mxn; thus -- as often pointed out by my feminist friends -- my place or position in the feminist movement/dialogue is one that continues to be highly contested as it is not necessarily about who I identify as, but also who/what my body represents.

Therefore, even in writing this opinion piece, I was fully aware of how problematic my position may be and that perhaps this is not even my piece to write, not even as an LGBTQI+ rights activist and human rights defender that has done work and continues to work in hostile environments with communities in the margins.

But I feel compelled to contribute this as part of making room for visibility of the consistently silenced screams. I think it is imperative that, in as much as I may merely be regarded as an ally in the feminist movement, I continue being intersectional in my lens. Trans-exclusion in feminist work and research is as vile as transphobia.

It’s no surprise that Netflix’s costs have gone up. Big budget shows like Stranger Things, House of Cards and Orange is the New Black have all started to add up and if Netflix wants to keep offering that level of premium content it’s going to need to find a way of paying for it.

Jensen explains Ontario's funding of psychotherapy services is part of the province's $140 million investment in mental health support over three years.
Another burning question I had for Jensen was whether the new expanded psychotherapy programs would also be helping children and youth with mental health issues.
But Kimberley Moran, CEO of Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO) disagrees.
Moran says there has been no increase in resources towards community-based children's mental health in over a decade.","We've come to the end of another Mental Illness Awareness Week, the time of year when government suddenly finds the money and resources for programs and initiatives long overdue which they announce with great fanfare and pretty press releases that in the end, leave us all shaking our heads as to what exactly has been promised.

It's a song and dance I know well, having worked on both sides of the fence in government communications and news reporting.

If the media is doing its job right, reporters will ask questions and clarify statements so that people can understand exactly how they will be affected.

Unfortunately, I didn't see much of that happen this week.

So while I hate to get political, as a mental health journalist and someone who cares for a child with mental health conditions as well as battling anxiety and depression myself, I feel it's important to dig a little deeper into Monday's announcement by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MHLTC) to clarify just what exactly they meant when they said they would be ""expanding psychotherapy programs across the province"" for people with anxiety and depression.

The press release mentioned three different ways in which, for the first time ever, covered under OHIP, people in Ontario would be able to access structured psychotherapy in the coming three years:

Through in-person and group therapy at community mental health agencies; Self-administered through a program called Bounce Back that includes telephone support and instructional workbooks; and Through online self-management tools via the Ontario Telemedicine Network.

The evidence is strong that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is the best form of treatment for anxiety and depression. But there are wait lists to see a psychiatrist and those with health insurance through their job with coverage for psychotherapy can see a psychotherapist but the coverage usually only extends to just a few sessions. Those who can afford to pay for private psychotherapy, however, are able to avoid the queue and get help right away.

We live in a two-tier system where those who can afford to get psychotherapy receive treatment right away while those who can't languish on wait lists as their conditions worsen. According to Monday's announcement, Ontario will become the first province to provide publicly-funded structured psychotherapy.

We live in a two-tier system where those who can afford to get psychotherapy receive treatment right away while those who can't languish on wait lists as their conditions worsen.

Does this mean Ontario will be covering the services of psychotherapists under OHIP?

Following the smiles-and-shovels ground-breaking announcement at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) where Minister of Health and Long Term Care, Dr. Eric Hoskins was also celebrating the future addition of 235 new inpatient beds, I emailed David Jensen from the Communications and Marketing Division at MOHLTC for additional clarification.

""The Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Demonstration Project is led by the four psychiatric hospitals — CAMH, Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences, Royal Ottawa Health Care Group and Waypont Centre for Mental Health Care,"" says Jensen. ""Through this project, the four hospitals are developing a standardized psychotherapy model to deliver in community-based settings, including family health teams, community health centres, and community mental health and addictions agencies.""

Jensen goes on to explain that in order to ensure that the province is rolling out group and individual psychotherapy that adheres to a standardized, evidence-based treatment model, they will rely on the clinical expertise housed in the four hospitals to oversee training and supervision.

""Service provision will actually occur in the community — in community mental health agencies, in connection with the primary care provider, and through other organizations such as family service organizations that partner with these four hospitals,"" says Jensen.

""The IAPT Demonstration Project led by the four psychiatric mental health hospitals is the modality offered through the announced funding that offers in-person psychotherapy. Qualified, trained health-care providers will provide in-person therapy, such as social workers, psychologists, psychotherapists, registered nurses, and occupational therapists.""

While working to expand existing evidence-based services such in-person psychotherapy at community mental health agencies over the next three years, Jensen says the ministry will also be working on a provincially structured psychotherapy program to standardize the level of care patients will receive across the province.

Jensen explains Ontario's funding of psychotherapy services is part of the province's $140 million investment in mental health support over three years. The province is investing $72.6M over three years to support different types of psychotherapy services, which will provide more ways for Ontarians to address their specific challenges and improve their mental health. The investment will support additional requirements to expand the programs which cannot be leveraged through pre-existing human and capital resources.

""It means the answer to your question is no,"" says Ontario registered psychotherapist Christina Crowe. ""Varying the delivery medium is fantastic. But who are the practitioners?... All I know is that there are over 4000 registered psychotherapists in Ontario and we're all private, our services depend on patients' private insurance, whose coverage is dictated by employers. There is no shortage of qualified practitioners, from psychologists to psychotherapists who practice evidenced-based psychotherapy for anxiety and depression. But there is no virtually public support for Ontarians who need treatment, which is a daily frustration.""

Crowe is concerned that the announcement doesn't properly address the significant gaps that currently exist, most notably the lack of practitioners with appropriate training for OHIP-funded psychotherapy. She says the wait lists are over a year long for many of these limited practitioners and that most community-based mental health organizations are time limited, offering a maximum of one to three sessions with a different therapist every time.

""This could be great,"" says Crowe. ""It's still unclear that a patient could choose their own psychotherapist.""

Another burning question I had for Jensen was whether the new expanded psychotherapy programs would also be helping children and youth with mental health issues.

It is surprising that the Ontario government is not putting more funds behind treatment and supporting children and youth because we have clearly asked repeatedly for funding... Kimberley Moran

Jensen replied that the programs identified in the announcement target adults aged 16 and over but that the provincial structured psychotherapy program yet to be developed would be accessible to Ontarians across the lifespan, including families, children and youth.

But Kimberley Moran, CEO of Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO) disagrees.

""As children and youth mental health services fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, community-based children and youth mental health agencies do not receive funding or program direction through MOHLTC so at this time would not have access to this program,"" says Moran.

""It is surprising that the Ontario government is not putting more funds behind treatment and supporting children and youth because we have clearly asked repeatedly for funding for more psychotherapy and they are well aware that 70 per cent of mental illness has its first onset during adolescence and that those receiving the right kind of treatment at the right time can improve their long-term mental health.""

Moran says there has been no increase in resources towards community-based children's mental health in over a decade.

""CMHO has called on government to rectify the $120-million funding shortfall so community-based child and youth mental health centres can hire additional psychologists, social workers, nurses, child and youth workers and other mental health professionals to serve the almost 12,000 children currently waiting up to 18 months for treatment.""

Despite the skepticism, I'm hopeful the province will come through on its plans to deliver structured psychotherapy and that its plan will reduce and eventually eliminate wait times for people desperately waiting for treatment for anxiety and depression.

""It's a decent start,"" says Crowe.

I agree. I just hope we get started sooner rather than later and next year is an election year, which could slow down, change, or worse, cancel plans altogether depending on whether the Liberals get re-elected or not. Here's hoping whatever the outcome, all political parties continue to see the value and urgency in providing psychotherapy treatment for children, youth and adults with mental health conditions.

Our lives depend on it.

Wie ""Game of Thrones"" eine hässliche Wahrheit über uns selbst enthüllt Es war ein Moment, auf den sich die Fans der Fantasy-Serie Game of Thrones lange gefreut haben: Ramsay Bolton's Tod in der neunten Episode der aktuellen Staffel. Getötet wurde er ausgerechnet - oder: gerechterweise - durch Sansa Stark, eigentlich Ramsays Ehefrau, die er so lange drangsaliert und missbraucht hatte. Nicht nur Sansa, sondern auch alle Zuschauer und ich haben gelächelt, als Ramsay endlich sein verdientes Ende fand. Darf man das?

Dernier jour faisant fonction Aide-Soignante, fin de Service.

Les résidents de l'EHPAD sont couchés. Je peux enfin faire pipi! Je me sens seule dans ces longs couloirs. Le lieu apparaît soudainement très calme. Plus de sonnettes plus de lumières rouges au-dessus des chambres. Plus de cris.

J'ai dit au revoir à ces personnes qui ont tant à nous apprendre, tant à partager mais qu'on écoute pas.

J'ai pris soin de chacun autant que je le pouvais, pour essayer d'apporter chaleur et humanité dans cet endroit où le personnel est trop peu nombreux pour pouvoir réellement s'occuper de chacun avec attention.

Beaucoup attendent simplement la mort.

9 sont décédés depuis le mois de Juin.

90% d'entre eux n'ont pas de visite de toute l'année.

S'il vous plaît, quand vous dites que vous n'avez pas le temps de rendre visite à vos parents ou grands-parents, est-ce vraiment la réalité?

Mettons-nous à leurs places, car un jour, nous aussi, nous serons seuls et vieux à attendre. Attendre que quelqu'un vienne nous donner la main, nous apporter un sourire, un mot gentil. Ils ne demandent pas grand chose. Ils sont si malheureux car j'entends encore les résidents me répondre ""non ils n'ont pas le temps ils travaillent"".

""Ils travaillent""..... oui mais en général 8 heures par jour... trouvent le temps d'aller faire du shopping, voir des amis, aller chez le coiffeur, boire un verre, faire du sport...

Beaucoup disent que c'est chiant un vieux car ça parle pas ou alors ça radote et pis ça sent mauvais. Mais quand vous ne connaissiez que 3 mots étant enfant et avec les couches sales, ils venaient pourtant prendre soin de vous, vous apporter de l'amour et vous faire rire. La communication n'est pas seulement faite de mots.

Ils ont MAL, ils ont PEUR, ils SOUFFRENT.

J'ai vu leurs cris dans leurs regards.

J'ai vu des yeux livides, touché des corps qui déperrissent et noircissent, sentit l'odeur de la maladie, entendu les plaintes.

S'il vous plaît, pour EUX, pour VOUS car ils nous APPORTENT ENORMEMENT... rendez-leur visite.

Au cimetière, ce n'est pas votre sourire qu'ils verront.

Si seulement moi je pouvais encore rendre visite à mes grands-parents...

La journée et la mission étaient difficiles mais je repars sourire aux lèvres, avec grande satisfaction. ❤ Merci à eux pour tout cet amour.

Japan-born Ishiguro won the Man Booker Prize for the 1989 novel that was made into an Oscar-nominated movie. The Swedish Academy hailed his ability to reveal ""the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world"".

The award of the 9 million crown ($1.1 million) prize marks a return to a more mainstream interpretation of literature after it went to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan last year.

BREAKING NEWS The 2017 #NobelPrize in Literature is awarded to the English author Kazuo Ishiguro pic.twitter.com/j9kYaeMZH6 October 5, 2017

The works of Ishiguro, who moved to Britain as a young child, often touch on memory, time and self-delusion, the Academy said.

""He is a little bit like a mix of Jane Austen, comedy of manners and Franz Kafka. If you mix this a little, not too much, you get Ishiguro in a nutshell,"" said Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.

Ishiguro began to gain attention in the 1980s for works such as ""A Pale View of the Hills"" and won global fame for ""The Remains of the Day,"" a story of a fastidious and repressed butler in postwar Britain. The movie version starred Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.

Ishiguro takes his place beside Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Doris Lessing and Ernest Hemingway as winner of the world's most prestigious literary award.

Critics said the decision to give last year's prize to Dylan was a snub to more deserving candidates and strayed beyond what is traditionally deemed literature.

The prize is named after dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and has been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with his will.

The Kangana Ranaut-Hrithik Roshan drama, which seemingly started off as a fight about a relationship gone awry, soon took a legal turn. Throughout the controversy, where Kangana claimed that the two were in a relationship and that Hrithik even proposed to her in Paris, the actor chose to remain silent, to the extent that he didn't even name her.

Other than a couple of tweets, where he denied having any kind of affair with her, Hrithik did not give any interview, or release a statement addressing the matter. Kangana, on the other hand, was vocal about it and consistently maintained that the two were romantically involved.

Note: Hrithik has nowhere mentioned Kangana's name in his post but has only alluded to her, as the duo has been caught up in an elaborate legal battle.

""The truth is I have never met the lady. Yes, we have worked together but there has been no meeting in private,"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter.

""Please understand, I am not fighting against an allegation of an affair. Or being childish trying to uphold a 'good guy' image. I am, in fact, protecting myself from something far more serious, sensitive, and destructive than that,"" he wrote.

The actor said that the controversy has worked out in favour of Kangana as people are 'comfortable with a lie' as it doesn't 'threaten their model of the world.'

The actor denied any kind of relationship (other than professional) and said on the date the alleged engagement happened in Paris, he was in Mumbai.

Attached below is the entire note Hrithik Roshan has shared:

I choose to be on a path of creativity, productivity and constructive work. Anything that isn't in alignment with that, I tend to ignore, sidestep and treat as a distraction.

I believe that ignorance, non reaction and staying on the path of dignity is the best way to discourage any persistent unwanted intrusions. But Just like a nagging health issue sometimes ignored can turn malignant, this situation for me has unfortunately turned malignant.

In case of the matter at hand, it seems the media has no intention of letting go.

I don't see any grace in adding to this circus by testifying in defence of my character in a situation that I have no involvement in whatsoever.

I have been dragged into a dirty perverse mess without a choice in the matter. This is something that is not of my making.

The truth is, I have never met the lady in question one on one in my entire life. Yes, we have worked together, but there has been no meeting in private. Thats the truth

Please understand, I am not fighting against an allegation of an affair. Or being childish trying to uphold a 'good guy"" image. I am very aware of my faults, I am human.

I am in fact protecting myself from something far more serious, sensitive and destructive than that.

Sadly, very few from the media or the public seem to be interested in the truth. This has been a hard-learnt fact for me.

If the people are comfortable with a lie because it doesn't threaten their model of the world where a girl is the victim and the man the aggressor then so be it. I am ok with that too.

Women have suffered centuries of abuse at the hands of men and it infuriates me how some men can be so brutal and they deserve the harshest punishment. But by that logic if it ordains that one man can't be vulnerable and one woman can't be a liar, so be it. I'm ok with that too.

An alleged 7-year long, passionate affair between two high profile celebrities with no trail left behind.

No evidence, no paparazzi pictures, no witnesses, not even a memento in possession like a selfie taken at the alleged engagement which is claimed to have happened in Paris in Jan 2014. Nothing that constitutes an exchange or any sort of proof of a romantic relationship.

Yet we want to believe the other party because the rhetoric is -why would a girl lie.

My passport details show no travel outside the country in Jan 2014, which is the date that this alleged engagement supposedly took place. In Paris.

The only so-called proof presented of this alleged ""relationship"", was a photoshopped picture in the media. This was immediately exposed, the very next day by friends including my ex-wife.

These questions are not even asked, because we are taught to protect the woman, as we should. I myself have been brought up to think the same way, by my parents and the wonderful women in my life who have been my rock and support system. I'm deeply grateful to them. I will do my best to teach my children the same values of family and dignity. And yes, I will teach them to stand up for women. Always.

There are 3000 one sided mails which either I have sent to myself or the woman in question has sent to me. The Cyber-Crime Dept. can prove or disprove either story, in just a few days. Towards that purpose, I have surrendered all my devices including laptops / phones etc which are still lying with the cyber cell , but the other party has refused to do so. The investigation hasn't been closed.

This is not, and I repeat, not a lovers spat. I humbly request people to stop labelling it as one and, for a second, try and see it for what it really is.

I have been harassed by this for 4 years and the well meaning and probably necessary social bias toward women has deemed me helpless in defending myself.

I am not angry, I have seldom allowed anger into my life. I have not had a single fight in my life, with a man or a woman. Even in my divorce, there was no fight. I, and those around me, have always chosen peace.

I am not here to accuse or judge anyone, but it's time I defend the truth because when truth suffers the collective consciousness of society suffers. Civilization suffers. Closer to home, families suffer. Children suffer.

Die Hebamme kam herein, um nachzusehen, wie es uns beiden ging. Da erzählte ich ihr glücklich, dass Oscar bereits lachte. Die Hebamme nahm ihn mir sofort aus dem Arm und drückte den Notfallauslöser.

Sofort eilten viele Hebammen herbei. Sie maßen den Sauerstoffgehalt in Oscars Blut - er lag nur bei 45%.

Eine Hebamme rief den Krankenwagen und die Sanitäter kamen zum Glück schnell.

Für den Transport zum Krankenhaus legten sie Oscar in einen Brutkasten. Mir wurde nicht erlaubt, mit Oscar im Rettungswagen zu fahren. Mein Mann holte mich sofort mit dem Auto ab und wir fuhren hinterher.

Die ganze Autofahrt war ich absolut überzeugt, Oscar würde im Krankenwagen ohne mich sterben. Es war schrecklich.

Als wir ankamen, war eine Sanitäterin gerade auf ihrem Weg zurück zum Krankenwagen. Sie brachte uns gleich zur Intensivstation und versicherte uns, dass Oscar noch am Leben war.

Trotzdem wussten wir immer noch nicht, was unserem Sohn fehlte.

Als wir Oscar auf der Intensivstation fanden, sah er so zerbrechlich aus. Er wurde beatmet, bekam Medikamente durch eine Kanüle verabreicht und war durch mehrere Kabel an einen Monitor geschlossen.

Eine Krankenschwester begleitete uns ins Angehörigenzimmer, um uns zu erklären, was die Ärzte wussten: Oscar hatte eine Infektion in seinem Körper und litt große Schmerzen.

Die ersten Tage waren furchtbar. Wir durften Oscar nicht anfassen - seine Schmerzen waren zu groß. Das ganze Personal leistete jedoch hervorragende Arbeit und unterstützte uns, wo es nur ging.

Trotzdem ging es nicht bergauf. Oscars Entzündungswerte stiegen weiter an, obwohl er Antibiotikum bekam. Schließlich entschieden die Ärzte, eine Spinalpunktion durchzuführen. Das ist eine Untersuchung des Rückenmarks, bei der man verschiedene Krankheiten feststellen kann (A.d.Red.).

Ich durfte während des Eingriffs nicht an seinem Brutkasten bleiben und machte mir die ganze Zeit schreckliche Sorgen. Hinterher versicherte man mir jedoch, Oscar hätte währenddessen nicht einmal geweint.

Doch der Albtraum war noch nicht vorbei. Die Ärzte mussten eine zweite Spinalpunktion durchführen, da bei der ersten Blut in die Probe eingedrungen war.

Zwei Stunden später hatten wir jedoch die Gewissheit, welche Krankheit Oscar hatte: Er litt an bakterieller Meningitis, einer Hirnhautenzündung. Die Ärzte wussten allerdings noch nicht, welcher Typ der Krankheit vorlag.

Wir waren am Boden zerstört.

Aber wir hatten endlich Klarheit. Und die Ärzte konnten Oscar jetzt die richtigen Antibiotika zur Behandlung der Krankheit geben. Von da an es ging bergauf.

Eine Woche nach seiner Geburt wurde Oscar aus dem Krankenhaus entlassen. Es war der schönste Tag für uns. Nach einer Woche mussten wir für einen Check-Up zurück ins Krankenhaus, hatten jedoch keine weiteren Probleme.

Danach lebten wir mit Oscar in einer kleinen Blase. Er hatte all seine Meilensteine erreicht und war zu einem aufgeweckten und klugen kleinen Jungen herangewachsen. Trotzdem hatte er nach seiner Einschulung Probleme, sich zu integrieren und zeigte erste Wahrnehmungsstörungen - ein Anzeichen für eine Angststörung.

Auch mit den Lehrern gab es Probleme. Sie bestraften ihn für sein Verhalten, obwohl er darüber gar keine Kontrolle hatte.

Als Oscar diese Schule besuchte, rief ich das erste Mal die ""Mengitis Now"" Hotline an, weil ich einfach jemanden brauchte, der mir ein Ohr schenkte, während ich mich ausschimpfte und weinte.

Die erste Dame, mit der ich mich unterhielt, war sehr herzlich und erklärte mir, dass Oscars Verhalten mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit mit seiner Meningitis zu tun habe. Sie ließ mir Infoblätter zukommen, die ich gleich an seine Lehrer weiterleitete.

Doch schließlich mussten wir in von der Schule nehmen. Es war einfach nicht die richtige für ihn.

Mittlerweile haben wir eine hervorragende Förderschule für Oscar gefunden, die sich auch aktiv um Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Hilfestellen bemüht.

Die Schule wird meinem Sohn für sein nächstes Schuljahr einen persönlichen Lern-Assistenten zur Verfügung stellen. Er ist nämlich sehr ängstlich, was seinen Lernprozess und sein Verhalten stark beeinträchtigt.

Der Assistent wird ihm mehr Sicherheit geben.

Ich möchte mich beim Personal im Geburtshaus bedanken. Ihr schnelles Handeln rettete Oscars Leben. Ich möchte auch ""Mengingitis Now"" dafür danken, dass sie stets zur Stelle waren, wenn ich mich an sie wand.

The wave of demonstrations on the 65th birthday of President Vladimir Putin comes as Navalny serves a 20-day jail term for calling for an unsanctioned protest.

The opposition leader’s headquarters said protests would be held in nearly 80 Russian cities, the Press Association reported.

Rallies numbering from a few dozen to a few hundred people were held in several cities in Russia’s far east and Siberia.

Most of the demonstrations have not been sanctioned by authorities, and police have reportedly detained protesters and activists in some cities.

In Moscow, several hundred protesters, most of them young, gathered in Pushkinskaya Square, waving Russian flags and chanting “Russia will be free!” and “Free Navalny!”

Police warned the demonstrators that the rally has not been sanctioned and urged them to disperse, but did not immediately move to break up the protest.

Police and the National Guard showed up in full force in central Moscow and in St Petersburg, where a rally is set to be held later.

Navalny has declared his intention to run for president in the March election, even though a criminal conviction he calls politically motivated bars him from running.

The 41-year-old anti-corruption crusader has organised several waves of protests this year, casting a challenge to the Kremlin.

Putin has not yet announced his intention to seek re-election, but he is widely expected to run. With his current approval ratings topping 80%, he is set to win another six-year term in a race against torpid veterans of past election campaigns, like Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.

Navalny argued that a high level of support for Putin results from the lack of real political competition and urged his supporters to help him get registered for the race.

“The 86% approval rating exists in a political vacuum,” he said. “It’s like asking a person who has been fed with rutabaga through his entire life how eatable they find it and the rating will be quite high. Listen, there are other things which are better than rutabaga.”

The sarcastic analogy demonstrated his stinging style, which has recently helped him get broad support among youths. He has worked to expand his reach with videos exposing official corruption and YouTube live broadcasts.

“Because I love my wife and I love my children,” he replied matter-of-factly.

Of course, it wasn’t about love at all. Cory had just been arrested for committing a massacre. He was accused of slaughtering eight people: his wife’s mother, her older sister and her aunt, her cousin and her cousin’s husband, her pastor’s grandson and another young boy, as well as the officer who responded to the 911 call.

It was early morning on May 28 and Cory sat on the street in handcuffs outside his cousin-in-law’s house in Brookhaven, Mississippi, a small town nicknamed “A Home Seekers Paradise.” Police stood guard with guns drawn.

All night long they’d been on a manhunt for Cory after responding to reports that he had opened fire on his wife’s family in the neighboring hamlet of Bogue Chitto. Eight people were dead by the time he was arrested, a little before 7 a.m.

But why did Cory say it was love that led him to kill so many? Only one person understood.

“He didn’t want nobody else around us,” Cory’s wife, Sheena Godbolt, said sitting on her sister’s couch one scorching hot afternoon in July, almost two months after the shooting.

“He wanted me there with him, with no friends or family members, nothing,” she said. She shifted in her seat, drew a deep breath, shook her head. “That’s not love.”

There have been eight mass shootings in the United States this year. That night in Mississippi was the fifth. Everytown for Gun Safety defines a mass shooting as a single incident in which four or more people are fatally shot, not including the perpetrator. The most recent mass shooting occurred earlier this month in Las Vegas, when a gunman opened fire on concertgoers at a country music festival. With 58 fatalities, it earned the unenviable title of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

But what happened in Las Vegas is nothing like what most mass shootings look like in America. Most resemble what police say took place in Mississippi. This year, in five of the eight mass shootings, the perpetrators killed their girlfriends, wives, children and extended family members.

This year’s pattern is not unusual. Between 2009 and 2016, the perpetrator shot a current or former intimate partner or family member in 54 percent of mass shootings. Everytown also found that in nearly half of these cases, the perpetrator exhibited warning signs before the killing, such as recent acts of violence, threats or violation of a protective order.

Mass shootings are rare, of course, and make up only a fraction of overall gun violence in America. But when they do occur, the primary victims are usually not strangers like the victims in Las Vegas; they are those closest to the perpetrator.

Melissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Sheena Godbolt, 33, sits on her sister's porch in Bogue Chitto.

Cory was Sheena’s first and only boyfriend. They started dating when they were teenagers. In the beginning, he was adoring and generous. “He bought me my first cell phone,” Sheena recalled. “If I needed clothes, he took me to Walmart.”

But over the years things began to change. They got married and had two children. He started to become more possessive. She had to ask his permission to go anywhere, she said. He was jealous of her friendships and her relationships with her family. As she describes it, her life shrank to fit the four walls of their mobile home.

Neighbors said they could hear Cory screaming at her sometimes. He’d yell at her to change her clothes if he could see the outline of her body. He’d snatch her phone out of her hand to check her texts, she said. And when he got really angry, he’d punch things: the walls of their trailer, and sometimes, she said, her too. She wore long sleeves to cover the marks he left behind – even through Mississippi summers. She learned to anticipate when he was likely to get violent. If she saw the telltale signs ― a narrowing of his eyes, a particular tone in his voice ― she’d take off in her car.

Over the course of their 17 years together, Sheena left Cory a half dozen times. (It’s a typical pattern. On average, it takes victims of domestic violence seven attempts before leaving for good.) She would hop in the car and drive; it didn’t matter where. Once she wound up in Louisiana, three hours away, before she calmed down. It was safest to stay in hotels or pass the time at a rest stop. If she and the kids bunked with friends or family, Cory might turn against them, she said.

The man held grudges. Sheena’s relatives didn’t like how Cory treated her, and he got in altercations with several of them through the years. Sheena usually sided with him out of loyalty. When her family tried to intervene, it just made everything harder.

Sheena’s family pressed charges against him on a few occasions. In 2015, Cory confronted Myrtis May, one of Sheena’s aunts, and “made threats to kill her,” according to a court document. He was convicted of simple assault, attempting by physical menace to create fear, and fined $467.75.

Sheena rarely involved the police herself; she said Cory told her they couldn’t protect her. But in 2016, Cory reached a new level of violence, she said. That year, she obtained a temporary protection-from-abuse order. She told police that Cory had punched her in the stomach and strangled her ― all because she would not give him the security code to her cell phone. “She states he also put his hand down her mouth where she couldn’t scream for help,” a court document states.

“He tortured me that day,” Sheena said.

He was charged with domestic violence, aggravated assault, but the charges were later dropped. Sheena forgave him for that incident, too.

“He was my husband and I loved him,” she said. “I wanted our marriage to work.”

Afterward, the violence got worse, she said, and eventually she came to the realization that she had to abandon the marriage to save herself.

A few weeks before the May 2017 rampage, she left again, this time for the last time. She sought refuge with her mother, Barbara Mitchell, who was recovering from open heart surgery. For three weeks, she stayed at her mother’s home without incident.

And then they decided to throw a party.

Alissa Scheller/HuffPost

The Massacre

It was Memorial Day weekend in Bogue Chitto where Sheena was raised, around 60 miles south of Jackson, Mississippi. That Saturday, her mom held a barbecue in the yard. Friends and family came over, bringing food to grill. By 11:30 p.m., the festivities were winding down, and only around 10 people remained. Sheena’s mother, Barbara Mitchell, was resting in the living room. Her sister, Toccara May, was chatting out in the yard with her aunt, Brenda May. Vincent Mitchell, Sheena’s stepfather, was in the kitchen with his brother, who was visiting.

Sheena was putting her kids to bed in the guest room when Cory arrived at the door.

She recalled how he strode into the living room and demanded Sheena give him their kids. This was a classic tactic of his, she said. Whenever she’d leave him, he’d take the kids from her; if she wanted to see them, she had to come home. It used to work. But Sheena wasn’t going back again; she wanted a divorce. So that night, when Cory showed up, she called the police. She knew her husband. She knew he wouldn’t leave without a fight.

Around nine minutes after her call to 911, Deputy Sheriff William Durr of the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office pulled up and asked Cory to leave. Then, without warning, her husband pulled out a gun and shot Durr, Sheena said. Everyone scattered into various rooms, seeking cover. Sheena bolted toward her kids in the guest room, ripping them out of bed and pushing them out the window.

“As we were jumping the fence and running through the woods, I was hearing gunshots, gunshots, gunshots,” Sheena recalled. “That was my last time seeing my family.”

Later, authorities would confirm that Barbara Mitchell, Brenda May and Toccara May had been killed along with Deputy Durr. And that was just the beginning.

After Sheena and the children emerged from the woods and were huddling in the street in shock, neighbors, friends and relatives rushed to their side. Sheena had cut her wrist when she jumped out the window and was bleeding badly. For hours, they stood together, praying and crying. The house had been cordoned off by the police. They didn’t yet know who had been slain, and they didn’t know where Cory had gone.

Among those gathered to support Sheena was Tiffany Blackwell, a family friend whose father was the pastor of New Zion Union M.B. Church, which Sheena and Cory attended. Tiffany and her husband, Shon Blackwell, drove over as soon as they heard the news, leaving their children at home in Brookhaven overnight.

While many details are still unclear, it appears Cory drove to the Blackwells’ home next. No one else knows why he went there, but when he arrived, he shot at the locked door until he was able to kick it in, according to Caleb Edwards, 15, one of Tiffany’s nephews. Once inside, he shot Tiffany’s son Jordan, 18, who in a heroic gesture used his body to shield Caleb and Caleb’s 11-year-old brother, Austin. Caleb survived with a cut to his eye, but both Jordan and Austin were killed.

Cory was not finished. According to witnesses, he took another teen, a friend of the boys who was there that night, at gunpoint and forced him to drive them around for hours. About 6 a.m., Cory let the teen go at a gas station near his third and final stop: the home of Sheena’s cousins Sheila and Ferral Burage.

Sheila, her husband and her sister Shonda May had been in Bogue Chitto all night with Sheena. Along with many other friends and family members, they had gone to offer their support. At dawn they went home, but soon after they heard a knock at the door. It was Cory. Ferral was armed and ready because he knew Cory was still on the run. He fired at Cory, Shonda said, but Cory shot back and killed Ferral. The sisters ran. Shonda hid in a closet while Sheila sought cover in the bathroom. While Shonda was not discovered, Sheila was, and Cory fatally shot her too, police say.

Cory was apprehended minutes later down the street from the Burages’ home by members of multiple law enforcement agencies. He sat in the street, bleeding from the arm where Ferral had shot him and muttering about his family. He was later charged with one count of capital murder and seven counts of first-degree murder.

“They would not let me live and let live!” he yelled, according to video taken by Clarion-Ledger reporter Therese Apel at the scene. “I just wanted to love my family. I just wanted to love my wife.”

The high death toll made national headlines briefly and then faded out of the news cycle. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) called it a “senseless tragedy” and asked his constituents to pray for those who had died. Maybe because of the people who were targeted ― the family of the killer’s wife ― the shooting was, somehow, relegated to the realm of the domestic.

A Community Mourns

In Bogue Chitto, where Sheena and Cory lived, the community felt rattled to its core. They had all either grown up together or went to the same school or church. Losing eight people at once ― from children to a police officer ― left a gaping wound. On Highway 51, across from a gas station and tanning salon popular with locals, someone erected a memorial: eight blazing white crosses in a row.

When HuffPost visited in July, Cory was due in court for a preliminary hearing. At Lincoln County Circuit Court in Brookhaven, more than five dozen relatives of the slain filed into the courtroom and waited in tense silence.

Over the previous two months, they had buried the dead, mourned, held community prayer meetings and tried to make sense of what had happened. Now, for many of them, it was the first chance to lay eyes on the man charged with killing their loved ones.

Cory entered the room in shackles, wearing a yellow shirt and khaki pants. He scanned the room as though looking for someone. Shonda May shook uncontrollably. Tressie Durr, the widow of the slain deputy sheriff, silently wiped away tears. Vincent Mitchell stared at Cory with fury.

The hearing was brief. An officer from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation recited the bare details of the shootings: the locations, the names of the deceased, the evidence indicating Cory to be the sole perpetrator. Boxes of tissues were passed down the aisles.

Afterward, many relatives gathered at the Burages’ house in Brookhaven to eat ribs and fried catfish and to reminisce about those who had lived there before it became a crime scene. The house was the final stop on the killing spree. Months after the shooting, there was no trace of the tragedy.

Shonda stood outside on the lawn. She didn’t want to go inside. She was there when Cory burst in. She had hidden in a closet as her sister Sheila and brother-in-law Ferral were killed. Seeing Cory in the courtroom had shaken her badly.

“I felt very nervous to where I felt like my heart jump out of my chest,” she told HuffPost, as she stood in the shade of the front yard staring back at the house.

Inside, Shon Blackwell sat looking through photos of his late son on his phone. Jordan, who was killed that night in the Blackwells’ home, was a rising football star at Brookhaven High School, and had recently received scholarship offers from a number of universities. He had dreamed of playing professional football or, if that didn’t pan out, going into coaching, his father said.

Shon, an assistant pastor at New Zion Union M.B. Church, said he was leaning heavily on scripture in the aftermath of the shooting and finding solace in the church. Every day was getting a little bit easier, but not better.

“It has caused us to depend more on God and less on ourselves,” he said.

Before the hearing that day, Shon posted a Facebook Live video online from his car. He said he arrived at the courthouse early so that he would have time to pray before seeing Cory face to face.

“People ask me how I feel. I don’t know,” he said in the video. “I don’t even know how I’m supposed to feel. If anyone else knows how I am supposed to feel, ask them to please share with me.”

Melissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Sheena and Cory's mobile home burned down after the shooting.

Officer Down

Behind the courthouse, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office was selling car decals emblazoned with William Durr’s name and patrol number and the words ”A hero remembered lives forever.”

Durr, who had responded to Sheena’s call for help, was the first officer killed on duty in the history of the department, Sheriff Steve Rushing told HuffPost. Law enforcement from as far away as New York and Chicago attended his funeral, along with the governor of Mississippi.

“Honestly, it shook us,” Rushing said. “You know in this line of work that it can happen, but you don’t really realize until it does happen how it affects you.”

Everyone at the sheriff’s office was deeply distressed by Durr’s death, he said. In the months since the shooting, his officers had stepped up to support Durr’s wife and 10-year-old son, Nash.

In August, they would even chaperone Noah to his first day of sixth grade.

“We miss William everyday, but especially on days like today,” Tressie Durr wrote on Facebook that day. “I am so thankful for our blue family.”

The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office is a lean operation, with 21 deputies responsible for patrolling 500 square miles. Three deputies are on each night, and they travel in separate cars to cover more ground. Most calls involve accidents or general complaints, but there’s also a fair amount of domestic violence. The majority of the domestic violence calls are fairly straightforward, Rushing said. But even so, it’s standard procedure to send two officers to the scene, as domestic violence is known to be the most dangerous type of call for police.

The night of the massacre, two deputies were dispatched to the house of Barbara and Vincent Mitchell. Durr arrived first. A second officer pulled up about five minutes later, he said, but by that time Durr had been shot.

The department was familiar with Cory; deputies had responded to calls from Sheena before. Over the years, he was arrested a dozen times and accused of simple assault, disturbing the peace, domestic violence and robbery. Still, Rushing said, he didn’t expect Cory to do this.

“A lot of us knew him,” the sheriff said. “I personally had met him in the community several times. Some of my officers went to church with him.”

Left Behind

Everyone in Bogue Chitto dealt with the tragedy in their own way.

Some turned to the church for support. The police community took care of its own. But Sheena ― who had lost her mother, her sister, her aunt and, in a sense, her husband ― no longer felt like she belonged anywhere.

First of all, she was homeless. Two weeks after the shooting, her mobile home burned down. An investigation found it to be “undetermined in cause,” but Sheena suspected arson. In a way, she understood. She was learning by that point what grief and rage did to a person. How it roiled inside of you, ugly and unknowable, and could spark fleeting thoughts of retaliation. Sheena preferred denial. Sometimes, for a moment, she allowed herself to imagine her family intact, her mother on the way home from the store.

Visiting her mother’s grave made it real again. Seven of the victims are buried in the same place, and it is a stark vision: a gathering of fresh graves covered in bright flowers inside an old cemetery.

When HuffPost met with Sheena, she had just driven back from Jackson, where she had requested copies of her children’s birth certificates. They’d been lost in the fire, along with all her belongings ― clothes, furniture and family photos. She was slowly working to replace those things. She had taken a leave of absence from her job at a local Walmart distribution center and was seeing a therapist. Some days, she said, she struggled to get out of bed.

“It feels like a ton of bricks on top of me,” she said, sitting at her sister’s house. “It won’t let me up and live again.”

The what ifs race through her mind all the time. What if she hadn’t left? What if she’d gone to a hotel? What if she’d said yes when Cory asked for the kids? What if she’d never met him?

“It’s been hard ever since that day, because I feel like it’s my fault,” she said. She knows, rationally, that she’s not to blame. But she still can’t stop feeling that way. And it doesn’t help that others seem to think so too.

No one comes out and blames her directly, but she feels it, she said. People hold her accountable. Some of her friends don’t call anymore. She can only guess why. She wonders if it’s simply because they don’t know what to say.

On a recent weekend, Sheena spoke to HuffPost by phone. She had heard about a mass shooting in Texas committed by an estranged husband and wanted to contact the mother of the woman who was killed. No one else really understood what she was going through, and she hoped the woman’s family might.

Since HuffPost visited Sheena in July, she has moved to a different town and enrolled her son and daughter in a new school. The children, now in the third and fifth grades, are settling in. The move is good for the children, she said. It gives them anonymity. Other kids don’t know them as the children of a mass murderer, she said.

She has also found a different church. She’s back at work after almost four months off. She is an adult alone for the first time in her life. In a way, Cory has gotten exactly what he wanted. She’s isolated from nearly everyone she knows and loves.

“What Cory did, that was on Cory,” she said. “He left me and those babies here to suffer from his actions.”

Sheena misses her own mother like a physical ache, she said. She used to call her daily on her lunch break. Now, she tries to take her break at a different time and make jokes with co-workers to occupy her mind.

“I just try to stay focused,” she said. “Once I lose that focus, it seems like my whole world just turns upside down.”

The Socceroos drew 1-1 with Syria overnight, in the first leg of their FIFA World Cup qualifier (which, should they win, will put them through to another two-leg playoff against a Central or North American team).

But there were some serious sour grapes from some of the Socceroos, even though the match result reflected the periods of dominance both teams enjoyed -- us in the first half, Syria late in the second.

Among the loudest to complain was Germany-based striker Robbie Kruse, who said of a dubious penalty which the Syrians were awarded:

""It's never a pen, but you come to expect that in this confederation.""

The penalty did indeed look marginal at best.

But to say ""you come to expect that in this confederation"" could be interpreted as a swipe at the standard of either Asian Confederation refereeing, or the (perceived low) standard of football in the regional conference, or both.

Kruse took a second dig at Iranian referee Alireza Faghani who has officiated Socceroos games before, saying:

""You expect that from this referee, we've had him before. I think he wanted to give it as soon as he made contact.""

For the record, he also scored a brilliant goal with a lovely deft touch.

Much clumsier were his words after the game and there's no small irony in an Australian player questioning the competence of the refereeing in the Asian Confederation.

Australia lobbied for years to enter the confederation, and to qualify through it for the FIFA World Cup. Previously, we qualified through Oceania, where for years we thrashed Pacific island nations and only had genuine competition against New Zealand, who we almost always beat before facing tougher opposition from elsewhere on the globe in a last stage qualifier.

That's how we came to play, and eventually beat, Uruguay in that famous 2005 John Aloisi moment which sent football fans into raptures and took Australia to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, where we preformed well.

Hypokrusey?

After that 2006 Cup the Socceroos were admitted to Asia. The move paid immediate dividends. We qualified directly for the World Cup in 2010 and 2014 via one of the automatic four spots afforded the continent. We are also the reigning Asian Cup champions.

This year is the first time the Socceroos have not qualified directly for the FIFA World Cup since admission to Asia. Having missed one of the automatic four spots after failing to score heavily enough against Thailand, we are forced to go the long way round.

Despite this year's hiccup, our success in recent years, and the rise in mainstream interest in Australian football, owe virtually everything to our participation in the Asian confederation.

While some fans are arguing Kruse made some valid points, others say it's hypocritical to criticise Asia when things don't go our way.","Socceroo Takes Major Swipe At Asian Confederation, Which We Were So Desperate To Join",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/05/socceroo-takes-major-swipe-at-asian-confederation-which-we-were-so-desperate-to-join_a_23234415/

Mais elle était bien embêtée lorsque son amie l'a approchée pour être la marraine de son bébé âgé de quelques mois. «Bien sûr», voulait-elle répondre. Mais les choses ne sont pas aussi simples dans son cas. Car Andréa n'est officiellement une femme que depuis l'an dernier.

Andréa, qui préfère taire son nom de famille par respect pour la vie privée de son amie et de l'enfant, a longtemps été mal dans sa peau. Née garçon, la dame de la région de Québec a vécu un long processus de changement avant de se trouver.

«Mon histoire est particulière par rapport aux autres. J'avais un handicap physique, c'est peut-être pour ça que je me trouvais différente. J'ai grandi avec ça», dit-elle. Anxiété, crises de panique et colère occupaient une grande place dans sa vie. «Je n'ai jamais été un homme. Et si j'avais continué avec mon identité ancienne....» Elle s'arrête. Elle préfère parler de qui elle est vraiment.

Elle a commencé sa transition en 2013, avant de faire son coming out en 2014.

«J'ai fait une évaluation psychologique pour avoir le droit de prendre des hormones. On a vu que je n'avais pas une maladie mentale, mais que mon cerveau et mon corps ne vont pas ensemble. J'ai donc débuté un traitement hormonal en 2015 et ça m'a aidée. En décembre 2015, j'ai fait ma demande de changement de sexe à l'état civil. Elle a été acceptée en avril 2016», précise-t-elle.

Parallèlement, elle s'est toujours considérée comme croyante. Tous ses sacrements de l'initiation chrétienne ont été faits lorsqu'elle était plus jeune et elle participait occasionnellement à des activités pastorales. Son premier emploi d'été fut à l'oratoire Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Saint-Joseph, en Gaspésie.

«Beaucoup de transgenres rejettent la foi. Il y a une entente non-écrite entre l'Église et les transgenres pour s'exclure mutuellement. L'Église nous regarde de haut et les trans disent 'on va aller se faire regarder ailleurs' ! Mais je ne peux pas faire ça. Pour être la vraie moi, je ne peux pas me promener avec un bras en moins, le bras étant la foi», dit-elle.

Mais face à la demande de son amie, elle était prise au dépourvue: l'Église lui permettra-t-elle d'être marraine ?

De nouvelles questions posées à l'Église

Cette question jadis théorique frappe de plus en plus à la porte de l'Église. Surtout depuis qu'un cas a retenu l'attention en Espagne il y a deux ans. Pris de court par la demande d'un jeune transgenre de 21 ans et par la controverse publique entourant cette affaire, Mgr Rafael Zornoza Boy, évêque du diocèse de Cádiz et Ceuta, a sollicité l'avis de la Congrégation pour la doctrine de la foi. La réponse était sans équivoque: «impossible».

Pour la congrégation, adopter un «comportement» transgenre dénote «publiquement» une «attitude opposée à l'exigence morale de résoudre son problème d'identité sexuelle selon la vérité de son sexe». Elle jugeait donc que l'un des critères pour être parrain ou marraine – c'est-à-dire avoir une vie conforme à la foi catholique – n'est pas rencontré. On précisait alors qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une «discrimination» mais bien de la «reconnaissance objective de l'absence des conditions nécessaires» pour être parrain ou marraine.

Au Canada, face à l'évolution des mœurs sexuelles dans la société, l'Église se prépare à faire face à de telles demandes.

«Si on regarde comment la société civile évolue, ça pourrait venir plus souvent», estime Chantal Labrèche, professeure adjointe à la Faculté de droit canonique de l'Université Saint-Paul et spécialiste du droit canonique. Pour l'instant, elle note que la plupart des cas qui aboutissent dans les chancelleries diocésaines concernent surtout les cas de futurs parrains ou marraine qui n'ont pas fait leur confirmation.

Elle précise que même si Andréa est légalement reconnue comme une femme, la loi ne pourrait pas contraindre l'Église à accepter sa demande pour cause de discrimination.

«Ce n'est pas un droit d'être parrain ou marraine. L'Église ne pourrait pas être poursuivie au niveau civil pour un tel refus», explique-t-elle.

Dans le cas d'Andréa, les sacrements de l'initiation – baptême, confirmation, première communion – ont tous été faits. Mais même si elle se faisait discrète sur son changement de genre, elle ne pourrait pas aller signer sur la ligne «parrain»: elle se mettrait en situation de parjure par rapport à l'état civil, où elle n'a plus le droit de s'identifier comme un homme. Ce serait de toute manière «loin de l'esprit du droit canonique» qu'une paroisse propose un tel procédé pour trancher la question, précise la professeure Labrèche.

Des critères à respecter

De son côté, l'abbé Francesco Giordano, vice-chancelier pour le diocèse de Montréal, croit que les critères pour devenir parrain ou marraine sont assez bien définis dans l'Église.

«Dans ce cas particulier, on peut facilement passer à travers la checklist: être baptisé, avoir vécu les sacrements d'initiation et avoir 16 ans. Mais avec le dernier item sur la liste, on peut s'enfarger: est-ce qu'elle vit sa foi de façon conforme à l'Église?», dit-il.

«Ce n'est pas un jugement sur son caractère ou sa moralité, mais la personne témoigne-t-elle de la foi dans sa vie? Et la foi est assez définie. On a le credo, des enseignements qui touchent la vie morale, les disciplines. Alors, il y a des critères plus spécifiques à considérer», explique l'expert en droit canonique.

«Pour une personne transgenre, cela pose problème car il y a une incohérence entre la biologie et l'identification de soi-même. Une personne qui est témoin de sa foi, ce n'est pas juste subjectif: 'je me sens comme'», poursuit-il.

«Cela dit, si un transgenre est capable de vivre sa foi et continue malgré tout à assumer son identité sexuelle biologique, elle peut répondre aux critères pour devenir parrain ou marraine. On reconnait que des personnes portent des souffrances, vivent des situations difficiles», assure le vice-chancelier.

Dans sa pratique de canoniste, l'abbé Giordano n'a pas encore eu de dossier concret à gérer sur cette question. Il affirme faire confiance aux paroisses pour que les critères de l'Église soient bien respectés.

«Ça va nous être demandé. Qu'est-ce qu'on fait à ce moment-là?» Yves Côté, agent de pastorale

À la paroisse Saint-Pierre-Apôtre, dans le village gai de Montréal, l'agent de pastorale Yves Côté a accompagné l'hiver dernier une personne transgenre qui avait été approchée pour être parrain. Le baptême, qui devait se dérouler à Brossard, n'a finalement jamais eu lieu et la question est restée en suspens.

«Je crois que la question va émerger davantage au cours des prochaines années», dit M. Côté. «Il faut se préparer. J'en parlais récemment à mon curé. Ça va nous être demandé. Qu'est-ce qu'on fait à ce moment-là?»

À ses yeux, l'Église devrait pouvoir tenir compte du changement de sexe lorsqu'elle est accompagnée d'une démarche auprès du gouvernement. «Par contre, je sais que l'Église est très...» Il s'arrête et prend quelques instants pour bien choisir ses mots. «C'est un gros bateau difficile de faire tourner de bord», ajoute celui qui côtoie la communauté LGBTQ dans son travail pastoral.

Dialogue souhaité

Andréa reste déçue de la position de l'Église sur cet enjeu, mais elle croit que la question mérite d'être scrutée attentivement. «Je trouve ça correct que l'Église ne tourne pas sur un 10 cennes. Les lois humaines, on peut les changer n'importe quand. Mais au niveau de l'Église, c'est une bonne idée de prendre le temps de réfléchir.»

En attendant, elle continue d'explorer sa foi et met cette question au cœur de ses prières.

«Je prie. Mes prières sont très personnalisées. Je demande à Dieu d'être aiguillée. Quels arguments je peux leur amener pour leur dire que je ne suis pas une abomination?», demande-t-elle.

Elle invite l'Église à lui poser des questions pour voir si elle vit effectivement selon la foi catholique. «Je vais répondre, et on verra si je suis une bonne personne. Mais parce que je suis transgenre, il n'y a pas de discussion possible», regrette-t-elle. «Mon identité de genre, c'est ce qui existe au fond de moi. Je ne peux pas arriver à faire abstention de moi-même», dit-elle en réponse à la proposition d'endurer son sexe biologique.

«Certaines personnes s'éloignent de la religion? Oui. Mais parfois, c'est la religion qui les fait fuir.»

L'abbé Giordano assure qu'il sera du devoir des chancelleries qui auront à recevoir ces demandes de faire preuve de sensibilité et de compréhension.

«Ce que je dis aux personnes transgenres, c'est: 'viens nous en parler'. Si vous avez des questions, on sera contents d'y répondre. Ce n'est pas facile, c'est une nouveauté. Mais la réponse de l'Église est assez claire dans le cas des parrains et marraines: il faut être prêt à assumer une vie catholique. Et ce qui constitue la vie catholique est bien établi.»

Dahinter steckt eine Naturkatastrophe

Den See und was die Gefahr für Mensch und Umwelt verursacht, seht ihr im Video oben

Lake Erie ist einer der viertgrößten Seen Nordamerikas. Normalerweise zeichnet er sich durch sein blaues Wasser aus. Doch seit mehreren Jahren verfärbt sich der See grün.

Was sich faszinierend anhört, ist in Wahrheit das Anzeichen einer Naturkatastrophe dar. Die ist sowohl für Menschen als auch die Umwelt gefährlich. Anfang Oktober veröffentlichte die NASA neue Bilder des Sees, die das Ausmaß der Katastrophe zeigen.

Laut einer Pressemitteilung des National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sind “Microcystis Cyanobakterien” der Grund für die Verfärbung.

3 Millionen Menschen beziehen Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee

“Die Microcystis Cyanobakterien erstrecken sich über das westliche Becken und breiten sich entlang der Küsten von Michigan und Ohio, von Maumee Bay bis hin zur Küste von Ontario, aus”, heißt es in der Pressemitteilung.

Der See sei so stark mit giftigen Algen verschmutzt, dass die Ohio Environmental Protection Agency davor warne, das Leitungswasser in der Region zu trinken und in die Nähe des Lake Erie zu gehen. Laut der “New York Times” beziehen fast drei Millionen Menschen ihr Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee.

Die globale Klimaerwärmung verstärkt das Gift der Algen

Das Problem sei seit 2000 bekannt, dennoch sei bisher nicht viel dagegen unternommen worden. Wissenschaftler gehen davon aus, dass das Gift der Algen durch die globale Klimaerwärmung stärker werden wird.

Die Bürgermeisterin von Toledo, einer Stadt an der Küste des Sees, schrieb vor wenigen Tagen einen Brief an US-Präsident Donald Trump. Paula Hicks-Hudson macht darin auf die Gefahr, die von dem See ausgeht, aufmerksam.

“In unserem Land stimmt etwas nicht, wenn sich unsere Seen und Flüsse grün färben. Ich kann Ihnen eins sagen: Der Status Quo funktioniert nicht”, erklärte Hicks-Hudson in ihrem Schreiben.

Cette idée est le fruit d'une collaboration entre un graphiste berlinois, Manuel Bürger et un Parisien, Pierre Vanni.

Pour Pierre Vanni, le créateur français de l'affiche, l'inversion des lettres permet de capter subtilement l'attention des passants et des visiteurs. Automatiquement, le cerveau va remettre les lettres dans le bon ordre. ""Nous avons gardé les premières et dernières lettres de ""nuit"" et ""blanche"" pour fixer ces deux mots, mais changé l'ordre des autres lettres par exemple en doublant les consonnes pour qu'ils soient durs à lire; et pourtant on y arrive"", explique l'artiste au HuffPost qui précise qu'elle a été faite sans cynisme, sans volonté de ""manipuler le public"".

L'interprétation de cette affiche varie selon ceux qui y font face. ""Certains y voient la métaphore d'une nuit blanche, d'une nuit de fatigue et la difficulté à parler, à lire"", ajoute Pierre Vanni qui raconte que la mairie de Paris a été séduite par l'idée, contre toute attente.

Avant de voir le film, Raoul Peck s'exprime sur son film : « Je voulais montrer Marx, Engels et Jenny, la femme de Marx dans leur vie quotidienne, à partir de leurs propres paroles, ils sont jeunes, ils ont la vingtaine, ils sont révoltés et ils ambitionnent de changer le monde. C'est cela le cœur du film».

À propos du réalisateur: Raoul Peck né le 9 décembre 1953 à Port-au-Prince est un réalisateur, scénariste et producteur de cinéma haïtien. Nommé en janvier 2017 pour l'Oscar du meilleur documentaire I am not your negro. Il a réalisé Lumumba, inspiré de l'histoire de Patrice Lumumba et de son rôle dans l'indépendance du Congo. Il a été ministre de la Culture de la République d'Haïti de 1995 à 1997. Sa formation: l'Université Humboldt de Berlin et la télévision Berlinoise.

C'est un homme engagé et il se définit comme faisant un travail de passeur pour le présent, pour un combat d'aujourd'hui.

Synopsis

En Allemagne, une opposition intellectuelle fortement réprimée est en pleine ébullition. En France, les ouvriers du Faubourg Saint–Antoine se sont remis en marche. En Angleterre aussi le peuple est dans la rue, et la révolution est industrielle. La reconstitution de l'époque est convenable. Ce qui me reste de ce film, c'est ce que je découvre sur Karl Marx, surtout Friedrich Engels et leurs femmes. La traversée d'un groupe de jeunes protestataires luttant pour leurs convictions jusqu'à la mort. J'ai refait le trajet à travers le temps.

C'est à Paris, en 1844, qu'il croise le jeune Friedrich Engels, cette rencontre changera le destin de Karl Marx.

Karl Marx est né le 5 mai 1818 à Trêves, en Allemagne. Il grandit dans une famille juive, son père est un avocat israélite qui se convertira au protestantisme. À 26 ans, Karl Marx entraine sa femme Jenny Von Westphalen sur les routes de l'exil. C'est à Paris, en 1844, qu'il croise le jeune Friedrich Engels, cette rencontre changera le destin de Karl Marx.

Friedrich Engels est né le 28 novembre 1820 à Barmen dans une famille d'industriels. Son père a fait fortune dans l'industrie du textile. Il doit quitter le lycée pour raisons de famille. En 1838, tout en travaillant comme commis dans une société commerciale à Brême, il commence à étudier profondément la philosophie en se rapprochant de Hegel qui prédomine de la philosophie allemande de l'époque. En 1842, il s'installe en Angleterre à Manchester et travaille dans une entreprise industrielle où son père a des intérêts. C'est là qu'il publie en 1845 » La situation de la classe laborieuse en Angleterre. La même année Friedrich Engels contribue au journal franco-allemand édité et publié par Karl Marx. Grâce à cette première rencontre, ils découvrent qu'ils partagent les mêmes idées et décident de collaborer plus étroitement. Après l'expulsion de Karl Marx à Paris, ils s'installent en Belgique. Jenny, Karl et Friedrich, où la liberté d'expression est plus grande que dans d'autres pays d'Europe. Marx accompagne Friedrich en Angleterre ou il rencontre Marie Burns, une ouvrière irlandaise avec laquelle il vivra jusqu'à sa mort. En 1848, Engels et Marx sont expulsés de Belgique. Ils s'installent à Cologne où ils fondent un nouveau journal La Nouvelle Gazette. Karl Marx et Friedrich Engels ont traversé le temps, parcouru l'Europe, avec leurs épouses avec la même détermination. Après la mort de Karl Marx, en 1883, Friedrich Engels réunit les brouillons pour assurer la publication posthume des livres II et III du Capital. Il meurt à Londres en 1895, sans enfant.

Ce n'est pas tout à fait le film, mais c'est une belle histoire.

Darf ich es schreien lassen, wenn es nachts aufwacht? Bis zu welchem Alter soll ich mein Kind stillen? Und soll es lieber Brei bekommen oder gleich feste Nahrung?

Junge Eltern stellen sich viele Fragen. Ihre größte Angst ist es, Fehler zu machen. Fehler, die sich womöglich nie wieder rückgängig machen lassen. Und die Antworten auf ihre Frage finden viele von ihnen in Erziehungsratgebern.

Die Regale mit solchen Publikationen für Eltern in den Buchhandlungen sind daher meterlang.

Doch Pädagogen sehen den Ratgeber-Boom mit Skepsis. Wenn Eltern sich zu sehr auf diese Literatur fixieren, warnen die Experten, können sie ihren Kindern schlimmstenfalls sogar schaden.

Largo hält die meisten Erziehungsratgeber für kontraproduktiv

Der wahrscheinlich bekannteste Kritiker von Erziehungsratgebern ist der Schweizer Kinderarzt Remo Largo. Nur wenige Experten im deutschsprachigen Raum haben sich so intensiv mit dem Thema Kindesentwicklung beschäftigt wie er. Sein Buch ""Babyjahre"" gehört seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten zur Grundausstattung junger Eltern.

Den Großteil der neuen Erziehungsratgeber hält Largo für kontraproduktiv. ""Die meisten dieser Bücher behandeln nur ein bestimmtes Thema und sind problemorientiert"", sagte er der HuffPost.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Kinderarzt Remo Largo erklärt: Mit diesem Fehler schaden Eltern ihren Kindern

""Was mache ich, wenn mein Baby nicht durchschläft? Was, wenn es den Brei nicht essen will? Ich halte von dieser Art von Ratgeber nicht viel.""

Sie seien sehr direktiv geschrieben und versprächen, dass es auf das eine Problem auch die eine Lösung gebe. ""Doch DIE Lösung in dem Sinne gibt es beim Thema Erziehung nicht"", sagt er.

""Diese Form von Erziehungsratgebern macht die Eltern hilflos""

Die Folge, so warnt Largo, seien Ratlosigkeit bei den Eltern und Schaden für die Kinder. ""Diese Form von Erziehungsratgebern macht die Eltern hilflos - und die Kinder leiden darunter, dass die Eltern ihr Problem nicht lösen können.""

Der Kinderarzt erläutert das an einem Beispiel: ""Nehmen Sie etwa einen Ratgeber zum Thema Schlafstörung. Da wird den Eltern also direktiv gesagt, was sie tun sollen. Doch was ist, wenn diese eine Methode nicht funktioniert? Dann können die Eltern ein weiteres Buch kaufen oder sich irgendwann Hilfe bei einem Experten suchen.""

➨ Das könnte euch interessieren: Ein Hirnforscher erklärt, was Kinder mehr als alles andere von ihren Eltern brauchen

Dass Ratgeber in vielen Fällen mehr Negatives ausrichten als sie nützen, kritisieren auch andere Experten. ""Viele Eltern, die unsere Beratungsstelle aufsuchen, sind durch die vielen unterschiedlichen Ratgeber verunsichert"", sagte Bettina Lamm, Familientherapeutin und Entwicklungspsychologin an der Universität Osnabrück, der ""Rhein Main Presse"".

Fehlende praktische Erfahrung verunsichert Eltern

Sie und andere Wissenschaftler beobachten, dass das Phänomen vor allem die gebildete, gut situierte Mittelschicht betrifft. ""Die Familiengründung findet meist Ende 20 oder Anfang 30 statt und oft haben Mutter und Vater dann zum ersten Mal in ihrem Leben ein Baby im Arm"", sagte Lamm.

Die fehlende praktische Erfahrung verunsichere die Eltern, der Griff ins Bücherregal sei eine logische Folge. Das Problem, so warnt sie: Diese Eltern suchten oft nach der einen, allgemeingültigen Lösung für eine Erziehungsfrage - die nicht existiere, wie auch Largo betont.

Statt nach Patentrezepten zu suchen, sollten Eltern lieber eines tun, rät der Kinderarzt: versuchen, das Kind zu verstehen.

""Ich habe Hunderten von Kindern dabei zugesehen, wie sie groß geworden sind"", sagt Largo. Er habe immer versucht, kein Ratgeber zu sein und auch keine zu schreiben.

Jedes Kind entwickelt sich unterschiedlich

""Stattdessen ist es mein Ziel, den Eltern zu erklären, wie ihr Kind tickt und welche Bedürfnisse es hat. Denn nur wenn die Eltern ihre Kinder verstehen, können sie auch ihre Probleme lösen.""

Die Paar- und Familienberaterin Ursula Keller ist sehr ähnlicher Ansicht. ""Ein guter Erziehungsratgeber berücksichtigt, dass Kinder sich unterschiedlich entwickeln"", sagte sie dem Onlineportal ""familienleben.ch"".

""Vorsichtig sollten Eltern immer dann auf einen Erziehungsratgeber reagieren, wenn er versucht, Patentrezepte zu verkaufen. Denn Patentrezepte, die für alle Familien gelten, gibt es nicht.""

➨ Das könnte euch interessieren: Das passiert mit Kindern, die früh in die Kita kommen

Sie nennt außerdem einen weiteren Punkt, der aus Ihrer Sicht gegen die Lektüre vieler Erziehungsratgeber spricht: ""Die Ratgeber sind oft sehr unterschiedlich. Auf gleiche Fragen bieten sie unterschiedliche Antworten. Das kann Eltern zusätzlich verwirren.""

""Die eine Lösung für die Probleme aller Kinder gibt es nicht""

Entwicklungspsychologin Lamm rät verunsicherten Eltern, die zu ihr in die Familientherapie kommen: ""Packt die Bücher weg und vertraut eurem Bauch"" - auch wenn sie wisse, dass das nicht einfach sei und meist erst beim zweiten oder gar dritten Kind gelinge, wie sie selbst sagt.

Auch für Kinderarzt Largo ist die Sache klar: ""Jedes Kind ist einmalig"", sagt er. ""Die eine Lösung für die Probleme aller Kinder gibt es nicht. Wenn Eltern ihr Kind und seine Entwicklung verstehen, brauchen sie all die Erziehungsratgeber nicht.""

Als Sturmtief ""Xavier"" am Donnerstag über Teile Nord- und Ostdeutschlands fegte, hinterließ er eine Schneise der Verwüstung. Durch umstürzende Bäume kamen insgesamt sieben Menschen ums Leben.

Unter den Opfern ist auch die Journalistin und Politik-Expertin Sylke Tempel, Chefredakteurin der Zeitschrift ""Internationale Politik"" und Vorstandsmitglied der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik.

Doch der tragische Unfalltot Tempels ist für den deutschen Türkei-Aktivisten und Erdogan-Anhänger Martin Lejeune offenbar ein Grund zur Freude.

Jubel über eine Tote

Der ehemalige Journalist, der aus seiner Verehrung für den türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan keinen Hehl macht und damit gerne provoziert, schreibt auf Twitter:

""Die Gebete der Muslime wurden erhört

Der Baum ist die Strafe Gottes für Sylke Tempel's Taten

Lejeune, der im Juli 2016 zum Islam konvertierte, war ganz offensichtlich nicht mit den kritischen Türkei-Analysen Tempels einverstanden. So stellte sie sich in der Schmäh-Gedicht-Affäre um Jan Böhmermann und Erdogan hinter den TV-Moderator und bezeichnete den türkischen Präsidenten in diesem Zusammenhang als ""Pascha"".

Zwar sah sich auch Shapira wegen seiner Wortwahl Kritik ausgesetzt. Aber er erklärte sein Vorgehen in einem zweiten Tweet: ""Er (Lejeune) ist wohl einfach krank und braucht Hilfe, wird aber stattdessen angefeuert. Allerdings kann man deswegen nicht alles durchgehen lassen.""

Die Äußerungen des Erdogan-Anhängers könnten nun sogar ein juristisches Nachspiel haben.

So hat ein Journalist des Nachrichtenblogs ""Ruhrbarone"" mittlerweile gegen Lejeune Strafanzeige ""wegen des Verdachts der Verunglimpfung des Andenkens von Verstorbenen"" gestellt.

Les Bleus ont leur destin en mains: un succès contre le Belarus mardi au Stade de France leur permettra de se qualifier même si les Suédois gagnent contre les Pays-Bas.

Une heure avant le coup d'envoi, la France était repassée en deuxième position de son groupe A, dépassée de deux points par la Suède qui avait écrasé le Luxembourg (8-0). De quoi au passage remuer un peu plus le couteau dans la plaie du piteux 0-0 concédé par les Bleus début septembre à Toulouse face au même Grand-Duché.

Bête noire

Si la France a dominé la Bulgarie en octobre dernier au ""SdF"" (4-1), cet adversaire avait des airs de bête noire, entre le cauchemar de 1993, lorsque la bande d'Emil Kostadinov était venue glacer le Parc des Princes (2-1) et priver les Bleus du Mondial américain, et une terre bulgare où les Bleus ne s'étaient plus imposés depuis 1932.

Les Bleus ont pris le contrôle du match et assommé d'emblée les Bulgares avec un but de Matuidi, dans un angle fermé, après une combinaison entre Digne et Griezmann (3e). Pas mal pour un joueur qui a les ""pieds carrés"", comme il l'avait évoqué mardi avec auto-dérision.

""Mentalement, on est en train de se préparer pour aller à la guerre"", avait assuré Mbappé jeudi. Et il fallait du mental, dans la pluie et le froid, pour surmonter ce match aux allures de traquenard, et répondre au combat, illustré par quelques scènes musclées et cartons jaunes bulgares à la clef.

Il fallait résister. La première période fut largement maîtrisée, avec plusieurs occasions, et une seule frayeur, lorsque Lloris a mal renvoyé un ballon puis s'est rattrapé dans la foulée sur sa ligne (37e).

La seconde période fut bien plus décousue côté bleu. La perte sur blessure de la précieuse sentinelle Kanté, remplacée par Rabiot (34e), l'expliquait peut-être.

Lacazette moyen

Deschamps avait tenté un coup en revenant au 4-3-3 et surtout en titularisant deux ex-Lyonnais, Tolisso au milieu (deuxième sélection), et Lacazette en pointe, détrônant Giroud.

Tolisso a trouvé le ton juste, dans la technique et l'agressivité, tandis que Lacazette s'est moins mis en valeur. Il a certes prodigué quelques belles déviations, mais a notamment perdu son duel avec le gardien (29e), son unique occasion, et tergiversé dans une situation de contre-attaque favorable (66e).

Griezmann s'est montré très mobile, dans tous les bons coups, singulièrement pour le but de Matuidi. Il a beaucoup décroché pour orienter le jeu, et a dès lors manqué de présence aux avant-postes.

Mbappé, lui, a offert de belles opportunités à ses deux acolytes offensifs, que ce soit donc à Lacazette (29e) ou à Griezmann (26e), en vain. Dans un élan côté gauche prenant la défense de vitesse, il a par deux fois manqué de précision, entre un tir détourné par le gardien (15e) et un autre trop enlevé (45e+1).

Chacune de ses prises de balle allumait du danger, même s'il a aussi eu un certain déchet, comme ce centre trop long (18e). Il a été beaucoup plus quelconque en seconde période, remplacé par Giroud (85e).",Bulgarie/France : Le résumé et le but du match de qualification pour le Mondial-2018,http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/07/bulgarie-france-le-resume-et-le-but-du-match-de-qualification-pour-le-mondial-2018_a_23236139/

Doch der Bereich im Gesicht, in dem ihr die Pickel bekommt, sagt mehr über eure Gesundheit aus, als ihr denkt

Oben im Video seht ihr, was die verschiedenen Stellen bedeuten

Dass Stress, Hormone oder eine falsche Ernährung für unreine Haut verantwortlich sein können, ist schon länger bekannt. Spannend ist aber, wie viel eigentlich die Stelle, an der die Pickel auftreten, über deren Ursache aussagt.

Laut dem Dermatologen Joshua Zeichner vom dermatologischen Institut des Mt. Sinai Krankenhaus in New York, lassen sich daraus nämlich einige Schlüsse ziehen.

Stresshormone sorgen für mehr Pickel

So ist für Pickel in der T-Zone, also der Stirn und der Nase, vor allem Stress verantwortlich.

Fehlender Schlaf und emotionale Belastungen sorgen dafür, dass Stresshormone, wie Adrenalin ausgeschüttet werden und so die Talgproduktion der Haut gefördert wird.

Da dieser Bereich mit den Lungen, dem Herzen, sowie der Leber verbunden ist, können Pickel laut chinesischer Medizin aber auch auf Probleme mit dem Blutdruck hindeuten oder auf übermäßigen Alkoholkonsum.

Von Unreinheiten an Kinn, Kieferpartie und Hals sind oft Frauen betroffen. Das liegt vor allem an den wechselnden Hormonen, die sich vor allem einige Tage vor der Periode ändern.

Das männliche Hormon Testosteron ist vermehrt im Körper zu finden, wodurch die Talgdrüsenzellen stimuliert werden.

Unreine Haut kann auch auf Darmprobleme hinweisen

Unreinheiten in der Kiefergegend, weisen gelegentlich aber auch auf Probleme mit dem Dickdarm hin, die oft von industrielle stark verarbeitenden Lebensmittel ausgelöst werden.

Das National Center for Biotechnology Information erklärt, dass der Einfluss der Ernährung auf Pickel und Akne zur Zeit noch sehr umstritten ist.

Dennoch wird vermutet, dass vor allem Milchprodukte und raffinierter Zucker unreine Haut fördern.

Auch fettiges oder sehr säurehaltiges Essen kann für mehr Irritationen im Bereich des Mundes und der Mundwinkel verantwortlich sein.

Zeichner: ""Drückt eure Pickel niemals aus""

Für Ausbrüche am Haaransatz sind vor allem ölige Haar- und Reinigungsprodukte verantwortlich.

So können Haarpflegeprodukte und Rückstände von Produkten zur Gesichtsreinigung die Haut in diesem Bereich reizen.

Zur Behandlung von Unreinheiten hat der Dermatologe einen klaren Tipp.

“Drückt eure Pickel niemals aus. Am besten versucht ihr euer Gesicht so wenig wie möglich zu berühren. Denn das verschlimmert das Ganze nur”.

Zeichner empfiehlt stattdessen, das Gesicht zweimal täglich mit einem ph-neutralen Produkt sanft zu reinigen.

So seid ihr die lästigen Pickel schnell wieder los.

In emails obtained by the Times, Bloom suggested to the Weinstein Company board that Weinstein’s team could do “more and different reporting” in response to the newspaper’s bombshell story, which reported the film executive had settled at least eight sexual harassment claims. Journalist Lauren Sivan added to the allegations on Friday, telling HuffPost Weinstein had once trapped her in a restaurant hallway and masturbated in front of her.

Bloom’s planned strategy, as written in her email, included “photos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct,” according to the Times.

After the Times published its first report on the allegations against Weinstein, Bloom issued a statement Thursday saying that although Weinstein “denies many of the accusations as patently false,” he would not “demean or attack” his accusers.

Bloom told HuffPost in an email that she did not have plans to gather or share photos of his accusers, but she declined to share the full copy of her emails with the board.

“There was no ‘plan.’ I was simply pointing out that there was intense media interest in the story and there would be more to come,” Bloom said. “That everyone should take a breath and wait until an investigation got to the bottom of the facts and then make a decision.”

“Hard to understand how someone could criticize that approach but the board would not have it until later they decided to do exactly that.”

I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein.

My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement. — Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) October 7, 2017

Board members Bob Weinstein (Harvey’s brother and company co-founder) and Lance Maerov were reportedly upset with the plan laid out in Bloom’s email. According to the Times, Maerov asked Bloom to step down, saying that a business deal she has with Harvey Weinstein makes her unable to be impartial when giving the film executive legal advice.

Bloom announced earlier Saturday that she was stepping down from her role as Weinstein’s adviser. Lanny Davis, another one of Weinstein’s legal advisers, followed suit.

When asked if Maerov’s criticisms played a role in her resignation, Bloom said, “The criticism I had of the board and the board had of me had as much relevance to my resignation decision as what I had for breakfast today.”

A self-described “women’s rights advocate,” Bloom also said she would be working on completing a “comprehensive review” of the Weinstein Company’s workplace and gender equality policies.

In the wake of its searing report, the Times has called for Weinstein to release his accusers from any nondisclosure agreements he may have with them so they can speak about issues of gender equality.

Manche warnen schon vor einem Bürgerkrieg

Die spanische Regierung versucht alles, um die immer schneller rollende Unabhängigkeitsbewegung in Katalonien noch zu stoppen.

Nun gibt es den nächsten Versuch: Wenige Tage vor der erwarteten Unabhängigkeitserklärung der nordwestlichen Region hat das spanische Verfassungsgericht die dafür vorgesehene Sitzung des katalanischen Parlamentes untersagt.

Dies berichteten spanische Medien am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf Justizkreise. Die katalanischen Sozialisten (PSC) - strikte Gegner der Separatisten - hatten Beschwerde gegen die geplante Sitzung eingereicht, weil sie die Verfassung verletzte und die Rechte der Abgeordneten missachte.

Das Regionalparlament wollte am kommenden Montag zusammentreten, um die Konsequenzen aus dem Volksabstimmung zu ziehen, bei der sich die große Mehrzahl der Abstimmenden für die Unabhängigkeit von Spanien ausgesprochen hatte. Schon das Referendum war von der Justiz untersagt worden - ohne Konsequenzen.

An der Abstimmung hatten sich 42 Prozent der Stimmberechtigten beteiligt, 90 Prozent stimmten für die Unabhängigkeit. Jedoch waren die Gegner einer Abspaltung der Wahl überwiegend ferngeblieben.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Katalonien-Konflikt gilt als Freiheitskampf - doch er ist vor allem ein Duell rigoroser Nationalisten

Kein Dialog mit der Regionalregierung

Der spanische Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy lehnt jeden Dialog mit der Regionalregierung Kataloniens ab.

In der Nacht zum Donnerstag wies er ein neues Gesprächsangebot der Separatisten energisch zurück. ""Sie haben schon viel Schaden verursacht, ziehen Sie die Drohung einer Abspaltung zurück"", hieß es in einem Kommuniqué an die Adresse des katalanischen Regierungschefs Carles Puigdemont.

Puigdemont hatte Madrid zuvor zu Verhandlungen aufgerufen. Er habe bereits viele Vermittlungsangebote erhalten und ""es wäre unverantwortlich"", diese nicht anzunehmen, erklärte der 54-Jährige in einer Fernsehansprache in Barcelona. Gleichzeitig stellte er klar, dass die Pläne zur Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit auf jeden Fall verwirklicht werden sollen.

Spanischen Medien zufolge werde es immer wahrscheinlicher, dass die Regierung versuche, die Regionalregierung zu entmachten und die Kontrolle über die autonome Region zu übernehmen.

Oettinger: ""Bürgerkrieg mitten in Europa""

EU-Kommissar Günther Oettinger (CDU) warnte derweil vor der Gefahr einer dramatischen Eskalation: ""Die Lage ist sehr, sehr besorgniserregend. Da ist ein Bürgerkrieg vorstellbar, mitten in Europa"", sagte er bei einer Podiumsdiskussion in München.

""Man kann nur hoffen, dass zwischen Madrid und Barcelona bald ein Gesprächsfaden aufgenommen wird."" Die EU könne sich in den Streit aber nicht aus eigenem Antrieb einmischen. ""Eine Moderation durch die EU wäre nur denkbar, wenn wir gefragt werden, aber nicht ungefragt"", betonte Oettinger.

Doch Doug Sosnik, einer der renommiertesten Politikstrategen des Landes, glaubt: Trump wird wiedergewählt werden

Im Video oben seht ihr, warum zudem ein vorzeitiges Ende von Trumps Amtszeit unwahrscheinlich

Was soll man noch schreiben, über einen Mann, der auf jedem Meter derart aneckt, dass die ganze Welt erzittert? Über Donald Trump, der sich mit seinem Rassismus, seiner Kriegstreiberei und seiner Unfähigkeit zu Regieren zum unbeliebtesten US-Präsidenten der Neuzeit gemacht hat?

Doug Sosnik hat diese Frage in einem Artikel für die ""Washington Post"" für sich beantwortet: Er schreibt, dass Donald Trump seine Wiederwahl im Jahr 2020 gelingen wird. Obwohl 56 Prozent der US-Bürger ihn für ungeeignet halten, sein Amt auszuführen. Und obwohl Trumps Beliebtheitswerte am Freitag wieder einmal auf ein Rekordtief fielen.

Sosnik war jahrelang Top-Berater des ehemaligen US-Präsidenten Bill Clinton. Er ist als Politstratege für die Demokratische Partei in den USA tätig.

Laut ihm gibt es gleich vier Gründe, warum Trump sich Hoffnungen auf eine zweite Amtszeit im Weißen Haus machen kann:

Grund 1: Trump braucht keine Mehrheit für den Wahlsieg

Die Mehrheit der US-Amerikaner hat Donald Trump nicht gewählt. Seine Konkurrentin Hillary Clinton hat bei der Wahl drei Millionen Stimmen mehr bekommen als der jetzige US-Präsident.

Trump gewann, weil es bei Wahlen in den USA darum geht, mehr Wahlmänner und -frauen für sich zu gewinnen als der Gegner.

Und das tat Trump. Mit Wahlsiegen in wichtigen Staaten wie Florida, die besonders viele Wahlmandate stellen. Doug Sosnik argumentiert nun: Bei der Wahl im Jahr 2020 könnte Trump auf die gleiche Weise gewinnen. ""Trump weiß, dass die absolute Mehrheit zu gewinnen keine Voraussetzung ist, sondern höchstens ein Anspruch"", schreibt Sosnik.

Tatsächlich seien aber zwei der letzten drei Präsidenten ohne absolute Mehrheit gewählt worden: George W. Bush - und eben Trump.

Grund 2: Die Politikverdrossenheit in den USA hilft Trump

Das Vertrauen in die Politik ist in den USA schwer beschädigt. Nicht nur die Demokraten haben damit zu kämpfen, sondern auch die Republikaner. Donald Trumps Wahlsieg war Ausdruck dieses Frusts, dieser Wut auf das politische Establishment in Washington.

Sosnik schreibt, dass diese Stimmung im Land die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöhe, dass 2020 ein dritter, unabhängiger Kandidat sich um den Posten im Weißen Haus bemühen werde. Außerdem könnten noch weitere Kandidaten vom politischen Rand das Duell von Republikanern und Demokraten stören.

""So ein breites Kandidatenfeld könnte dafür sorgen, dass die Anti-Trump-Front aufgespalten wird"", schreib Sosnik. ""Das würde ihm die Wiederwahl sichern, wenn seine Anhänger gleichzeitig weiter zu ihm halten.""

Grund 3: Trumps Beliebtheit wird unterschätzt

Und danach sieht es aus.

Zwar sehen nur 32 Prozent der US-Bürger Donald laut einer Umfrage der Nachrichtenagentur AP Donald Trumps Präsidentschaft derzeit positiv - doch Sosnik glaubt, dass Erhebungen wie diese Trumps Beliebtheit unterschätzen. So würden die Umfragen alle Wahlberechtigten berücksichtigen. Und nicht nur diejenigen, die tatsächlich als Wähler registriert und gewillt sind, zur Wahl zu gehen.

Hinzu kommt laut Sosnik: ""Viele Wähler wollen einfach nicht offen zugeben, dass sie Trump gewählt haben und unterstützen.""

Grund 4: Der fanatische Kern von Trumps Anhängerschaft

Dem harten Kern von Donald Trumps Anhängerschaft geht das anders. Sie halten eisern und lautstark zu ihrem Präsidenten. Egal, was dieser macht. Sosnik erinnert in diesem Zusammenhang daran, dass Trump einmal im Wahlkampf sagte, er könne mitten auf der Fifth Avenue in Manhattan jemanden erschießen, und seine Fans würden weiter zu ihm halten.

Und noch einer weiteren Gruppe an Anhängern könne der US-Präsident sich gewiss sein: ""Denen, die ihm weiter die Treue halten, weil sie fest davon überzeugt sind, dass er das System in die Luft jagen und echte Veränderungen bewirken wird.""

Sosniks Fazit: In einem gespaltenem Land wird Trump gewinnen

Ob Trump dies gelingen wird, bleibt höchst fraglich. Auf jeden Fall hat der US-Präsident mit einer Rekordfülle an politischen Traditionen in den Vereinigten Staaten gebrochen. Warum sollte er also nicht wiedergewählt werden, obwohl er so unbeliebt ist, wie noch nie ein Präsident zuvor?

Für Sosnik ist klar, dass Trump dies in einem politisch gespaltenem Land gelingen kann. ""Wenn die Demokraten Trump schlagen wollen, müssen sie sich hinter einem Kandidaten vereinen"", schreibt der Wahlkampf-Stratege.

Soll heißen: Einen innerparteilichen Grabenkampf, wie er 2016 zwischen Hillary Clinton und dem Senator Bernie Sanders stattfand, können sich die Demokraten bei der nächsten Wahl nicht erlauben.

KOCHI -- Malayalam superstar Dileep, arrested for alleged involvement in the kidnapping of an actress, was on Tuesday granted bail by the Kerala High Court. The actor later left Aluva sub-jail here to loud cheers from hundreds of his fans.

The bail conditions include surrendering his passport, furnishing a bond of Rs 1 lakh, a pledge to stay away from witnesses in the case and to keep away from the media.

This is the third time Dileep approached the High Court for bail. He had also sought bail earlier twice from the trial court.

The court order on his bail was brought to Aluva sub-jail, where Dileep has been housed, by his brother.

In stark contrast to being hooted by angry crowds who had gathered to see Dileep following his arrest on July 10, on Tuesday hundreds of fans gathered to cheer the star. His fans, including women, began collecting soon after he was granted bail by the Kerala High Court around 2 p.m. They were seen distributing sweets and chanting slogans in his favour.

Dileep was arrested for his alleged involvement in the conspiracy behind the kidnapping of a popular actress in February this year.

Dressed in a white shirt and a fully grown beard, Dileep stood on the running board of the car and waved to his fans, and also stood with folded hands as the car drove away to his home where his mother, actress wife Kavya Madhavan, his daughter and close relatives were waiting to receive him.

The police was present in large numbers in the jail and also at the two homes of the actor near here.

Ernakulam rural Superintendent of Police A.V. George, who was one of the key officials in the probe team, told the media that the charge sheet in the case would be filed soon.

The arguments on the bail plea got over last Friday.

Actor Mahesh, who had been defending Dileep all through, expressed happiness.

""Every time a bail plea was moved, we hoped against hope that he would get bail. Finally, the prayers of his fans have been answered,"" he said.

The abduction of the popular actress took place in February when she was on way from Thrissur to Kochi.

She was taken around in her vehicle forcefully and allegedly molested for about two hours before being dumped near an actor-director's home.

The key accused -- Pulsar Suni and his accomplices involved in the actual abduction -- were arrested a week later. After detailed questioning, police unearthed a conspiracy angle in the abduction and arrested Dileep.",Malayalam Actor Dileep Gets Bail In Kidnapping And Sexual Assault Case,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/03/malayalam-actor-dileep-gets-bail-in-kidnapping-and-sexual-assault-case_a_23230975/

Angela Merkel war am Samstag zu Gast beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union

Merkel zeigte sich in ihrer Rede noch immer ""enttäuscht"" vom Wahlergebnis

Die Kanzlerin kündigte jedoch auch offizielle Gespräche über Verhandlungen zu einer Jamaika-Koalition an

Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat erstmals offiziell Gespräche mit FDP und Grünen über eine Jamaika-Koalition angekündigt.

Es werde schwierige Verhandlungen geben, aber es gehe darum, eine verlässliche Regierung zu bilden, sagte Merkel am Samstag beim ""Deutschlandtag"" der Jungen Union in Dresden. Über einen Koalitionsvertrag werde ein Sonderparteitag entscheiden.

Auf die JU-Forderung nach personeller Erneuerung in einer künftigen Regierung erklärte Merkel, sie wolle ""neue Köpfe"" berücksichtigen. Eine öffentliche Personaldiskussion werde sie aber derzeit nicht führen. Zudem habe sie auch in der Vergangenheit darauf geachtet, dass junge Köpfe in Partei und Regierung Verantwortung hätten.

Bestes Beispiel sei der Parlamentarische Staatssekretär im Finanzministerium, Jens Spahn. Er hatte am Vorabend kaum verborgen heftige Kritik an ihrem Kurs geäußert. Spahn sei Staatssekretär ""ja nicht geworden, weil ich ihn verstecken wollte"", sagte Merkel.

Merkel will Wähler wieder für die Union gewinnen

Um jene Wähler, die die Union diesmal nicht gewählt hätten, müsse gekämpft werden. Die Union müsse sich mit dem Ergebnis auseinandersetzen, es ""ist und bleibt enttäuschend"".

Merkel rief ihre Partei eine Woche vor der Niedersachsen-Wahl zu einer Kraftanstrengung im dortigen Wahlkampf auf. ""Lassen Sie uns bitte noch eine Schippe drauflegen, damit Bernd Althusmann Ministerpräsident dieses Landes wird.""

Zuvor hatte Merkel ihrer Partei eine umfassende Aufarbeitung des Unionsdesasters bei der Bundestagswahl zugesagt, zugleich aber ihre umstrittene Reaktion auf das Ergebnis verteidigt. ""Ich rate uns nun allen dazu, gemeinsam demütig zu sein"", sagte Merkel am Samstag.

With files from Althia RajListen to an interview with Jagmeet Singh on HuffPost Canada's politics podcast:","ADVERTISEMENT

""Socks are out.""

Jagmeet Singh made the quip days before he won the leadership of Canada's left-wing New Democratic Party on the first ballot, a stunning rout of three experienced members of Parliament.

Just ahead of a debate hosted by HuffPost Canada, Singh — immaculately dressed in a pinstriped navy suit and bright orange turban — used the line to explain his noticeably bare ankles.

The 38-year-old politician can't help but stand out. His fashion sense has landed him on best-dressed lists and a profile in GQ. Uncommon stuff for someone aspiring to lead a party that champions the poor and marginalized.

Jagmeet Singh, centre, went sockless during a NDP leadership debate hosted by HuffPost Canada on Sept. 27, 2017. (Photo: Charla Jones/HuffPost Canada)

But one couldn't help but wonder if Singh's sartorial comment was also something of a dig at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose penchant for wacky socks — Look, Chewbacca! — seems to catch the eyes of international media more than his policies.

Or, for that matter, the things Trudeau might not want to talk about, including his abandoned pledge to reform Canada's electoral system or the fact that his government is not complying with a human rights order to boost funding for Indigenous children on reserves.

Like Trudeau, Singh boasts charisma, flash, social media prowess, and remarkable confidence. Both know how to draw a crowd and capture the attention of young people. Both have that thing.

But while Trudeau is the son of a former prime minister, Singh is the child of immigrants from the Indian state of Punjab, who enrolled their boy in taekwondo to fend off bullies. He became a skilled martial artist and wrestler.

While Trudeau tells the world that diversity is Canada's strength, Singh knows what it means to grow up with people calling him dirty because of his brown skin.

It's those kinds of contrasts that have New Democrats — a party often seen as playing for the bronze — bullish that Trudeau may have met his match. They hope that progressives who two years ago were eager to send Conservatives packing will tack further left next time to make history in more ways than one.

A Sikh who boasts a long, black beard, Singh is now the first person of colour to lead a major federal party in Canadian history. Singh was open throughout his campaign about the bigotry he has faced because of the way he looks. He has beaten back questions that he will be rejected in the battleground province of Quebec because of its culture of secularism.

""Growing up with brown skin, long hair and a funny-sounding name meant I faced some challenges,"" Singh said in his acceptance speech in Toronto Sunday — the ""funny name"" bit containing unmistakable shades of the speech that made Barack Obama a star.

""I've been stopped by the police multiple times for no other reason than the colour of my skin. It makes you feel like you don't belong. Like there's something wrong with you for just being you.

""And that's why, as prime minister, I will make sure that no one in Canada is stopped by the police because of the way they look or the colour of their skin.""

Singh, a criminal defence lawyer before making the jump to politics, also told the crowd how, in his 20s, he became the sole income earner for his family and a surrogate parent to his younger brother when his father became ill and couldn't work.

Singh suggested that's another reality that Trudeau doesn't understand. He accused the Trudeau government of delivering a message that Canadians should get used precarious, paycheque-to-paycheque work.

""Maybe if you look at employment as a hobby you can just get used to unstable work, but if your work means the difference between putting food on the table or a roof over the head of your family, then job insecurity is unacceptable,"" Singh said.

There has never been an acceptance speech quite like it because, simply, there's never been a leader like this. Not here, anyway. Not until now.

Singh is the same age as the new Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, who will be 40 by the time the next election rolls around. At 45, Trudeau — dismissed by some as too green two years ago — is suddenly the oldest of Canada's three main party leaders.

Like Trudeau after he won the Liberal Party leadership in 2013, Singh will face questions about whether he has the chops to lead a G7 country. He lacks a federal seat and appears is no rush to get one before the 2019 election, instead hinting he'll spend the days in between criss-crossing the country to rebuild the party at the grassroots.

Like Trudeau, Singh will be called on to prove he's about more than Snapchat and saccharine slogans. His, by the way, is ""love and courage.""

Like Trudeau, Singh knows what it means to have international attention thrust upon him.

Just before NDP members started to vote last month, a heckler spewing ugly words about Shariah law and the Muslim brotherhood confronted Singh at an event.

He urged the crowd not to be intimidated by hate.

""We welcome you. We love you,"" he told the shouting woman with more grace than she was owed.

Later, Singh said he didn't tell that woman he's Sikh because his response to Islamophobia has never been to say that he's not Muslim, but that ""hate is wrong.""

The video was shared around the world. Famous Americans talked about it on Twitter, scratching that itch some Canadians have not only to be noticed but for it to be known that maple-washed notions of Canada as a land devoid of racism don't hold up.

It was all so much more important than socks.

There's a bit to unpack here so bear with us.

We're not exactly sure if he writes his own raps or uses a ghost writer. But while Bill's flows weren't the smoothest, he did manage to sneak in a solid burn or two on the Government, rhyming ""our economy's in debt but Malcolm's just chillin', hey Malcolm can you lend us a couple million?"" and spitting, ""Will I rap again?

Ces dernières semaines, Jean-Luc Mélenchon et Manuel Valls ont multiplié les invectives l'un envers l'autre. Alors que l'ancien premier ministre enchaîne les plateaux télé et radio pour dénoncer la ""dangerosité"" du député des Bouches-du-Rhône, lequel se comporterait comme un ""factieux"", le leader de la France insoumise répond du tac-au-tac.

""Dorénavant, la bande à Valls est totalement intégrée à la fachosphère et à sa propagande"", a tweeté ce samedi 7 octobre Jean-Luc Mélenchon, toute la semaine qualifiée ""d'islamo-gauchiste"" par Manuel Valls. Dernier clash en date entre les deux, celui portant sur la mission en Nouvelle Calédonie, dans laquelle le député des Bouches-du-Rhône refuse de siéger car elle est présidée par ""l'ignoble"" ex-maire d'Evry. Comme si les deux ne pouvaient même plus se trouver ensemble dans une même pièce sans que cela ne dégénère.

Elle paraît alors irréelle, cette photo datée de 1993. On y voit Michel Rocard, accompagné dans son bureau par sa jeune garde. On y retrouve ceux qui sont devenus depuis les deux pires ennemis de l'hémicycle (ci-dessous).

Valls ""contaminé par l'extrême droite""

Comment en est-on arrivé là? Pour une partie de la gauche (et pas seulement pour Jean-Luc Mélenchon), Manuel Valls incarne une forme de trahison, que son choix en faveur d'Emmanuel Macron à la présidentielle contre les règles de la primaire socialiste qu'il avait pourtant signées, est venu conforter.

Sur le plan des idées, les griefs de la gauche de la gauche à son égard sont très nombreux. Autoritarisme, libéralisme économique (défiscalisation des heures supplémentaires, TVA sociale etc.), propos polémiques (Roms n'ayant ""pas vocation à s'intégrer"", ""whites"" et ""blancos"" etc.)... Manuel Valls a souvent heurté la gauche.

Mais pour Jean-Luc Mélenchon, cela va plus loin. ""En établissant une corrélation entre difficultés sociales et immigration, M. Valls vient de valider une thèse absurde du Front national"", taclait-il dès 2012.

En établissant une corrélation entre difficultés sociales et immigration, M. Valls vient de valider une thèse absurde du Front national. — Jean-Luc Mélenchon (@JLMelenchon) 28 juin 2012

Après la sortie de Manuel Valls sur les Roms en 2013, Jean-Luc Mélenchon signait encore un communiqué grinçant. ""Les propos odieux de Valls sur les Roms provoquent enfin une prise de conscience sur ce personnage et la politique qu'il conduit. Il nie le but républicain en assignant les individus à leur ethnie, l'ethnie à un invariant"", écrivait-il sur son blog. Cette même année, il estimait que Manuel Valls était ""contaminé par l'extrême droite"" et qu'il était ""néfaste pour la gauche"".

Une fois à Matignon, l'ex-maire d'Evry a utilisé à six reprises le 49-3, notamment au moment de l'adoption des lois Macron et El-Khomri, toutes deux contestées dans la rue. Du pain bénit pour Jean-Luc Mélenchon et ses soutiens, qui avaient alors beau jeu d'opposer l'autoritarisme de Manuel Valls à la colère populaire.

Tout cela a contribué à faire de Manuel Valls (plus encore que de François Hollande) l'ennemi numéro 1 de la France insoumise. Une animosité à des années lumières de la courtoisie qui prévaut aujourd'hui entre Jean-Luc Mélenchon et l'actuel premier ministre Edouard Philippe.

En témoigne l'élection de Manuel Valls aux élections législatives, toujours contestée à ce jour devant le Conseil constitutionnel. En résumé, la candidate de la France insoumise, Farida Amrani, accuse l'actuel député de l'Essonne d'avoir triché. Ce qui, au moment de la communication des résultats dans le hall de la mairie d'Evry, a donné lieu à une scène pour le moins surréaliste.

Une escalade récente

Mais le ton est encore monté entre Jean-Luc Mélenchon et Manuel Valls quand ce dernier a quitté Matignon pour se tailler un costume de candidat, à la primaire de la gauche d'abord, puis aux législatives. Jean-Luc Mélenchon s'est d'ailleurs rendu dans sa circonscription de l'Essonne pour expliquer aux électeurs que Manuel Valls était ""plus misérable que tout"".

Il faut dire que le natif de Barcelone avait trouvé un angle d'attaque particulièrement virulent: la ""compromission"" dont ferait preuve la France insoumise à l'égard des islamistes. Depuis, Manuel Valls n'a pas arrêté, et a persisté dans ce registre, allant jusqu'à qualifier les députés de la France insoumise ""d'islamo-gauchistes"" dans l'hémicycle. Une intervention applaudie par le FN.

Et cela prend des proportions toujours plus importantes. Ce samedi, le camp Valls accuse désormais la formation de Jean-Luc Mélenchon de nourrir ""une complicité de plus en plus explicite avec les sinistres de la République, avec les thèses de Dieudonné et Alain Soral"".

Taper sur Mélenchon pour se faire une place

En s'attaquant mutuellement, Jean-Luc Mélenchon et Manuel Valls se nourrissent donc du sentiment de rejet que provoque leur adversaire désigné auprès d'une partie des Français.

Mais si le leader de la France insoumise, qui apparaît pour l'heure comme le premier opposant à la politique de l'exécutif, a plus intérêt à tirer sur le tandem Macron-Philippe que sur l'ancien premier ministre, Manuel Valls a au contraire un besoin vital d'exister, lui qui paraît isolé au sein de la nouvelle majorité.

D'où cette stratégie de la mitraille adoptée par l'ancien premier ministre qui, à défaut de pouvoir peser au sein du groupe LREM, continue d'être exposé en endossant le rôle de l'adversaire du premier opposant au président de la République.

PA Wire/PA Images Theresa May struggled to complete her conference speech, as it was disrupted by a prankster and she suffered from a cold

It comes amid reports that backbenchers will pressure May to “impose some discipline” and fire Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary for his repeated interventions in which he set out his own vision for Brexit.

The coup attempt follows the disastrous snap general election result and May’s difficult conference speech, which have left her so weak she appears unable to contain Johnson, leading the press to suggest he is “unsackable”.

May was forced to make a statement saying she would not go and that she was providing “calm and stable” leadership.

Davidson added there were “an awful lot of people in our party who need to settle down”.

She praised May’s “grit and determination” and hinted she found the move against her had a hint of sexism.

“One of the irritants over the last couple of days, for me, particularly as a woman, is this idea that all of these men are supposed to be making decisions on Theresa May’s behalf,” she said.

Meanwhile, The Guardian reports the party’s 1922 Committee will insist next week she have a Cabinet reshuffle to show she is still capable of one.

“There’s a general feeling that there’s support for her there but I do think she needs to do a major reshuffle and if she doesn’t act to sack Boris and to bring some new people on board, she has a problem,” one member told the paper.

It's not quite ""back to Brexit"" as Parliament re-assembles after the conference break - the over-riding issue of British politics does not feature much in a rather humdrum agenda for the first week back.

The main excitement of the week is likely to revolve around ministerial statements and urgent questions. There are plenty of topics to raise: Labour might want to ask about the government's plans on housebuilding and student finance, while the All Party Parliamentary Group on Catalonia is likely to query the government's response to the crisis over its independence referendum, if one of the political parties doesn't get there first.

And, of course, the prime minister will face a testing question time on Wednesday. Will her performance squash talk of a leadership challenge or stoke the speculation to a new fever pitch?

One point to note is that a number of SNP MPs will miss the early part of the week because they will be attending their party conference in Glasgow; reinforcing their longstanding complaint that Parliament doesn't accommodate their gathering, but does tailor its sittings to the needs of the much smaller Lib Dem contingent.

″[Hammond] has basically said ‘look there are other priorities, there’s too much uncertainty right now to double down on the deficit’ and that is the right thing.”","Philip Hammond could be in for a rough ride next month, with a suggestion that for the last seven years the UK’s level of productivity has been overestimated, directly impacting on the Budget.

Last year the Chancellor said he was setting aside £26 billion as a fund to help cushion the effects of leaving the European Union:

The OBR expects cyclically adjusted public sector net borrowing to be 0.9% in 2020-2021, giving us £26 billion of headroom against the headline 2% target in our new fiscal rules, maintaining our fiscal resilience over the period. That was then: What Philip Hammond said in his 2017 Spring Budget speech

But that could now be virtually wiped out thanks to inaccurate estimations by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Financial Times has reported.

In information that could have been passed to the paper from the Treasury in an attempt to get bad news out early ahead of the Autumn Budget, it was revealed that the chancellor’s Brexit “headroom” could be slashed by as much as two-thirds in a public finance “bloodbath”.

The OBR is due to publish a report on Tuesday in which it will suggest it has repeatedly over-estimated how well the UK is doing productivity-wise, the FT said.

This means that growth forecasts are slower, so there will simply less money for everything, including the NHS, council housing and public sector pay.

Speaking on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson explained: “Back in March, the OBR assumed that the economy would be beginning to get back to something like normal over the next three or four years in sense that productivity growth - that’s the amount that we produce every hour we work - would start to get back to normal, growing a couple of percent a year.

“In fact, since last March, the figures have been coming in really badly, productivity has been getting worse not better.”

He added: “It’s certainly going to cause the chancellor a lot more trouble than he was hoping.”

In his Waugh Zone analysis, HuffPost UK’s politics executive editor Paul Waugh explained: “To many this will be evidence of yet another forecasting blunder (the OBR was in Gove’s sights when he attacked ‘experts’ in the EU referendum), but the more immediate problem is a real political headache for Hammond.

“As well as a bit of leeway for Budget goodies to ease the squeeze, he was hoping to have a ‘Brexit cushion’ in case things turned for the worse in coming years.

“Will we now get those tax rises Hammond hinted at this week?”

Also speaking on the Today programme, Rupert Harrison, former chief of staff to George Osborne at the Treasury, said that the overly optimistic estimations meant that reducing the deficit was going to have to wait.

He said: “This ambition of achieving a balanced budget in order to start getting the debt down - which I still think is the right long-term ambition for a small vulnerable open economy like the UK - has been put off a long way to the right.

Full and partial face veils such as burqas and niqabs divide opinion across Europe, setting advocates of religious freedom against secularists and those who argue that such garments are culturally alien or a symbol of the oppression of women.

The niqab covers everything but the eyes, while the burqa also covers the eyes with a transparent veil.

France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have all imposed some restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places.

""This is not a ban on religious clothing, this is a ban on masking,"" Jacob Ellemann-Jensen, spokesman for the Liberal Party, told reporters on Friday after his party, the largest in the coalition government, decided to back a ban.

The burqa overs the entire face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through.

This would effectively mean a ban on the niqab and the burqa, he added. Around 200 women inDenmark wear such garments, according to researchers.

The three-party center-right minority government, its ally the Danish People's Party and the main opposition Social Democrats have all said they are in favor of a ban, though they are still discussing how the ban should be designed and enforced.

""There will come a masking ban in Denmark. That's how it is,"" Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Facebook.

His party, the Liberal Alliance, had previously been one of the staunchest opponents of a ban, saying it limited people's ability to freely choose their attire, but has now aligned its stance with that of the other coalition parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals.

""So if it is practically possible to have such a ban without betraying ourselves or our own values, then the Liberal Alliance will vote for it,"" Samuelsen said.

The niqab is most common in the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf.

The Social Democrats, Denmark's biggest party, has also signaled support in principle for a ban on garments such as the burqa, which it said oppressed women.

""We are ready to ban the burqa if that is what it takes ... But there are some dilemmas, not least with regards to how such a ban would be enforced,"" said the Social Democrats' leader Mette Fredriksen during a debate in parliament on Thursday.

Norway's government in June proposed a ban on face-covering Muslim veils in kindergartens, schools and universities.

Die CSU gestehe zunächst zu, dass das Recht auf Asyl für politisch Verfolgte - wie es auch im Grundgesetz verankert ist - nicht begrenzt werden könne. Das hatten CSU-Politiker zuletzt in Interviews mehrfach gesagt.

Für die vielen Migranten, die als Flüchtlinge nach der Genfer Konvention nach Deutschland kommen, sollen dann Kontingente festgelegt werden, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter. Die Regelung könnte Teil eines Einwanderungsgesetzes werden, das von der Jamaika-Regierung erarbeitet wird.

ADVERTISEMENT

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech yesterday assured the nation that All is Well with the Indian economy, and that there was no reason to worry.

He offered data to sell his argument. Let's go through some of the data that he offered and see what he told us and more importantly what he did not.

The fiscal deficit of the government has fallen from 4.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013-2014, when Manmohan Singh was prime minister, to 3.5 per cent in 2016-2017. Fiscal deficit is the difference between what a government earns and what it spends.

Yes, the fiscal deficit has come down. A major reason for this is the fall in oil prices, since Modi took over as prime minister. On May 26, 2014, the day Modi was sworn in as prime minister, the price of Indian basket of crude stood at $108.1 per barrel. As of October 4, 2017, the price was at $55 per barrel, having fallen to even lower levels during the period.

Oil prices go up and down due to a host of reasons and Modi's government has almost no role to play in it.

The central government has captured much of this fall in price of oil, by increasing the excise duties on petrol and diesel, thereby increasing its earnings, and thereby bringing down the fiscal deficit. As they say, there is a difference between making things simple and making them simplistic.

Prime Minister Modi also claimed in his speech that the current account deficit has improved from -1.7 per cent of the GDP in 2013-2014 to -0.7 per cent of the GDP in 2016-2017. The current account deficit is the difference between total value of imports and the sum of the total value of its exports and net foreign remittances. Or to put it in simpler terms, it is the difference between outflow (through imports) and inflow (through exports and foreign remittances) of foreign exchange.

Again, this has primarily been account of fall in the price of oil and thus a fall in the total amount of dollars that India pays for importing oil. India imports around 80 per cent of the oil that it consumes. Hence, Modi's government has had very little role to play in the fall of the current account deficit.

It further needs to be pointed out that imports are a negative entry in the GDP calculation. So, if imports fall, the GDP rises automatically, assuming everything else stays the same. Falling oil imports are a big reason for the pick-up in the GDP growth, during Modi's tenure as prime minister.

Take a look at the following chart, which was a part of the prime minister's presentation yesterday.

(Source: https://cdn.narendramodi.in/economy_1.pdf)

As per this chart, the total foreign exchange reserves have risen by close to $ 60 billion during the period that Modi has been prime minister. In contrast, they were more or less flat when Manmohan Singh was the prime minister. At least that is what the above chart suggests.

This is primarily because of data has been taken from the end of 2011-2012 onwards. What happens if the data would have been taken from the end of 2003-2004 onwards. Singh first became prime minister in May 2004.

As of March 31, 2004, the total foreign exchange reserves were at around $113 billion. By March 2014, they had jumped to around $304 billion. This meant an increase of 10.4 per cent per ear on an average. Between April 2014 and September 2017, the growth rate in foreign exchange reserves has been at 8.3 per cent per year on an average.

Foreign exchange reserves accumulated at a much faster rate during Manmohan Singh's tenure as prime minister.

Hence, foreign exchange reserves accumulated at a much faster rate during Manmohan Singh's tenure as prime minister. Of course, a bulk of these gains came during the first five years of the tenure, when the forex reserves increased at the rate of 17.4 per cent per year. Between 2009 and 2014, when the Congress-led UPA made a mess of the economy, the increase in foreign exchange slowed down dramatically to 3.8 per cent per year on an average.

Basically, who did well, Singh or Modi, on the foreign exchange front, depends on where we start measuring from.

Prime Minister Modi further said that the interest rate the government pays on the money that it borrows has fallen from 8.45 per cent in 2013-2014 to 7.16 per cent in 2016-2017. This has happened primarily due to two reasons. The falling fiscal deficit has led to the government having to borrow lesser in proportion to the size of the economy. With the government borrowing lesser, interest rates have come down.

It is important to remember here that the government has had to borrow lesser because it has increased excise duty on petrol and diesel and captured the bulk of the gain of falling oil prices.

Also, after demonetisation, a huge amount of deposits ended up with banks. These deposits were reinvested into government securities and in the process interest rates on government securities came down.

Prime Minister Modi pointed out that food inflation is in negative territory. The question is, is that a good thing? Why is food inflation in negative territory? It is in negative territory because farmers haven't got the right prices for their produce. This is primarily on account of the fact that agri-supply chains have collapsed in the aftermath of demonetisation, forcing farmers to sell their produce at rock bottom prices.

The thing is there is no free lunch in economics. The collapse in food prices led to farmers demanding a waiving off agriculture loans and that has happened in state after state. It is ultimately expected to cost the nation, in the form of state governments compensating banks, more than Rs 2 lakh crore.

Over and above this, the prime minister shared data on a few consumption data points. Car sales, two-wheeler sales and tractor sales have improved, since June, hence, all is well.

What the prime minister did not tell us is the rapid rise in non-oil non-gold non-silver imports, post demonetisation. Take a look at the following chart.

(Source: Ministry of Commerce and Industry)

Imports also represent consumer demand at the end of the day, even though that demand does not add to the country's GDP. For example, every time an Indian buys an electronic good manufactured in China, he is adding to the consumer demand but not to the GDP. Of course, he is adding to the Chinese GDP because exports are a positive entry into the GDP formula.

Hence, if we remove the imports of oil, gold and silver, from the total imports number (in dollars), what remains (i.e. non-oil non-gold non-silver imports) is a good indicator of consumer demand.

The above chart tells us that non-oil non-gold non-silver imports have grown at an extremely fast rate after October 2016. They are growing at rates at which they haven't grown for a couple of years. What is happening here?

Demonetisation destroyed domestic supply chains. Without supply chains products can't move. This has resulted in consumer demand being fulfilled through imports.

What this also means is that as demonetisation destroyed supply chains in India, it also led to a huge job destruction.

This is clearly visible in the huge growth of non-oil non-gold non-silver imports. What this also means is that as demonetisation destroyed supply chains in India, it also led to a huge job destruction. If goods weren't moving, there was no point in producing them either. This meant shutdown of firms and massive job losses.

Further, by importing stuff that we used to produce in India earlier, we have helped the manufacturing business in foreign countries and in the process ""possibly"" helped create jobs there.

What the prime minister did not tell us in his speech:

a) During the course of this financial year between April and August 2017, the total outstanding loans of banks (non-food credit) have shrunk. Only retail loans are growing, loans to industry, agriculture and services have shrunk. This, even though interest rates have fallen. What this clearly tells us is that a large section of the economy is not in a good shape and in no mood to borrow money and that is not a good thing.

b) As on March 31, 2017, 22 out of 27 public sector banks had a bad loans ratio of 10 per cent or more. This basically means that out of every Rs 100 of loans given by these banks, Rs 10 or more of loans had gone bad and weren't being repaid.

In fact, five banks had a bad loans rate more than 20 per cent, which basically means that more than one-fifth of the loans given by these banks had gone bad and were not being repaid.

This is a problem that has only grown during Modi's tenure. He and his government have sat on it, and only blamed the previous government for the mess.

c) All the so-called attack on black money has had a very limited impact on the price of real estate. While prices haven't risen, they haven't fallen either. This essentially means that homes continue to remain unaffordable for most people.

d) There has been almost no talk on how demonetisation and now the badly implemented GST have played havoc with the functioning and the existence of small and medium enterprises. If small and medium enterprises keep getting destroyed how is the country ever going to create jobs. It is worth remembering here that one million Indians are entering the workforce every year. Where are the jobs for these people?

e) Our primary education system continues to remain in a mess, with most children finding it difficult to read, write and do basic maths. It has been more than 40 months since Modi was elected prime minister, and nothing serious has been done on this front.

f) The non-government GDP has collapsed to 4.3 per cent. The non-government part of the GDP amounts to close to 90 per cent of the economy.

g) The growth rate of industry in general and manufacturing and construction in particular is at a five-year low. The manufacturing part of industry grew at 1.17 per cent during April to June 2017, whereas construction grew by 2 per cent during the same period. Also, it is worth pointing out here that manufacturing and construction together form 82-85 per cent of industry. If these sectors are barely growing, how will any jobs be created?

I can go and on the bad state of the Indian economy, but there is only so much time and only so much space. The trouble with trying to be clever all the time is that ultimately you get found out and more importantly, the nation doesn't go anywhere.

The first step towards solving a problem is recognising that it exists. The economy has a problem, it is time that the government acknowledged that and worked towards it.

Serenity had a severe brain injury when she was taken to hospital where doctors noticed she was underweight and had multiple bruises. She remained on life support for about a week before she died on Sept. 27, 2014.

Late Friday, Mounties clarified that the charges against the Rabbits were related to the circumstances in which the child lived, noting that the specific injury that caused her death was not criminal in nature.

This investigation.. would be one of the most complex investigations that we've done in a long period of time. RCMP Chief Supt. George Stephensen

RCMP Chief Supt. George Stephensen said Friday that he couldn't release many details about the case and defended the length of time it took to get it to court.

""This investigation, in my opinion, would be one of the most complex investigations that we've done in a long period of time,'' said Stephensen, who added that the Crown was consulted on what charges should be laid.

""This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for all who knew Serenity and we feel her loss. Our thoughts are with them.''

Serenity's death drew criticism and concern when details became public last year. Premier Rachel Notley struck an all-party panel to come up with ways to improve child welfare in the province.

Delays over girl's autopsy and gov't investigations

It has been reported that there were delays and secrecy over the girl's autopsy and about police and government investigations. It was also reported that the child and youth advocate's office was denied critical information in examining the case.

Earlier this year, Alberta introduced legislation to increase the power of the advocate to investigate deaths of children in government care.

The aboriginal girl had been with foster parents for two years before she was placed in what is called kinship care, a program that aims to keep children with relatives and maintain ties to their culture and communities. The relatives became her legal guardians and the government had not been involved with her for almost a year.

Serenity's birth mother warned social workers about abuse

Serenity's birth mother had raised concerns to social workers that the child was being abused, and wanted her moved back to foster care.

""I'm glad to see charges have finally been laid, but I still have questions as to why it took so long,'' Alberta Party Leader Greg Clark said in a release. ""We still don't have clear answers about what went wrong, and we cannot wait for a fatality inquiry to provide those answers.''

Clark said he wants assurances that court cases related to the abuse or death of children are not delayed.

United Conservative Party members Jason Nixon and Ric McIver, who are on the province's child-welfare panel, also issued a statement that said they are relieved to finally see charges.

Three years is a long time to wait.. we know that Serenity's family, and Albertans, want answers. Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley

""It's clear that this case was mishandled from the very beginning and we must understand what went wrong in order to prevent tragedies like this from happening in the future. The United Conservatives remain committed to getting answers for Serenity's family and seeing that our broken child intervention system is fixed.''

Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley said in a statement that Serenity's death was a ""call to action — a symbol of why we must never stop doing everything we can to prevent tragedies like this one.

""Three years is a long time to wait for a family who has already suffered such heartbreaking loss. And we know that Serenity's family, and Albertans, want answers.''

Als Sturmtief ""Xavier"" am Donnerstag über Teile Nord- und Ostdeutschlands fegte, hinterließ er eine Schneise der Verwüstung. Durch umstürzende Bäume kamen insgesamt sieben Menschen ums Leben.

Unter den Opfern ist auch die Journalistin und Politik-Expertin Sylke Tempel, Chefredakteurin der Zeitschrift ""Internationale Politik"" und Vorstandsmitglied der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik.

Doch der tragische Unfalltot Tempels ist für den deutschen Türkei-Aktivisten und Erdogan-Anhänger Martin Lejeune offenbar ein Grund zur Freude.

Jubel über eine Tote

Der ehemalige Journalist, der aus seiner Verehrung für den türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan keinen Hehl macht und damit gerne provoziert, schreibt auf Twitter:

""Die Gebete der Muslime wurden erhört

Der Baum ist die Strafe Gottes für Sylke Tempel's Taten

Gottes Gerechtigkeit siegt

Lejeune, der im Juli 2016 zum Islam konvertierte, war ganz offensichtlich nicht mit den kritischen Türkei-Analysen Tempels einverstanden. So stellte sie sich in der Schmäh-Gedicht-Affäre um Jan Böhmermann und Erdogan hinter den TV-Moderator und bezeichnete den türkischen Präsidenten in diesem Zusammenhang als ""Pascha"".

Zwar sah sich auch Shapira wegen seiner Wortwahl Kritik ausgesetzt. Aber er erklärte sein Vorgehen in einem zweiten Tweet: ""Er (Lejeune) ist wohl einfach krank und braucht Hilfe, wird aber stattdessen angefeuert. Allerdings kann man deswegen nicht alles durchgehen lassen.""

So hat ein Journalist des Nachrichtenblogs ""Ruhrbarone"" mittlerweile gegen Lejeune Strafanzeige ""wegen des Verdachts der Verunglimpfung des Andenkens von Verstorbenen"" gestellt.

This photo doesn't need a funny caption because this grown man is trying to see if his pot plant smells like piss.
Luckily next week promises EVEN MORE DRAMA ABOUT THE POT PLANT!!!","After the shocking exit of four men last night Jarrod proclaimed that the bach pad was shrouded in darkness. Everyone was very gloomy, gloomily looking at the three intruders who were now nestled into the mansion of love.

Suddenly Luke appeared to let them know Shy Financial Advisor James had scored the single date.

As you can see a dark cloud has descended over the Bachelor household.

Everyone cheered except Ryan who continued to gloom due to not being picked. Ryan, who is still getting a cartoon villain edit, said ""It's really testing my patience,"" as lighting struck behind him creating a skull and crossbones of smoke.

Financial Planner James said the eight most important words in 'Bachelorette' history, ""Being on the water makes me so happy,"" which appeased the show's biggest fan: Poseidon king of the oceans.

""This date pleases me,"" Poseidon said from his Perth home while he used his trident to flick between this and 'The Block'.

James' date sounds exactly like a nightmare, having to improvise a fun performance in the middle of Darling Harbour while confused tourists occasionally clapped along to no music.

'The Bachelorette' has now become a talent show where she dates the contestants? More like The Ex Factor!!! Haha, nailed it.

""Yo, my name is Sophie... it rhymes with trophy,"" Sophie rapped as James writhed on stage breakdancing like his skin was full of bees.

""This date turned bad,"" Poseidon said, hitting his TV with his trident in a desperate attempt to end his second-hand embarrassment.

""James is a financial planner,"" Sophie observed, ""and I saw him stand up and do things people in my industry could never do,"" she said while James flicked a ribbon.

The pair then went to enjoy a Manhattan cocktail at a Sydney rooftop bar. ""Is this like the New York skyline?"" James asked as bars and clubs began closing at 8pm.

James, the most adorable and beautiful man ever to grace this Earth, told Sophie he had feelings for her and when she went to give him a rose she said she'd be ""devo"" if he didn't accept it. Everyone watching at home was like, ""same"".

Out of frame is the intern with their hands in an ice bucket after having to light all those candles.

Back at the house it was revealed the group date was all about going back to school. The boys discussed what the date could be. ""I think it could be a test about Sophie,"" Jarrod said excitedly.

""What if they want to know her blood type or what she looks like when she sleeps?"" he thought out loud. ""Bring on the Sophie quiz! Please!!"" he cried, throwing his Sophie flashcards into the air.

The first school challenge was a paper plane contest, whoever could throw it the furthest would win. As always, Jarrod took competition casually and calmly.

Round two was a basketball challenge where Blake revealed he loved basketball and was ready to get the highest score. He got the lowest.

The next test was a maths quiz which seems ridiculous considering iPhones have calculators on them. Jarrod was wearing a ""I <3 Sophie"" sticker to play it cool. It turned out no one was very good at maths.

""Sophie! Sophie! So- Hey Sophie! S- Hey Sophie the only maths I care about is 1+1 if you know what I mean Sophie!! Hey Sophie!!""

The final round faced Ryan against intruder AJ the chef where the two of them would face off in a spelling bee. Each man's words were tailored to his job. Ryan had to spell words like ""building"" and ""wardrobe"". Meanwhile, AJ decided to THROW the competition so Ryan could win in case the other boys would make life hard for him!

AJ claims he didn't want to ""stir the pot"" which is a terrible attitude for a chef, a profession that basically demands constant pot stirring.

That meant Ryan scored the alone time with Sophie, which went terribly last time but we had high hopes for round two.

Just kidding! It went terribly. After confronting Ryan about wanting to actually be there Sophie pretty much gave him the ""It's not you, it's me and this journey and being on this journey,"" speech and sent Ryan packing!

""I definitely want to be here, don't focus on the fact that every conversation we have it appears we have less and less in common!!!""

Osher entered the cocktail party to let the other bachelors know about Ryan's sudden departure, putting added pressure on the evening. And that was just the beginning.

Sophie had some good news for Jarrod, the love plant he gave her had already sprouted. Jarrod's love plant had not sprouted. As any of us would assume, Jarrod's mind went straight to paranoia.

Jarrod sat everyone down and demanded the culprits come forward. It was like a terrible re-enactment of 'Big Little Lies'. ""Who roughed up my plant baby? Which one of you malicious award-winning actresses hurt my beautiful plant child?!""

""People could have pissed in the pot,"" Jarrod assumed, while someone asked if he could smell any piss. ""I'm not going to taste the pot!"" Jarrod responded to literally no one asking him to do such a thing.

This photo doesn't need a funny caption because this grown man is trying to see if his pot plant smells like piss.

It's not every season of 'The Bachelorette' that a shock exit mid-episode is eclipsed by a dude running around screaming about people pissing on his dead plant, but this season truly outdid itself.

""It's really pissed me off,"" Jarrod said about his suspected plant sabotage. ""It's really pissed on me,"" the plant replied.

After all that Intruder Guy (his actual name is Guy we're not just being vague) had to leave with the most wrinkle-free face of all time. Farewell Guy, we hope to see our own reflections on your beautiful, flawless skin in the future.

But as a pharmacist, I was extremely disappointed that the future of community pharmacies was not addressed.

The industry is facing some of its toughest times, with speculation rife that cuts are afoot and pharmacists will be stripped of many of their day-to-day jobs, with responsibilities handed over to technicians instead.

The biggest problem is this: pharmacists are often the most accessible healthcare professionals for people.

You would be surprised at the number of people who walk into their local chemist and say 'can I speak to a pharmacist, please'. They might have a cold, or they might have a rash, or they might have taken some tablets and they feel dizzy.

Ultimately, they want some help and advice, and they wanted it fairly quickly and without having to make an appointment with their GP.

Pharmacists go through four years of training and generally have extensive knowledge about the suitability of medications, and what medicines work well with another.

We are the final gate post before the drug gets to the patient, and often the first person a patient comes to if they have any questions.

New plans, which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to consider, include allowing technicians to supervise a pharmacy and hand out prescription-only medication without a pharmacist being present.

These plans have understandably caused controversy and a real fear that patients will suffer.

To put it simply, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians go through very different training and have very different skill sets.

Technicians are trained in accuracy. They are trained to make sure the right sticker is on the right box.

Pharmacists are trained in pharmacology. We don't just check prescriptions, but clinically assess the suitability of a medicine for the patient, and whether one medicine matches another.

If mistakes were to occur, in the most extreme cases it could mean life or death. This isn't an over exaggeration.

It's all too easy for government ministers to make decisions based on cost and balancing the books, without spending time fully getting to grips with what a pharmacist actually does.

If given the go ahead, the current legislation will need to be amended to allow 'pharmacy professionals' to take responsibility for the supply and sale of prescription only medicines.

This is simply a push-back and will put more pressure on over-stretched GP surgeries.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health previously said they wanted to ""optimise"" the skills of technicians and ""make the best use of staff"".

They added no changes would be made without proper consultation.

In response, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society recently produced an eight-point position statement setting out their objection to any plans which would involve 'pharmacies run without pharmacists'.

Among the points, they said they wanted to see ""the law constructed so as to ensure the pharmacist always has the opportunity to undertake the clinical assessment or check"".

They added they did not want to see any law changes ""which could be used to operate pharmacies without pharmacists being present for anything other than very short periods of time"".

I couldn't agree with this more.

A post shared by Kayla Grey (@kayla_grey) on Apr 11, 2017 at 2:36pm PDTGrey can relate.
For Grey and many other women in sports journalism, comments like Newton's aren't the only ones they contend with.
""For me, the hurdle as a sports journalist in Canada isn't so much being a woman — it's being a woman of colour,"" shares Grey.","If you're into sports, into journalism, or into both — you probably heard about Cam Newton's (the Carolina Panthers quarterback) recent response to reporter Jourdan Rodrigue who asked him a question, and basically, did her job.

""It's funny to hear a female talk about routes like — it's funny,"" Newton responded.

The humour was lost on many, including women working in sports journalism.

Women with some level of visibility, especially in male-dominated fields, often face particular job hazards that men are able to avoid. Rodrigue was the latest example, but not the only one — consider just this past August, when Radio-Canada journalist Valerie-Micaela Bain requested the public's help identifying a man who kissed her without her consent on camera.

We must remember people are not knowledgeable because they are men or white or rich.

The sports world is often a difficult one for women to thrive in, as women often have to battle against people minimizing their work and expertise. Philosopher Myisha Cherry summed up the struggle in a HuffPost blog:

""We must remember people are not knowledgeable because they are men or white or rich. Neither are people smart because of certain racial or sexual biological features. Rather we acquire knowledge through study and experience. What make us credible are not our biological features but the actual knowledge we possess.""

Many female sports journalists spoke out after Newton's recent comment (for which he has since apologized), and one of those women is Kayla Grey, an anchor and reporter at TSN.

Combining her love of storytelling with her passion for sports — ""my grandmother would watch [Blue Jays games] with the TV on mute while my grandfather would crank the radio"" — a career in sports journalism was a natural fit.

Sometimes you feel as though you are constantly having to prove your credibility.

That career has come with its ups and downs, not least because of her gender.

""Being a woman in this industry has had its challenges,"" she tells HuffPost Canada. ""Sometimes you feel as though you are constantly having to prove your credibility. You feel as though you can't make as many — if any, mistakes.""

.. still waiting for the joke though... smh https://t.co/n4pdx1dibB — Kayla Grey (@Kayla_Grey) October 4, 2017

And what did she think of Newton's comment?

""When I first saw the video from the news conference all I could feel was disappointed,"" she says. ""Disappointed that he didn't just answer the question, because it was good regardless of who it was coming from. Instead, he was so stumped on the fact that a woman was asking it.""

A post shared by Kayla Grey (@kayla_grey) on Apr 11, 2017 at 2:36pm PDT

Grey can relate. She recounts a time when a basketball player she interviewed expressed shock at her stats knowledge. When he exclaimed, ""Wow, you really know your stuff!"" Grey responded with ""What? You think I just showed up here with no stats?""

""I honestly didn't take much offence to it,"" Grey says. ""I should know my stuff, but sometimes you have to let people know you mean business.""

I take pride in surrounding myself around men and women in the industry that are supportive but also not afraid to reel you in.

For Grey and many other women in sports journalism, comments like Newton's aren't the only ones they contend with. Male colleagues can also be an obstacle to overcome.

""Won't lie, I've had my run-ins in my career. Men thinking that you're in it for the worst reasons. I take pride in surrounding myself with men and women in the industry that are supportive but also not afraid to reel you in. You need those kinds of relationships for your sanity,"" Grey says.

""Thankfully, I'm in a space where my colleagues treat me with respect and don't back down or soften any conversations because I am a woman.""

As we've seen for decades, race is an indelible part of professional sports, and this is mirrored in sports journalism. ""For me, the hurdle as a sports journalist in Canada isn't so much being a woman — it's being a woman of colour,"" shares Grey.

""We've still got a ways to go. I see that more than ever with the way race has been at the forefront of many topics in sports these days, and the lack of care to get actual black voices in Canada to speak on it is troubling.""

Being the 'only' in a locker room can often feel very lonely.

As Grey states, ""Being the 'only' in a locker room can often feel very lonely,"" but as more women take up space in sports journalism, the hope is that the industry will become more equitable, from all angles.

What advice does Grey have for girls or women interested in sports journalism?

""I would say always remember your ""why?"" Why are you doing this? Why did you fall in love with sports ? Why is your perspective so needed in this industry? Once you have that written down — never forget it, because you'll need it for the highs and lows,"" she shares.

""People will try to test you and your existence in this space. Understand that you belong wherever you've worked hard to get. I would also say don't be too hard on yourself, the ball still bounces.""",Canadian Journalist Kayla Grey Doesn’t Think It's 'Funny' She’s A Woman In Sports,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/06/journalist-woman-in-sports_a_23235530/

Whether it's a president venting (probably) from the toilet, a Kardashian's ovaries or your friend's dad who keeps posting articles on immigration that maybe, might be, definitely are racist, you'll be hard-pressed to find an access point to opinions as immediate and extensive as a social network.

Donald Trump And The Great NFL Distraction One of the more fun types of play you'll see during any NFL game, is the play-action pass. It is an elaborate fake, involving the QB pretending to hand the ball to the running back while actually concealing the fact they have kept the ball and intend to throw it downfield for a touchdown. When it's done well it's deadly, making the defender think one thing is going on, when they should be worried about something else entirely.

With Increasing Speed, A Key Component Of Donald Trump's Support Base Is Starting To Abandon Him Donald Trump's tenure in the Oval Office seems to reach new depths of despair with each passing week. An inability to score any sizeable policy victories (despite the Republicans controlling both the House of Representatives and the Senate) mixed with a serious investigation into possible collusion between his campaign team and the Russian government has left the president increasingly weak, isolated and, most damaging of all, deeply unpopular.

MOSCOW/ST PETERSBURG, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Police detained more than 200 opposition activists on Saturday for taking part in a wave of anti-Kremlin protests across Russia in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, ahead of a presidential election in March, a monitoring group reported.

Under grey skies and intermittent rain, over two thousand people gathered in central Moscow's Pushkin Square and chanted ""Russia will be free"" and ""Russia without Putin"" before walking towards the Kremlin and parliament.

Police briefly detained a few people, but did not charge anyone. It was a different story at rallies in other cities however, and the OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said at least 262 people had been detained in 27 towns.

In St Petersburg, Putin's home town, a Reuters witness saw riot police roughly detain at least 11 people. OVD-Info said at least 66 people had been detained in the city.

Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for violating rules on public meetings, called the rally in Moscow and other cities to coincide with Putin's 65th birthday.

Some of the public protests were unsanctioned.

Putin, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for almost 18 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term.

Navalny hopes to run too, despite the central election commission declaring him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence he says was politically-motivated.

One of the Moscow protesters held a homemade poster of Putin sitting on a mountain of banknotes, wearing a crown with the legend: ""Happy Birthday you little thief!""

Others carried posters citing their right to protest, some waved Russian flags, and a few carried inflatable yellow ducks, a jokey reference to Navalny accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of owning a lavish estate with a duck house.

Medvedev called the claims politically-motivated nonsense.

There was also a rally in St. Petersburg.

In St Petersburg, some 1,500 activists waving red and white banners gathered in a square before heading for the city's main street shouting ""Putin is a thief"" and ""Free Navalny.""

PROTESTS MORE MODEST IN SIZE

The size of Saturday's Moscow rally and others across Russia looked far more modest than Navalny-backed mass protests in March and June, which were widely recognized to be some of the biggest since 2012.

Many of the Moscow protesters were teenagers or in their twenties.

Carrying a yellow duck, Ulugbek Apsapayev, 17, said he had turned up because he wanted a better future for Russia.

""The duck is a sign that we support Alexei Navalny who also wants only good things for the country. But unfortunately we only have Vladimir Putin and his gang in power.""

Putin is popular across the country however, especially outside major cities where his strong leadership style and tough foreign policy stance go down well. He is expected to confirm later this year that he will run for another six-year term.

Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny.

Opinion polls show he would comfortably beat Navalny if the opposition leader was allowed to run. Navalny says such polls are meaningless because there is no fair political competition.

Putin spent his birthday taking congratulatory calls from other world leaders, and chaired a security council meeting.

Authorities had refused to approve most of Saturday's rallies, but Navalny says Russians' right to protest is enshrined in the constitution.

For the last couple of days, Bengal witnessed a major fracas-- the Durga idol bhashan (immersions) coinciding with Muharram. First, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that Durga idol immersion won't take place on Vijaya Dashami (Dussehra in other states), which coincides with Muharram. The BJP opposed the decision. Banerjee then justified the administrative order on grounds that the government wants to avoid any law and order problems. Meanwhile, the BJP was quick to call this as another example of Banerjee's ""appeasement of Muslims"". Last week, the Calcutta high court cancelled the West Bengal government's decision to restrict the immersions.

While the parties and politicians fought, Bengal proved once again that there's so scope for hate there.

This year, Muslims in West Bengal's Kharagpur cancelled their Muharram procession all because they wanted to save the money and use it for the treatment of a Hindu neighbour, a cancer patient.

According to a Hindustan Times report, a local club which organises Muharram procession in Kharagpur's Puratan Bazar, raises around Rs 50,000 every year for the celebration. This year, they are raising the same amount, but not to celebrate. They will give it to Abir Bhunia, a resident in the same area, who is suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bhunia, a mobile recharge shop owner needs Rs 12 lakh for a treatment that includes bone marrow transplantation.

""I don't know whether I will be cured finally. But what my neighbours did for me have touched my heart,"" Bhunia told HT. He is undergoing chemotherapy at Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre.

The club has plans to raise more money than the usual amount for the celebration.

""Muharram processions can be organised every year. But we have to save the life first,"" Amjad Khan, secretary of Samaj Sangha told the newspaper.

But this isn't all. Finding examples of communal harmony in Bengal isn't difficult at all.

On Sunday, at Sunur, a village about 125 km from Kolkata, drummers (dhakis) of a local Durga puja beat the drums for a Muharram procession, when those hired for the tazia procession did not turn up.

""In our village we celebrate all religious programmes together. Members of the Muslim community join us in Durga puja. The women folk of Hindu households also observe a fast on Muharram till they offer puja after the procession,"" said the secretary of the club that organises the Durga Puja.

Now, this is Bengal for you. Are the politicians listening to the dhak beats?

Police warned the demonstrators that the rally has not been sanctioned and urged them to disperse, but did not immediately move to break up the protest.

Police and the National Guard showed up in full force in central Moscow and in St Petersburg, where a rally is set to be held later.

Navalny has declared his intention to run for president in the March election, even though a criminal conviction he calls politically motivated bars him from running.

The 41-year-old anti-corruption crusader has organised several waves of protests this year, casting a challenge to the Kremlin.

Putin has not yet announced his intention to seek re-election, but he is widely expected to run. With his current approval ratings topping 80%, he is set to win another six-year term in a race against torpid veterans of past election campaigns, like Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.

Navalny argued that a high level of support for Putin results from the lack of real political competition and urged his supporters to help him get registered for the race.

“The 86% approval rating exists in a political vacuum,” he said. “It’s like asking a person who has been fed with rutabaga through his entire life how eatable they find it and the rating will be quite high. Listen, there are other things which are better than rutabaga.”

The sarcastic analogy demonstrated his stinging style, which has recently helped him get broad support among youths. He has worked to expand his reach with videos exposing official corruption and YouTube live broadcasts.

His documentary about prime minister Dmitry Medvedev’s alleged ill-gotten wealth has been viewed nearly 25 million times since its release in early March, helping galvanise protests.",Protests Held In 'Almost 80' Russian Cities On Putin's Birthday Over Presidential Race,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/07/protests-80-russian-cities_n_18211642.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Earlier that year, the World Health Organisation had declared a global public health emergency around Zika virus and its link to horrific birth defects, the epicenter of which was in Olympics host country Brazil. Should athletes, most of whom were of reproductive age, skip an event for which they had trained for years? Or should they plunge forward, despite some warnings from public health experts?

It turns out that Zika virus was a smaller risk than many thought it would be, but athletes were not spared the consequences of other mosquito-borne viruses. Researchers from the University of Utah Health found that while no one on the U.S. teams, or their support staff, contracted Zika virus, a small minority of people tested positive for less mysterious, but similarly serious, viruses like West Nile, Dengue and Chikungunya, which can be passed along by the same mosquito that transmits Zika.

""Everyone was concentrating on Zika and ignoring that there could be other infections caused by mosquito bites,"" said researcher Dr. Krow Ampofo, in a statement about the study. ""We did not expect to find so many with these other infections.""

The findings align with a smaller study on 117 team members from Spain, who all tested negative for Zika after the Olympic games were over, as well as a larger WHO survey that didn't turn up a single Zika case among athletes or visitors in Brazilian health facilities immediately after the events. However, Ampofo's is the most wide-ranging analysis, in that it tested for more mosquito-borne viruses beyond Zika.

He planned to present the unpublished results Saturday at IDWeek, a national infectious disease conference in San Diego.

Of the approximately 2,000 athletes, coaches and support staff who traveled to Rio from the U.S. last year, 457 of them provided the university with blood samples both before and after the Olympic games. The participants also filled out a survey about what they had done in Brazil, where they had traveled, and what kinds of precautions they had taken against mosquito bites.

None tested positive for Zika, but seven percent of the participants had become infected with other mosquito-borne illnesses: West Nile virus (27 cases), Chikungunya (3 cases) and Dengue (2 cases).

Researchers alerted all 32 people who tested positive for one of these diseases, and solicited surveys about their symptoms. Of the 12 people who responded, only three reported mild symptoms, while the rest had no symptoms at all.

While these results may seem as if the global anxiety over Zika at the Olympics was much ado about nothing, Ampofo told HuffPost that the world was truly witnessing an unprecedented, fast-moving epidemic, made all the more frightening by a lack of understanding about how it caused severe birth defects.

""I don't think it was blown out of proportion,"" said Ampofo. ""It's just that everybody had to take the necessary precautions in the absence of information of what it was going to be like at the time of the Olympic games.""

A contributing factor to the lack of Zika virus cases among U.S. participants may have been the fact that because the Olympics took place during Brazil's winter, mosquito bite risk was lower than it had been at the height of the Zika epidemic. But as the 32 cases of other viruses show, the risk wasn't zero.

Ampofo also noted that there was one behavior that unified most of the study participants who had gotten a mosquito-borne infection.

""When we looked at the data, those who developed an arbovirus infection were less likely to adhere to the preventive measures that were recommended before they went, especially using mosquito repellant,"" he said ― a lesson for international travelers.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidelines on how to prevent mosquito bites, and updates a count of countries and territories where Zika virus is still a risk.

Symptoms for the other three viruses can vary substantially. Most people who contract West Nile Virus will have no symptoms at all, but in about one out of every 150 cases, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.

Meanwhile, Dengue, which is also known as breakbone fever, can come with severe head and eye pain, muscle and joint pain, and a rash. It can also progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever, or severe dengue, which can cause bleeding in the nose or gums, internal bleeding, vomiting and death. There were 2.35 million cases of dengue in the Americas in 2015, according to the WHO. About 10,000 cases progressed to severe dengue, and 1,181 people died.

Finally, Chikungunya causes most people who get the virus to have symptoms like fever, joint and muscle pain, and rash. In some people, the joint pain can last for months and be disabling, according to the CDC, but deaths are rare.

While Brazil declared its Zika emergency officially over in May of this year, thanks in part to a nationwide campaign to eradicate mosquitos, the country is now grappling with the support and care of more than 2,000 babies born with varying disabilities as a result of a Zika infection in the womb, most of whom were born to poor families who live far away from health centers.

On October 2, Prakash Raj, a celebrated actor who has dabbled in multiple film industries, minced no words when he called out Prime Minister Narendra Modi for choosing to remain silent on the murder of activist and journalist, Gauri Lankesh.

""I am worried about the PM's silence. Is he trying to endorse cruelty espoused by some of his followers,"" he questioned.

Raj particularly pointed out the people who celebrated the brazen, remorseless and cold-blooded killing of Lankesh, on Twitter. Among those who were joyously celebrating her death were people followed by Modi's official account on the micro-blogging site.

What is unique about Raj's comments is that his is one of the few dissenting voices emerging from the collective film industries of India, that questioned the establishment which Lankesh extensively wrote against.

Other than the usual few (Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das) not many actors from the Hindi film industry condemned Lankesh's death, let alone questioning the PM's silence over the cowardly attack on the journalist.

At this point, more than ever before, our cultural institutions bear the responsibility of speaking truth to power. And while it's the moral responsibility of every artiste to question the regime and look at its increasing hegemony with skepticism, Bollywood, which is one of the country's most influential industries, cannot afford to look the other way in a bid to preserve its commercial interests. Not anymore.

While nobody is going to hold a filmmaker or an actor accountable for their lack of political engagement (and one can't because they are not activists), should that entirely absolve them from taking a stand? In majoritarian politics, it's the responsibility, nay, duty, of leading figures in akrts to ensure they represent the voices of the marginalised.

In January 2017, a fringe group that goes by the name of Rajput Karni Sena, thronged the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansal's historic-epic Padmavati, pulled the director's hair, slapped him across the face. The group had a problem with the depiction of Queen Padmavati, who they feared, was being shown romantically involved with Sultan Alaudidn Khilji, a claim Bhansali denied. Despite the brazen attacks, no arrests were made. It's hard to imagine for a group to conduct such planned attacks (which were captured on camera) and get away with it, unless they have some form of insidious support from the State.

#WATCH Visuals of Padmavati set vandalised by fringe group in Kolhapur, Maharashtra pic.twitter.com/C6o4C0xN6z — TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) March 15, 2017

The final compromise that was reached between the Sena and Bhansali wouldn't be out of place in a Banana Republic: Bhansali had to give them in writing that he won't show intimate scenes between the Queen and the Sultan and, according to reports, he also has to show the film to the Sena before its release.

But what if Bhansali wanted to subvert? What if he wanted his narrative to deviate from history? Historical fiction is a popular genre across continents and as a filmmaker practising his vocation in the world's largest democracy, Bhansali should be able to exercise his right without the fear of repercussion.

These are exactly the privileges that are currently under threat and the film industry, which in itself remains a divided lot, needs to come together as a community and make their voices heard, and not only when it serves their purpose, but also when it goes beyond that.

This year it was Bhansali. In 2016, it was Karan Johar, targeted by the MNS (a Mumbai-based spin-off of Shiv Sena that thrives on divisive politics) for having cast Fawad Khan in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. The threats reached such a point that Johar had to issue an apology to ensure the safe release of his mega-budget romantic drama.

This sets a very dangerous precedent. The fact that Johar bowed down to such elements emboldens them to do it over and over again. And we weren't like this.

We used to be stronger than this.

In the communally charged year of 1998, Deepa Mehta's Fire, a film about lesbian lovers, was targeted by the Shiv Sena as it deemed lesbianism as 'alien to Indian culture.' Despite a Censor Board clearance, Sena, a ruling party in Maharashtra at the time, attacked cinema halls in Mumbai, Delhi, and Kanpur, disrupting the screenings and stirring a debate about State-sponsored hooliganism.

The film was eventually banned albeit temporarily.

You'd imagine Mehta bowing down, issuing an apology and moving on? Nope. Bollywood rallied against the ban. Mahesh Bhatt, Dilip Kumar, Shabana Azmi and Deepa Mehta led protests against saffron forces, marched on the streets, went to courts, and got an order to get the film re-released, without any cuts.

Yes, Dilip Kumar's house was surrounded by protesters, yes there were threats, but in hindsight, what we remember is an industry standing up for itself. And winning.

In 1989, Shabana Azmi took to the stage at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) held at Delhi and strongly condemned the brazen murder of theatre activist Safdar Hashmi by the political goons. She didn't stop there — Azmi went on to call out the ruling Congress party for its alleged role in the murder. Fun fact: IFFI was organised by the government and HKL Bhagat, the then I&B Minister, was sitting in the audience.

In 1975, Kishore Kumar refused to bow down to diktats laid out by Indira Gandhi via her propagandist-in-chief VC Shukla. Gandhi wanted Kumar to sing a song at a Congress rally in Mumbai. He plainly refused, a decision that'd get him banned from the state broadcaster, All India Radio and Doordarshan.

If you go further back in time, in 1949, ace filmmaker Balraj Sahni and poet-lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri even spent time in prison for their scathing critique of the Nehru government.

The point remains the same: Bollywood was known to take a stand, even if it came at a price, which it almost always did.

Sure, the times we live in have changed drastically and unlike solo producers, we now have colossal studios bankrolling films, whose only concern is to get return on their massive investments. How can a film star sabotage millions in revenue for the sake of politics?

After all, when Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan spoke out against the growing intolerance, it resulted in their respective films (Dilwale, PK) losing out on sizeable revenue due to their political outspokenness.

But one must not lose sight of the longterm consequences of political pacification because of immediate financial gratification.

The only way to combat this is to have a unified voice that cannot be stifled by arbitrary protests. Bollywood, as a unit, must demand complete security from the policing machinery, whenever there is a threat to their jobs. It cannot work out when an Amitabh Bachchan (who has never taken a stand on anything, not even against the BMC after the 29 August floods in Mumbai) happily takes over the title of the brand ambassador of Gujarat, after Aamir Khan is sacked from that very position for speaking out against intolerance.

Bollywood must recognise the intensity of the power that it can wield if it decides to collectively come together and put the weight of its stars to champion a cause. At the same time, it can't happen if there continues to be a very real nexus between the two institutions.

We needs more celebrities like Prakash Raj. We need our own Meryl Streeps, our George Clooneys, our Mark Ruffalos, our Katy Perrys. Sure, the freedom afforded to people in the US may vastly differ in its scope, but shouldn't we compare ourselves to countries that are better off, as opposed to the ones where the idea of protest in itself is a joke?

Bollywood's many inhabitants may feel they are soft targets, they are vulnerable, that there's a very real price to pay — but the reason why they are vulnerable in the first place is because the establishment fears their exponential reach.

It takes advantage of their divisiveness and creates a fear psychosis.

But together, the flame of dissent cannot be extinguished.

It'll only show us a way out of the darkness.

Early in 2015, consulting giant Ernst & Young launched an online countdown to gender parity. Many of us clicked the refresh button repeatedly, hoping to reveal what must be a joke -- parity was to be achieved in precisely 115 years.

I went back to it recently hoping for a DeLorean time-jump thanks to the subject of women and her ascendancy within our cultural zeitgeist. Instead the timeframe had slid back to a whopping 170 years.

This is greatly upsetting for all of us. It's a signpost of two things: a growing social divide between traditionalists and modern-progressives, and an interminable gross misunderstanding of gender. In business especially, we are losing out on the female opportunity.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently stood before a very high-level gathering and extolled the benefits of women's economic empowerment: ""This is not only detrimental to women, it represents a loss for society as a whole,"" he said.

Numerous studies have shown that were women to participate equally in the economy; global GDP could increase by at least 26 percent -- the equivalent of $12 trillion by 2025. A great achievement for the stability and growth of societies and economies worldwide.

The numbers are stacked in favour of soaring profits once the issue of gender gets pushed to the top of the pile.

Bringing the year for achieving gender parity from 2187 to 2025 is going to be hard work if we all want to reap the benefits. Barriers to participation must be removed, pay needs to be distributed equally and work structures should be reworked to cater to everyone's needs.

Even still, it'll take a full commitment to counter pushback. The recent furore in Silicon Valley over standardised diversity and inclusion policies reveals a simmering discontent driving a backlash against the economic benefit to all -- men included.

For every hundred leaders who push gender to the bottom of the slush pile, there are a few who are seeing through the billion-dollar bi-focal lenses. Larry Fink CEO of Black Rock, head of the world's largest asset manager, recently called for a commitment to gender diversity with a truly valuable insight.

""The reality is in the world more than 50 percent of household wealth is managed by women,"" Fink said to a crowded room at the Bloomberg Business Forum in New York, ""And so if I'm going to be a mirror of my clients; we are going to need more women in our firm"".

He's not wrong -- Ernst & Young also identified that by 2028 women will be responsible for 75 percent of discretionary spend -- whether we like it or not.

As the world changes, business must move in perfect tandem in order to keep abreast of new needs, evolved understandings, and the tilts and shifts of economic and social power starting especially with gender.

Fink and Black Rock have taken the first step, have you?

1. Identify the clash between the gender of your business culture and the gender of your customers.

When your internal business and its output does not reflect contemporary values and modern life experiences in an increasingly globalised and changing world; then Muhammad must play fast catch up to get to the mountain.

2. Now bring in a female lens.

Seeing through a new focused perspective helps further embed diversity modules and can be learned and valued by both genders. A female lens builds upon the maxim that we can create better connection and empathy with our stakeholders when we 'walk in her/his/their shoes'.

It is understanding gender differences from biology and thinking patterns to life experiences -- and utilising it as a powerful business advantage.

Furthermore, a female lens helps you audit your business from top to bottom, from edge to edge, and assists in identifying the blind spots between your internal culture and the external.

Not to mention that training all employees to see through a female lens will drive cultural buy-in because it values the virtue and innovation of female staff -- while including male staff -- because it becomes a standardised skill for better competitor advantage.

We are at the tip of the disruption iceberg. Whilst many look to technology, there is one perspective that cannot be overlooked due to the sheer economic force of it -- female influence and power.

The research by Dove, given exclusively to HuffPost UK, interviewed more than 5,000 girls aged 10-17 across 14 countries.

It found that having higher levels of body esteem - defined as how individuals evaluate their own physical appearance - has a lasting impact on a girl’s confidence, resilience and life satisfaction as she enters adulthood.

In contrast, girls with low body esteem are more likely to succumb to beauty and appearance pressures and will withdraw from fundamental life-building activities such as socialising or joining clubs.

The body esteem of girls in the study was assessed using the Mendelson scale, which is a measure made up of 18 statements.

Girls were asked to signify how much they identified with negative statements such as “there are lots of things I would change about my looks if I could” or positive statements such as “I am proud of my body”. They were then given an overall “body esteem” score.

The report found that almost six in 10 girls globally have avoided an activity because of the way that they look. This rises to three-quarters (75%) for Russian and Indonesian girls.

In comparison, 53% of girls in the UK have avoided an activity because they felt badly about their appearance while Japan came out as the least affected, with just 22% of girls saying the same.

Louise*, a 17-year-old from south east England, told HuffPost UK that anxiety about her appearance changes the way she socialises.

“A lot of the time, I may not go out. I feel like other people will hate what I look like, because I hate it,” she said.

“I’ll say I can’t go to dinner and make excuses not to eat because I don’t feel good about my body that day. I don’t want to show myself off, because I don’t want other people to see me because they’ll think I’m fat.”

Louise said the one-dimensional image of beauty we see portrayed in the media is contributing to the low self-esteem girls her age and younger feel.

“A lot of it is to do with social media and the way people like Kylie and Kendal Jenner are presented as society’s ‘beauty’ because they’re so skinny,” she said.

“All these models you see are so skinny and it gets it in our heads, and my head, that I have to be skinny because they’re skinny.”

Sadly, Louise’s experience is not unique. The report found that globally, five in 10 girls (55%) will not spend time with friends and family, participate in activities outside the house, or try out for a team or club if they aren’t happy with the way they look.

This number significantly increases to eight in 10 (80%) for girls with low body esteem, but actually drops to four in 10 (41%) for girls with high body esteem.

The survey also found that girls with low body esteem feel additional pressure to get good grades in school, get married and never make mistakes compared to those with high body esteem.

Abiee Harris, a 20-year-old Girlguiding peer educator, said body image was a major concern for her as a teenager and impacted her school life.

“I remember when I was 10, I got so upset with how I looked that I’d hide when I got changed for PE and asked my mum to help me lose weight,” she told HuffPost UK.

“At secondary school I didn’t want to put my hand up in class in case I had sweat patches and I sometimes wouldn’t wear clothes that I really liked because they were too tight fitting.

“Looking back now there was nothing wrong, but it was still holding me back. I’m quite confident about my body at the moment, but even now I have a few

wobbles.”

Abiee Harris Abiee Harris.

In her role at Girlguiding, Harris she still sees teenagers having the same concerns she did as a youngster.

“When I run sessions with groups of girls as the peer educator for Girlguiding, they talk about the ‘image myth’ and it’s scary that girls all come out with the same idea and vision. That’s what they’e aspiring to be and it’s sad to see that,” she said.

While girls show increasing awareness of the media’s role in driving unattainable beauty ideals, the report found that only those with high body esteem seem equipped to respond to these pressures.

A total of eight in 10 (78%) with high body esteem said they think they are beautiful even if they are different from what they see in the media. This is compared to only one in 10 (12%) girls with low body esteem.

It’s perhaps not surprising that seven in 10 (68%) of girls overall said they wish the media did a better job of portraying women of diverse physical attractiveness, age, ethnicity, shape and size.

Despite previous research suggesting that image-based social media such as Instagram could be having a negative impact on young people’s mental health, the Dove report suggests girls may be using social media in order to build body confidence.

It found that girls are using social media as a platform to confidently express their individuality, with half (51%) saying they feel more confident interacting with people online.

Commenting on the finding Jess Weiner, professor at the University of Southern California (USC) Annenberg School of Journalism, said in a statement: “Girls worldwide are harnessing the power of social media to democratise the beauty narrative whether we are a part of it or not.

“They are forming their own online communities to talk about the issues that matter most to their physical and emotional health and flooding the space with their diverse stories and images. They are becoming the subject of their own stories and not the object of someone else’s.”

Dove

Dr Phillippa Diedrichs, associate professor at the Centre for Appearance Research at the University of West England, told HuffPost UK that she’s not surprised by the Dove findings.

“The findings in Dove’s paper are supported by academic

research where we see body image concerns impacting all key areas of girls’ lives. This includes their mental and physical health, social lives, and their education and work aspirations,” she said.

“While I’m not surprised, I am motivated to stop this. There are tangible steps we call take to address this issue and it’s not a time for us to be complacent.”

As well as challenging appearance-based bullying, Dr Diedrichs said we should be mindful of the conversations we have around women and girls relating to physical appearance.

“Seemingly benign comments like ‘you look great, have you lost weight?’ or ‘that dress really suits you, it makes you look tiny’ can reinforce the pressure on them to look a certain way,” she explained.

“On a community level, we can ask our local schools what they are doing to promote body confidence and steer them towards evidence-based resources that have measurable impacts after just a few lessons.”

Encouragingly, the report also highlighted some more positive findings.

It found that eight in 10 (82%) girls think they have something about them that is beautiful, and nearly all (80%) feel more confident after taking time to do things that make them feel happy about themselves, their bodies and their health, such as reading or exercising.

Sophie Galvani, global vice president of Dove Masterbrand, said it is “hopeful” to see girls are aware and taking their own steps to create change, “but they can’t do it alone”.

“Our research shows that a girl aged 17 is more likely to experience lower happiness and life satisfaction than a 10-year-old,” she said in a statement.

“This is a crucial moment in a girl’s life where proactive intervention and support is needed, and that is exactly what the Dove Self-Esteem Project is designed to do – its evidence based tools, interventions and workshops are proven to help build positive body confidence in young people, and ultimately help the next generation reach their full potential in life.”

*Name changed to protect anonymity of interviewee.

The study surveyed girls from across the world, including: India, the US, UK, Brazil, China, Japan, Turkey, Canada, Germany, Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Australia and Indonesia.

According to Dove, the countries were selected in order to adequately represent the diversity of girls in terms of culture, beliefs, social pressure and economic development as well as a fair representation of the diversity of culture and tradition around beauty. The sample was intended to be broadly representative of girls population in each country in terms of age, region and social grade.

PA Wire/PA Images Theresa May struggled to complete her conference speech, as it was disrupted by a prankster and she suffered from a cold

It comes amid reports that backbenchers will pressure May to “impose some discipline” and fire Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary for his repeated interventions in which he set out his own vision for Brexit.

The coup attempt follows the disastrous snap general election result and May’s difficult conference speech, which have left her so weak she appears unable to contain Johnson, leading the press to suggest he is “unsackable”.

May was forced to make a statement saying she would not go and that she was providing “calm and stable” leadership.

Davidson added there were “an awful lot of people in our party who need to settle down”.

She praised May’s “grit and determination” and hinted she found the move against her had a hint of sexism.

“One of the irritants over the last couple of days, for me, particularly as a woman, is this idea that all of these men are supposed to be making decisions on Theresa May’s behalf,” she said.

Meanwhile, The Guardian reports the party’s 1922 Committee will insist next week she have a Cabinet reshuffle to show she is still capable of one.

“There’s a general feeling that there’s support for her there but I do think she needs to do a major reshuffle and if she doesn’t act to sack Boris and to bring some new people on board, she has a problem,” one member told the paper.

Several Tory MPs have already openly called for Johnson’s dismissal after he joked Libya could be a tourist destination once the “dead bodies” there were removed.

On Friday, Johnson’s message to a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs leaked. In it, he said the prime minister was “right right right”.

“We have JUST HAD AN ELECTION and people are fed up with all this malarkey,” he wrote.

“Get behind the pm. Ordinary punters I have spoken to thought her speech was good and anyone can have a cold.

“Circle the wagons turn the fire on Corbyn and talk about nothing except our great policies and what we can do for the country.”

Slamming the Narendra Modi government over sliding economic growth and increasing job losses, former Union minister Arun Shourie has likened demonetisation with suicide, saying the latter is too ""a bold step"".

He also called the Narendra Modi government as ""government of two-and-a-half persons"".

""This is a government by 'ilhaam' (revelation). The Prime Minister has the 'ilhaam' one night that demonetisation should be done and he does it. In any case it was a bold step. I have to remind you suicide too is a bold step,"" Shourie said in an interview to NDTV when asked why in his view, the government went in for demonetisation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on November 8 last year.

""Which argument (offered by the government in defence of demonetisation) today survives? Black money? All of it turned white. Terrorism? Terrorists are still coming into India. At the end they have nothing to say,"" he added.

Shourie also took a dig at BJP President Amit Shah who has said that current slowdown is ""due to technical reasons"", terming him ""that famous economist?"" and underscoring that official figures cannot be brushed under the carpet.

He also said those running the government do not seek any advice or hear the facts.

""This is a government of two-and-a-half persons, that is, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and one in-house lawyer. They don't have the expertise and they have surrounded themselves by persons who don't have the expertise.

""They are now in a sealed echo-chamber. They don't hear what is happening. The distress the RBI has documented of small and medium enterprise. These poor fellows had been clamouring and shouting. Nobody heard them,"" he added.

He said that persons like Yashwant Sinha, P Chidambaram and several other economists have been ""talking about facts"".

""And those facts emerge from official reports such as The Economic Survey, the RBI surveys, the SBI's report etc. Is it a fact or not that GDP has collapsed to 3.7 per cent according to the old series? Is it a fact or not that index of industrial production has gone down from about 9 per cent in 2015-16 to about 1.7 per cent in April to July? Is it not a matter of concern?"" Shourie said.

However, he said, despite all the red signals, there was little hope of a course change as ""it all flows from the nature of the government"" and the Modi government has a ""sense of hustings"".

""Their core competence is event management. They are so self-satisfied with it. They are just briefing each other, not listening to others... They are concerned about 300-feet statute, bullet trains etc,"" he said.

On BJP and government functionaries calling former Union minister Yashwant Sinha a ""frustrated"" person after he lashed out at the government, Shourie said it was ""their standard operating procedure"".

""Whenever they are confronted with inconvenient facts, they try to bury it in avalanche of abuse. I have aconstructive suggestion for them. They should publish a list of persons in advance who they think are frustrated,"" he said.

He said that the government's policies must have predictability, stability and credibility -- all of which is totally absent now -- so that investors and industry are sure of what they can expect from the government and not taken by surprise by out of the blue announcements followed by policy flip flops as has happened under the present regime, be it demonetisation or GST implementation.

Last month, the Daily Mail claimed that Kim had pulled out of playing Samantha Jones in a third big-screen adaptation of ‘Sex And The City’, due to producers failing to meet her apparent “diva demands”.

In response, Kim said she’d made no “demands” but had simply decided not to do the film.

‘Sex And The City’ fans have been divided over the news, with some arguing that Kim should give them one last outing as Samantha (particularly after ‘Sex And The City 2’ proved to be such a dud), and others claiming it’s her right to not take part if she doesn’t want to.

But it seems Kim is done with the conversation completely now, publicly urging one fan to “move on” from the topic.

One fan tweeted her saying he was “confused” after reading she said she was “too old” to play Samantha, despite her having spoken out about Hollywood ageism in the past, to which she responded: “I’ve played ‘SAM’ for 20 years. Am moving on & so should you.”

Perhaps sensing the tweet would get media attention (or maybe we shouldn’t be so cynical), she then urged him to watch her more recent series, ‘Sensitive Skin’, on Netflix.

‘Sex And The City’ cast members Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis have both expressed their disappointment that the film was ultimately canned, with SJP saying: “We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.

“It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.”

By way of response, Kim admitted she thinks her former co-star “could have been nicer” about her decision not to return.

A new study carried out by Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Lund University in Sweden, found that divorce runs in the family and could be genetic, the Independent reports, confirming already known research that children whose parents are divorced are more likely to get divorced than the children of parents who didn't split up.

Previously on HuffPost:

Certain studies, in fact, have shown that daughters of divorced parents have a 60 per cent higher divorce rate in marriages than children of non-divorced parents, while sons have a 35 per cent higher rate.

However, whereas previous research chalked up this fact to environmental factors and the normalization of divorce to a child, this new study found that this link doesn't exist for adopted children whose parents divorced, indicating that divorce could in fact be genetic.

Researchers say these findings will have an impact on how marriage counsellors offer advice to couples who are considering divorce.

""We were trying to answer the basic question: Why does divorce run in families?"" asked study author Dr. Jessica Salvatore. ""At present, the bulk of evidence on why divorce runs in families points to the idea that growing up with divorced parents weakens your commitment to and the interpersonal skills needed for marriage.

At present, the bulk of evidence on why divorce runs in families points to the idea that growing up with divorced parents weakens your commitment to and the interpersonal skills needed for marriage.

""So, if a distressed couple shows up in a therapist's office and finds, as part of learning about the partners' family histories, that one partner comes from a divorced family, then the therapist may make boosting commitment or strengthening interpersonal skills a focus of their clinical efforts.""

However, if divorce is actually genetic, this type of counselling may not be useful.

Instead, Salvatore says counsellors should focus on looking at couples' basic personality traits which have been previously linked to divorce, such as high levels of negativity and low levels of constraint.

""Research has linked growing up in a divorced family to the use of more negative or destructive strategies for dealing with conflict, and conflict resolution skills (not surprisingly) are linked to overall marital quality and stability,"" reports Psychology Today.

This all being said, it has been noted in previous studies that growing up with divorced parents is likely to affect your attitude towards marriage.

""That is, you are less likely to consider marriage to be a life-long endeavor, and are more accepting of divorce,"" notes Psychology Today, which adds that those from divorced families are more likely to consider divorce at the first sign of conflict in a new marriage.

But there is a silver lining after the ink on the divorce papers has dried: studies have found that children's well-being can increase when their parents divorce if there had been a lot of conflict in the marriage. The real challenge is for those kids to work on how they deal with conflict, any negativity they may have, and their levels of constraint in the future.","Divorce Could Be Genetic, Claims New Study",http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/05/divorce-genetic_a_23233797/

The unnamed witness from a nearby business tells CTV he heard yelling and when he went outside, he saw a large white cube van driving away with the gas station employee hanging onto the passenger side mirror.

The witness says the van headed north for a distance before swerving, tossing the man from its side before running over him.

RCMP say the man died at the scene. Mounties are still searching for both the van and the driver.

Ironically, it was not the only gas and dash the detachment dealt with on Friday.

They said in a news release they had arrested two people in a gas and dash involving a school bus that had earlier been stolen from the Rimbey area.

They also said the suspects are believed to have stolen a truck from a man who stopped to assist them on the highway, and to have stabbed another civilian whose car they tried to steal.

That driver suffered a cut which was treated on scene.

Previous fatal case in Alberta

In August, a 22-year-old man was sentenced to 11 years in prison for a gas-and-dash that killed Calgary gas-station worker Maryam Rashidi, 35.

She was run over by Joshua Cody Mitchell when she tried to stop him from taking off without paying for $113 worth of fuel.

Rashidi and her husband had come to Canada from Iran in 2014. She had been working at the Centex gas station for just two weeks after being laid off from her engineering job during Calgary's economic downturn.

Mitchell was convicted of manslaughter, hit and run and theft.

Gerne gehört wurde auch „Despacito"" von Luis Fonsi, leider gab es beim Mitsingen Schwierigkeiten, da Fonsi den Hit in Spanisch singt. Immer wieder gefragt war „Atemlos"" von Helene Fischer, ein echter Dauerbrenner, der schon seit einigen Jahren zu den Klassikern gehört. Die stimmungsvolle und auch ausgelassene Atmosphäre in den Zelten gehört definitiv zu den Highlights 2017.

Kurioses aus dem Fundbüro

Das Fundbüro auf der Wies´n ist immer wieder die Sammelstelle für Kuriositäten aller Art, das diesjährige Oktoberfest machte da keine Ausnahme. Neben Schlüsseln, Handtaschen, Dirndlschürzen, Hüten und Geldbörsen wurden auch mehrere Gebisse und sogar Krücken abgegeben, die offenbar niemand mehr vermisst.

Erst am Mittwoch hat Macron mit einer unbedachten Aussage für einen erneuten Skandal gesorgt

Wieder einmal hat Emmanuel Macron seine scharfe Zunge in Schwierigkeiten gebracht.

Am Mittwoch hatte der französische Präsident eine von einer Schließung bedrohte Fabrik in Südwestfrankreich besucht.

Vor den Werkstoren protestierten aktuelle und ehemalige Arbeiter eines Automobilzulieferers. Drinnen erklärte Macron, einige der Demonstranten täten besser daran, sich nach Stellen in einem anderen Unternehmen umzuschauen, “anstatt einen Saustall zu hinterlassen”.

Der 39-Jährige benutzte dabei den Ausdruck ""foutre le bordel"", der als derb und umgangssprachlich gilt. Ein Audiomitschnitt entrüstet die Franzosen nun schon seit Tagen.

Pour Macron ""certains"" GM&S ""feraient mieux"" de chercher des postes ""au lieu de foutre le bordel"" https://t.co/oJO2V1NlDH pic.twitter.com/RJz9GYYbHS — franceinfo (@franceinfo) 4. Oktober 2017

Der Zeitpunkt der sprachlichen Eskapade ist denkbar ungünstig: Denn die Reformen der Macron-Regierung nehmen gerade Fahrt auf - und die Zustimmungswerte des Präsidenten bessern sich.

Exklusive Zahlen der französischen Ausgabe der HuffPost zeigen jedoch: Zugleich nimmt die Ablehnung gegen Macron zu. Der Präsident, der angetreten ist um Europa zu einen, ist dabei, sein eigenes Land zu spalten.

Auf dem Weg der Besserung?

In einer Umfrage des Meinungsforschungsinstituts YouGov im Auftrag der HuffPost und der französischen Nachrichtenseite ""CNews"" gaben 32 Prozent der Befragten an, mit der Arbeit von Macron zufrieden zu sein. Das sind zwei Prozentpunkte mehr im Vergleich zum Vormonat (grüne Linie in der Grafik oben).

Deutlich wird auch: Macron war seit Beginn seiner Amtszeit im Mai in den Umfragen regelrecht abgestürzt. Kein Präsident seit Jacques Chirac 1995 verlor so rapide an Beliebtheit wie der junge Shootingstar.

Nun also bessern sich die Werte langsam - zumindest auf den ersten Blick. Denn zugleich sind auch mehr und mehr Menschen mit dem Präsidenten unzufrieden. 56 Prozent lehnen die Arbeit des Präsidenten ab, zwei Prozentpunkte mehr als im September (rote Linie in der Graphik oben).

Macron ist dabei, die französische Gesellschaft in Befürworter und Gegner seiner Politik zu spalten.

Macron will Europa und Frankreich vereinen

Vergangene Woche hatte der französische Präsident seine Vision für Europa vorgestellt. In einer visionären Rede versuchte Macron, eine Neugründung der EU zu skizzieren. Er möchte die Union stärken und die europäischen Nationen zusammenführen.

Auch für Frankreich wollte Macron ein Kandidat der Einheit sein. Immer wieder beteuerte der 39-Jährige, linke und rechte Wähler gleichermaßen abholen zu wollen.

Fünf Monate nach seinem überraschenden Sieg bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen muss sich Macron allerdings eingestehen: Die Strategie funktioniert nicht - zumindest in Frankreich.

Anstatt die Gräben zu überbrücken, ist Frankreich weiter ein politisch gespaltenes Land. Bei seinen eigenen Anhängern konnte Macron in der YouGov-Umfrage zwar ganze 15 Prozentpunkte zulegen, Federn ließ er aber bei allen anderen politischen Lagern.

Lediglich 20 Prozent der linken Wähler sind mit ihm zufrieden. Das sind drei Prozentpunkte weniger als im Vormonat. Bei den Wählern der konservativen Republikaner verlor Macron sogar 5 Prozentpunkte, hier sind nur noch 21 Prozent mit ihm zufrieden.

Die Fehltritte

Gründe für Macrons Unbeliebtheit bei linken wie konservativen Wählern gibt es viele:

► Seine liberalen Arbeitsmarktreformen stoßen auf Widerstand im linken Lager. Über hunderttausend Menschen gingen dagegen auf die Straße, angestachelt von der Hardliner-Gewerkschaft CGT und dem ultralinken Politiker Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

► Weitere Reformen der Sozialabgaben und der Rente werden für manche Menschen in Frankreich Einbußen bedeuten.

► Konservative Politiker stehen Macrons Europa-Kurs kritisch gegenüber. Der Republikaner Laurent Wauquiez legte der deutschen Kanzlerin Angela Merkel gar kritische Worte über Macrons Europa-Rede in den Mund, um den Präsidenten zu kritisieren.

► Schon mehrfach hat Macron mit Aussagen über seine Reformen für Empörung gesorgt. In Bukarest hatte der Präsident im August gesagt, die Franzosen würden Reformen hassen. Die Gewerkschaften protestierten.

Bei einem Besuch in Athen hatte Macron beteuert, er werde sich den ""Zynikern"" und ""Faulenzern"" nicht beugen und seine Vorhaben umsetzen. Wieder war der Aufschrei in Frankreich groß, die Gegner des Präsidenten bezogen die Aussagen auf sich.

Und nun Macrons desaströser Auftritt am Mittwoch. Auch Politiker der konservativen Republikaner kritisierten die Aussagen des Präsidenten. Macron lasse keine Gelegenheit aus, seine Verachtung gegenüber den Franzosen auszurücken, schrieb die Sprecherin der Konservativen, Valérie Boyer auf Twitter.

Macron mag angetreten sein, das im Wahlkampf so erhitzte Frankreich zu versöhnen. Gelungen ist ihm das bisher nicht.

""Emmanuel Macron wird immer Emmanuel Macron bleiben"", kommentierte die französische Tageszeitung ""Le Monde"" vor kurzem den Politikstil des Präsidenten: ""Grenzüberschreitend auf die Gefahr hin, spaltend zu sein, offensiv auf die Gefahr hin, anzuecken.""

She added: “Some states are modernising their nuclear arsenals, and there is a real danger that more countries will try to procure nuclear weapons, as exemplified by North Korea. Nuclear weapons pose a constant threat to humanity and all life on earth.”

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.

ICAN is a coalition of non-governmental organisations from 108 countries around the globe, promoting adherence to and implementation of the United Nations nuclear weapon ban treaty. It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007.

ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn said she was “delighted” to have been awarded the prize.

A statement from ICAN added: “This prize is a tribute to the tireless efforts of many millions of campaigners and concerned citizens worldwide who, ever since the dawn of the atomic age, have loudly protested nuclear weapons, insisting that they can serve no legitimate purpose and must be forever banished from the face of our earth.”

In July, 122 nations adopted a UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, but nuclear-armed states including the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France stayed out of the talks.

The Nobel prize seeks to bolster the case of disarmament amid nuclear tensions between the United States and North Korea and uncertainty over the fate of a 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran’s nuclear program.

US President Donald Trump has called the Iran agreement the “worst deal ever negotiated” and a senior administration official said on Thursday that Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the landmark pact.

The prize, worth $1.10m, will be presented on 10 December.

Wayne LaPierre, the NRA’s CEO and executive vice president, issued a joint statement Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action, the lobbying arm of the NRA.

“In the aftermath of the evil and senseless attack in Las Vegas, the American people are looking for answers as to how future tragedies can be prevented,” LaPierre and Cox said in the statement. “Unfortunately, the first response from some politicians has been to call for more gun control.”

While the NRA executives pushed back against “banning guns on the criminal act of a madman,” they said that “devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations” ― a surprising concession from a group that has been hell-bent on torpedoing almost any type of gun control measure.

Fully automatic weapons are strictly regulated under federal law, but bump stocks offer gun owners a relatively easy ― and cheap ― way to get around such restrictions.

Police discovered a cache of weapons, including 12 firearms outfitted with bump stocks, when they stormed the two hotels rooms in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino where 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired hundreds of rounds into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers on Sunday. Hundreds of people were injured and at least 59 were killed, including Paddock, who died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The gun range at the NRA’s headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, doesn’t allow the use of bump stocks, an NRA employee confirmed to HuffPost on Thursday. The NRA did not immediately offer a response to HuffPost’s question about why or when this rule was implemented.

Bump stock sales have surged in the wake of Sunday’s mass shooting ― the deadliest in modern U.S. history ― as gun enthusiasts worry lawmakers will move to ban the device.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), an avid proponent of tighter gun control legislation, introduced a bill Thursday that would ban the use and possession of bump stocks.

“The only reason to modify a gun is to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible,” Feinstein told reporters.

While the bill currently is without Republican support, some GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have said they would be willing to consider such legislation.

But the NRA, which claims to have 5 million members, has repeatedly helped sink numerous efforts by Congress over the years to pass gun control legislation.

The gun rights group noted in its statement Thursday that “the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.”

“The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,” the statement read.

Les circonstances et motifs des coups de feu restent obscures.

Au même moment, un homme avait été roué de coups par plusieurs personnes avant d'être secouru par des policiers. Il s'était présenté comme le père du tireur présumé venu chercher son fils qui lui avait indiqué ""être en danger"", selon le procureur.

Il y a près d'un an, deux policiers pris d'assaut

La Grande Borne -11.000 habitants sur les 28.000 que compte Grigny- est considérée comme l'une des cités les plus difficiles d'Île-de-France.

En lisière de la cité, le 8 octobre 2016, deux véhicules de police avaient été pris d'assaut par un groupe d'individus cagoulés et munis de 13 cocktails Molotov. Deux policiers avaient été gravement brûlés et deux autres plus légèrement.

Après cette attaque, qui avait eu un immense retentissement et déclenché une fronde inédite dans la police, le gouvernement avait renforcé les effectifs policiers en Essonne.

Mais ça ne mène à rien!"".

C'est un rapport de la CIA.

Une douzaine d'autres notes témoignent, au lendemain des accords d'Evian qui ont mis fin à la guerre d'Algérie et à la veille du référendum par lequel 62% des Français vont se prononcer pour l'élection du président au suffrage universel direct, de la véritable obsession anti-de Gaulle des services américains. Comme si rien n'avait changé depuis que, dix-huit ans plus tôt, Franklin D. Roosevelt voulait tenir l'irascible général français à l'écart du projet de débarquement allié et imposer à la France une administration et une monnaie américaines.

Une douzaine d'autres notes témoignent de la véritable obsession anti-de Gaulle des services américains.

Au printemps 1961, pourtant, de Gaulle a reçu à Paris John Fitzgerald Kennedy et Jackie. Un fastueux dîner aux chandelles a été donné en leur honneur dans la Galerie des Glaces à Versailles. Devant toute la cour, le Général a mené à table ""la gracieuse Madame Kennedy"". Le jeune et le vieux chef d'Etat ont sympathisé. Au cours de longs entretiens à l'Elysée, de Gaulle, qui va s'avérer un allié solide lors de la crise de Cuba, a presque réussi à convaincre son homologue américain qu'entre l'Union soviétique et les Etats-Unis, un troisième pôle était nécessaire pour l'équilibre de la planète –oui, une troisième force nucléaire, que la France pourrait maîtriser plus rapidement si l'Amérique consentait à un transfert de technologies.

Mais en coulisses, le Secrétaire d'Etat Dean Rusk et la CIA manoeuvrent contre un tel scénario. ""Quant à l'énorme investissement financier déjà réalisé (par la France) en faveur de la force de frappe, insiste un rapport de la CIA qui envisage froidement la disparition du Général, il devrait être rapidement revu à la baisse, voire abandonné avant l'achèvement du programme..."" Kennedy assassiné, la ""guerre de trente ans"" comme l'appelle Eric Branca, qui la raconte dans un livre passionnant, ""L'ami américain"", va reprendre plus sournoisement et férocement que jamais entre la France de De Gaulle et l'Amérique de Lyndon Johnson.

Historien et journaliste, Branca a déjà consacré plusieurs ouvrages à succès à l'histoire du gaullisme et des services secrets français. En s'appuyant sur des archives américaines récemment déclassifiées mais aussi sur de nombreux témoignages inexploités jusqu'alors, il nous livre un récit passionnant. Où l'on voit le Département d'Etat et la CIA tout tenter –du financement du FLN algérien puis de celui de l'OAS et des généraux qui tentèrent d'assassiner de Gaulle, jusqu'à l'appui en sous-main de mouvements anarchistes de mai 1968- pour abattre la résistance française. Où l'on voit aussi, au fil de révélations stupéfiantes, une bonne partie de la classe politique française –d'Antoine Pinay à Dany Cohn-Bendit en passant par Guy Mollet, François Mitterrand et Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, se laisser prendre aux arguments américains selon lesquels il n'est de sécurité possible pour la France qu'au sein d'une Europe comprenant la Grande Bretagne... unifiée sous la tutelle de l'Amérique.

Où l'on voit le Département d'Etat et la CIA tout tenter -du financement du FLN algérien puis de celui de l'OAS et des généraux qui tentèrent d'assassiner de Gaulle, jusqu'à l'appui en sous-main de mouvements anarchistes de mai 1968- pour abattre la résistance française.

Du même coup, tout un pan de l'histoire de la Vème République s'éclaire. On comprend mieux pourquoi, dans les années 1966-1967, de Gaulle, qui a voulu se représenter à la présidentielle à 75 ans en 1965 pour réaliser son grand dessein et doter la France de sa force de dissuasion, effectue une sorte de tour du monde afin d' appeler les peuples ""non alignés"" à prendre leur indépendance: discours de Phnom Penh proclamant, en pleine guerre américaine au Vietnam, ""le droit des peuples d'Indochine à disposer d'eux-mêmes"", provoquant ""Vive le Québec libre!"" lancé du balcon de l'Hôtel de Ville de Montréal. A l'exception de quelques proches comme Michel Debré et André Malraux, d'ailleurs, la majorité des politiques et des observateurs raisonnables, sans aller jusqu'à épouser la colère des médias d'outre-Atlantique, verront là le signe d'une obstination puérile du Général ""C'est un enfant, soupirera le Premier ministre Georges Pompidou, qui joue avec des allumettes...""

Il s'est trouvé pourtant un président américain pour le comprendre et même pour adhérer à sa vision du monde: Richard Nixon. Simple candidat de passage à Paris, celui-ci a été reçu par de Gaulle. A-t-il médité sa phrase ""le meilleur allié des Etats-Unis, ce n'est pas celui qui s'aplatit devant eux, c'est celui qui sait leur dire non""? A-t-il retenu aussi le conseil gaullien de renouer avec la Chine? En tout cas, la présidence Nixon va marquer un tournant, que son principal conseiller, Henry Kissinger, souligne ainsi: ""Lorsque de Gaulle rejeta la Grande-Bretagne du Marché commun en 1963, les attaques dont il fut l'objet à Washington prirent une forme carrément personnelle. Quand il se retira du commandement intégré de l'Otan, en 1966, ces attaques prirent un caractère vindicatif. Au cours de ces années 1960, notre politique européenne consista, en grande partie, à s'efforcer en vain d'isoler la France"". Désormais s'ouvre une nouvelle ère.

Élu président et reçu à Paris en 1969 en ami, Nixon salue en de Gaulle ""un géant de l'Histoire"". Cela lui vaut, à Washington, une pluie de critiques. ""Le général de Gaulle croit que l'Europe devrait avoir sa propre position indépendante, rétorque-t-il. Et, franchement, je le crois aussi. Je pense que le temps est passé où cela servait nos intérêts que les Etats-Unis soient le partenaire dominant dans une alliance"". En mars 1969, à l'issue des obsèques d'Eisenhower, Nixon confirme même à de Gaulle que, si la France souhaite conclure des accords de coopération nucléaire avec les Etats-Unis, il ne pose plus comme préalable qu'elle regagne les structures intégrées de l'Otan!

They learn what makes you tick and they learn your fears.”Courtesy of Emmy Myers Emmy Myers said the men who bought sex were mostly successful business men.","To many, Emmy Myers appeared to be a model student during high school. She was involved in gymnastics, track and the agricultural club.

But her life took a dark turn into drugs and, eventually, sex trafficking.

Today, the 28-year-old Wisconsin native wants people to know that sex trafficking can happen to anyone ― and that the people buying women and girls can come from every income level and from every community.

The issue isn’t just “something from a Hollywood movie,” Myers told HuffPost.

Courtesy of Emmy Myers When Emmy Myers was 24 and broke, she moved in with her drug dealer who said he would ""take care of her."" He provided her with shelter and food and proceeded to sell her for sex. When she protested, he threatened to kill her.

Through her nonprofit, Lacey’s Hope Project, Myers speaks openly about her experiences. The organization’s name is a nod to Myers’s previous stage moniker when she used to dance for money.

Human trafficking is on the rise in the U.S. In 2016, the number of cases jumped 35.6 percent from the year prior, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. These are cases that involve victims who are forced to engage in physical labor or sexual exploitation against their will. These crimes are climbing for a number of reasons, according to Jarrett Luckett, executive director of Exploit No More, a group that supports sex trafficking survivors.

Luckett frequently collaborates with Myers on events that raise awareness about trafficking in the city.

High poverty levels and the country’s growing drug epidemic are two factors that make victims more susceptible to being trafficked, he told HuffPost.

These issues have helped make the city where Myers grew up, Milwaukee, a hub for human trafficking.

Milwaukee is particularly desirable for traffickers because they can transport their victims to a handful of major nearby cities, including Chicago and Madison. Heroin use in Milwaukee combined with its high unemployment rate, helps traffickers to lure in their victims.

Courtesy of Emmy Myers During the year and a half that Myers was trafficked, she was arrested a number of times. However, she isn't a felon, which is fortunate. Many trafficking survivors are arrested for prostitution and other serious charges and can't get their records expunged.

Sex trafficking has become so widespread in Milwaukee that the city has been dubbed the “Harvard of pimp school.”

Myers’s story demonstrates how traffickers can succeed in grooming even victims who have strong family ties and ambitions.

Myers was the kind of active, involved kid most parents would brag about.

But she was also sexually abused by a family friend from around the time she was 3 years old until she was 6 years old. She spent most of her childhood blaming herself for the repeated assaults, she said. That eventually led her to find comfort in drugs and fall into the hands of a manipulative trafficker, she said.

Myers said she first tried drugs in high school and started stripping during her senior year to help fund her habit. After high school, she first experimented with heroin and went to rehab twice before she turned 20. She danced on and off to pay for drugs.

When she was 24 and trying to get clean, she moved in with someone who was abusive. Her drug dealer, who was aware of the toxic situation, offered to take Myers in “under his wing” and take care of her. He provided her with housing, clothes and food. But he also advertised Myers for sex on Backpage.com, a classified ad site that offers up a host of services and products. The site was forced to shut down its adult ads section this year after a Senate report accused Backpage.com of facilitating prostitution and trafficking.

“Never did he disclose to me that I was going to be selling myself. Once I was there, I didn’t have anywhere to go,” Myers said. ”[Pimps] are good at what they do. They pretend they love you. They learn what makes you tick and they learn your fears.”

Courtesy of Emmy Myers Emmy Myers said the men who bought sex were mostly successful business men. “This is what surprises America,” Myers said. “It’s not these big, fat smelly gross guys. It’s often very prominent men in the community.”

When Myers objected to being sold for sex, she said her drug dealer threatened to kill her nephews if she didn’t comply. He confiscated her identification and the little money she had.

Myers’s pimp, together with his girlfriend, drove from city to city and trafficked Myers out of various hotels. She’d meet men as early as 6:30 a.m. before they headed to business meetings and had sex with other clients well into the night. Myers’s pimp kept her high pretty much all of the time and used drugs as a way to keep her from protesting the arrangement. Myers was “lucky” in a sense. None of the men she slept with were violent with her. Most of them were respected, successful career-driven men. Most of them had families at home.

“This is what surprises America,” Myers said. “It’s not these big, fat smelly gross guys. It’s often very prominent men in the community.”

HuffPost is hitting the road this fall to interview people about their hopes, dreams, fears ― and what it means to be American today.

A few months later, Myers was arrested in Milwaukee for charges unrelated to sex trafficking or prostitution. There were warrants out for her arrest and the police got the FBI involved. They offered to help her change her life and recover.

Myers went to jail in 2013 for about a month and then to rehab for the third time. When she got out, she returned to the trafficking life for a short period. Half a year later, she went back to jail for about seven months, but was allowed work release while serving time. When she completed her term, Myers moved into an emergency shelter for survivors of domestic abuse for two months. With the help of a transitional living program, she was able to secure her own apartment.

Myers has been sober for three years now. She has a police record, but hasn’t been classified as a felon, which makes her lucky. Many trafficking survivors in the U.S. have prostitution charges on their record – for crimes they were forced to commit – and can’t get their records expunged. That, in turn, precludes them from getting jobs and housing.

Myers currently works as a caregiver for elderly residents of an assisted living facility. She’s also the executive director of her nonprofit, which aims to prevent instances of trafficking through its awareness and educational events. Myers shares her story at schools, churches and other community gatherings. She educates medical professionals, students, parents, law enforcement, first responders, and others about the realities of trafficking, and what to look out for to stop these crimes from happening.

For example, she’ll tell doctors to keep an eye out for bruising in odd places, multiple miscarriages, patients who don’t know how many sexual partners they’ve had and those who can’t give an exact address for where they live.

This type of advocacy work is crucial to curbing trafficking cases, Luckett said.",This Sex Trafficking Survivor Protects Girls From 'Hell' She Endured,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-trafficking-survivor-protects-girls-from-hell-she-endured_us_59b961f8e4b0edff97188d83?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

With 58 fatalities, it earned the unenviable title of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

She had heard about a mass shooting in Texas committed by an estranged husband and wanted to contact the mother of the woman who was killed.","LINCOLN COUNTY, Miss. ― As he was waiting to be taken to jail, a local reporter asked Willie Cory Godbolt why he did it. Why did he kill all those people?

“Because I love my wife and I love my children,” he replied matter-of-factly.

Of course, it wasn’t about love at all. Cory had just been arrested for committing a massacre. He was accused of slaughtering eight people: his wife’s mother, her older sister and her aunt, her cousin and her cousin’s husband, her pastor’s grandson and another young boy, as well as the officer who responded to the 911 call.

It was early morning on May 28 and Cory sat on the street in handcuffs outside his cousin-in-law’s house in Brookhaven, Mississippi, a small town nicknamed “A Home Seekers Paradise.” Police stood guard with guns drawn.

All night long they’d been on a manhunt for Cory after responding to reports that he had opened fire on his wife’s family in the neighboring hamlet of Bogue Chitto. Eight people were dead by the time he was arrested, a little before 7 a.m.

But why did Cory say it was love that led him to kill so many? Only one person understood.

“He didn’t want nobody else around us,” Cory’s wife, Sheena Godbolt, said sitting on her sister’s couch one scorching hot afternoon in July, almost two months after the shooting.

“He wanted me there with him, with no friends or family members, nothing,” she said. She shifted in her seat, drew a deep breath, shook her head. “That’s not love.”

There have been eight mass shootings in the United States this year. That night in Mississippi was the fifth. Everytown for Gun Safety defines a mass shooting as a single incident in which four or more people are fatally shot, not including the perpetrator. The most recent mass shooting occurred earlier this month in Las Vegas, when a gunman opened fire on concertgoers at a country music festival. With 58 fatalities, it earned the unenviable title of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

But what happened in Las Vegas is nothing like what most mass shootings look like in America. Most resemble what police say took place in Mississippi. This year, in five of the eight mass shootings, the perpetrators killed their girlfriends, wives, children and extended family members.

This year’s pattern is not unusual. Between 2009 and 2016, the perpetrator shot a current or former intimate partner or family member in 54 percent of mass shootings. Everytown also found that in nearly half of these cases, the perpetrator exhibited warning signs before the killing, such as recent acts of violence, threats or violation of a protective order.

Mass shootings are rare, of course, and make up only a fraction of overall gun violence in America. But when they do occur, the primary victims are usually not strangers like the victims in Las Vegas; they are those closest to the perpetrator.

Melissa Jeltsen/HuffPost Sheena Godbolt, 33, sits on her sister's porch in Bogue Chitto.

Cory was Sheena’s first and only boyfriend. They started dating when they were teenagers. In the beginning, he was adoring and generous. “He bought me my first cell phone,” Sheena recalled. “If I needed clothes, he took me to Walmart.”

But over the years things began to change. They got married and had two children. He started to become more possessive. She had to ask his permission to go anywhere, she said. He was jealous of her friendships and her relationships with her family. As she describes it, her life shrank to fit the four walls of their mobile home.

Neighbors said they could hear Cory screaming at her sometimes. He’d yell at her to change her clothes if he could see the outline of her body. He’d snatch her phone out of her hand to check her texts, she said. And when he got really angry, he’d punch things: the walls of their trailer, and sometimes, she said, her too. She wore long sleeves to cover the marks he left behind – even through Mississippi summers. She learned to anticipate when he was likely to get violent. If she saw the telltale signs ― a narrowing of his eyes, a particular tone in his voice ― she’d take off in her car.

Over the course of their 17 years together, Sheena left Cory a half dozen times. (It’s a typical pattern. On average, it takes victims of domestic violence seven attempts before leaving for good.) She would hop in the car and drive; it didn’t matter where. Once she wound up in Louisiana, three hours away, before she calmed down. It was safest to stay in hotels or pass the time at a rest stop. If she and the kids bunked with friends or family, Cory might turn against them, she said.

The man held grudges. Sheena’s relatives didn’t like how Cory treated her, and he got in altercations with several of them through the years. Sheena usually sided with him out of loyalty. When her family tried to intervene, it just made everything harder.

Sheena’s family pressed charges against him on a few occasions. In 2015, Cory confronted Myrtis May, one of Sheena’s aunts, and “made threats to kill her,” according to a court document. He was convicted of simple assault, attempting by physical menace to create fear, and fined $467.75.

Sheena rarely involved the police herself; she said Cory told her they couldn’t protect her. But in 2016, Cory reached a new level of violence, she said. That year, she obtained a temporary protection-from-abuse order. She told police that Cory had punched her in the stomach and strangled her ― all because she would not give him the security code to her cell phone. “She states he also put his hand down her mouth where she couldn’t scream for help,” a court document states.

“He tortured me that day,” Sheena said.

He was charged with domestic violence, aggravated assault, but the charges were later dropped. Sheena forgave him for that incident, too.

“He was my husband and I loved him,” she said. “I wanted our marriage to work.”

Afterward, the violence got worse, she said, and eventually she came to the realization that she had to abandon the marriage to save herself.

A few weeks before the May 2017 rampage, she left again, this time for the last time. She sought refuge with her mother, Barbara Mitchell, who was recovering from open heart surgery. For three weeks, she stayed at her mother’s home without incident.

And then they decided to throw a party.

Alissa Scheller/HuffPost

The Massacre

It was Memorial Day weekend in Bogue Chitto where Sheena was raised, around 60 miles south of Jackson, Mississippi. That Saturday, her mom held a barbecue in the yard. Friends and family came over, bringing food to grill. By 11:30 p.m., the festivities were winding down, and only around 10 people remained. Sheena’s mother, Barbara Mitchell, was resting in the living room. Her sister, Toccara May, was chatting out in the yard with her aunt, Brenda May. Vincent Mitchell, Sheena’s stepfather, was in the kitchen with his brother, who was visiting.

Sheena was putting her kids to bed in the guest room when Cory arrived at the door.

She recalled how he strode into the living room and demanded Sheena give him their kids. This was a classic tactic of his, she said. Whenever she’d leave him, he’d take the kids from her; if she wanted to see them, she had to come home. It used to work. But Sheena wasn’t going back again; she wanted a divorce. So that night, when Cory showed up, she called the police. She knew her husband. She knew he wouldn’t leave without a fight.

Around nine minutes after her call to 911, Deputy Sheriff William Durr of the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office pulled up and asked Cory to leave. Then, without warning, her husband pulled out a gun and shot Durr, Sheena said. Everyone scattered into various rooms, seeking cover. Sheena bolted toward her kids in the guest room, ripping them out of bed and pushing them out the window.

“As we were jumping the fence and running through the woods, I was hearing gunshots, gunshots, gunshots,” Sheena recalled. “That was my last time seeing my family.”

Later, authorities would confirm that Barbara Mitchell, Brenda May and Toccara May had been killed along with Deputy Durr. And that was just the beginning.

After Sheena and the children emerged from the woods and were huddling in the street in shock, neighbors, friends and relatives rushed to their side. Sheena had cut her wrist when she jumped out the window and was bleeding badly. For hours, they stood together, praying and crying. The house had been cordoned off by the police. They didn’t yet know who had been slain, and they didn’t know where Cory had gone.

Among those gathered to support Sheena was Tiffany Blackwell, a family friend whose father was the pastor of New Zion Union M.B. Church, which Sheena and Cory attended. Tiffany and her husband, Shon Blackwell, drove over as soon as they heard the news, leaving their children at home in Brookhaven overnight.

While many details are still unclear, it appears Cory drove to the Blackwells’ home next. No one else knows why he went there, but when he arrived, he shot at the locked door until he was able to kick it in, according to Caleb Edwards, 15, one of Tiffany’s nephews. Once inside, he shot Tiffany’s son Jordan, 18, who in a heroic gesture used his body to shield Caleb and Caleb’s 11-year-old brother, Austin. Caleb survived with a cut to his eye, but both Jordan and Austin were killed.

Cory was not finished. According to witnesses, he took another teen, a friend of the boys who was there that night, at gunpoint and forced him to drive them around for hours. About 6 a.m., Cory let the teen go at a gas station near his third and final stop: the home of Sheena’s cousins Sheila and Ferral Burage.

Sheila, her husband and her sister Shonda May had been in Bogue Chitto all night with Sheena. Along with many other friends and family members, they had gone to offer their support. At dawn they went home, but soon after they heard a knock at the door. It was Cory. Ferral was armed and ready because he knew Cory was still on the run. He fired at Cory, Shonda said, but Cory shot back and killed Ferral. The sisters ran. Shonda hid in a closet while Sheila sought cover in the bathroom. While Shonda was not discovered, Sheila was, and Cory fatally shot her too, police say.

Cory was apprehended minutes later down the street from the Burages’ home by members of multiple law enforcement agencies. He sat in the street, bleeding from the arm where Ferral had shot him and muttering about his family. He was later charged with one count of capital murder and seven counts of first-degree murder.

“They would not let me live and let live!” he yelled, according to video taken by Clarion-Ledger reporter Therese Apel at the scene. “I just wanted to love my family. I just wanted to love my wife.”

The high death toll made national headlines briefly and then faded out of the news cycle. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) called it a “senseless tragedy” and asked his constituents to pray for those who had died. Maybe because of the people who were targeted ― the family of the killer’s wife ― the shooting was, somehow, relegated to the realm of the domestic.

A Community Mourns

In Bogue Chitto, where Sheena and Cory lived, the community felt rattled to its core. They had all either grown up together or went to the same school or church. Losing eight people at once ― from children to a police officer ― left a gaping wound. On Highway 51, across from a gas station and tanning salon popular with locals, someone erected a memorial: eight blazing white crosses in a row.

When HuffPost visited in July, Cory was due in court for a preliminary hearing. At Lincoln County Circuit Court in Brookhaven, more than five dozen relatives of the slain filed into the courtroom and waited in tense silence.

Over the previous two months, they had buried the dead, mourned, held community prayer meetings and tried to make sense of what had happened. Now, for many of them, it was the first chance to lay eyes on the man charged with killing their loved ones.

Cory entered the room in shackles, wearing a yellow shirt and khaki pants. He scanned the room as though looking for someone. Shonda May shook uncontrollably. Tressie Durr, the widow of the slain deputy sheriff, silently wiped away tears. Vincent Mitchell stared at Cory with fury.

The hearing was brief. An officer from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation recited the bare details of the shootings: the locations, the names of the deceased, the evidence indicating Cory to be the sole perpetrator. Boxes of tissues were passed down the aisles.

Afterward, many relatives gathered at the Burages’ house in Brookhaven to eat ribs and fried catfish and to reminisce about those who had lived there before it became a crime scene. The house was the final stop on the killing spree. Months after the shooting, there was no trace of the tragedy.

Shonda stood outside on the lawn. She didn’t want to go inside. She was there when Cory burst in. She had hidden in a closet as her sister Sheila and brother-in-law Ferral were killed. Seeing Cory in the courtroom had shaken her badly.

“I felt very nervous to where I felt like my heart jump out of my chest,” she told HuffPost, as she stood in the shade of the front yard staring back at the house.

Inside, Shon Blackwell sat looking through photos of his late son on his phone. Jordan, who was killed that night in the Blackwells’ home, was a rising football star at Brookhaven High School, and had recently received scholarship offers from a number of universities. He had dreamed of playing professional football or, if that didn’t pan out, going into coaching, his father said.

Shon, an assistant pastor at New Zion Union M.B. Church, said he was leaning heavily on scripture in the aftermath of the shooting and finding solace in the church. Every day was getting a little bit easier, but not better.

“It has caused us to depend more on God and less on ourselves,” he said.

Before the hearing that day, Shon posted a Facebook Live video online from his car. He said he arrived at the courthouse early so that he would have time to pray before seeing Cory face to face.

“People ask me how I feel. I don’t know,” he said in the video. “I don’t even know how I’m supposed to feel. If anyone else knows how I am supposed to feel, ask them to please share with me.”

Officer Down

Behind the courthouse, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office was selling car decals emblazoned with William Durr’s name and patrol number and the words ”A hero remembered lives forever.”

Durr, who had responded to Sheena’s call for help, was the first officer killed on duty in the history of the department, Sheriff Steve Rushing told HuffPost. Law enforcement from as far away as New York and Chicago attended his funeral, along with the governor of Mississippi.

“Honestly, it shook us,” Rushing said. “You know in this line of work that it can happen, but you don’t really realize until it does happen how it affects you.”

Everyone at the sheriff’s office was deeply distressed by Durr’s death, he said. In the months since the shooting, his officers had stepped up to support Durr’s wife and 10-year-old son, Nash.

In August, they would even chaperone Noah to his first day of sixth grade.

“We miss William everyday, but especially on days like today,” Tressie Durr wrote on Facebook that day. “I am so thankful for our blue family.”

The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office is a lean operation, with 21 deputies responsible for patrolling 500 square miles. Three deputies are on each night, and they travel in separate cars to cover more ground. Most calls involve accidents or general complaints, but there’s also a fair amount of domestic violence. The majority of the domestic violence calls are fairly straightforward, Rushing said. But even so, it’s standard procedure to send two officers to the scene, as domestic violence is known to be the most dangerous type of call for police.

The night of the massacre, two deputies were dispatched to the house of Barbara and Vincent Mitchell. Durr arrived first. A second officer pulled up about five minutes later, he said, but by that time Durr had been shot.

The department was familiar with Cory; deputies had responded to calls from Sheena before. Over the years, he was arrested a dozen times and accused of simple assault, disturbing the peace, domestic violence and robbery. Still, Rushing said, he didn’t expect Cory to do this.

“A lot of us knew him,” the sheriff said. “I personally had met him in the community several times. Some of my officers went to church with him.”

Left Behind

Everyone in Bogue Chitto dealt with the tragedy in their own way.

Some turned to the church for support. The police community took care of its own. But Sheena ― who had lost her mother, her sister, her aunt and, in a sense, her husband ― no longer felt like she belonged anywhere.

First of all, she was homeless. Two weeks after the shooting, her mobile home burned down. An investigation found it to be “undetermined in cause,” but Sheena suspected arson. In a way, she understood. She was learning by that point what grief and rage did to a person. How it roiled inside of you, ugly and unknowable, and could spark fleeting thoughts of retaliation. Sheena preferred denial. Sometimes, for a moment, she allowed herself to imagine her family intact, her mother on the way home from the store.

Visiting her mother’s grave made it real again. Seven of the victims are buried in the same place, and it is a stark vision: a gathering of fresh graves covered in bright flowers inside an old cemetery.

When HuffPost met with Sheena, she had just driven back from Jackson, where she had requested copies of her children’s birth certificates. They’d been lost in the fire, along with all her belongings ― clothes, furniture and family photos. She was slowly working to replace those things. She had taken a leave of absence from her job at a local Walmart distribution center and was seeing a therapist. Some days, she said, she struggled to get out of bed.

“It feels like a ton of bricks on top of me,” she said, sitting at her sister’s house. “It won’t let me up and live again.”

The what ifs race through her mind all the time. What if she hadn’t left? What if she’d gone to a hotel? What if she’d said yes when Cory asked for the kids? What if she’d never met him?

“It’s been hard ever since that day, because I feel like it’s my fault,” she said. She knows, rationally, that she’s not to blame. But she still can’t stop feeling that way. And it doesn’t help that others seem to think so too.

No one comes out and blames her directly, but she feels it, she said. People hold her accountable. Some of her friends don’t call anymore. She can only guess why. She wonders if it’s simply because they don’t know what to say.

On a recent weekend, Sheena spoke to HuffPost by phone. She had heard about a mass shooting in Texas committed by an estranged husband and wanted to contact the mother of the woman who was killed. No one else really understood what she was going through, and she hoped the woman’s family might.

Since HuffPost visited Sheena in July, she has moved to a different town and enrolled her son and daughter in a new school. The children, now in the third and fifth grades, are settling in. The move is good for the children, she said. It gives them anonymity. Other kids don’t know them as the children of a mass murderer, she said.

She has also found a different church. She’s back at work after almost four months off. She is an adult alone for the first time in her life. In a way, Cory has gotten exactly what he wanted. She’s isolated from nearly everyone she knows and loves.

“What Cory did, that was on Cory,” she said. “He left me and those babies here to suffer from his actions.”

Sheena misses her own mother like a physical ache, she said. She used to call her daily on her lunch break. Now, she tries to take her break at a different time and make jokes with co-workers to occupy her mind.

“I just try to stay focused,” she said. “Once I lose that focus, it seems like my whole world just turns upside down.”

Even after all the deaths her family has experienced, there is one more that she and her children may have to live through. It’s possible Cory will be executed for his crimes.

Every day, she said, is a struggle ― to go to work, to come home, to do the chores and tasks that keep the life of a family moving forward.

“I give up over 30 times a day, and this is the truth,” Sheena said. “But once my kids walk in the house, that’s my motivation. I have to be here, I have to go on. It’s only me here to love and protect them.”",Portrait Of An American Mass Shooting,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shooting-domestic-violence-willie-cory-godbolt_us_5989f222e4b0449ed505d656?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Co-written and directed by the National Award-winning filmmaker Kranti Kanade, CRD presents the story of a young playwright who rebels against his fascist mentor in a bid to win a prestigious theatre competition. Kanade draws his inspiration from the renowned Purushottam Karandak Inter-collegiate Theatre competition in Pune that over the last several decades has given us playwrights like Satish Alekar and Vijay Tendulkar.

Walking a tightrope between melodrama and heightened realism, CRD endeavors to develop a unique language

The competition is seen as a launch pad for not just young writers but also actors and music composers. Kanade, who directed the legendary American actor Harvey Keitel in his previous directorial outing Gandhi of the Month, is known to make socially relevant films featuring strong protagonists committed to fight against autocracy and injustice instead of meekly accepting the status quo. In CRD, he explores fascism and cut-throat competition in the field of art while commenting on the general state of affairs of the world we inhabit.

Walking a tightrope between melodrama and heightened realism, CRD endeavors to develop a unique language that comes across as a cross between cinema and theatre. This hybrid language ensures that those who love cinema don't find it too theatrical and that the theatre lovers don't feel alienated as well. In the recent times we have been witnessing some interesting experiments on the web with CinePlay commission the retelling of old classics like Badal Sarkar's Pagla Ghoda and Mohan Rakesh's Aadhe Adhure but as far as Hindi cinema is concerned CRD certainly comes across as a breath of fresh air. In fact, such bold experiments in terms of narrative have been unheard of in Hindi cinema since the master Indian filmmaker Mani Kaul made films like Ashadh Ka Ek Din and Satah Se Uthata Admi.

CRD opened to unanimous critical acclaim in the United States, receiving rave reviews from Los Angeles Times, Hollywood Reporter, LA Weekly, among others. Egged on by the positive response that the movie has received all around, Kranti Kanade has made an announcement that all those who are left disappointed by the film will be refunded their ticket price as well as the fuel cost. In the words of Kanade himself: ""It's often that viewers are disappointed with a film and that discourages them from visiting cinemas again soon, resulting in overall decline. In every other aspect of life, we have the right to return and reclaim our fund. Why not apply that logic here as well? It's a baby step, but a revolutionary one, and we hope it will soon be the future norm.""

Overall, CRD comes across as a bold albeit clever potpourri of ideas that unfolds like a delectable orgy of excesses. With influences ranging from István Szabó's Mephisto to Taviani Brothers' Caesar Must Die, the film pays countless tributes to several stalwarts of cinema including the likes of Bergman, Godard, Kurosawa, Ghatak, and Antonioni, among others. An interesting way to look at the films would be as a treatise on narcissism, fear, obsession, insecurity and hubris. CRD serves a testament to the duplicitous nature of art.

As Pablo Picasso had so eloquently stated, ""Art is a lie that tells the truth."" In defense, Orson Welles had said in F for Fake, ""I must believe that art itself is real."" Interestingly, Welles' early fame was based on a lie. While on a painting trip through Ireland, he visited the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed that he was a Broadway star. The convenient lie got him his first break. And the rest is history. While the characters in CRD toy around with lies most of the times, they ultimately succeed in discovering their innermost truths, which is probably what Picasso was once trying to suggest.

However, CRD lacks consistency and suffers from some structural and narrative flaws but that's quite acceptable of a film that constantly dares to experiment with form.

L'attentat avait été planifié par deux hommes de 19 ans, un Canadien nommé Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, et un Américain résidant au Pakistan, Talha Haroon. Il devait se dérouler ""durant le ramadan"", entre début juin et début juillet 2016, selon un communiqué du procureur de Manhattan.

Mais un agent de la police fédérale (FBI), se présentant comme un adepte de l'Etat islamique, s'est immiscé dans leurs échanges via smartphones et a suivi leurs préparatifs: de l'achat d'explosifs de type TATP -favori des jihadistes- au Canada par El Bahnasawy jusqu'à son arrivée aux Etats-Unis en mai 2016, en passant par l'identification de lignes de métro à cibler, selon ce communiqué.

Dans ses échanges avec l'agent du FBI, le Canadien aurait affirmé vouloir ""tuer beaucoup de monde"" et attaquer aussi des concerts: ""On entre avec nos armes à la main, c'est comme ça que les types de Paris ont fait"", aurait-il dit, en allusion aux attentats de Paris de novembre 2015, selon le procureur.

Talha Haroon aurait prévu d'arriver aux Etats-Unis au dernier moment pour aider à perpétrer les attentats. Dans ses échanges avec l'agent, il aurait qualifié le métro de ""cible parfaite"" et aurait affirmé vouloir ""tuer le plus de passagers possibles"", comme lors des attentats de Bruxelles du 22 mars 2016.

El Bahnasawy a été arrêté par le FBI le 21 mai 2016 à Cranford dans le New Jersey, à 30 km au sud-ouest de New York.

Il a plaidé coupable en octobre de cette année-là de sept chefs d'accusation, dont trois -conspirations pour utiliser des armes de destruction massive, commettre un acte de terrorisme dépassant les frontières nationales et poser une bombe dans un lieu public et des transports publics- pourraient lui valoir la prison à perpétuité. Il devrait connaître sa sentence le 12 décembre.

""Encercler Times Square"" et tuer ""des milliers de personnes""

Haroon, inculpé de cinq chefs d'accusation, a été arrêté au Pakistan en septembre 2016. Les Etats-Unis espèrent son extradition prochaine. Il risque aussi la perpétuité.

Dans ses échanges avec l'agent, il aurait qualifié le métro de ""cible parfaite"" et vouloir ""tuer le plus de passagers possibles"". Il aurait aussi évoqué la possibilité d'""encercler Times Square"" et de tuer ""des milliers de personnes"".

Un troisième homme, Russell Salic, Philippin de 37 ans, a été arrêté aux Philippines en avril et attend aussi son extradition. Il aurait aidé à financer les attentats, en envoyant un peu plus de 400 dollars, via l'agent du FBI, censés aider à financer l'achat de munitions et d'explosifs.

Depuis les attentats du 11 septembre 2001, et avec la multiplication des attentats en Europe ces dernières années, New York vit dans la crainte d'une nouvelle attaque terroriste, et des endroits très touristiques comme Times Square sont particulièrement surveillés.

Le dernier attentat dans la capitale financière américaine remonte au 17 septembre 2016, lorsqu'une bombe placée dans une poubelle a explosé un samedi soir dans le quartier très animé de Chelsea, ne faisant heureusement que des blessés légers.

L'unique suspect, Ahmad Rahimi, un Américain d'origine afghane, est accusé d'avoir placé un deuxième engin quelques rues plus loin, qui a été repéré avant d'exploser, et un troisième dans le New Jersey, qui visait le passage d'une course à pied mais n'a pas fait de victime.

Rahimi avait été arrêté deux jours plus tard après une fusillade, en possession d'un carnet citant Oussama Ben Laden et un idéologue de l'Etat islamique. Son procès s'est ouvert lundi à Manhattan.

In an interview with the The Indian Express, Balwan Singh Ghosh, a 45-year-old farmer from Madhya Pradesh, has recounted his ordeal at the Tikamgarh Dehat Thana, where he was allegedly and stripped and beaten on Tuesday.

Ghosh told the newspaper that he joined the Congress Party-backed protest in order to highlight problems like lack of electricity and water for irrigation that were taking a toll on his annual crop yield.

""After the failure of my crops, I thought I would get some relief. But instead, I was beaten by policemen. Then, at the station, I told them, 'Please don't make me strip, my underwear has a hole'. They said, 'Go naked','' Ghosh told the newspaper.

In a horrific incident in Madhya Pradesh, dozens of farmers who joined the protest on Tuesday were stripped and beaten at the local police station. The alleged incident occurred four months after five farmers were killed in police firing during an agitation in the Mandsaur district of MP.

The Bharatiya Janata Party government in MP had initially denied that farmers were beaten up police personnel, earlier this week. But after photos of farmers sitting in their underwear at the police station first appeared in the media and then on social media, the government was forced to set up an inquiry.

""The Director General of Police has been asked to institute an inquiry and submit a report within three days,"" State Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said on Thursday. ""It is a matter of investigation if the farmers took off their clothes themselves or police did so,"" he said.

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has today issued notice to the MP government, demanding a report from the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police (DGP) in four weeks.

Meanwhile, BJP leaders have countered that the entire episode has been orchestrated by the Congress Party to show the BJP in a bad light.

Speaking to The Indian Express, five farmers who participated in the protest said they were not concerned with political activism but rather their dwindling produce.

Amol Singh Ghosh, a marginal farmer who feeds a joint family of eleven, said, ""What proof do they need? Don't our injuries speak of our suffering? Do we look like farmers or Congress activists?""

Jean Drèze is a familiar name for social science students and researchers. His contributions unarguably have helped improve the state of social programmes in India and have motivated several students to take up social research. In 2013, he co-authored a book with Amartya Sen on the importance of public programmes in achieving social development.

Sense and Solidarity: Jholawala Economics for Everyone (2017, Permanent Black) is his second solo-authored book after No.1 Clapham Road:The Diary of a Squat (1990, Peaceprint, published under a pseudonym) on homelessness in London. It is divided into 10 sections: drought and hunger; poverty; school meals; healthcare; child development; employment guarantee; food security; corporate power; war and peace; and a set of miscellaneous essays.

This book is a collection of his previously published essays, mostly in The Hindu, with a fresh general introduction, and a section-wise commentary, which sets the context. This review engages only with this fresh material.

Create a good society

Drèze's vision, like most of the current and future readers of the book, is to ""create a good society"". As he writes, this warrants the abolition of caste and patriarchy. Such a vision requires a progress in ""ethics and social norms"". He titles his approach ""research for action"". This reminds me of Karl Marx, who wrote in the Theses on Feuerbach that: ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.""

Many public policy measures try to create policies with 'appropriate incentives' as if they are god.

It is indeed commendable that Drèze, along with Reetika Khera and others, have been able to conduct field surveys with student volunteers. Moreover, he has participated in several village meetings, public hearings, and social audits.

Drèze's underscoring of ""ethics and social norms"" is extremely important today. Many public policy measures try to create policies with 'appropriate incentives' as if they are god. What we truly lack, to use Adam Smith's phrase, is good ""moral sentiments""—sympathy, compassion, friendship, and care. These cannot and shouldn't be quantified or reduced to monetary terms. Nor can they be incentivised. It is here that 'experience' plays a significant role. Looking at theory and quantitative secondary data is insufficient to capture most of social reality. It is precisely this reason that has led to the critique on men writing about patriarchy and Brahmins writing about Dalits. Not only is the lived experience missing in these instances but also can it never be obtained.

Study literature to understand society better

Drèze rightly criticises the quantitative fetish found in the community of economists and development studies researchers. And, as if they weren't enough, the public policy specialists have joined this quantitative bandwagon, or rather the bullet train, as it were. This is not to suggest that we abandon quantitative analysis altogether but rather to use it with great care.

I completely endorse Drèze's recommendation to study literature as a way to understand a society better. He lists the following authors in his book as people who ought to be studied: Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Daya Pawar, Laxman Gaikwad, Om Prakash Valmiki, and Shantabai Kamble. In fact, I strongly think that the economics students would benefit with a compulsory course on 'Literature for Economists' alongside 'Mathematics for Economists' in the curriculum.

Engage with publicly available data

There is not much that Drèze writes on economic theory, except his approval of game theory, which is not really a theory but a mathematical 'method' of studying conflict and cooperation. I will go further and argue that there is much to be learnt from the theories of economists such as Smith, Marx, Keynes, Kalecki, and Sraffa. A deep understanding of methods, in all its plurality—complexity theory, experiments, field work, game theory, instrumental variables estimation, lived experience, ratio and proportion, regression analysis, and textual analysis—is much needed along with a similar understanding of various theories.

Another important learning from Drèze's book is the need to engage with publicly available data, reports, and legislation. For instance, some of the legislation/programmes mentioned in this book are the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), National Food Security Act (NFSA), and Right to Information Act (RTI). As voters, we too should be reasonably aware of their key provisions.

Research for action

Many students pursue social sciences with the intention of making a change in the society. Currently, there is a palpable sense of disappointment and disillusionment among these students. Perhaps, Drèze's approach of ""research for action"" is one solution. At the very least, such research should be recognised and encouraged by academics and the society at large (particularly, parents). Of course, not everyone might have the means or the luck to pursue this course of action. However, this shouldn't deter anyone from pursuing good research, which can be in the realms of theory, history, methods, action, or some combination of the four.

To me, the central takeaways from Drèze's book are that as members, and analysts, of Indian society, we must be sensible in our approach to theory and methods by bringing in pluralism in these two areas. More importantly, solidarity warrants collective discussion, engagement, and action, which also aids in the progress of our ""ethics and social norms"".

However, I felt that the book is expensive at Rs. 795 (hardback), one hopes for a paperback edition priced at Rs. 250 to be available soon. Although all but one are previously published essays, Drèze's introductory chapter and section-wise commentary provide readers with a peek into his valuable philosophy. I hope the book is translated into the many regional languages of India.

Is divorce contagious? It is, if you believe my mother's sister, her daughter, their daughter's sister-in-law, their sister-in-law's cousin, their aunty from the village and her grandmother's uncle. That's not the only thing they have an opinion on, of course. In India, you are constantly evaluated by the ""marriage you make"" and the most stringent evaluators and string-pullers are your ""beloved"" relatives.

They are the ones who arrange matches between prospective brides and grooms, they play a key role in deciding the customs and rituals to be followed in the wedding, they are part of the negotiating team that works out the gifts and money to be exchanged. So it's not surprising that they easily slip into the same role in a divorce. In fact, since they have been an integral part of the marriage they feel entitled to assume a magnified role even in the divorce. It is quite common to see the relatives accompany the litigants for legal consultations and even to the family court. While they are ostensibly present to provide emotional and moral support, the reality is a bit more complicated—often, they also call the shots in how a divorce plays out.

Since they have been an integral part of the marriage they feel entitled to assume a magnified role even in the divorce.

It's not uncommon to see relatives air their views about the way the case is progressing, what the spouse ought to offer as a settlement figure as alimony, what should be the role of the warring husband and wife as parents. It's not as simple as them merely airing their views—they pull the strings as well and their influence is palpable, even if not in a formal capacity, in the divorce proceedings in court.

Relatives may ""make a marriage"" but they are also key players in a divorce. For someone who hasn't grown up in India, it is difficult to fathom how a relative can actually break up a marriage, but almost every Indian knows that behind the ""happy aunty/uncle"" façade lurks a plotting politician whose underhand tactics would put Machiavelli to shame. These supposedly harmless relatives are often instrumental in engineering or contributing to the breakup of a marriage, adding fuel to the fire even in the divorce.

As they did in mine.

Why do we let them do it? In my case, I didn't grasp the hidden meaning behind their well-intentioned advice, which actually comprised veiled barbs at my husband (now my ex) and his family. I'm wiser now and stay away from their advice, comments, recommendations, opinions and ""guidance"" on how to live my life. Our social fabric may bind us and our blood may relate us but nothing compels me anymore to let relatives be the guiding light in my life. The ethos of the country is such that we may never be able to tell our relatives to completely back off from our lives because ""hey, we are still in India"" where our social ties are sacrosanct. Whether we like it or not, relatives will continue to be a part of our lives –in marriage and divorce, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.

Den See und was die Gefahr für Mensch und Umwelt verursacht, seht ihr im Video oben

Lake Erie ist einer der viertgrößten Seen Nordamerikas. Normalerweise zeichnet er sich durch sein blaues Wasser aus. Doch seit mehreren Jahren verfärbt sich der See grün.

Was sich faszinierend anhört, ist in Wahrheit das Anzeichen einer Naturkatastrophe dar. Die ist sowohl für Menschen als auch die Umwelt gefährlich. Anfang Oktober veröffentlichte die NASA neue Bilder des Sees, die das Ausmaß der Katastrophe zeigen.

Laut einer Pressemitteilung des National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sind “Microcystis Cyanobakterien” der Grund für die Verfärbung.

3 Millionen Menschen beziehen Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee

“Die Microcystis Cyanobakterien erstrecken sich über das westliche Becken und breiten sich entlang der Küsten von Michigan und Ohio, von Maumee Bay bis hin zur Küste von Ontario, aus”, heißt es in der Pressemitteilung.

Der See sei so stark mit giftigen Algen verschmutzt, dass die Ohio Environmental Protection Agency davor warne, das Leitungswasser in der Region zu trinken und in die Nähe des Lake Erie zu gehen. Laut der “New York Times” beziehen fast drei Millionen Menschen ihr Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee.

Die globale Klimaerwärmung verstärkt das Gift der Algen

Das Problem sei seit 2000 bekannt, dennoch sei bisher nicht viel dagegen unternommen worden. Wissenschaftler gehen davon aus, dass das Gift der Algen durch die globale Klimaerwärmung stärker werden wird.

Die Bürgermeisterin von Toledo, einer Stadt an der Küste des Sees, schrieb vor wenigen Tagen einen Brief an US-Präsident Donald Trump. Paula Hicks-Hudson macht darin auf die Gefahr, die von dem See ausgeht, aufmerksam.

But in the wake of the Parson's Green bomb and the arrest of teenage suspects in the days following, we need to wake up to the reality of extremism.

At its core radicalisation of children is yet another form of online grooming; exploiting a child for a particular use or purpose.

So the same way parents warn their children about sexual predators online, they have a responsibility to make sure their children are aware extremists may be using the web as a tool to push their ideologies.

Our recent Cybersafe study found that in the past three years there was a 28% rise* in the amount of parents concerned about radicalisation, which reiterates that it is something we need to openly address.

Adolescence is a time where young people are particularly vulnerable as they are at their most impulsive which can leave them open to being influenced by peers, older people and the web. Not to mention, they are keen to discover their own identity and their curiosity can lead them to explore new ideas and issues online.

So where do they find radical content?

Children may choose to actively seek out the content or they could be persuaded by others. Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Ask FM have been used by extremists looking to target youngsters. Like grooming, the person may not say who they really are and their true identity may be concealed as they encourage them to embrace extreme views and beliefs.

If you have concerns about radicalisation there are number of signs you can look out for. Be mindful that a lot of the signs can be fairly common among teenagers so you should look out for increased instances of any of the below.

A conviction that their religion, culture or beliefs are under threat and treated unjustly

A tendency to look for conspiracy theories and distrust of mainstream media

The need for identity and belonging

Being secretive about who they've been talking to online and what sites they visit

Switching screens when you come near the phone, tablet or computer

Possessing items - electronic devices or phones - you haven't given them

Becoming emotionally volatile.

Script-talking - Expressing views that you feel don't sound very them and sound as though they are someone else talking.

If you have spotted any of the above signs - Here's some handy tips on tackling the subject with your child:

Be Approachable:

Let them know you're there to help them if they get into trouble online - and if they're concerned about something they can come to you.

Be calm and don't get angry

Your child is far more likely to be open and honest with you if you remain calm about the situation.

Talk to them about their online friendships.

Find out what sites they go to, where they met their online friends, how they communicate. Talk to them about being cautious about what they share with people online. Remind them that even though people they've met online might feel like friends they may not be who they say they are, and that they may have ulterior motives for befriending them

Don't be confrontational

Your child's beliefs are a sensitive subject and need handling carefully as you don't want to push them away or shut them out.

Be safe in real life

Teach your child to never arrange to meet someone they only know online without a parent present.

Encourage them to share their ideas and opinions

Many young people are often not aware of the realities and consequences of the radical ideas they have formed or the arguments against them.

Where to go if you think your child is being radicalised?

Visit www.gov.uk/report-terrorism to report illegal or harmful information, pictures or videos you've found on the internet. You can make your report anonymously.

Further information can be found at Educate Against Hate here.

You can report any concerns about online grooming to the National Crime Agency's CEOP Command

If you feel your child or another child may be in immediate danger, a threat to others - contact the police.

A champion athlete, who is both white and not American, has the chance, at some personal cost, to protest racial injustice in the United States. Should he avoid taking a stand or lend support to a protest that doesn't directly affect him?

The question is currently being asked of Sidney Crosby. His statement that it is ""a great honour"" for his Stanley Cup winning team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, to visit Donald Trump's White House comes amid a boycott of the White House by the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, and Trump's racist criticisms of NFL players' taking a knee to protest police brutality against black Americans.

The two athletes' starkly different responses to similar situations of racial tension highlight the extent to which Crosby, the Penguins and the NHL — in the face of profound injustice — have failed to rise to the occasion.

(Incidentally, Norman was also responsible for suggesting that Smith and Carlos share a single pair of gloves after Carlos forgot his, back at the Olympic Village.)

Norman, like Crosby, was in a privileged position to do something. Or he could have used his non-Americanness, or his whiteness, as an excuse to stay out of a domestic U.S. racial struggle. Instead, Norman played a crucial supporting role in what has become a legendary stand for human rights.

When Smith and Carlos told Norman what they were going to do, they asked him if he believed in human rights. Norman, driven by his strong Salvation Army faith, said he did. His ultimate response, which should be taught in schools worldwide, was the opposite of Crosby's: ""I will stand with you.""

The price of taking a stand

Norman did so despite the palpable threat of assassination in the violent summer of 1968. He faced the threat of repercussions from a controversy-averse International Olympic Committee and a home country still operating under an overtly racist White Australia immigration policy.

He did so because he believed deeply in human equality. As Carlos remarks in the excellent Norman-focused documentary, Salute: ""Peter didn't have to take that button. Peter wasn't from the United States. Peter was not a Black man. Peter didn't have to feel what I felt. But he was a man."" That was enough.

Norman, like Smith and Carlos, paid an enormous price for his stand. For wearing that patch, Australia blacklisted him from the 1972 Olympics despite being the fifth-fastest sprinter in the world at the time (he continues to hold the Australian 200 metre record). He was not even invited to take part in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, attending instead as the guest of an appreciative U.S. Track and Field Federation.

Long after the U.S. recognized Carlos and Smith as heroes (as their spiritual successor, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick will be, in time), Norman remained a pariah: the Australian government only apologized for Australia's treatment of him in 2012, six years after his death.

For him, doing the right thing took precedence over doing the easy thing.

No regrets

Despite the hardship, Norman did not regret his actions. For him, doing the right thing took precedence over doing the easy thing.

Crosby's and the Penguins' actions fall short of Norman's example. What's more, in trying not to choose sides — between African-Americans who fear for their lives around police and a president who finds it hard to condemn neo-Nazis — they've implicitly revealed what they're prepared to tolerate. As Lt.-Gen. David Morrison, the former Australian Chief of Army, noted in a similar context, ""The standard you walk past, is the standard you accept.""

And yet, while it is profoundly disappointing that Crosby, the Penguins and the NHL have missed their Peter Norman moment, Norman himself probably would not have judged them too harshly. As he remarked in Salute: ""In a victory ceremony for the Olympics, there's three guys that stand up there. Each one's been given about a square metre of God's earth to stand on. And what any one of the three choose to do with his little square metre of earth at that stage is entirely up to them.""

Athletes Tommie Smith, (left) and John Carlos carry Peter Norman's casket from the Williamstown Town Hall on Oct. 9, 2006.

Ultimately, what Crosby and his fellow Penguins choose to do with their square metre is a matter for their own consciences. For others, graced with the opportunity to stand with the victims of injustice, Peter Norman offers a shining example of what moral courage looks like.

Ein guter Notendurchschnitt auf dem Weg zum Arzt reicht leider nicht aus, es muss schon ein sehr guter Schnitt sein. Aber damit könnte es bald vorbei sein, denn der Numerus clausus, kurz NC, kommt auf den Prüfstand. Nach einem Bericht der „BZ"", befasst sich das Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe ab dem 4. Oktober mit dem NC.

Nicht mit dem Grundgesetz zu vereinbaren

Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte das Verwaltungsgericht in Gelsenkirchen. Die dortigen Richter bezweifeln, dass sich der NC mit dem Grundgesetz vereinbaren lässt. Wer heute Medizin studieren möchte, der muss unter Umständen sehr lange auf einen Studienplatz warten. Für die Vergabe der begehrten Plätze gibt es ein sogenanntes Quotensystem. Rund ein Fünftel der Studienplätze geht an diejenigen, die die besten Noten im Abitur haben. Dann folgt ein weiteres Fünftel, das auf die Warteliste kommt und für die übrigen Plätze hat jede Universität ein eigenes Auswahlverfahren. Wer Pech hat, der muss bis zu 15 Semester auf einen Studienplatz warten.

Hart umkämpft

Besonders der Bereich Humanmedizin ist sehr hart umkämpft. Alleine für das Wintersemester 2017/2018 gibt es mehr als 43.000 Anwärter, aber nur 9000 Studienplätze. Die Entscheidung der Richter in Gelsenkirchen wird mit der Tatsache begründet, dass die Noten im Abitur bundesweit nicht miteinander vergleichbar sind. Daher sollte es eine Landesquote geben. Die Noten spielen nach Ansicht der Richter zudem eine viel zu große Rolle. Bereits in den 1970er Jahren hat sich das Bundesverfassungsgericht schon einmal mit dem NC beschäftigt. Damals entwickelte das Gericht bestimmte Kriterien für die Vergabe der Studienplätze. Jetzt stellt sich die Frage, ob es in der Rechtsprechung eine Weiterentwicklung geben muss.

Ärzte dringend gesucht

Rar sind in Deutschland vor allem Ärzte, die auf dem Land arbeiten möchten. In den weniger dicht besiedelten Regionen arbeiten Landärzte nicht selten weiter über das Rentenalter hinaus, weil sie keinen Nachfolger finden. Die Abschaffung des Numerus clausus könnte ein erster Schritt sein, um die Situation zu entspannen. Befürworter sehen zudem die Chance, dass auch denjenigen der Weg zu einem Medizinstudium geebnet wird, die keine vermögenden Eltern haben. Viele, die aus einem vermögenden Elternhaus kommen, wollen nicht auf den Studienplatz in Deutschland warten. Sie gehen nach Osteuropa, denn dort gibt es keine Wartezeiten an den Universitäten, allerdings kostet das Studium dort mehr als 10.000 Euro pro Jahr.

Chapter 2: Fear And Judgement What I have to regularly remind myself is that people will judge you whether you worry about their opinions or not, so you may as well do what you want to do. Plus, when you think about it, worrying about the opinion of others is actually incredibly self-indulgent because it's based on the assumption that you are important enough to others that they even care about what you're up to.

Yes, I Take Full Responsibility For This Disease I Can't Control... It has crossed my mind many times that it would be much easier to just not tell people I have epilepsy.

La plainte survient au lendemain de la publication du reportage-choc du New York Times révélant qu'il a conclu au moins huit ententes pour étouffer des plaintes d'agression sexuelle.

L'incident a eu lieu il y a dix ans, selon Lauren Sivan, qui était alors présentatrice télé sur la chaîne câblée Long Island 12 à New York. Elle a avoué que l'expérience l'a choquée, et que si elle l'a racontée à ses amis, elle est restée silencieuse parce qu'elle était dans une relation à long terme et qu'elle avait peur du pouvoir que Weinstein avait dans les médias.

Sivan a raconté l'incident à HuffPost lors une entrevue enregistrée.

La soirée de l'incident a commencé quand Sivan rencontrait Weinstein et d'autres à Cipriani, un restaurant italien renommé à Manhattan. Plus tard, elle est montée en voiture avec lui et d'autres pour se rendre à Socialista, un club et restaurant à thématique cubaine dans lequel Weinstein et Giuseppe Cipriani, qui était alors à la tête de l'empire de restaurants Cipriani, étaient investisseurs. Sivan a noté que la voiture de Weinstein était remplie de caisses de Coke Diète, ce qu'elle a trouvé étrange. Dans un portrait de Weinstein publié en 2001 dans le New York Magazine, le journaliste David Carr a noté qu'alors qu'il était assis à une table, Weinstein avait «trois Coke Diète en attente devant lui.»

Le HuffPost a aussi parlé avec une amie de Sivan qui était avec elle cette soirée-là. Elle s'est confiée sous le couvert de l'anonymat parce qu'elle n'est pas autorisée par son employeur à parler à la presse.

Sivan s'est rappelée qu'au club, Weinstein lui a demandé qu'elle se joigne à lui pour une tournée de son restaurant, Cafe Socialista. Sivan raconte qu'elle a convenu à contrecœur de l'accompagner au restaurant. Avant que Sivan ne parte, son amie lui a dit que si elle n'était pas revenue dans 10 minutes, elle irait vérifier ce qu'il se passe.

Une fois que Sivan et Weinstein étaient en bas, ils ont parlé et il lui a montré le café. Il l'a ensuite emmenée à la cuisine (le restaurant était fermé à ce moment-là), où plusieurs employés nettoyaient. Le silence dans la cuisine a frappé Sivan, qui a trouvé ça étrange. Ceci dit, un article publié en 2008 laisse savoir que le Cafe Socialista était fermé par manque d'achalandage (alors que le club restait ouvert), ce qui explique peut-être pourquoi la cuisine n'était pas peuplée.

Weinstein a ensuite renvoyé les deux employés de la cuisine. Selon plusieurs femmes qui ont parlé avec le HuffPost sous le couvert de l'anonymat, elles ont eu des expériences similaires avec Weinstein. En effet, il commençait des rencontres ou des interactions avec d'autres personnes dans la salle, et ensuite les congédiait pour être seul avec les femmes.

Une fois les employés partis, Sivan a avoué que Weinstein s'est avancé et a essayé de l'embrasser. Sivan a rejeté cette tentative, lui disant qu'elle avait un copain depuis quelque temps. Weinstein a ensuite menacé Sivan: «Bon, peux-tu rester debout là et te taire?»

À ce moment-là, Weinstein et Sivan étaient dans un vestibule entre la cuisine et les toilettes. Pour partir, Sivan devait aller au-delà de lui et traverser la cuisine. Elle explique qu'elle était prise parce que le corps de Weinstein la bloquait et qu'elle était intimidée.

Weinstein a ensuite exposé ses parties génitales à Sivan et a commencé à se masturber. Elle dit qu'elle était vraiment choquée par le comportement de Weinstein, qu'elle se sentait bloquée et qu'elle ne savait pas quoi dire ou quoi faire. L'incident du vestibule n'a pas duré longtemps. Sivan dit que Weinstein a éjaculé rapidement dans la plante verte qui était dans le vestibule, qu'il a ensuite fermé la fermeture éclair de ses pantalons et qu'ils sont retournés dans la cuisine.

À ce moment, l'amie de Sivan s'est inquiétée parce que ça faisait longtemps que cette dernière était partie.

Son amie descendait vers la cuisine lorsqu'elle s'est fait arrêter par un gardien de sécurité qui lui a dit qu'elle n'avait pas le droit de passer. Elle a expliqué la situation et a demandé «Êtes-vous en train de me dire que si elle a des ennuis, vous ne me laisserez pas passer?» Le gardien a donc convenu de la laisser passer.

Une fois en bas, elle a rencontré Sivan et Weinstein qui sortaient de la cuisine.

Sivan et son amie sont parties après l'événement, et les deux se rappellent que Sivan a raconté ce qu'il s'est passé dès qu'elles sont sorties.

Sivan a raconté que Weinstein a appelé à son bureau le lendemain alors qu'elle travaillait. Weinstein lui aurait témoigné qu'il a «eu un bon moment hier soir.» Weinstein a mentionné qu'il s'en allait à l'étranger et lui a demandé si elle voulait qu'ils se rencontrent à son retour. Sivan lui a rappelé qu'elle était dans une relation et elle a rapidement terminé l'appel. Elle n'a pas discuté avec Weinstein depuis l'incident en 2007.

La Weinstein Company a annoncé vendredi que Weinstein partait en congé pour une durée indéterminée le temps de l'enquête sur les plaintes de harcèlement sexuel menée par un cabinet juridique indépendant.

Almost a century ago, Mohandas K. Gandhi – commonly known by the honorific Mahatma, the great-souled one – emphasized nonviolent resistance in his campaign for Indian independence.

Today, as my research shows, Gandhi has become an iconic figure for people seeking social change, including communities across the United States.

Explaining nonviolence

For Gandhi, nonviolence was not simply the absence of physical violence. Self-rule and radical democracy in which everyone participates in the governance process were also part of Gandhi's idea of nonviolence.

He believed that self-rule should extend to all people, rich and poor, male and female, and at all levels of society. To him, authority over others was a form of violence. To achieve that vision, he encouraged participation of women and the lower castes in economic and political matters.

These ideas about violence and authority had circulated in the U.S. in the 19th century, especially among the Christian peace churches such as the Quakers and Mennonites. In this view, equality and the lack of hierarchical structures are forms of nonviolence.

For Gandhi, it was the Indian religions, Hinduism and Jainism, that shaped his activism. His mother, a devout Hindu, taught him the importance of fasting as a form of self-discipline and religious devotion. From the Jains, with whom he grew up, he learned nonviolence and nonpossessiveness. In particular, he drew on the Hindu text ""Bhagavad Gita"" (The Song of the Lord) for a religious framework on the values of simplicity, duty and nonviolence.

All this translated into Gandhi's peaceful expression of protest of which the most potent ""weapon"" was fasting.

Nonviolent resistance

The Salt March of 1930 is one of Gandhi's best-known acts of peaceful resistance.

Under colonial rule, the British taxed Indians for salt and declared that making or collecting salt was illegal. Since salt is necessary for survival, this issue affected each and every Indian. They considered this law unjust and morally wrong.

Gandhi organized a 241-mile march across western India to the city of Dandi in Gujarat, in western India, where he collected salt, illegally. He started with 78 people. But as the marchers proceeded, thousands more joined. Weeks later, his unarmed followers marched to a government salt depot, where they met violent retaliation.

In the words of American journalist Webb Miller,

""At a word of command, scores of native police rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads...Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins.

For Gandhi, resistance meant placing one's own body in harm's way, open to the possibility of injury, imprisonment or even death. And that is what made it such such a powerful political tool.

AP Photo/Horace Cort

Years later, Martin Luther King Jr., who met with Gandhi, would employ similar ways of nonviolent resistance.

Indeed, it was the visceral horror of what happened in the two countries that rapidly swung public opinion.

During the Indian independence movement, descriptions of British clubs striking unarmed Indians in the Salt March drew worldwide sympathy. Back in the U.S., Americans watched with horror as Birmingham police set dogs upon African-Americans during a peaceful civil rights protest in 1963. This pushed President Kennedy to take action and eventually led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

What can we learn from Gandhi

In my research, I found many communities in the U.S. replicating Gandhi's model: Possibility Alliance in La Plata, Missouri, and Cherith Brook Catholic Worker House in Kansas City, Missouri, are among those who have used nonviolent protests to raise their voice against racial and economic injustices.

But, for others, as we have seen in recent months, keeping protests peaceful can be difficult. There were reports, for example, of violence during protests on college campuses and rallies against or in support of President Trump. The Black Lives Matter movement has been accused of rioting, for example, in Baton Rouge where members blocked intersections.

At times, oppressive regimes might themselves retaliate violently, blaming the protesters for their retaliation. King too was criticized for inciting violence. Only later was he labeled ""passive and nonconfrontational.""

For contemporary protesters, Gandhi and King's political strategies could provide some valuable lessons. The peaceful resistance that the two pursued was more effective in exposing hard truths about injustices. And it is worth remembering what King wrote, in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, that he ""earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.""

Ce dispositif, inutilisé en France depuis de nombreuses années, avait notamment été balayé par l'utilisation du TATP par les organisations terroristes. Mais les bonbonnes de gaz ont fait leur retour en septembre 2016 lors de la découverte de plusieurs d'entre elles dans une voiture à Paris, non loin de la cathédrale Notre-Dame. Depuis, leur utilisation (sans succès) s'est multipliée: le 30 septembre dernier, un attentat a été déjoué dans le XVIe arrondissement de la capitale, après la découverte de bonbonnes de gaz dans un immeuble.

Comment expliquer ce retour en grâce? Cette méthode peu sophistiquée et utilisée il y a plusieurs décennies en France, est-elle synonyme d'un renouveau dans la menace terroriste ou témoigne-t-elle, au contraire, d'un affaiblissement des organisations djihadistes telles que l'Etat islamique?

Un dispositif qui date du... XIXe siècle



Il est relativement simple de se procurer cet outil du quotidien disponible dans toutes les stations-service sans se faire repérer. Contacté par Le HuffPost, Samuel Rémy, secrétaire général du syndicat national des personnels de la police scientifique (SNPPS) affilié à l'UNSA, détaille: ""La bonbonne de gaz permet de donner un outil à quelqu'un qui se radicalise dans son coin, en allant regarder des vidéos sur internet tout seul, et qui n'a pas de commando, ni de structure logistique ou d'artificier qui pourra l'aider"".

D'autre part, les guides d'explications disponibles sur internet, et destinés aux candidats terroristes, font état de fabrication d'explosifs avec des produits chimiques. ""Or, ces derniers sont davantage surveillés aujourd'hui"", indique Samuel Rémy. Les terroristes se rabattent donc sur ces bonbonnes de gaz.

Alain Bauer, professeur de criminologie au CNAM et auteur de livre ""Vivre au temps du terrorisme"", explique au HuffPost: ""En matière terroriste, on invente peu de choses: la bonbonne de gaz est un processus ancien, inventé au XIXe siècle, qui fait partie de l'attirail traditionnel. Il s'agit d'un objet comme un autre, qui a une longue histoire d'utilisation dans l'histoire des attentats"".

En effet, ce dispositif, était utilisé lors de la vague d'attentats qui a secoué la France en 1995, et notamment celui perpétré dans le RER B à la station Saint-Michel. Un autre attentat, survenu le 15 juillet 1983 à l'aéroport d'Orly-Sud avait fait 8 morts.

Un mode opératoire synonyme d'affaiblissement des organisations terroristes?

Pourquoi les terroristes reviennent-ils à ce procédé? Pour Yves Bonnet, ancien préfet et ex-directeur de la Direction Nationale de Surveillance du Territoire (DST), il s'agit d'un ""aveu d'impuissance"" de la part des organisations terroristes. Interrogé par Le HuffPost, il confie:

""Je crois qu'on est sorti d'une phase de relative compétence à la phase de l'improvisation. Pour être intéressant, un attentat doit être ciblé, et non aveugle. L'attentat ciblé est plus difficile à commettre. Comme les organisations terroristes ont de moins en moins de recrues qualifiées, parce qu'une bombe n'est pas facile à faire, on en arrive maintenant à des tentatives et des attentats qui sont commis par des gens peu compétents. Dans un certain sens, c'est plutôt 'bon signe'"".

Un constat face auquel Alain Bauer rétorque:

""En la matière, ce n'est pas un affaiblissement mais plutôt une diversification des modes opératoires. L'Etat islamique a commencé il y a déjà très longtemps par les attaques à la voiture, au couteau, à l'arme à feu, les attaques à la bombe... La bonbonne de gaz nécessite beaucoup moins de moyens, moins d'organisation, moins d'endoctrinement et elle produit exactement le même effet médiatique, ce qui est le but du jeu du terrorisme. Le terrorisme c'est de la communication d'abord"".

Un arsenal supplémentaire donc, qui n'empêchera pas les cellules terroristes de commettre un attentat de la même ampleur que celle du 13-Novembre. Samuel Rémy, secrétaire général du SNPPS affirme: ""Ceux qui ont un niveau de technicité comparable à ceux des attentats de novembre 2015 sont toujours en mesure de le faire. Ils vivent dans la clandestinité, étaleront leur projet dans la durée, pour passer sous les radars, et continueront à le construire quand même"".

L'utilisation de la bonbonne de gaz nécessite une certaine technicité

Même si l'utilisation de bonbonnes contenant du gaz de ville reste plus facile que de manipuler du TATP, explosif auquel a très souvent recours l'Etat islamique, réputé plus instable et plus dangereux, toute la difficulté réside dans le déclenchement du détonateur.

""Si on n'est pas dans le schéma d'un attentat suicide, où la personne qui active le détonateur est juste à côté et se fait exploser avec, on est sur un dispositif à distance. Avec les moyens modernes, on utilisera plutôt un téléphone portable, tandis que dans les années 1970 on utilisait une télécommande à micro-ondes ou une minuterie"", poursuit Samuel Rémy.

Il précise: ""Aujourd'hui, on retrouve beaucoup de bonbonnes de gaz qui n'explosent pas car il y a une perte de technicité par rapport aux candidats terroristes, qui ne maîtrisent pas la mise à feu"".

Des échecs successifs, qui peuvent pousser les terroristes à perpétrer une attaque avec une arme plus simple, comme le couteau. Dimanche 2 octobre, deux femmes ont été poignardées à la gare Saint-Charles de Marseille par Ahmed Hanachi. L'Etat islamique a revendiqué l'acte.

Jetzt, vor dem Gipfel der Spitzen von CDU und CSU am Sonntag in Berlin, haben die Christsozialen sich bemüht, ihre Pläne für die Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge zu präzisieren.

Schließlich erhielten ""weniger als ein Prozent der Antragsteller letzten Endes Asyl wegen politischer Verfolgung nach Artikel 16a Grundgesetz“. Viel entscheidender sei ""der weit überwiegende Großteil, der nach der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention als Flüchtling anerkannt wird oder eine kurzzeitige Aufenthaltserlaubnis beispielsweise als Bürgerkriegsflüchtling erhält“.

Mayer: ""Das kann auch ein großherziges Angebot sein""

CSU-Vize Manfred Weber hatte für diese Gruppe feste Kontingente nach kanadischem Vorbild ins Spiel gebracht und erläuterte in einem Interview seinen Plan: ""Wir bieten dem UNHCR ein jährliches Kontingent an, wie viele Flüchtlinge wir als Europäer bereit sind aufzunehmen. Das kann durchaus ein großherziges Angebot sein.”

Mayer stellte im Gespräch mit der ""Passauer Neuen Presse"" klar: Bei jährlichen Kontingenten ""muss auch der Familiennachzug mit umfasst sein. Ansonsten wäre eine derartige Kapazitätsgrenze vollkommen wirkungslos“. Der CSU-Politiker forderte einen ""passenden Instrumentenkasten, um die illegale Migration noch effektiver als bisher zu begrenzen“.

Dazu gehöre neben der weiteren Aussetzung des Familiennachzugs ""auch die Schaffung von Einrichtungen in Grenznähe, in denen all diejenigen ohne Ausweispapier so lange verbleiben, bis ihre Identität zweifelsfrei geklärt ist, sowie die stärkere europäische Angleichung der Sozialhilfe für Flüchtlinge“.

Die spanische Regierung lehnt weiter jeden Dialog mit der Führung Kataloniens ab

Jetzt will sie die Region wirtschaftlich ausbluten

Dabei macht sie besorgten Unternehmen und Geldhäusern den Abzug leichter

Die Lage in Spanien spitzt sich immer weiter zu. Jetzt will die spanische Regierung im Katalonien-Konflikt den wirtschaftlichen Druck auf die nach Unabhängigkeit strebende Region erhöhen.

Beide Parteien rücken keinen Millimeter von ihren diametral entgegengesetzten Forderungen ab - aus Sicht vieler Beobachter könnte das gar zu einem Bürgerkrieg führen. Denn auf beiden Seiten stehen sich hartgesottene Nationalisten gegenüber.

Nun also die nächste Eskalationsstufe: Am Freitag hat Madrid ein Dekret verabschiedet, das Firmen und Banken den Weggang aus Katalonien erleichtert.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Katalonien-Konflikt gilt als Freiheitskampf - doch er ist vor allem ein Duell rigoroser Nationalisten

Firmenumzüge im Schnellverfahren

Spanische Medien sprachen bei dem Vorgang von einer ""salida exprés"" - einem Weggang im Eilverfahren. Demnach reicht für einen Ortswechsel künftig eine Entscheidung des Aufsichtsrats, eine Gesellschafterversammlung muss nicht mehr einberufen werden.

Bereits am Donnerstag hatte die fünftgrößte Bank des Landes, Banco Sabadell, angekündigt, nach Alicante umzuziehen. Am Freitag folgte die zweite Großbank: La Caixa. Die größte Sparkasse Europas will aus ""politischen und sozialen"" Gründen ihren juristischen Sitz nach Valencia legen, wie sie mitteilte.

Es wird erwartet, dass dank des Dekrets schnell weitere Geldhäuser und Firmen folgen könnten.

Hintergrund dafür dürfte vor allem der unklare Verbleib Kataloniens in der Europäischen Union sein, sollte die Region sich wirklich von Spanien abspalten.

Abspaltung: ""Kein Scherz, sondern echte Katastrophe""

Doch nicht nur Banken planen eine Verlegung. So will der Energieriese Gas Natural Fenosa seinen traditionellen Hauptsitz in Barcelona aufgeben und nach Madrid umziehen. Auch Freixenet, einer der größten Cava-Produzenten Spaniens, könnte Katalonien den Rücken kehren.

""Wenn es wirklich zu einer einseitigen Unabhängigkeitserklärung kommen sollte, dann werden viele Firmen aus Katalonien abziehen, was großen Schaden anrichten wird"", zitierte die Zeitung ""La Vanguardia"" Freixenet-Chef José Luis Bonet. Eine Abspaltung sei ""kein Scherz"", sondern ""eine echte Katastrophe"".

Selbst deutsche Unternehmen würden laut ""Spiegel Online"" ""detaillierte Notfallpläne für den Fall"" diskutieren.

Denn von etwa 1600 in Spanien aktiven deutschen Konzernen haben die Hälfte ihre lokale Zentrale in Katalonien, darunter die Lebensmittel-Discounter Lidl und Aldi, der Elektro-Händler Media Markt Saturn oder der Pharmariese Bayer.

Unbeirrt auf Abspaltungskurs

Die Katalanen hatten sich am Sonntag bei einem umstrittenen und von der Justiz untersagten Referendum mit deutlicher Mehrheit für eine Abspaltung der bisher wirtschaftsstärksten Region von Spanien ausgesprochen.

Die Regierung in Madrid hatte wochenlang mit allen Mitteln versucht, die Volksabstimmung zu verhindern. Bislang lehnt sie jeden Dialog mit der Regionalregierung ab.

Denn diese bleibt nahezu unbeirrt bei ihrem Abspaltungs- und Konfrontationskurs: Zwar wurde eine für Montag angesetzte Parlamentssitzung, bei der die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens erklärt werden sollte, am Donnerstag vom Verfassungsgericht verboten.

Aber der Chef der ""Generalitat"" (Regionalregierung), Carles Puigdemont, will nun am Dienstag vor dem Parlament in Barcelona Stellung zur ""aktuellen politischen Lage"" beziehen.

Ob er dabei die Unabhängigkeit ausrufen oder lediglich das weitere Vorgehen seiner Regierung vorstellen will, wurde nicht bekannt.

Kleiner Schritt der Annäherung

Derweil drängt die EU-Kommission Madrid und Barcelona, schnell miteinander ins Gespräch zu kommen. ""Wir wollen, dass dies rasch passiert"", sagte ein Sprecher in Brüssel.

Er blieb aber bei der Haltung der Kommission, sich nicht als Vermittler einzumischen. Die Behörde sieht den Konflikt als innere Angelegenheit Spaniens.

Immerhin: Einen kleinen Schritt der Annäherung machte Enric Millo, ein Vertreter der spanischen Regierung in Katalonien.

Fünf Tage nach der von Polizeigewalt überschatteten Abstimmung entschuldigte er sich als erster Vertreter der Zentralregierung bei den knapp 900 Verletzten.

Gleichzeitig gab er der Regionalregierung die Schuld an den Vorfällen, weil diese die Bürger zu den Wahllokalen geschickt habe, obwohl die Abstimmung von der Justiz verboten worden war.

Die Situation bleibt also angespannt.

LONDON -- Beleaguered liquor baron Vijay Mallya has been arrested in a second money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate, the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said today.

The 61-year-old flamboyant businessman, was later granted bail after he appeared before the Westminster Magistrates' Court in London this afternoon.

""Vijay Mallya has been arrested on money laundering charges and will be appearing in court today,"" a CPS spokesperson said.

The case is being probed by the ED and the central probe agency has already filed a charge sheet against him and others in a Mumbai court.

The CPS will be arguing the case against Mallya on behalf of the Indian government.

Chief Magistrate Emma Louise Arbuthnot has been hearing Mallya's extradition case at Westminster Magistrates' Court on his previous arrest warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April.

Mallya's trial in that case is scheduled for two weeks, starting December 4.

The embattled businessman, who has been based in the UK since he fled India in March last year, is wanted in India for his erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines' default on loans worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore.

It remains to be seen if both cases will be clubbed together, which may lead to a delay in the trial date.

CHANDIGARH -- Honeypreet Insan, who calls herself the adopted daughter of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, was on Tuesday arrested by the Haryana Police in connection with the deadly violence which followed the sect head's conviction on 25 August.

The arrest came hours after Honeypreet appeared on two private news channels interacting with reporters at an undisclosed location, even though the Haryana Police had been looking for her for more than a month.

Priyanka Taneja (36), alias Honeypreet, was arrested from Zirakpur-Patiala road, Haryana Police DGP B S Sandhu said. The scene of her arrest is about 15-18 kms from both Chandigarh and Panchkula.

The Haryana Police had been facing flak for not being able to nab Honeypreet for more than a month.

Honeypreet tops a list of 43 people ""wanted"" by the state police in connection with the violence following Ram Rahim's conviction in two rape cases. At least 41 people died and several were injured in the violence.

Police Commissioner A S Chawla said that another woman - a Dera follower- was accompanying Honeypreet at the time of her arrest. Both of them were being questioned.

""We have deputed senior lady officers for questioning. She has not divulged much, but we are on the job. Initially, she was not cooperating,"" Chawla told reporters in Panchkula.

Chawla said the woman accompanying Honeypreet ""confirmed that Honeypreet was with her for the past several days in Bathinda district of Punjab.""

He said the information was being verified. ""We will take her there and confirm things.""

Honeypreet will be produced before a court in Panchkula on Wednesday where the police will seek her remand, he said.

""Her role in the violence will be probed,"" the officer said.

He said the Punjab Police has been informed about the arrests.

Asked whether the Haryana Police got the information about the accused's movements from their Punjab counterparts, Chawla said, ""At this moment, I cannot share what all intelligence inputs we had or who all supported us"".

Asked to comment on reports that Honeypreet was in the custody of the Punjab Police before her arrest today by the Haryana Police, Chawla evaded a direct reply.

Mohali SSP Kuldeep Chahal, however, said the reports were ""misleading"".

On being quizzed about the police station where the Dera chief's adopted daughter will be kept, Chawla said, ""All these are part of operational details which I cannot share"".

The officer said the priority was to question Honeypreet.

""Who supported whom, who did the wrong, which all places did she hide and who gave her shelter, all these things will come to the fore when we question her at length,"" he said.

Chawla said the role of Ram Rahim's relative, who is a politician, will also come under the scanner.

The Haryana Police on 1 September issued a lookout notice against Honeypreet and another Ram Rahim aide Aditya Insan following fears that they might ""escape from the country"".

An arrest warrant was issued against Honeypreet and two key Dera functionaries - Aditya and Pawan Insan, after the Haryana Police moved an application in Panchkula court.

The police had conducted searches at various locations with several teams even traveling across the country, including the Indo-Nepal border, in search of Honeypreet.

Honeypreet, who calls herself ""Papa's angel"", had accompanied Ram Rahim from the sect headquarters at Sirsa to special CBI court in Panchkula on 25 August. After Dera chief's conviction that day, she also accompanied him in a chopper when he was flown to Rohtak jail.

On 26 September, the Delhi High Court had dismissed Honeypreet's transit anticipatory bail plea. The court's order was based on the ground that she had been evading arrest and hence, was not entitled to any discretionary relief.

AHMEDABAD -- The Gujarat High Court on Thursday rejected Zakia Jafri's plea challenging a lower court order upholding SIT's clean chit to then chief minister Narendra Modi and others on allegations of larger conspiracy in connection with the 2002 post-Godhra riots.

The high court, however, allowed Zakia to approach higher forums for further investigation in the case.

Zakia, the wife of slain former MP Ehsan Jafri, and activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO Citizen for Justice and Peace had moved the criminal review petition against a magistrate's order upholding the clean chit given by the special investigation team (SIT) to Modi and others regarding the allegations of a ""larger criminal conspiracy"" behind the riots.

The petition demanded that Modi and 59 others -- including senior police officers and bureaucrats -- be made accused of allegedly being a part of a conspiracy which facilitated the riots.

It had also sought the high court's direction for fresh investigation into the matter.

Ehsan Jafri, a Congress leader, was among 68 people who were killed at the Gulberg Society when a mob attacked it on 28 February, 2002, a day after the Godhra train burning incident which had set riots in the state.

The SIT's closure report, filed on 8 February, 2012, gave a clean chit to Modi and others.

In December 2013, the metropolitan magistrate's court here rejected Jafri's petition against the report, after which she moved the high court in 2014.

Follow these nine tips on how to eat healthy on a budget.
Plan ahead""If you plan ahead and cook from scratch, healthy foods are not more expensive,"" Debenham said.
Lunch wraps and salads""Try roast chicken whole grain wraps with fresh veggies, or salad made with roast veggies and chickpeas,"" Tuck said.
""For snacks, try fresh fruit, homemade hummus (chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, natural yoghurt), carrot sticks and a handful of raw nuts.""","One worry many people have when deciding to eat more healthily or follow a plant-based diet is the apparent high cost of the change.

Yes, eating healthily can be expensive if your trolley is full of superfoods and organic produce, but at its core, health eating is incredibly affordable.

""Studies have found that people do tend to believe healthy foods are in fact more expensive,"" Anna Debenham, accredited practising dietitian from The Biting Truth, told HuffPost Australia. ""While this may be true in some product categories, many people believe this is the case across all categories, and it is not.

""Of course, if you are wanting to follow the latest trends and superfoods, your shopping trolley price tag is going to stack up, but many of the healthiest staples are actually more affordable than their unhealthy counterparts.""

Nutritionist Fiona Tuck highlights that often we use the ""healthy food is expensive"" reason as an excuse to not make healthy dietary changes.

""We sometimes make excuses for the things that we don't want to do,"" Tuck said. ""Choosing an apple over a chocolate bar is not only a healthier choice, but it is a cheaper choice too.

Check out the following price comparison A serve of potato is one medium potato (or 150g): Whole potatoes per 150g = 50c

Frozen chips per 150g = 70c

Potato crisps per 150g = $3.75

""Healthy eating doesn't need to be expensive and can actually be more economical than buying pre-packaged processed goods like confectionery, fizzy drinks and junk food.

""Choosing fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains such as brown rice and wholemeal pasta, lean fish, meats and poultry is an economical way to eat.""

Follow these nine tips on how to eat healthy on a budget.

1. Plan ahead

""If you plan ahead and cook from scratch, healthy foods are not more expensive,"" Debenham said. ""Try to plan your meals one week in advance so you know exactly what you need.""

Need ideas? Try these healthy, meal prep-friendly recipes.

""Check supermarket catalogues for specials and identify any products that you need before you go shopping.

""Once you have planned your meals for the week, write a shopping list and stick to it. If you find the aisles too tempting, why not try shopping online?""

2. Avoid buying superfoods

While it might be tempting, choosing exotic superfoods such as acai and goji berries, or organic foods, can quickly shoot up the price.

""Healthy eating becomes more expensive when people become fixated with new trends and fads,"" Alexandra Parker, accredited practising dietitian from The Biting Truth, told HuffPost Australia.

""Fad foods and ingredients are often marketed with a superior price tag and, more often than not, lack the scientific evidence to support any health claims around them.""

3. Cook from scratch

""Healthy eating is very affordable if you cook your meals from scratch,"" Parker said.

""If you choose to regularly purchase healthy meals from restaurants for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner, it will certainly take its toll on your wallet, as healthier eating out options tend to be more expensive than less healthy options.""

Browse online for easy, healthy recipes and get inspiration from Pinterest.

4. Choose in-season produce

""Shopping for real, fresh ingredients that are in-season will provide the true nutritional benefits without the price tag,"" Debenham said.

Think about it: if you're buying mangoes in winter, you're paying for the product to be shipped in to Australia. Plus, out-of-season produce won't taste as good as in-season varieties.

5. Avoid ready-made meals and grains

Most times, food with no-frills or zero packaging -- like uncooked rice, pasta, fruit, veggies, loose nuts and legumes -- will be cheaper than their pre-prepared, pre-chopped or pre-packed counterparts.

""Minimise processed and packaged foods. These are more expensive and full of sugars, salts and additives,"" Tuck said.

""Buy wholegrain pasta and rice and cook at home, rather than buy precooked, packaged options. And throw in fresh veggies and herbs, rather than using packet sauces and mixes.

""You can also buy a whole fresh chicken and roast at home. This is a more economical way to eat, plus it doesn't have artificial flavours and additives like the pre-prepared, packaged or processed meats.""

Whole grains like oats, barley and whole wheat help keep us fuller for longer.

6. Compare prices and choose home brand products

Don't be afraid of buying home-brand foods, as well as cheaper cuts of meat to make stews, to dramatically lower the total shopping cost.

""Compare the prices per kilogram or unit price to determine the best value for money,"" Parker said.

""Generic brands such as home brand are usually the same quality and provide the same nutritional benefits, but more affordable.

""You can use regular tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, swap eye fillet for rump steak, and try frozen peas instead of snow peas.""

7. Buy in bulk

""Try to stock up on foods you eat regularly when they are on special. For example, tins of tuna or tubs of yoghurt,"" Debenham said. ""Buy a large tub of yoghurt and portion it out rather than buying individual sized tubs.

""If you have bought too much of a vegetable such as carrots, slightly steam them, let them cool and place in a ziplock bag and freeze.""

Another tip: instead of buying grated cheese, which is more expensive, choose a block of cheese and grate it yourself.

Farmers markets also often have reduced-price produce.

8. Don't shop on an empty stomach

""We all know how tempting it is to buy unhealthy foods when you go to the supermarket hungry. So one super tip is to eat before you go shopping, as you'll find you're much more likely to stick to your list this way,"" Debenham said.

9. Stock up on frozen and canned fruits and vegetables

""Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are just as good as fresh from a nutritional perspective,"" Parker said.

However, when it comes to canned fruits and vegetables in particular, be mindful of the salt and sugar content.

""Pay attention to salt content in canned veggies and look for no-added salt (sodium) products. With frozen fruit, ensure there is no added sugar, and if you're choosing tinned fruit opt for natural juice rather than syrup.""

Whip up a quick curry using canned chickpeas, veggies and Indian spice mix.

Cheap, healthy meal ideas

Need some ideas for healthy, delicious and budget-friendly meals? Try these:

Homemade spaghetti bolognese using lean mince/lentils

""You can find 500 grams of lean mince at the supermarket for around $7 or less. This amount easily makes two dinner meals, with lunch leftovers,"" Parker said. ""Packing in affordable veggies like frozen peas and carrots, along with legumes such as lentils, will help to bulk out the meal and mean it will go even further.""

Homemade baked beans

""This is the perfect meal for the weekend and you can flavour it up with whatever herbs and spice you like,"" Debenham said. Try this recipe.

Stir fry

""You can generally find stir fry beef or chicken tenderloins for around $7 at the supermarket which, combined with rice and frozen veggies or seasonal vegetables, can be used to create at least two dinners, plus leftovers,"" Parker said.

Soups

""This is a great option during winter. Try throwing some lentils and veggies in a pot to make a winter warming lentil soup and serve with some crusty bread,"" Debenham said.

Homemade pizza

""Make your own healthy pizza using pita bread and whatever vegetables you have left in the fridge. We usually add some chicken to bump up the protein content,"" Debenham said.

Lunch wraps and salads

""Try roast chicken whole grain wraps with fresh veggies, or salad made with roast veggies and chickpeas,"" Tuck said.

Breakfast porridge

""Cook rolled oats and top with sliced banana, natural yoghurt and a dash of honey,"" Tuck said.

""For snacks, try fresh fruit, homemade hummus (chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, natural yoghurt), carrot sticks and a handful of raw nuts.""

Le déjeuner au travail est un moment important, une pause indispensable entre collègues ou seul. Raison de plus pour la soigner. C'est aussi pour cela que nous avons lancé un défi du 9 au 13 octobre: cuisiner et apporter son déjeuner au bureau tous les jours.

Nous avons interrogé cinq spécialistes de la nutrition sur ce qu'elles mangent au déjeuner en semaine. Sortez votre plus beau tupperware, voici leurs meilleures recettes:

Chloé Thomas, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Vincennes

Au déjeuner, j'essaie toujours de manger des légumes, des féculents et des protéines. Quand je cuisine la veille, j'essaie d'en faire un peu plus pour pouvoir m'apporter une gamelle le lendemain. Par exemple, en ce moment, il commence à faire plus frais, j'ai besoin de manger chaud. Ce midi, j'ai mangé des courgettes et des carottes poêlées, du riz complet et des crevettes. Le tout était revenu avec un peu de crème fraîche et du curry. Au dessert, c'était du fromage blanc.

Quand je vais dans des brasseries, j'aime prendre des grandes salades composées. Pour avoir aussi des féculents, je mange un morceau de pain. En dessert, je peux commander une pana cotta, des sorbets ou des fruits en sirop. Si elle est maison, je mange aussi volontiers une tarte aux pommes.

Valérie Legrand, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Lyon

Au déjeuner, je prends toujours le temps de me préparer à manger à l'avance. Je fais en sorte d'avoir dans mon assiette: des protéines, des légumes, des féculents. Il y a une recette que j'aime beaucoup me faire. Je prépare du riz aux oignons, à la tomate et avec des courgettes. J'ajoute de l'ail et des herbes aromatiques ainsi qu'une escalope de poulet émincée, des moules ou des crevettes.

En dessert, je mange un fruit frais.

Ariane Grumbach, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Paris

J'essaie de faire un mix entre les repas maison et les repas pris à l'extérieur. Se dire qu'on se prépare à déjeuner tous les jours, c'est beaucoup de pression et d'organisation. Je congèle pas mal de restes et quand je me prépare à manger, je fais beaucoup de repas végétariens, la plupart sont des assemblages de produits déjà cuits.

Ce midi j'ai mangé un mélange de quinoa et de riz, du concombre, du basilic, des graines et une vinaigrette huile d'olive et citron. J'avais fait cuire ces féculents la veille pour un plat de poivrons farcis. Il m'a suffit de les assembler avec autre chose pour avoir un repas différent le lendemain.

Quand je mange à l'extérieur, je prends rarement une entrée, un plat et un dessert. Je préfère me concentrer sur un très bon plat. Un restaurant à côté de mon cabinet fait de très bons et complets bols repas. Le dernier en date c'était du quinoa, des poivrons, du pesto et des courgettes. Je préfère manger moins souvent à l'extérieur mais manger un plat qui me fera vraiment plaisir et qui sera donc un peu plus cher. C'est aussi ce que je conseille à mes patients, mieux vaut économiser deux tickets resto sur une semaine pour faire un bon repas que de manger à l'extérieur tous les jours.

Anaïs Lala, diététicienne-nutritionniste à Paris

J'ai trois configurations, soit je mange un repas maison, soit un plat surgelé, soit un plat acheté dans un supermarché. Dans le premier cas de figure, comme ce midi, je peux manger une poêlée de légumes avec du quinoa et des fèves avec une vinaigrette. J'ai complété avec deux tranches de jambon et un yaourt nature ou au citron.

De temps en temps, je prends du surgelé mais les plats offrent peu de variétés donc pour ne pas me lasser, je me limite. Au supermarché, je peux acheter une salade de carottes, une barquette de tomates cerises et des protéines comme du jambon. Si je vais dans une boulangerie, je vais acheter une salade et un bon petit pain aux noix pour les féculent par exemple plutôt qu'un sandwich.

Hélène Brunengo, diététicienne-nutritionniste, spécialiste de chrono-nutrition et micronutrition

Au déjeuner, je mange des féculents. En ce moment, j'aime beaucoup le boulgour que je décline en salade l'été et que je mange chaud autrement. Je le mélange avec des courgettes, de l'avocat, de l'aubergine, du potiron. J'aime aussi beaucoup l'alliance: boulgour, pastèque, pamplemousse, oignons jeunes, raisins secs et coriandre.

Si le temps manque, le boulgour c'est aussi très bon avec une noix de beurre et un jus de viande.

NEW DELHI -- A government crackdown on Muslim-dominated abattoirs and the trade of cattle dragged down India's exports of leather shoes by more than 13% in June, as leading global brands turned to China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan to secure supplies.

The drop in exports of shoes and leather garments comes as a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has sought to create millions of jobs by more than doubling the leather industry's revenues to $27 billion by 2020.

Emboldened by the victory of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 general election, Hindu hard-liners, who consider cows sacred, became more assertive in their calls for a clamp-down on both the meat and leather industries, run by Muslims, who make up 14% of India's 1.3 billion people.

""The writing was already on the wall,"" Nazir Ahmed, CEO of shoemaker Park Exports, told Reuters by phone from Agra, a shoe-making hub and home to the Taj Mahal. ""We have killed the goose that laid the golden egg.""

India, the world's second-biggest supplier of shoes and leather garments, exports nearly half its leather goods, with overseas sales estimated at $5.7 billion in the 2016/17 fiscal year to March, down 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Footwear exports fell more than 4% in April-June, to $674 million.

INFORMAL SECTOR

In March, after being appointed chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and a major leather exporter, Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu monk, ordered a closure of abattoirs operating without licenses.

Slaughterhouse owners complain that much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal sector, and it's hard to get licences, especially for smaller units.

In May, citing cruelty to animals, the federal government banned the trade of cattle for slaughter, and restricted livestock sales only for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production.

But the country's top court overturned that order, citing the hardship the ban had caused.

That has not brought relief as repeated attacks on trucks carrying cattle still rankle the leather trade.

""The supreme court has allowed the resumption of trade for cattle, but the ground reality is that cow vigilante groups continue to be active and no one wants to risk his life by transporting cattle,"" Ahmed said.

Deterred by a clutch of measures that squeezed the supply of leather, a key raw material, brands like H&M, Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks, cut back their orders to India, said M. Rafeeque Ahmed, a leading shoe exporter from the southern city of Chennai and former president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.

""We lost orders because our buyers were skeptical of our ability to meet their requirements. Instead, most buyers moved to rival suppliers in Asia and southeast Asia,"" he said.

A spokesman for India's trade ministry declined to comment.

Earlier this year, a finance ministry report said India should sign more free trade agreements and make tax and labour reforms to drive leather exports, which offer ""tremendous opportunities for (the) creation of jobs.""

The industry is also grappling with a Goods and Services Tax, introduced in July, which has pushed up production costs by 6-7 percent, exporters said.

NOWHERE TO HIDE

The crackdown also hurt day-workers employed at shoe and garment making units and hit leather supplies, forcing manufacturers to import hides from the United States, Australia, and some European nations, raising the cost of production and squeezing margins.

Many tanneries, as a result, have run out of leather.

""My business has come to a standstill because I don't have any inventory at all. Most large shoemakers are importing hides now,"" said a tannery owner, who asked not to be named so as to avoid retaliation from cow vigilante groups.

Nearly a third of the roughly 3 million-strong workforce, mostly lowly-paid casual workers employed in the leather sector, have lost their jobs in the past six months, according to six shoemakers and two tannery owners interviewed by Reuters for this article.

Since most Indian states have outlawed cow slaughter, the supply of leather largely comes from the legal slaughter of buffaloes whose skins are used in many leather goods.

""Everyone must abide by the rule on cow slaughter and respect sentiments, but by choking the supply of other animal hides, we have nearly killed a thriving industry,"" said Ahmed of Park Exports.

Du tac au tac, Ryan Gosling lui a demandé si elle était une fan du film, ce à quoi elle a avoué qu'elle ne l'a jamais vu, ce qui a fait rire l'acteur. «J'apprécie votre candeur», lui a-t-il dit.

Lorsqu'Hammond a voulu connaître les motivations de Ford de tourner un deuxième Blade Runner 25 ans plus tard, elle n'a pas eu de vraie réponse. «Quand ils m'ont demandé si j'étais intéressé, j'ai dit...», a commencé Ford, avant de se faire interrompre par Hammond: «Combien?». «Montrez-moi l'argent!», a répondu Ford, causant encore plus de rigolade.

Après qu'Hammond ait commenté le pull de Gosling, celui-ci a demandé «est-ce que c'est une entrevue ou quoi?» avant de se lever et d'aller du côté des caméras, pour finalement revenir s'asseoir.

Au sujet des scènes de cascades et de batailles dans le film, Gosling a indiqué: «Vous savez ce qu'on dit? Ne rencontrez pas vos héros, mais moi je dis, ne vous faites pas donner un coup de point par vos héros!»

In den Wochen danach folgten zwei Briefe fast gleichen Inhalts, noch konkreter formuliert.

Und am Samstag 13. Februar 2016 stand einen ganzen Gottesdienst lang ein Mann vor dem Altar, der im Rathaus angekündigt hatte, dass ich nach diesem Gottesdienst nicht mehr existieren würde. Die Polizei stand daneben in der Sakristei und konnte nichts tun.

Was damals passiert war, hat halb Deutschland verfolgt: Ich hatte als gebürtiger Kongolese einen Artikel der damaligen CSU-Ortsvorsitzenden kritisiert, die von einer ""Invasion"" von Flüchtlingen sprach und davon, dass Bayern ""überrannt"" werde. Dann ging es los.

Wie können Christen so hassen?

Die meisten der Menschen, die in diese Geschichte verwickelt sind - der Briefeschreiber, die Pöbler, die CSU-Politikerin - sind Christen. Die meisten kamen sogar zu mir in den Gottesdienst.

Ich habe mich gefragt, wie es sein kann, dass sie so hassen. Das passte alles nicht.

Denn die Botschaft Jesu ist eindeutig: Liebe deinen nächsten wie dich selbst. Christsein besteht nicht darin, in den Gottesdienst zu gehen, sondern darin, dieses Gebot zu leben.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Schein trügt: Hasskriminalität gegen Lesben und Schwule nimmt stetig zu

In der christlichen Erziehung funktioniert etwas nicht

Und ich habe meine Antwort auf die Frage gefunden: In der christlichen Erziehung funktioniert etwas nicht und dafür ist grundsätzlich die Kirche verantwortlich.

Es stimmt etwas nicht damit, wohin sich die Kirche strukturell und theologisch entwickelt hat. Wir haben die Kirche Jesu Christi entstellt. Und das merkt man in der Art, wie wir Pastoral machen, also Seelsorge.

Die Kirche hat sich gewaltig von der Lehre Jesu entfernt

Basis für alles, was die Kirche tut, muss die Lehre Jesu sein. Und davon hat sich die Kirche ganz gewaltig entfernt.

► Beispiel priesterlicher Zölibat: Hat Jesus das gewollt? Ganz eindeutig nein. Er hat verheiratete und unverheiratete Männer zu Aposteln gemacht. Jetzt von den Priestern ausschließlich Ehelosigkeit zu verlangen, ist Hochmut, ist Anmaßung, denn dadurch stellt die Kirche Jesus unter sich, als ob er falsch gehandelt und gedacht hätte. Und doch hat er die Kirche gegründet und er allein ist Sohn Gottes, der Messias.

► Beispiel Papst: Wir nennen sowohl Gott als auch den Papst ""Heiliger Vater"" (etwa im vierten Hochgebet der Messfeier). Das ist eine Vergöttlichung eines Menschen. Das geht doch nicht!

► Beispiel Hierarchien: Wir haben die Kirche hierarchisch aufgebaut mit Kardinälen, Erzbischöfen und vielen mehr - statt geschwisterlich, wie Jesus es vorgelebt und ausdrücklich uns gesagt hat. ""Nennt niemanden auf Erden euren Vater, nur einer ist euer Vater, der im Himmel, ihr alle seid Brüder.""

Solche Widersprüche spüren die Menschen und treiben sie weg von der Kirche, die dadurch unglaubwürdig da steht. Und die Kirche hat auch im Konkreten Fehler gemacht:

► Beispiel Bibelkreis: Wir haben lange Zeit die Bibelarbeit vernachlässigt. Christen müssen diese Lehren kennen und diskutieren, um sie im Alltag anwenden zu können. Wir müssen einen Weg finden, die Bibelkreise so zu gestalten, so anzubieten, dass sich die Menschen angesprochen fühlen.

► Beispiel Gottesdienst: Wir haben die Bedeutung des Gottesdienstes überbewertet, diese rituellen Zusammenkünfte. Christsein heißt aber nicht in erster Linie, dass man in die Kirche geht, sondern dass man Liebe und Nächstenliebe im Alltag lebt. Und dabei müssen wir den Menschen helfen.

► Beispiel Flüchtlinge: Der Münchner Kardinal hat die Verantwortung der Christen für die Flüchtlinge betont. Aber es genügt nicht, wenn nur der Kardinal laut redet und viele andere Geistliche still sind. Es ist die Aufgabe der Kirche, klar zu sagen, wenn Politik gegen Grundwerte verstößt.

► Beispiel Rassismus: Selbst Menschen, die sich als Christen bezeichnen, rufen ""Ausländer raus"". Aber nach christlicher Auffassung ist jeder ein Ebenbild Gottes. Das heißt, wer einen anderen hasst, der hasst auch sich selbst. Damit haben alle verloren. Wir müssen Ausländerhass auch durch religiöse Aufklärung bekämpfen. Wir müssen uns so um die Menschen kümmern, dass sie sich nicht mehr von Radikalen einfangen lassen - egal, ob das nun Rassisten oder Islamisten sind.

Ich muss es so hart sagen

Ich weiß, das klingt hart für einen Geistlichen. Aber ich muss es hart sagen, damit es gehört wird. Ich kritisiere die Kirche, weil ich sie sehr liebe. Ich möchte, dass sie noch mehr Ausstrahlungskraft gewinnt und schließlich die Menschen zum Heil führt.

Die Kirche kann die riesigen gesellschaftlichen Aufgaben nicht alleine lösen. Die Politik muss dafür sorgen, dass es allen gut geht - den Benachteiligten aber auch allen anderen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich wurde im Bus wegen meines Kopftuchs angefeindet - das habe ich allen in Deutschland zu sagen

Jeder Einzelne muss mitarbeiten. Das fängt schon damit an, dass er sich bewusst macht, dass er sich selbst lieben darf - und erst dann auch andere lieben kann.

Das ist eine immense Herausforderung. Und die Kirche muss Vorbild sein. Das ist ihre Berufung und ihre Mission.

The USFWS is defending the decision, saying it’s based on the walruses’ demonstrated ability to adapt to environmental changes and that there’s not sufficient data to indicate the animals need to be listed as “threatened” or “endangered” at this point in time.

The primary issue at hand is sea ice, which has been declining over the past few decades as the planet warms. Pacific walruses, which live in Arctic waters, use sea ice for crucial behaviors like giving birth, nursing and resting.

Declining sea ice means the walruses must increasingly “haul out” ― meaning congregate in large numbers ― on land instead of on sea ice. And when females and their young perform those behaviors on land instead of on ice, there are serious risks.

“When walruses are forced to land, they have reduced access to their food and have to swim farther to find food,” Wolf said. (Their diet is largely bottom-dwelling prey like clams.) Scientists have observed a lack of sea ice resulting in walrus pups being separated from their mothers and left to starve or drown.

And on land, young walruses are more vulnerable to predators and are susceptible to being trampled by the much larger adults.

The USFWS acknowledges these hazards. But it sees the fact that walruses have been able to shift to land at all as a sign of the subspecies’ adaptability, and says there are ways to mitigate some of the risks that come with the shift.

Handout . / Reuters An estimated 35,000 walruses hauled out on a beach near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2014. Scientists say the walruses hauled out on the beach because of the lack of sufficient sea ice, which they would normally use.

Patrick Lemons, chief of the Marine Mammals Management Office in Anchorage, Alaska, told HuffPost that in recent years officials in Alaska and Russia have implemented ways to reduce the kinds of trampling events that have previously killed thousands of walruses. Primarily, they created rules to reduce human disturbances like hunting and air traffic that can spook walruses into stampeding. (Trampling events can also occur when walruses become panicked by natural occurrences, like the sight of predators.)

When it comes to reduced access to food, Lemons said that researchers previously weren’t sure that land-living walruses would be able to make “very long off-shore foraging trips,” but that it’s now clear they’ve shown the ability to do so.

Wolf, however, says that walruses moving from ice to land should absolutely not be seen as a sign of adaptability, but a signal that something is seriously wrong.

“Walruses are ice-dependent,” she said. “Being forced to move from ice to land when the ice disappears is causing lots of harms to walruses ... This is no happy adaptation story.”

She noted that listing the walrus under the ESA would have had several major benefits.

“It raises awareness that climate change is driving walruses toward extinction, and opens up resources for conservation action,” Wolf said. “ESA listing would require protection of the walrus’s core habitat, a recovery plan with the science-based steps needed for walrus survival and recovery, and require the Fish and Wildlife Service to work with other federal agencies to ensure that the federal government’s actions don’t harm the walrus and its habitat.”

Lemons said that the Pacific walrus population ― now estimated to be at about 280,000 ― appears to have decreased by about 60 percent since 1980. But he said it’s not totally clear why. Declining ice, he said, is one potential factor. He also noted there was a “significant amount of subsistence hunting in the mid 1980s,” which has since lessened, but may have been responsible for population drops around that time.

The most recent data, he says, suggests the population is “the highest it’s been since 1980 and is approaching sustainability.”

The USFSW could be open to listing the Pacific walrus as threatened or endangered in the future if the data changes, he said.

“We will continue to monitor the population and work with our partners here in Alaska,” he said.",Trump Administration Denies Endangered Species Protection To Walruses Threatened By Climate Change,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pacific-walrus-endangered-species-act-trump_us_59d7d43ae4b0f6eed350356b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009

Den See und was die Gefahr für Mensch und Umwelt verursacht, seht ihr im Video oben

Lake Erie ist einer der viertgrößten Seen Nordamerikas. Normalerweise zeichnet er sich durch sein blaues Wasser aus. Doch seit mehreren Jahren verfärbt sich der See grün.

Was sich faszinierend anhört, ist in Wahrheit das Anzeichen einer Naturkatastrophe dar. Die ist sowohl für Menschen als auch die Umwelt gefährlich. Anfang Oktober veröffentlichte die NASA neue Bilder des Sees, die das Ausmaß der Katastrophe zeigen.

Laut einer Pressemitteilung des National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sind “Microcystis Cyanobakterien” der Grund für die Verfärbung.

3 Millionen Menschen beziehen Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee

“Die Microcystis Cyanobakterien erstrecken sich über das westliche Becken und breiten sich entlang der Küsten von Michigan und Ohio, von Maumee Bay bis hin zur Küste von Ontario, aus”, heißt es in der Pressemitteilung.

Der See sei so stark mit giftigen Algen verschmutzt, dass die Ohio Environmental Protection Agency davor warne, das Leitungswasser in der Region zu trinken und in die Nähe des Lake Erie zu gehen. Laut der “New York Times” beziehen fast drei Millionen Menschen ihr Trinkwasser aus dem Eriesee.

Die globale Klimaerwärmung verstärkt das Gift der Algen

Das Problem sei seit 2000 bekannt, dennoch sei bisher nicht viel dagegen unternommen worden. Wissenschaftler gehen davon aus, dass das Gift der Algen durch die globale Klimaerwärmung stärker werden wird.

Die Bürgermeisterin von Toledo, einer Stadt an der Küste des Sees, schrieb vor wenigen Tagen einen Brief an US-Präsident Donald Trump. Paula Hicks-Hudson macht darin auf die Gefahr, die von dem See ausgeht, aufmerksam.

But as a pharmacist, I was extremely disappointed that the future of community pharmacies was not addressed.

The industry is facing some of its toughest times, with speculation rife that cuts are afoot and pharmacists will be stripped of many of their day-to-day jobs, with responsibilities handed over to technicians instead.

The biggest problem is this: pharmacists are often the most accessible healthcare professionals for people.

You would be surprised at the number of people who walk into their local chemist and say 'can I speak to a pharmacist, please'. They might have a cold, or they might have a rash, or they might have taken some tablets and they feel dizzy.

Ultimately, they want some help and advice, and they wanted it fairly quickly and without having to make an appointment with their GP.

Pharmacists go through four years of training and generally have extensive knowledge about the suitability of medications, and what medicines work well with another.

We are the final gate post before the drug gets to the patient, and often the first person a patient comes to if they have any questions.

New plans, which Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is set to consider, include allowing technicians to supervise a pharmacy and hand out prescription-only medication without a pharmacist being present.

These plans have understandably caused controversy and a real fear that patients will suffer.

To put it simply, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians go through very different training and have very different skill sets.

Technicians are trained in accuracy. They are trained to make sure the right sticker is on the right box.

Pharmacists are trained in pharmacology. We don't just check prescriptions, but clinically assess the suitability of a medicine for the patient, and whether one medicine matches another.

If mistakes were to occur, in the most extreme cases it could mean life or death. This isn't an over exaggeration.

It's all too easy for government ministers to make decisions based on cost and balancing the books, without spending time fully getting to grips with what a pharmacist actually does.

If given the go ahead, the current legislation will need to be amended to allow 'pharmacy professionals' to take responsibility for the supply and sale of prescription only medicines.

This is simply a push-back and will put more pressure on over-stretched GP surgeries.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health previously said they wanted to ""optimise"" the skills of technicians and ""make the best use of staff"".

They added no changes would be made without proper consultation.

In response, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society recently produced an eight-point position statement setting out their objection to any plans which would involve 'pharmacies run without pharmacists'.

Among the points, they said they wanted to see ""the law constructed so as to ensure the pharmacist always has the opportunity to undertake the clinical assessment or check"".

They added they did not want to see any law changes ""which could be used to operate pharmacies without pharmacists being present for anything other than very short periods of time"".

Anfang des Jahres tauchte ein 35-seitiges Geheimdossier über angebliche Russland-Verbindungen von Donald Trump auf, das sogenannte Steele-Dokument.

Es ist nach seinem Verfasser, dem ehemaligem britischen Geheimagenten Christopher Steele, benannt und enthält viele Informationen über Trumps Beziehungen nach Moskau und St. Petersburg.

Für Furore sorgte aber vor allem eine Anekdote in Steeles Bericht, die dem Dossier den Spitznamen ""Urin-Dossier"" eintrug - und die jetzt auch Sonderermittler Robert Mueller beschäftigt.

Trump und die russischen Prostituierten

So soll Donald Trump laut Christopher Steele in der Präsidentensuite des Moskauer Hotels Ritz Carlton mehreren Prostituierten befohlen haben, auf das Bett zu urinieren. Nicht nur eklig, sondern auch brisant - denn in diesem Bett soll zuvor das Ehepaar Obama geschlafen haben.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Sex, Lügen und ein Videotape? Das müsst ihr über Trumps angebliche Porno-Enthüllungen wissen

Tatsächlich ist das Dossier des britischen Agenten äußerst umstritten. Es zirkulierte schon Monate vor seiner Veröffentlichung in mehreren US-Redaktionen - erst das Nachrichtenportal ""Buzzfeed"" wagte sich an die Veröffentlichung. Auch Vertreter der US-Geheimdienste äußerten Zweifel über das Dokument und konnten seine Echtheit nicht bestätigen.

Doch nun beschäftigt sich laut verschiedenen Medienberichten der als seriös und unbestechlich geltende Robert Mueller mit dem Steele-Dossier - und gibt diesem somit eine neue Relevanz.

Muellers Team hat mit Christopher Steele gesprochen

Dafür spricht vor allem, dass Muellers Ermittlerteam das Dossier wohl nicht nur eingesehen hat, sondern sich auch mit Christopher Steele persönlich getroffen haben soll. Das berichten übereinstimmend die US-Sender NBC News und CNN.

BREAKING NEWS: NBC News confirms that Mueller's office spoke to Trump Dossier Author #TheBeat https://t.co/PqEFJDMcLF — TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) 5. Oktober 2017

Auch die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters hatte zuvor berichtet, dass das Steele-Dossier offizieller Teil von Muellers Ermittlungen über die möglichen Verbindungen von Trumps Team nach Russland sei.

Ermittlungen, die gerade enorm an Fahrt aufnehmen.

Steele-Dossier nur kleiner Teil der Untersuchung in der Russland-Affäre

Denn Mueller beschäftigt sich längst nicht nur mit dem ominösen Steele-Dossier. Vielmehr gehe der Ex-FBI-Chef auf breiter juristischer Front gegen Trump vor, wie der ehemalige Bundesstaatsanwalt Renato Mariotti für das US-Magazin ""Politico"" schreibt.

Demnach hat Mueller nicht nur zahlreiche Unterlagen des Weißen Hauses angefordert, sondern auch Finanzdokumente von Trumps Unternehmen. Der Sonderermittler hat zudem mehrere Interviews mit ehemaligen und derzeitigen Mitarbeitern von Donald Trump angefragt.

Einer dieser Mitarbeiter ist Paul Manafort, Trumps ehemaliger Wahlkampfmanager, dessen Wohnung auf Geheiß Muellers bereits bei einer Razzia durchsucht und der monatelang vom FBI abgehört wurde.

Es führen also viele Spuren von Donald Trump nach Russland - und Robert Mueller folgt ihnen allen. Auch, wenn sie nach russischem Urin riechen sollten.

Anyone who has slept on an Indian khatiya knows it isn't exactly a luxury item that spells comfort. Its criss-crossing web is created by pliable strings, usually made of rude materials like jute, to keep the structure from snapping under the weight of the sleeper. Even so, the charpoy has been popular, historically.

Moroccan traveller and scholar Ibn Battuta sang praises of its functionality and light weight when he arrived in India to join Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq's court in Delhi. In 1350, Battuta wrote, ""The beds in India are very light. A single man can carry one and every traveller should have his own bed, which his slave carries about on his head. The bed consists of four conical legs, on which four staves are laid; between they plait a sort of ribbon of silk or cotton. When you lie on it you need nothing else to render the bed sufficiently elastic.""

Chanelling Battuta's spirit in 2017 is an Australian man named Daniel Bloore, who was floored by the humble khatiya while travelling through India in 2010 in search of a music teacher. A year-and-a half ago, Bloome fashioned himself a charpoy bed and about six months ago, he started selling them after making one for his friend.

Now here's the catch: India's humble charpoy, used mostly by poor village-dwellers, seems to have gotten a thousand-dollar makeover in Australia. Bloome's flyer advertises the khatiya as ""Made from beautiful timber with strong Mortise and Tenon joints"" and ""100% Australian made to an ancient Indian design"". It is also priced at $990, which is just over Rs 50,000.

Naturally, as soon as Indian Twitter got a whiff of the exorbitant price the khatiya is being sold for, the floodgates were thrown open for sarcasm, jokes and, of course, lamentations about the West cashing in on India's age-old wisdom.

While India marvels at and ridicules the steep price tag on the khatiya, down under, Bloome justified it saying that it takes up to a week to make these 'handwoven daybeds'.

""It's a lot of work to make these beds. The timber and the rope cost almost half of the price and then it takes many hours to make the frame,"" an Australian website quoted Bloome as saying. Although business isn't exactly booming yet, Bloome says he's constantly fielding calls from people curious about the desi charpoy.

Doch Doug Sosnik, einer der renommiertesten Politikstrategen des Landes, glaubt: Trump wird wiedergewählt werden

Im Video oben seht ihr, warum zudem ein vorzeitiges Ende von Trumps Amtszeit unwahrscheinlich

Was soll man noch schreiben, über einen Mann, der auf jedem Meter derart aneckt, dass die ganze Welt erzittert? Über Donald Trump, der sich mit seinem Rassismus, seiner Kriegstreiberei und seiner Unfähigkeit zu Regieren zum unbeliebtesten US-Präsidenten der Neuzeit gemacht hat?

Doug Sosnik hat diese Frage in einem Artikel für die ""Washington Post"" für sich beantwortet: Er schreibt, dass Donald Trump seine Wiederwahl im Jahr 2020 gelingen wird. Obwohl 56 Prozent der US-Bürger ihn für ungeeignet halten, sein Amt auszuführen. Und obwohl Trumps Beliebtheitswerte am Freitag wieder einmal auf ein Rekordtief fielen.

Sosnik war jahrelang Top-Berater des ehemaligen US-Präsidenten Bill Clinton. Er ist als Politstratege für die Demokratische Partei in den USA tätig.

Laut ihm gibt es gleich vier Gründe, warum Trump sich Hoffnungen auf eine zweite Amtszeit im Weißen Haus machen kann:

Grund 1: Trump braucht keine Mehrheit für den Wahlsieg

Die Mehrheit der US-Amerikaner hat Donald Trump nicht gewählt. Seine Konkurrentin Hillary Clinton hat bei der Wahl drei Millionen Stimmen mehr bekommen als der jetzige US-Präsident.

Trump gewann, weil es bei Wahlen in den USA darum geht, mehr Wahlmänner und -frauen für sich zu gewinnen als der Gegner.

Und das tat Trump. Mit Wahlsiegen in wichtigen Staaten wie Florida, die besonders viele Wahlmandate stellen. Doug Sosnik argumentiert nun: Bei der Wahl im Jahr 2020 könnte Trump auf die gleiche Weise gewinnen. ""Trump weiß, dass die absolute Mehrheit zu gewinnen keine Voraussetzung ist, sondern höchstens ein Anspruch"", schreibt Sosnik.

Tatsächlich seien aber zwei der letzten drei Präsidenten ohne absolute Mehrheit gewählt worden: George W. Bush - und eben Trump.

Grund 2: Die Politikverdrossenheit in den USA hilft Trump

Das Vertrauen in die Politik ist in den USA schwer beschädigt. Nicht nur die Demokraten haben damit zu kämpfen, sondern auch die Republikaner. Donald Trumps Wahlsieg war Ausdruck dieses Frusts, dieser Wut auf das politische Establishment in Washington.

Sosnik schreibt, dass diese Stimmung im Land die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöhe, dass 2020 ein dritter, unabhängiger Kandidat sich um den Posten im Weißen Haus bemühen werde. Außerdem könnten noch weitere Kandidaten vom politischen Rand das Duell von Republikanern und Demokraten stören.

""So ein breites Kandidatenfeld könnte dafür sorgen, dass die Anti-Trump-Front aufgespalten wird"", schreib Sosnik. ""Das würde ihm die Wiederwahl sichern, wenn seine Anhänger gleichzeitig weiter zu ihm halten.""

Grund 3: Trumps Beliebtheit wird unterschätzt

Und danach sieht es aus.

Zwar sehen nur 32 Prozent der US-Bürger Donald laut einer Umfrage der Nachrichtenagentur AP Donald Trumps Präsidentschaft derzeit positiv - doch Sosnik glaubt, dass Erhebungen wie diese Trumps Beliebtheit unterschätzen. So würden die Umfragen alle Wahlberechtigten berücksichtigen. Und nicht nur diejenigen, die tatsächlich als Wähler registriert und gewillt sind, zur Wahl zu gehen.

Hinzu kommt laut Sosnik: ""Viele Wähler wollen einfach nicht offen zugeben, dass sie Trump gewählt haben und unterstützen.""

Grund 4: Der fanatische Kern von Trumps Anhängerschaft

Dem harten Kern von Donald Trumps Anhängerschaft geht das anders. Sie halten eisern und lautstark zu ihrem Präsidenten. Egal, was dieser macht. Sosnik erinnert in diesem Zusammenhang daran, dass Trump einmal im Wahlkampf sagte, er könne mitten auf der Fifth Avenue in Manhattan jemanden erschießen, und seine Fans würden weiter zu ihm halten.

Und noch einer weiteren Gruppe an Anhängern könne der US-Präsident sich gewiss sein: ""Denen, die ihm weiter die Treue halten, weil sie fest davon überzeugt sind, dass er das System in die Luft jagen und echte Veränderungen bewirken wird.""

Sosniks Fazit: In einem gespaltenem Land wird Trump gewinnen

Ob Trump dies gelingen wird, bleibt höchst fraglich. Auf jeden Fall hat der US-Präsident mit einer Rekordfülle an politischen Traditionen in den Vereinigten Staaten gebrochen. Warum sollte er also nicht wiedergewählt werden, obwohl er so unbeliebt ist, wie noch nie ein Präsident zuvor?

Für Sosnik ist klar, dass Trump dies in einem politisch gespaltenem Land gelingen kann. ""Wenn die Demokraten Trump schlagen wollen, müssen sie sich hinter einem Kandidaten vereinen"", schreibt der Wahlkampf-Stratege.

Soll heißen: Einen innerparteilichen Grabenkampf, wie er 2016 zwischen Hillary Clinton und dem Senator Bernie Sanders stattfand, können sich die Demokraten bei der nächsten Wahl nicht erlauben.

Die Demokraten dürfen Trump auf keinen Fall unterschätzen, warnt Sosnik. Er schreibt: ""Es wäre ein Fehler zu glauben, Trump könnte 2020 nicht gewinnen. Genau so, wie es ein Fehler war zu glauben, er würde erst gar nicht Präsident werden.""

Viele Beobachter stilisieren den Konflikt nun zu einer Schlacht um Demokratie und Freiheit

Doch tatsächlich findet in Katalonien ein politischer Machtkampf rigoroser Nationalisten statt

Spaniens Demokratie ist zu jung, als dass sie dem ganzen Land eine gemeinsame Identität geben könnte.

Im Jahr 1975 starb der Diktator Francisco Franco - doch erst sieben Jahre später war der Faschismus in Spanien endgültig besiegt. Seitdem kämpfen die Spanier vor allem mit dem Nationalismus im Land, besonders dem der Regionen.

Bis April diesen Jahres terrorisierte die national-baskische ETA das Land. Nur wenige Monate später begehren nun die Katalanen gegen den spanischen Staat auf und verlangen so laut wie nie ihre Unabhängigkeit.

Die Regierung des konservativen Premiers Mariano Rajoy reagierte brutal - die Bilder spanischer Polizisten, die friedliche Demonstranten blutig schlugen, schockierten zurecht die Welt.

Jetzt wird in vielen internationalen und deutschen Medien von einem Freiheitskampf der Katalanen geschrieben. Von einer Schlacht um die Demokratie.

Ja, es geht im Streit um Kataloniens Unabhängigkeit auch um die Wehrhaftigkeit und Freiheit der spanischen Demokratie. Doch nach wie vor ist der Katalonien-Konflikt vor allem eines: Ein rigoroser Machtkampf zwischen nationalistischen Ideologien.

Das nationalistische Demokratieverständnis der katalanischen Separatisten

Da sind zum einen die katalanischen Separatisten.

Die Regionalregierung des Bundesstaates stellte ihr Unabhängigkeitsreferendum als Ausdruck des Volkswillens und demokratischen Akt dar. Dabei hatte das spanische Verfassungsgericht den Vorgang zuvor als verfassungswidrig eingestuft - eine Einschätzung, die auch die EU-Kommission teilt.

Der Regierung Kataloniens ist das egal: Sie will am Montag die Unabhängigkeit verkünden, nachdem angeblich mehr als 90 Prozent der Katalanen dafür gestimmt hätten.

Laut Günther Maihold, Spanien-Experte der Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, verstehe diese linke Regierung die Unabhängigkeit als Verkörperung der Suche nach Autonomie. ""Sie schreckt dabei auch vor einer Knebelung des regionalen Parlaments in Barcelona nicht zurück"", sagt Maihold der HuffPost.

Demokratie ist in Katalonien also dann erwünscht, wenn sie als direktdemokratisches Scherbengericht nationalistische Bestrebungen fördert. In institutioneller Form - als Verfassungsgericht, Parlament oder internationaler Regierungskörper - wird sie nach dieser Logik zum Instrument der Unterdrückung des Volkes.

Rajoy und die Verteidigung der Nation gegen die Nationalitäten

Diesem katalanischen Nationalismus steht derjenige der spanischen Zentralregierung gegenüber.

In Katalonien selbst hat Spaniens Premier kaum Unterstützer. Nur 8 Prozent der Wähler haben hier bei der letzten Wahl seiner Partido Popular (PP) ihre Stimme gegeben. Im Gegenzug nutzt Rajoy die Katalanen als Steigbügel für seinen Erfolg im Rest des Landes.

Diesen hat der 62-Jährige vor allem durch den spanischen Nationalismus erzielen können, erläutert Politikwissenschaftler Maihold: ""Für Rajoy bedeutet ein Nachgeben in seinem Anti-Katalanismus mögliche Verluste in der starken Position, die er als Vertreter von Rest-Spanien einnimmt.""

Der Premier braucht also den starken Zentralstaat, um seine Macht in Spanien zu sichern. Für Rajoy und die PP geht es laut Maihold um nichts Geringeres als ""die Verteidigung der Nation gegen die Nationalitäten.""

Der Nationalismus regiert, die Demokratie verliert

Für das aggressive und brutale Vorgehen Rajoys gegen die katalanischen Demonstranten ist das keine Entschuldigung. Doch der Nationalismus des Premiers ist eine Erklärung für seine harte Gangart gegen die katalanische Regionalregierung.

Diese besteht aus einem Bündnis der progressiven Liste Junts pel Sí und der anarchistisch ausgerichteten Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CUP). ""Diese beiden Kräfte führen die jetzige Unabhängigkeitskampagne nach Maximen von Extrempositionen und Mobilisierung durch Konfrontation"", sagt Experte Maihold.

Deren Höhepunkt ist in Katalonien nun erreicht. Der Dialog zwischen den Konfliktparteien ist endgültig gescheitert. Populismus, Anfeindungen und nun auch Gewalt bestimmen die Lage.

In Katalonien wie in Spanien gilt nun eine neue Ordnung: Der Nationalismus regiert - und die Demokratie verliert.

Ein guter Notendurchschnitt auf dem Weg zum Arzt reicht leider nicht aus, es muss schon ein sehr guter Schnitt sein. Aber damit könnte es bald vorbei sein, denn der Numerus clausus, kurz NC, kommt auf den Prüfstand. Nach einem Bericht der „BZ"", befasst sich das Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe ab dem 4. Oktober mit dem NC.

Nicht mit dem Grundgesetz zu vereinbaren

Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte das Verwaltungsgericht in Gelsenkirchen. Die dortigen Richter bezweifeln, dass sich der NC mit dem Grundgesetz vereinbaren lässt. Wer heute Medizin studieren möchte, der muss unter Umständen sehr lange auf einen Studienplatz warten. Für die Vergabe der begehrten Plätze gibt es ein sogenanntes Quotensystem. Rund ein Fünftel der Studienplätze geht an diejenigen, die die besten Noten im Abitur haben. Dann folgt ein weiteres Fünftel, das auf die Warteliste kommt und für die übrigen Plätze hat jede Universität ein eigenes Auswahlverfahren. Wer Pech hat, der muss bis zu 15 Semester auf einen Studienplatz warten.

Hart umkämpft

Besonders der Bereich Humanmedizin ist sehr hart umkämpft. Alleine für das Wintersemester 2017/2018 gibt es mehr als 43.000 Anwärter, aber nur 9000 Studienplätze. Die Entscheidung der Richter in Gelsenkirchen wird mit der Tatsache begründet, dass die Noten im Abitur bundesweit nicht miteinander vergleichbar sind. Daher sollte es eine Landesquote geben. Die Noten spielen nach Ansicht der Richter zudem eine viel zu große Rolle. Bereits in den 1970er Jahren hat sich das Bundesverfassungsgericht schon einmal mit dem NC beschäftigt. Damals entwickelte das Gericht bestimmte Kriterien für die Vergabe der Studienplätze. Jetzt stellt sich die Frage, ob es in der Rechtsprechung eine Weiterentwicklung geben muss.

Ärzte dringend gesucht

Rar sind in Deutschland vor allem Ärzte, die auf dem Land arbeiten möchten. In den weniger dicht besiedelten Regionen arbeiten Landärzte nicht selten weiter über das Rentenalter hinaus, weil sie keinen Nachfolger finden. Die Abschaffung des Numerus clausus könnte ein erster Schritt sein, um die Situation zu entspannen. Befürworter sehen zudem die Chance, dass auch denjenigen der Weg zu einem Medizinstudium geebnet wird, die keine vermögenden Eltern haben. Viele, die aus einem vermögenden Elternhaus kommen, wollen nicht auf den Studienplatz in Deutschland warten. Sie gehen nach Osteuropa, denn dort gibt es keine Wartezeiten an den Universitäten, allerdings kostet das Studium dort mehr als 10.000 Euro pro Jahr.

The Roaring Lion And The Dutiful Public Servant: Johnson And May's Wildly Different Views Of Brexit Britain In her speech, Theresa May said that ""the Tories must win the battle of ideas again."" But perhaps it is not only the Tories that must win the battle of ideas within the nation, but within their own party. For in this moment, these two competing ideas of post-Brexit Britain, the lion and the servant cannot sustain the standoff. Lions often eat unaware but dutiful servants and dutiful servants, often kill lions. Before the current prime minister can carry out her vision of dutifully serving the nation, she needs to win the battle of ideas within her own party. PhD student, Queen Mary University of London

The Ego Has Landed For all the sound and fury, insiders say Boris has agreed he won't argue for time limit on the transition period, and crucially won't oppose the UK continuing to pay for access to the EU single market in a transition. What his critics saw as an ego-trip, but allies saw as valuable restoration of Cabinet consultation, looks to have abated. And Boris won't be quitting, because he will be joining David Davis and Philip Hammond in the audience in Florence. Executive Editor, Politics, HuffPost UK

Leavers Like Boris Johnson Harm Their Brexit Cause More Than Its Critics For all the many attacks on Brexit sceptics for how they talk down Britain's potential, this very public spat at the heart of government is even worse for weakening the government's already poor hand.

Theresa May's Plans For Britain's Brexit Look Increasingly Like The Status Quo - But Worse Leave supporters will be least impressed of all. One by one virtually every promise made by Vote Leave looks set to be broken except for the vow to leave the EU.

We're On The Offensive, And Boris Johnson's Constituency Is Firmly In Our Sights The case against Boris Johnson is very clear. Here is a man who was sacked for lying twice: once by a newspaper editor, another by his party leader. He opportunistically backed Brexit only because he felt it would further his political career. He recently had perhaps the most humiliating carcrash interview of any Cabinet minister in recent history. And as Foreign Secretary, he is reducing this great country to an international laughing stock. Guardian columnist and author

Democracy In The Time Of Brexit There are few things as important to our society, and our nation, as democracy.

Du kennst meinen Namen, aber nicht meine Geschichte. Das galt auch für die Rettungssanitäter und den Polizeibeamten, welche mich an einem warmen Sommerabend in die Notfallambulanz begleiteten.

Diagnose: F33.3

(Rezidivierende depressive Störung, gegenwärtig schwere Episode mit psychotischen Symptomen)

Die Schnittwunden am Unterarm bluteten und ich hatte die Befürchtung, dass ich an meinen Tränen ersticken könnte. Ich versuchte, mich zu beruhigen, doch es gelang mir nicht. Jeder Versuch, mich zu beschwichtigen, führte dazu, dass ich panisch nach Luft schnappte und das Weinen immer intensiver wurde. Ich spürte nun sehr deutlich, dass ich ohne Hilfe diesen Abend nicht überleben würde. Es fühlte sich wahrhaftig so an, als hätte ich den Verstand verloren. Als ob mich jeglicher gesunder Menschenverstand verlassen hätte und ich mir selbst - ohne himmlischen Beistand - überlassen sein würde.



Amnesie

Im Rettungswagen stellten mir die Einsatzkräfte noch viele weitere Fragen. Manche davon grenzten auch an Ironie. „Begleiten Sie gegenwertig suizidale Gedanken und wie geht es Ihnen?"", wurde ich mehrfach gefragt. Da meine Situation für Sarkasmus keinen Raum bot, sparte ich mir hierauf die Antworten. In der Notfallambulanz der Klinik für Psychiatrie angekommen, wurde ich von sehr freundlichem Personal begrüßt und an die diensthabende Assistenzärztin übergeben. Nach einer kurzen Anamnese wurde entschieden, dass ein Aufenthalt auf der geschützten Station der Psychiatrie ratsam wäre. Was diese Entscheidung für mich bedeutete, realisierte ich zunächst überhaupt nicht.

Zwei Pfleger des Krankenhauses baten mich, mich auf das freiliegende Bett vor mir zu legen. „Wir wechseln nun das Stockwerk"", hieß es. Kaum hatte ich mich hingelegt, fühlte es sich an, als ob sich die Gänge drehen würden. Dieses grelle Licht, dieser unverkennbare Klang der Automatiktüren, und dieser latente Gestank von Desinfektionsmittel gaben mir zusätzlich den Rest. Sie rollten mich mit meinem Bett durch die Gänge und hielten vor einer breiten, weißen Tür. Ich wurde gebeten aufzustehen und mich meiner Kleidung zu entledigen. Im Gegensatz überreichten sie mir ein Patientenhemd mit dezentem Muster. Es wurde sichergestellt, dass ich keine Gegenstände mit mir führte, mit denen ich mich hätte verletzen können.

Nun öffneten die Pfleger die geheimnisvolle breite, weiße Tür und schoben mich, samt meinem Bett in das Zimmer. Der Raum wirkte kühl und steril. Auf der rechten oberen Seite befand sich eine Videokamera. Ich war zu erschöpft, um noch weitere Eindrücke aufzunehmen, denn inzwischen war bereits ein neuer Morgen angebrochen.

Ich habe nur sehr wenige Stunden schlafen können, als mich um neun Uhr morgens der diensthabende Stationsarzt begrüßte. Auch er stellte mir Fragen zu meinem Wohlbefinden, meinen psychotischen Gedanken und zu meinen suizidalen Absichten.

Ich erinnere mich wie gestern: Ich blickte diesem Arzt nur fragend in die Augen, schüttelte mit dem Kopf und sagte nur „Ich verstehe nicht"".

Einmal Hölle und zurück - ich erzähl dir meine Geschichte.

This proposed tax is part of his larger plan to ""urgently manage"" the evolution of robotics and technology for the sake of society. And, while this may seem like a daring statement, it's not exactly the first time it's been proposed. A handful of other leaders around the globe, including Bill Gates and the South Korean government, have quite recently raised similar points. But when broken down, is this hostility towards the evolution of technology really warranted?

Modern Fear

It's no secret that the media has had a huge part to play in the current state of automation. Since the first mention of robots hit the 24-hour news cycle, hundreds of articles have warned of a robotic takeover and an impending meltdown of society. What's usually left out of these articles, however, is the thorough research highlighting the benefits robotics and automation have on society. For example, it has been found that use of robots within manufacturing has increased labour productivity by 0.36%. While that may sound insignificant, it's key to point out that 0.36% accounts for 16% of total productivity growth between 1992 and 2007. And while robotisation has traditionally been adopted by financial and manufacturing sectors, its contribution is not limited to these particular verticals. For example, a report by London's Centre for Economic Research shows that contrary to popular belief, robots have been a huge driver of productivity and economic growth within most markets. This is due to the fact that robots have been able to successful integrate within a number of professions, eliminating the costs, risks and wasted time associated with manual tasks. Yet robots still seem to be the victim of fear mongering rhetoric within the media, mainly due to one particular topic--the dissolution of jobs.

The Question of Employment

There is no denying that with the introduction of robots comes a slight shift in the overall employment landscape. With that said, it's unfair to suggest that automation will be the be all and end all of the job market. As a society, we've been through this before. When the Industrial Revolution occurred, the entire job market went into a frenzy, leaving about half of workers wondering what to do next. But with time came great change. The job market rapidly began to evolve in conjunction with technology, resulting in the creation of jobs that had never even existed before.

While it's difficult to predict the exact outcome, it seems as if history is due to repeat itself. Britain's unemployment rate is currently at a 42-year low, showing that regardless of the increase in automation, jobs seem to be largely unaffected. Luckily, this seems to be a direct representation of the future. According to a recent report by PWC, it's predicted that AI and robotics will both create new jobs, specifically in the digital technology area. These new jobs will generate additional wealth and spending that will then support additional jobs of existing kinds, primarily in sectors that are historically harder to automate.

Arguing Against Robot Tax

In comparison to other leading nations, the U.K unfortunately still slightly lags behind when it comes to robotisation and AI. And while this may be due to our modern fear of the robotic revolution, it's ultimately a dangerous game to play. In order to stay competitive within the global economy, it's extremely important to put an emphasis on the future of technology and innovation. Instead of shying away from what we're uncomfortable with, we should be focusing on where to go next.

Continuous innovation is an essential part of a robust economy. Yes, without a doubt, technology will shift our lives as we know it today. But, why should we approach this change with fear? Measures such as a ""Robot Tax"" are nothing more than a step backwards when it comes to productivity and the overall well-being of society. As a forward thinking society, we have a huge amount of opportunity to utilise this innovative technology to create positive change, not only when it comes to supporting the economy, but to create new channels for society that we may not reach otherwise.",Rethinking The Robot Tax,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/neil-kinson/rethinking-the-robot-tax_b_18192200.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Speaking to Perth's 6PR radio station, the backbench MP from the Sydney seat of Hughes said that there were ""elements of the Portuguese model that we should look at very closely here in Australia"".

Portugal decriminalised the possession of all drugs for personal use 16 years ago in an ambitious policy that was complemented by the allocation of greater resources to expanding and improving programmes aimed not only at prevention but also treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration.

""So say for example it might be cocaine -- if you possess under what they classify as 10 days supply for an addict, instead of going to jail you are sent to a drug dissuasion commission,"" Kelly said.

Portugal decriminalised the possession of drugs for personal use in 2001.

""And if you are an addict you are put into a treatment, if you are a recreational user you are fined and you are given all the help to try and dissuade you from continuing to use drugs.""

Writing for HuffPost Australia earlier this year Gino Vumbaca -- president and co-founder of Harm Reduction Australia -- highlighted that the harmful impacts of Australia's current drug laws have led to greater risks of HIV and other blood borne viruses, higher incarceration rates and a range of health and social problems.

""Contrary to the initial fears of some, the results [in Portugal] have been reduced drug use, reduced overdose fatalities, reduced incarceration and a range of other positive outcomes,"" he wrote.

Kelly said that despite having always thought that ""we can't show any weakness"" in regards to drugs, ""we are simply not going to arrest ourselves out of this problem"".

I didn't expect to feel anything other than complete and utter joyful anticipation to my first daughter's marriage. Yet here I am, surprisingly emotionally divided, which has been troubling me to no end.

These conflicting emotions have had me spending a great deal of time asking: ""What's wrong with me? What sort of mother isn't jumping for joy, busting at the seams to marry their firstborn child?"" These thoughts then have me spiralling into a pit of motherly despair, and my inner dialogue questioning devotion to my daughter and whether I'm a good mother or not.

All of this is incredibly upsetting and unsettling to say the least. So rather than just wallow in these terrible feelings that I've been battling, I decided to take control of the situation and committed myself to addressing these emotions. In order to do this, I found that I've been spending the months leading up to her nuptials reflecting and keeping my social engagements to a minimum.

What I'm feeling has nothing to do with NOT being happy for her; rather, it is my own mortality.

Doing so has allowed me to inject some quiet into my life and my soul so that I can:

Thoroughly enjoy the final weeks leading up to her tying the knot; Sort myself out so that when the time comes for the festivities of my two other daughters getting married, I don't battle with the same emotions; Finally, be happy! Who wants to be blue during a time of celebration of new love? Not me.

What I have uncovered during my months of self-reflection is that the root of what I'm feeling has nothing to do with NOT being happy for her; rather, it is my own mortality. I'm no longer in my 20s (which I obviously already knew), but there is something about taking the first step with an adult child and final steps with a youngest child — who's graduating university this year — that really brings this one fact into sharp focus: their lives are just beginning and mine, in many ways, is winding down.

In reality, I know that her marriage isn't the end of my youth, or my life as I know it. I know that her embarking on this new and exciting phase of her life is not reflection of my life needing to ""slow down"" or become ""less invigorating or exciting"" for me and my husband. I KNOW this, but I didn't FEEL it. The mind is an amazing thing; if we're not paying attention, it has the ability to take a truly magical time in our lives and make us turn inward, causing us to miss beautiful experiences that are right before our eyes.

Their new beginning is in no way, shape or form taking away from your ability to embark on some new and exciting journeys of your own.

I am incredibly thankful that I caught myself before it was too late. I'm relieved that I've put my mind and my heart right while I still have time to enjoy all the excitement, adventure and happiness leading up to her wedding day. It would have broken my heart, not only as mother of the bride, but also as her matron of honour, to have missed everything because I was more focused on what was going on with me than what is happening for her.

If you're a MOB who is struggling with feeling ""not right"" leading up to your child's wedding, I suggest you do as I did and take some quiet time to ask yourself what you're feeling and why. Hopefully you will discover, as I did, that you truly are happy for your child and this incredible time of their lives. And maybe you just need to let yourself know that their new beginning is in no way, shape or form taking away from your ability to embark on some new and exciting journeys of your own. Now is as good a time as ever to dust of your bucket list and start ticking some of the items off!

Russland-Experte Boris Reitschuster schreibt ihm zu seinem Ehrentag einen Brief - mit 10 ungewöhnlichen Geburtstagswünschen

Lieber Wladimir Wladimirowitsch,

ich kenne Sie seit mehr als anderthalb Jahrzehnten persönlich; noch länger verfolge ich Ihr Wirken, habe mehrere Bücher darüber geschrieben.

Zu Ihrem heutigen 65. Geburtstag möchte ich Ihnen diese 10 Wünsche mit auf den Weg geben:

1. Dass Sie den Kontakt zur Realität wiederfinden

Macht macht selbst in demokratischen Ländern einsam. Absolute Macht, wie Sie sie haben, koppelt einen von der Wirklichkeit ab.

In Ihrer Umgebung traut sich niemand mehr, Ihnen unangenehme Wahrheiten zu sagen.

Etwa, dass Ihr Auftritt als Sänger und Pianist vor laufenden Kameras nur peinlich war.

Sie erklären Ihren Vertrauten morgens die Welt, die erklären die Welt dann genau so den Chefredakteuren – und abends sehen Sie im Fernsehen genau die Welt, die Sie am Morgen selbst entworfen haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie die Stärke finden, kritische Stimmen nicht mehr zu unterdrücken.

Das wäre zumindest ein erster Schritt.

Für eine grundlegende Rückkehr zur Realität, die ich Ihnen von Herzen wünsche, wäre allerdings die Erfüllung meines zweiten Wunsches notwendig.

Mit 65 Jahren sind sie bereits fünf Jahre über dem Renteneintrittsalter von russischen Männern, und auch wenn Sie Deutscher wären, dürften Sie jetzt bald mit dem Arbeiten aufhören.

2. Ich wünsche Ihnen: Gehen Sie in den Ruhestand

Fast 18 Jahre lange ein und dieselbe Arbeit zu machen, ist auch für weniger qualifizierte Jobs wie Arzt oder Professor ein langer Zeitraum; 18 Jahre an der Spitze Russlands ist für sie als Regierender sicher ebenso ermüdend wie für die Regierten.

Sie haben einmal gesagt, sie würden so hart arbeiten wie ein Sklave auf einer Galeere. Wählen Sie die Freiheit, schmeißen sie ihr Ruder weg!

Sie legen damit nicht nur die Einsamkeit der Macht ab.

Sie lassen immer verbreiten: Russland ist umzingelt, und meinen damit die NATO. In Wirklichkeit sind Sie umzingelt. Von Schönrednern und Claqueuren.

Befreien Sie sich!

3. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie endlich Ihre KGB-Brille ablegen können

Sie haben beim Geheimdienst gelernt, die Welt klar in Schwarz und Weiß zu teilen, in Freund und Feind.

KGB-Offiziere im mittleren Dienst wie Sie wurden darauf abgerichtet, überall Verschwörungen und Verrat, Provokationen und Angriffe zu wittern.

Viele Ihrer weltgewandteren Kameraden haben das abgelegt.

Ihre Politik zeigt, dass Sie bis heute in diesem Denken verfangen sind.

Die russischen Medien, die Sie steuern, lassen den Menschen ständig eintrichtern, die NATO plane einen Überfall auf Russland.

Ich fürchte, dass Sie selbst inzwischen daran glauben. An Ihre eigene Propaganda.

Wenn man überall Verrat, Provokation und Aggression wittert, muss das Leben eine Hölle sein.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie sich aus dieser Hölle befreien.

Russland ist nicht von Feinden umzingelt.

Die NATO plant keinen Angriff auf Ihr Land.

Wir wollen Partnerschaft mit Russland – nur tun wir uns schwer damit, solange Sie Nachbarländer überfallen und Ihre Kritiker gewaltsam ums Leben kommen.

4. Ich wünsche Ihnen ehrliche und freie Wahlen

Niemand zweifelt daran, dass Sie im Frühjahr zum vierten Mal zum russischen Präsident gewählt werden, mit einem überwältigenden Ergebnis.

Jeder, der Russland auch nur halbwegs kennt, ist sich bewusst, dass diese Wahlen massiv manipuliert werden.

Weil Sie Ihre Gegner gar nicht zur Wahl zulassen, sie in den Medien mit Schmutz bewerfen, statt sie zu Wort kommen zu lassen, weil Sie in und um die Wahllokale massiv und dreist betrügen.

So ein Wahlsieg muss so befriedigend sein wie ein Boxkampf, in dem der Sieger seinen Gegner vorab knebeln und auf den Boden fesseln lässt.

Ich wünsche Ihnen den Mut, eine echte Wahl zuzulassen.

Sie würden dann erfahren, was die Menschen wirklich von Ihnen denken.

Und egal, wie die Wahl ausgeht - sie könnten in jedem Fall stolz sein: Auf einen Sieg, der er ehrlich wäre. Und sogar auf eine Niederlage könnten sie stolz sein, weil Sie die Größe gehabt hätten, diese zu riskieren.

5. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie keine Angst mehr haben vor Ihren politischen Konkurrenten

Gerade hat ein Moskauer Gericht wieder in einem peinlichen Schauprozess Ihren bekanntesten Kritiker, Alexej Nawalnij, für 20 Tage einsperren lassen.

Zum wiederholten Male.

Selbst Ihre Marionette Dmitrij Medwedew hat, als er pro forma für Sie Präsident war, zugegeben, dass in Russland""Telefonjustiz"" herrscht – also Gerichtsurteile per Telefon von ganz oben an die Richter diktiert werden.

Es ist deshalb klar, dass auch Sie für das Urteil gegen Nawalnij Verantwortung tragen. Ebenso dafür, dass sein Bruder, der drei kleine Kinder hat, seit Jahren unschuldig in Haft sitzt – de facto als Geisel.

Sehr viele Menschen sitzen in Russland im Straflager, weil Sie gegen Sie sind.

Wer seine Gegner wegsperren lässt, muss große Angst haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie diese Angst besiegen.

Nicht nur Ihre Gegner werden dann frei sein – auch Sie werden sich freier fühlen.

6. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie im 21. Jahrhundert ankommen. Oder zumindest im 17. Jahrhundert

Ihr politisches Denken ist nicht mal in den Zeiten Bismarcks verhaftet – die Grundlagen für die Souveränität von Nationalstaaten wurden bereits 1648 mit dem Westfälischen Frieden gelegt.

Sie hingegen glauben immer noch, dass Russlands Nachbarländer wie kleine Kinder nicht ganz erwachsen sind und Sie über deren Schicksal mitbestimmen müssen.

Sie sind deshalb in diesen Ländern verhasst wie kaum ein anderer Politiker.

Lassen Sie diese Länder in Ruhe.

Akzeptieren Sie, dass nicht Sie, sondern die Menschen in diesen Ländern selbst über ihre Leben und ihr Schicksal entscheiden dürfen.

Ich zweifle, ob die Menschen dort wirklich dankbar sein werden, wenn Sie sie endlich in Ruhe lassen – dafür haben sie zu viel Angst dort ausgelöst, und zu viele Menschen sind gestorben.

Aber zumindest der Hass gegen Sie würde nachlassen.

Und weniger gehasst zu werden, sollte befreiend wirken.

7. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie Ihre Sowjetnostalgie ablegen. Sie ist schlecht für Sie und für Ihr Land

Sie haben den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion als die größte geopolitische Tragödie des 21. Jahrhunderts bezeichnet.

Unter Ihnen ist es in Russland zu einer Stalin-Nostalgie gekommen. Der grausame Massenmörder wird heute wieder gefeiert. Sie lassen Seine Verbrechen relativieren und seine angeblichen Verdienste preisen.

Sie stehen in der sowjetischen Denk-Tradition, wonach der Staat alles und der Mensch nichts ist.

Solange Russland diese Denkweise nicht ablegt, solange Stalin verehrt wird, hat Russland keine Zukunft. So treten Sie und Ihr großartiges Land immer wieder auf die alten Mistgabeln.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie verstehen, dass Russlands Zukunft nicht darin besteht, dass die Nachbarländer es fürchten.

Russland hat eine große Zukunft, wenn die Nachbarn es beneiden.

Wenn die Menschen nicht auf Russlands Bedrohungspotential stolz sind, sondern Stolz sein könnten auf eine funktionierende Gesundheitsversorgung, auf würdige Renten, funktionierende Gesetze und eine erfolgreiche Bekämpfung von Korruption und Willkür.

8. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie in die Geschichtsbücher nicht nur als Krieger eingehen

Sie sind für den Krieg in der Ostukraine verantwortlich, der mehr als 10.000 Menschen das Leben kostete und noch heute fast täglich Opfer fordert.

Die Truppen von Ihnen und Ihrem Verbündeten Assad haben massive Kriegsverbrechen in Syrien begangen.

Sie tragen die politische Verantwortung für den Abschuss des Fluges MH-17 über der Ostukraine mit fast 300 Toten und für die Ermordung des Ex-KGB-Agenten Alexander Litwinenko in London 2006 mit radioaktivem Polonium, wie niederländische Ermittler und ein britischer Richter feststellten.

Die Liste ließe sich lange fortsetzen.

Machen Sie sich ein Geburtstagsgeschenk, indem sie den blutigen Krieg in der Ukraine beenden. Sie müssen dazu nur die Grenzen dichtmachen und aufhören, aus Russland Waffen und Geld an Ihre Befehlsempfänger zu liefern, die Sie als ""pro-russische Rebellen"" ausgeben.

Vielleicht haben Sie Angst, dass Frieden statt Krieg zu beginnen Sie schwächer dastehen lässt.

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie das verstehen.

9. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie nicht nur als Spitze der russischen Korruptions-Pyramide in die Geschichte eingehen – sondern als jemand, der auch einen Teil seines Geldes zurückgibt

Sie müssen ja nicht gleich Robin Hood sein.

Enge Vertraute von Ihnen brachten es auf dubiose Weise zu unvorstellbaren Milliardenvermögen, seit Sie an der Macht sind.

Ihre Kritiker bezeichnen Sie als reichsten Mann der Welt, weil sie sagen, dass Sie auf dieses Geld Zugriff haben.

Geben ist seliger als Nehmen, sagt ein deutsches Sprichwort.

In Russland leben Millionen Menschen in bitterer Armut; viele können sich nicht vollwertig satt essen, vielen fehlt das Geld für dringend benötigte Operationen.

Sagen Sie Ihren Freunden, dass Sie – als Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie, statt Yachten und goldenen Toiletten für Ihre Flugzeuge – zumindest einen Teil Ihrer Milliarden den Menschen in Russland zurückgeben sollen.

Die Dankbarkeit der Menschen wird ein schönes Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie werden.

10. Ich wünsche Ihnen echte Freunde

Nicht solche wie Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder, deren angebliche Freundschaft mit Ihnen einen schalen Beigeschmack hat, weil er von Ihnen – über den Umweg Ihrer Konzerne – Unsummen an Geld verdient.

Genauso wie so viele Ihrer anderen Kumpels, die zu Milliardären wurden, beruhen solche Beziehungen auf Abhängigkeiten – und nicht auf Freundschaft.

Ich wünsche Ihnen Menschen, die kein Geld von Ihnen wollen, keine Macht, keine Posten – sondern die Sie um Ihrer selbst willen wollen.

OPP in charge of internal investigation

Ontario's Special Investigations Unit was called in, as is protocol any time there's an allegation of sexual assault or a person is seriously injured or killed when dealing with police in the province.

The internal investigation was turned over to the OPP from Waterloo Regional Police.

""We have the utmost confidence in our own members to conduct the investigation, but felt that — due to the circumstances — from an accountability and a transparency perspective an outside agency would better suited,"" Insp. Michael Haffner said to CBC News.

The worst-kept secret in the Sikh community is the grudge between hardliners and moderates.","It may go down as the world's easiest question for a young, charismatic party leader. All he had to do was answer it.

Newly crowned NDP leader Jagmeet Singh did not do himself any favours when he seemingly refused to disavow supporters of the alleged Sikh terrorist widely believed to be responsible for the largest terrorist attack in Canadian history.

He also managed to sound frustratingly similar to one U.S. President Donald Trump.

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

It was a softball question. Veteran journalist Terry Milewski repeatedly asked Singh to condemn those who praise Talwinder Singh Parmar, the architect of the Air India Bombing that killed 329 people, including 286 Canadians. Singh evaded the question three times, deflecting to the historical and present-day strife between Sikhs, Hindus and the government of India.

But for some reason he just couldn't bring himself to condemn Parmar by name or condemn those who hang posters of this martyr, and some Canadians are understandably wondering why.

Singh now seems incapable of saying things that will upset a segment of the very people who helped him attain power.

After all, what is the difference between President Trump not being able to directly denounce the KKK and Singh's inability to denounce supporters of an alleged Sikh terrorist? I submit that there is no difference, as Singh now seems incapable of saying things that will upset a segment of the very people who helped him attain power.

Before I unpack this theory, it would be prudent to explore how Singh was chosen as leader of the NDP, a party not known for resonating across the country (with the obvious exception of Jack Layton in 2011). Singh worked tirelessly, signing up 47,000 new party members, helping to triple the overall memberships of the party. Part of his overall support came directly from the Sikh communities in Brampton and other places in Ontario, and while that speaks well for inclusiveness and diversity, it also means Singh wants his community to appear united. The best way to spotlight unity is to make sure you do not alienate anybody, including a small, old-fashioned group of hardliners who still hold extremist views.

Talwinder Singh Parmar, left.

Singh's habit of subliminally ingratiating himself towards small groups of hardliners is not new, by the way. In 2012, when Singh was an Ontario MPP, he openly called for the Canadian government to pressure India into sparing the life of Balwant Singh Rajoana, a convicted Sikh terrorist and the chief architect of a suicide bombing that claimed the lives of 18 people, including a Punjab chief minister. Singh even suggested Ontario use its trade relationship with India as leverage to force India into sparing Rajoana's life. Singh said his motivation was his opposition to the death penalty, but the optics were clear: Singh was, as he is now, cognizant of the complex generational sensitivities within the Sikh community. He, like other Sikh politicians, seems determined not to inflame tensions, even if by doing so he appears to be sympathizing with convicted terrorists.

At the time, like he did with Milewski, Singh refused to answer direct questions about whether he thought a man who had used terrorism to kill civilians was, in fact, a terrorist. This means that even in 2012, Singh's loyalty to not stirring Sikh tensions was more important than being principled enough to denounce people responsible for killing the innocent.

Not a good look. Not even close.

This is a self-inflicted wound, a gaffe that could haunt Singh for years to come.

Let's be clear — Jagmeet Singh seems like a nice guy, and there is zero evidence to suggest he personally supports any form of terrorism or violence as a political tool. But this tendency to submit to a fear of sectarian strife within the Sikh community is an outdated strategy. It is one thing to not want to sow divisions among your own people; it is quite another to do so while leading a national party.

To some, asking a Sikh politician to denounce the supporters of an alleged Sikh terrorist seems like a loaded question, but evading the question actually worked to legitimize it. Knowing there are still extremists in Canada who sympathize with the Air India bombers while not taking the opportunity to disown them is not just a missed opportunity, it is a fundamental failure of leadership.

Activists during a protest against the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana in Amritsar, India on March 27, 2012.

This is a self-inflicted wound, a gaffe that could haunt Singh for years to come. The worst-kept secret in the Sikh community is the grudge between hardliners and moderates. With more than 300,000 Sikhs in Canada, the existence of extremism, while much lower than in decades past, is still an issue that lays quietly below the surface.

Jagmeet Singh not only has the charisma to rise above those divisions, he now has the responsibility to show all of Canada that religious grudges are best solved through direct condemnation of the terrorist who helped carve those divisions in the first place.

“It is quite outrageous that he has been held in the country for so long already. This is another example of how vulnerable tourists are to arrest and detention in Dubai and at how drawn out and disorganised legal proceedings are.”

From the recently launched Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Suraksha Yojana to the repeated invocation of the Gandhian dedication to cleanliness as a pioneering thought for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government has time and again found ways to incorporate Mahatma Gandhi's name into their agenda and programs. But just how strong this loyalty to the Mahatma's core values and legacy by the cultural organisation behind the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has historically been, merits a little more investigation.

The one term synonymous to Gandhi, globally, is that of peace or 'ahimsa', that he dedicated his life to propagating, and sustained, even in the face of immense political volatility and conflict. At the helm of Independence, and at the peak of violence, Gandhi displaying his characteristic fearlessness moved into a deserted Muslim home in one of the worst affected quarters of Calcutta, and decided to start a fast in response to the violent. This sort of political resistance is precisely what Gandhi's legacy stands for, and is, in fact, a far cry from what the RSS and all its adherent organisations have ever subscribed to. One doesn't even need to dig too deep into the archives of history to locate this fundamental difference, for, even today, the Sangh's mission statement emphasizes how Dr Hedgewar, one of the founders of the organisation, spent ""every ounce of his energy for the realisation of one all-consuming dream of seeing the Hindu Nation become invincibly powerful.""

Needlessly to say this statement exemplifies the fundamental difference between the political attitude and ideology between the two ideologies. Understanding the inevitably of conflict during Partition, Gandhi chose to unambiguously focus on the importance of Hindu-Muslim unity within India, instead of focusing on the Partition. While addressing a political rally in Delhi in 1947, Gandhi said, ""this culture of Delhi, belongs to the Hindus and Muslims and not exclusively to either.""

Keeping in mind the rich complexity of Indian culture and its demographic, Gandhi derived his ideals of what sort of secularism could exist in India.

It is important to mention, however, that religion by itself was not unimportant to Gandhi. On the contrary, it was vital to his identity as an intellectual, thinker and a leader. Yet, as much as he valued religion, and his own identity as a Hindu, Gandhi understood and emphasized that the only way India could survive and progress as one nation was if it based itself on secular principles, and embraced its diversity as a whole. In a discourse at his ashram in 1938, before the violence of the Partition descended, Gandhi saw it important to make this distinction, foreseeing the potential for chaos that religious discrimination bore. He clarified his own distinction between the idea of the role Religion could play in State affairs,

""I swear by my religion. I will die for it. But it is my personal affair. The state has nothing to do with it. The state would look after your secular welfare, health, currency and so on, but not your or my religion. That is everybody's personal affair.""

Keeping in mind the rich complexity of Indian culture and its demographic, Gandhi derived his ideals of what sort of secularism could exist in India. In contrast to the Western conceptualisation of secularism, where in some ways the word 'secular' is used as a contrast to the word 'religious', Gandhi was of the view that the religiosity of our society was its greatest strength and strongest part of our value system. It was with these very ideals that he led the nation to freedom, combining the seemingly theoretical concepts of Ahimsa and Satyagraha, Gandhi mobilised the population of pre-Independence India to claim their freedom.

Gandhi's opinions of keeping religion separate from the State were vehemently opposed by RSS leaders of the time, who criticised the Constitution for not emulating any ideas from the Manusmriti.

He channelised the potency of these concepts and made the simplest of acts radical and impactful. The Dandi March initiated by Gandhi is one of the greatest examples in history of how tyranny can be resisted in the most intelligent and peaceful ways.

It was almost as if Gandhi knew that the freedom struggle was just a sign of all the turbulence that was to follow during the actual process of nation-building. After Independence, India was not only facing the duress of Partition but also found itself at the most defining moment a nation can find itself in, the framing of the Constitution.

During this time, Gandhi's stand on religious incorporation of any kind into the Constitution was unflinching. In sharp contrast to this, existed the RSS's views on what the Indian Constitution should be. While the final draft of the Constitution effectively resisted all attempts to outlaw conversions, Gandhi's opinions of keeping religion separate from the State were vehemently opposed by RSS leaders of the time, who criticised the Constitution for not emulating any ideas from the Manusmriti.

There is a grammar of non-violence written into our Constitution today which is an echo of the Gandhian legacy of Ahimsa that shaped not just the Independence movement but also the democratic character of our nation. It finds itself in an increasingly precarious position today.

Article 25 of the Indian Constitution granting us, 'Freedom of conscience, free profession, practise and propagation of religion' is a result of the resolve of the leaders of the time who agreed with this idea of disallowing religious interference.

The debate over citizenship rights, an issue that has sparked much debate recently, had incidentally come up between Gandhi and RSS leader Savarkar back in 1923, when Savarkar in a pamphlet defining the RSS ideology of Hindutva announced that India only belongs to the people who were born here and can call it their 'pitrabhoomi (fatherland)'. Gandhi had then categorically stated that ""If Hindus felt that in India there was no place for anyone to live but Hindus, they would be destroying the very principles of Hinduism,"" reiterating how crucial it was to assume a secular character. The widely debated Citizenship Amendment Bill which at first glance seems like a noble humanitarian effort to help persecuted minorities is limited strictly to Hindus and excludes all minorities. The idea of India offering citizenship based on religious predilections is unconstitutional in its very demand today, but if the RSS leaders were to have their way, it could have found its way into our constitution.

The RSS in its core began as a unit to defend Hindu culture from what it identified as 'threats'.

The birth of RSS, if we were to historically trace it, was a form of cultural reorganisation launched largely in response to perceived threats by external agents like Christian missionaries, Muslim minorities, and Communist movements. In his book, while introducing the new concept of Hindutva, Savarkar defined 'three pillars' of a 'Hindu Nation: a common holy ground, a common blood and a common culture'. Inspired by this, K.B Hedgewar created the RSS with initial motives to serve as a volunteer force for the Hindus of the British India. The RSS in its core began as a unit to defend Hindu culture from what it identified as 'threats'. This is also a key reason for the sharply militant character of the RSS as an organisation.

While the archives of history are rife with testimonies and articles chronicling the triumphs as well as failures of Gandhi, there are lesser published guidelines and pieces of evidence of the RSS' thoughts and politics. The 100-page pamphlet titled We our Nationhood Defined and Bunch of Thoughts both written by prominent RSS leader Golwalkar are two of the most defining books for subscribers to the Hindutva ideology. In Bunch of Thoughts, essentially a collection of his speeches, Golwalkar openly referred to Gandhi as an enemy of the Hindu state: ""those who declare 'no Swaraj without Hindu-Muslim unity' have perpetrated the greatest treason in our society.""

The root of the difference between the two ideologists went way back in history and not, as is widely propagated, as a result of the violent assassination of Gandhi by Nathuram Godse, who was an adherent to the same Hindutva ideology.

B.R Ambedkar in his final speech to the Constituent Assembly had insightfully pointed out that India is entering an age of great contradictions.

Gandhi's unflinching stand on maintaining a secular character, his dedication to the principles and practises of satyagraha, that chose rational debated and political processes over violence and military means, could also have led to his assassination. During his fast in 1924, to protect Hindu-Muslim unity after the first Non-Cooperation Movement, Gandhi demonstrated the power of ahimsa and the immense possibilities true leadership could inspire. Unfortunately, it was this very dynamism that Gandhi displayed across his life that triggered his murder. In his final public speech during his court verdict, Godse, without mixing words, said: ""The accumulating provocation of thirty-two years, culminating in his [Gandhi's] last pro-Muslim fast, at last, goaded me to the conclusion that the existence of Gandhi should be brought to an end immediately.""

As history has repeatedly proven, ideas are bulletproof, and Gandhi's ideals have endured the test of time. His beliefs, shared by Nehru and other defining leaders and policymakers of the time, found their way into shaping India's foreign policy including its decision to be a part of the Non-Aligned Movement. Savarkar, quite predictably, was critical of Nehru's decision to be a part of the movement.

B.R Ambedkar in his final speech to the Constituent Assembly had insightfully pointed out that India is entering an age of great contradictions because while there is political equality guaranteed by the constitution, there still existed social inequality. While social inequality is far from obliterated, in today's environment it seems that even politically guaranteed rights and structural safeguards that the leaders of yesterday had fought so hard to retain are subject to change.

Pandit Nehru had once remarked that ""one can't change the course of history by turning portraits to the wall."" This holds true for all the claimants to the legacy of Gandhi who want to absorb his personage but not his principles and are in denial of the most fundamental differences with his legacy. Mahatma Gandhi said, ""intolerance itself is a form of violence and an obstacle to growth,"" this is a reminder of how any idea that doesn't allow space for tolerance and inclusion is automatically antithetical to all that Gandhi aspired to achieve.

NEW DELHI -- China has maintained a sizeable presence of its troops near the site of the Dokalam standoff with India and even started widening an existing road which is at a distance of around 12 km from the area of conflict.

Sources said China has been slowly increasing its troop level in the Dokalam Plateau which could further escalate the current situation as India has reasons to be concerned over it.

They said an existing road is also being strengthened in the Dokalam plateau, adding the road is at a distance of around 12 kms from the earlier face-off site.

An indication of tension between the two countries due to the presence of Chinese forces in the Chumbi Valley in the Dokalam Plateau was also given by Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa on Thursday.

""The two sides are not in a physical face-off as we speak. However, their forces in Chumbi Valley are still deployed and I expect them to withdraw as their exercise in the area gets over,"" Dhanoa told reporters.

There have been territorial disputes between China and Bhutan over Dokalam and India has been staunchly supporting Thimphu over the issue.

Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Dokalam since June 16 after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. Bhutan and China have a dispute over Dokalam.

Bhutan and India were in touch with each other during the course of the face-off that ended on August 28.

Days after the face-off ended, Army Chief Bipin Rawat had said China has started ""flexing its muscles"" and warned that the situation in India's northern border could snowball into a larger conflict.

There are also reports that People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased more troops on its forward post in Yatung.

Sources said though Chinese troops have been deployed in Dokalam Plateau, they leave the area during winters.

But, there were indication that they may leave the areas this time, they added.

Une semaine pour profiter de ses propres repas, avec des plats équilibrés, préparés en moins de 30 minutes avec des produits de saison.

Cette semaine de défi est aussi l'occasion d'apprendre à changer nos regards sur ce que nous mangeons... et ne mangeons pas. Comme toutes ces épluchures, déchets qui finissent oubliés dans les poubelles. Un gaspillage qui pourrait être évité en quelques tours de main.

François Pasteau, chef d'un restaurant ""bistronimique"", l'Épi Dupin à Paris, et très engagé dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique espère bien changer notre vision de la pelure de la carotte, de la parure de fenouil ou encore des fruits trop mûrs, de tout ce qui va généralement à la poubelle sans trop y penser.

Dans son dernier livre, ""Manger et cuisiner éco-responsable"", le chef parisien donne ses astuces pour cuisiner les légumes, fruits, poissons et viandes en réduisant au maximum les déchets et le gaspillage. ""À la base de cette démarche, il y a la volonté de proposer une bonne cuisine, de saison, locale, du terroir et intelligente"", explique le chef.

Moins polluante, plus respectueuse des ressources et de la terre, la cuisine de François Pasteau entend aussi nous donner une nouvelle vision de notre alimentation: plus végétale, en plus petite quantité et mieux conditionnée pour être conservée plus longtemps.

Dans son livre, il décline ainsi pour un même produit plusieurs recettes utilisant toutes les parties pour jeter le moins de choses possible.

Que faire d'une parure de fenouil? Un confit délicieux

De mai à décembre, il est possible de trouver des fenouils au marché comme dans les grandes surfaces. ""Le fenouil ne s'épluche pas, tout se mange. Il se consomme cru et cuit"", assure le chef. ""Or, on met en général 30% du fenouil à la poubelle"", déplore-t-il. Pour être sûr d'avoir un bon légume, il faut le choisir ""bien blanc"" et sans tâche, conseille encore le chef.

Si après une recette, il vous reste les parures d'un fenouil, les tiges et cœurs, ne les jetez pas. Vous pouvez le confire facilement (si, si).

Ingrédients

Les parures de fenouils (tiges et cœur de trois fenouils)

1 l d'eau

4 pommes Canada

250 g de sucre

4 noix de beurre

1 anis étoilé

Faites confire pendant 2h dans l'eau et le sucre les parures de fenouil avec l'anis étoilé. Une fois confit, retirez l'anis et mixez afin d'obtenir une purée lisse. Préchauffez le four à 170 °C (th. 5-6). Préparez les pommes en faisant une légère incision tout autour à la moitié du fruit. Ajoutez une noix de beurre sur chaque pomme. Enfournez sur une plaque avec 50 cl d'eau pour 20 min de cuisson. Servez tiède avec le confit de fenouil froid.

Et avec les épluchures de carottes? Des chips croustillantes

Les carottes se dégustent toute l'année. Ce qui multiplie d'autant les occasions de cuisiner les épluchures.

Ingrédients

Jus d'un kilo de moules cuites avec des carottes, des oignons et du vin blanc d'un autre repas.

700g d'épluchures de carottes

100 g de poisson cuit

100 g de pommes de terre

25 cl de lait

25 g de beurre

10 cl d'huile d'olive

1 cuil. à café de curry

1 gousse d'ail

Farine

Faites cuire les pommes de terre en robe des champs. Épluchez-les, puis passez-les au presse-purée. Mettez la purée à chauffer dans une casserole, ajoutez le beurre et le lait. Mélangez bien. Ajoutez le poisson froid, l'huile d'olive et l'ail haché. Récupérez le jus de cuisson des moules avec sa garniture, ajoutez le curry. Passez les épluchures de carottes dans la farine, puis faites-les frire à 145 °C sans coloration. Dressez la brandade au centre de l'assiette, les chips de carottes frites dessus et le jus de moules autour.

Et des poires trop mûres? Des fruits rôtis au miel

La saison de la poire commence en juillet pour des variétés comme la Guyot et se poursuit tout l'hiver. L'avantage, c'est que ce fruit peut se consommer aussi bien en salé qu'en sucré, voilà qui multiplie les possibilités.

Pour des poires trop mûres, le chef a trouvé une façon de les cuisiner pour ne pas avoir à les jeter. Il suffit de les passer simplement au four avec un peu de miel.

Ingrédients

Pour le blanc-manger:

2 feuilles de gélatine

200 g de crème liquide

1 gousse de vanille râpée

75 g de sucre

200 g de fromage blanc

Pour la garniture:

4 poires tapées

8 spéculoos

1 cuil. à soupe de miel

Épluchez les poires. Préchauffez le four à 180 °C (th. 6). Faites rôtir les poires nappées de miel au four pendant 15 min. Laissez refroidir, puis coupez les poires en lamelles. Préparez le blanc-manger: faites tremper les feuilles de gélatine dans de l'eau. Égouttez-les et faites-les fondre dans une casserole. Montez la crème liquide avec la gousse de vanille râpée, ajoutez le sucre. Incorporez délicatement la crème montée au fromage blanc et ajoutez les feuilles de gélatine fondues. Servez avec des brisures de spéculoos sur le dessus.

Trois exemples parmi tant d'autres que le chef ne se lasse pas de donner. Pour d'autres conseils, concernant les poissons, la viande ou même la vieille salade oubliée au fond du frigo, voilà de quoi vous donner des idées:

- Quand vous allez chez le poissonnier, demandez-lui de tout récupérer après qu'il a levé les filets. Vous pourrez faire des fumets, des soupes, des tuiles croustillantes.

- Avant de mettre une carcasse de viande à la poubelle, mettez-la dans une casserole d'eau avec une garniture aromatique pour préparer un bouillon. Ce sera parfait pour votre prochaine soupe.

- Une salade flétrie? Plongez-la dans l'eau bouillante, salez et transformez-la en tatin de salade avec une pâte brisée.

""Je ne suis pas un donneur de leçons"", martèle François Pasteau, conscient de la culpabilité que peut ressentir le grand public face aux défis écologiques. Si frire votre épluchure de carotte va trop loin pour vous, le chef répète que cuisiner ""éco-responsable"", c'est avant tout acheter des produits de saison, locaux, des poissons issus de la pêche durable, consommer moins de protéines animales et surtout privilégier la quantité sur la qualité, ""ce qui permet de moins acheter et s'avère souvent fécond pour le porte-monnaie"", précise-t-il.

Aber weder durch weitere Unterrichtsstunden zur NS-Diktatur, noch durch einen Rechtsruck der Parteienlandschaft lässt sich der AfD-Erfolg aufhalten.","Kurz vor den Wahlen wurde noch einmal deutlich, dass keine Partei bereit ist, mit der AfD zu koalieren.

Von der Linken bis zur CDU warnte man vor der AfD mit teils drastischen Worten. Die Haltung demokratischer Parteien ist klar: Jede Verniedlichung der NS-Diktatur wird als Gefahr gesehen.

Die Zeiten des Nationalsozialismus werden derart ausgeschlachtet, dass sogar, der an politischen Geschehnissen desinteressierteste Bürger Deutschlands, die Gräueltaten der NS-Diktatur kennt.

Deutschland steht zu seiner Geschichte. Und das ist auch gut so. In der Schule lernt man unterschiedliche Aspekte der NS-Zeit kennen. In Geschichte, in Deutsch oder Ethik.

Sie werden durch Fernsehfilme, durch literarische Texte oder durch lebhafte Diskussionen in Erinnerung gerufen. Fast nahezu in jedem Medium findet man Berichte zum 3. Reich. Zivile Organisationen wie die „Weisse Rose"" beeindrucken mit ihrer Arbeit gegen Rechtsextremismus.

Der Erfolg der AfD steht in direkter Verbindung zur fehlenden soziale Gerechtigkeit

Keine Frage: Mehr Aufklärung zu dem dunkelsten Kapitel des 20. Jahrhunderts ist nicht möglich. Gerade angesichts dieses Aufwandes den der Staat, Medien und zivile Organisationen aufbringen, um Rechtsextremismus zu unterdrücken, ist es für viele Gegner der NS-Zeit sehr überraschend, dass ein beachtlicher Anteil der Bürgerinnen und Bürger Deutschlands der AfD ihre Stimme gegeben haben.

Gerade der Partei, deren Ideologie sehr stark an das 3. Reich erinnert.

Die Ursachen dazu müssen erforscht werden. Nach mehreren direkten Gesprächen mit Menschen, die der AfD nahe stehen und der Analyse von statistischen Erhebungen, bin ich fest davon überzeugt, dass eine Hauptursache die fehlende soziale Gerechtigkeit ist.

Viele AfD-Wähler stammen aus einem sozial schwachen Umfeld. Das niedrige Bildungsniveau ist verbunden mit niedrigen Einkommen.

Während die deutsche Regierung ihre historisch niedrige Arbeitslosigkeit feiert, können Millionen von Menschen, die arbeiten gehen, kaum über die Runden kommen.

Natürlich führt das zur Wut bei den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern, die von dieser niedrigen Arbeitslosigkeit nicht profitieren. Es spielt für sie kaum eine Rolle, ob sie arbeiten gehen oder nicht arbeiten gehen. Ihr Einkommen sei nahezu identisch.

Die Politik muss umdenken, denn die Theorie, dass niedrige Arbeitslosigkeit die Löhne steigen lässt, ist schon längst hinfällig. Das liegt in erster Linie daran, dass wir einen globalen Wirtschaftsmarkt haben und Arbeitnehmer nicht mehr knapp werden.

Große Konzerne können sehr schnell Arbeitnehmer aus anderen Ländern nach Deutschland holen oder bei steigenden Lohnkosten die Arbeit ins Ausland verlagern. Auf Basis dieser Entwicklung kann eine niedrige Arbeitslosigkeit kaum ein Kriterium mehr sein, um den Erfolg einer Wirtschaft zu messen.

Vielmehr ist es entscheidend, wie hoch der Anteil der Geringverdiener am gesamten Arbeitsangebot in einem Land ist. Und gerade diese Arbeitsverhältnisse mit niedrigen Einkommen steigen seit den Arbeitsmarktreformen des ehemaligen Bundeskanzler Schröders rapide an.

Die Bürger sorgen sich um ihre Zukunft

Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse, niedrige Löhne und sehr schlechte Renten machen den Bürgern Sorgen.

Es macht sie wütend, weil sie auch sehen, dass es anderen Menschen besser geht. Gleichzeitig sehen sie, wie die Regierung sich in den Medien selbst feiert. Sie sucht auf ein komplexes Wirtschaftssystem, das für die Armut vieler Menschen verantwortlich ist, einfache Antworten.

Dabei ist es ein Phänomen, dass es in der Gesellschaft immer die Ärmsten trifft. Früher waren es die Hartz IV Empfänger und seit der Flüchtlingswelle sind es die Flüchtlinge. Die Wut auf Migranten ist oft damit verbunden, dass man ihnen die Schuld für die miserable finanzielle Lage Millionen von Deutschen gibt.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Nach 51 Jahren Arbeit werde ich meinen Ruhestand in Armut verbringen

Auf Basis dieser Erkenntnis sind zwei Maßnahmen von enormer Bedeutung, um die AfD zu schwächen. Zum einen müssen wir die Menschen aufklären, dass Migranten nicht schuld an ihrer Situation sind. Auch wenn der letzte Ausländer in sein Heimatland zurückgeschickt wird, werden sich die Renten und die Löhne nicht erhöhen.

Das Leben eines jeden Menschen, der derzeit in Deutschland unter Armut leidet, wird sich durch die Rückführung von Migranten nicht verbessern. Der Lebensstandard der unteren Hälfte der Gesellschaft wird sich erst dann steigern, wenn die Macht der Großkonzerne wieder abnimmt.

Das, was an der Armutsgrenze lebenden deutschen Bürgern widerfährt, sind die negativen Auswirkungen der Globalisierung und des Kapitalismus.

Parteien nutzen den Hass auf Flüchtlinge aus

Die Regierungen sind nicht mehr der Souverän einer Nation. Und das wirkt sich auf die untere Gesellschaftsschicht aus, da die Steuerlast für Geringverdiener viel zu hoch ist (der Staat möchte die Großverdiener und Großkonzerne nicht noch mehr belasten, da diese sonst flüchten würden aber braucht Steuereinnahmen, wodurch die untere Gesellschaftsschicht belastet wird, die wiederum nicht flüchten können) und die Löhne viel zu niedrig sind.

Zum anderen müssen gerade diese Zustände verbessert werden. Parteien machen gerade den Kardinalfehler, die derzeitigen Tendenzen in der Gesellschaft, nämlich den steigenden Hass auf Flüchtlinge sich eigen zu machen.

Aber gerade das kann keine gesunde Lösung sein. Denn wenn wir in unserer Parteienlandschaft alle einen Ruck nach rechts machen, dann wird der Hass auf Ausländer wieder salonfähig werden. Das wiederum führt zu Synergieeffekten und wird langfristig zu noch mehr Diskriminierung führen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Offener Brief an Alexander Gauland: Alle nennen Sie einen Nazi, aber die meisten sehen nicht, was Sie wirklich sind

Eine noch stärkere Spaltung der Gesellschaft ist die Folge, da die Migranten wieder verstärkt Diskriminierungen ausgesetzt sind und sich dagegen wehren. Deswegen ist es entscheidend die Ursachen des Fremdhasses zu bekämpfen.

In erster Linie wäre das die Menschen aufzuklären. In zweiter Linie für mehr soziale Gerechtigkeit zu sorgen. Nur dadurch wird sich die AfD schwächen lassen. Aber weder durch weitere Unterrichtsstunden zur NS-Diktatur, noch durch einen Rechtsruck der Parteienlandschaft lässt sich der AfD-Erfolg aufhalten.

Wir brauchen jetzt mehr linke Politik. Nicht weniger.

According to the CBRE's 2017 North American Scoring Tech Talent report, Toronto added 22,500 new technology jobs to eclipse tech hotbeds New York (5,370) and San Francisco (11,540) combined. In doing so, Toronto leaped from 12th to sixth in the overall annual ranking.

Bill Morneau, Canada's finance minister, tries on a virtual reality helmet during an artificial intelligence demonstration at the Vector Institute inside the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, Ont., on March 30, 2017.

Those familiar with the red-hot tech job market in Toronto weren't surprised.

""Absolutely I think that Toronto's tech scene is booming,"" said Lara Torvi, manager of media and community relations for MaRS. ""We shouldn't make the mistake of perceiving Toronto as less mature or smaller than we actually are. We are quite a hub and I think it's just going to increase. We're at a tipping point where we will become one of the world's leading hubs for innovation.""

How did Toronto get here? Let's take a closer look at the circumstances that have helped Toronto become a serious player in the tech industry.

Local talent

Torontonians, give yourselves a hand — the first reason Toronto is flourishing is you.

Analysts say that the city's diverse workforce of highly skilled tech talent is a draw. CBRE's report further found that the quality of labour locally is ""very high,"" scoring significantly better than far more highly paid talent in cities including Dallas, Minneapolis, Miami and Phoenix.

""We are recognized as one of the most diverse cities in the world, and I think that the way Toronto recognizes the fact that diversity boosts innovation is really good for business,"" Torvi said.

Toronto's other big advantage? We're (relatively) light on the wallet.

The institutions

Having the University of Toronto, York University and a variety of other top educational institutions is a boon both for creating tech jobs and training tech talent.

CBRE's analysis found a 35 per cent growth overall in tech degrees in the Toronto area between 2011 and 2015, with a 47 per cent boost in computer engineering degrees.

The University of Toronto alone houses 10 start-up accelerators, including the Creative Destruction Lab.

Then, of course, there's the aforementioned MaRS network, which works with more than 1,000 ventures, employs more than 6,200 people, and has raised over $3.5 billion in capital.

""We're considered the largest urban innovation hub at 1.5 million square feet,"" Torvi said. ""We have some of the leading centres for research and development in areas like artificial intelligence, stem-cell research, data science, cyber-security, and even blockchain and cryptocurrencies.""

People work on laptop computers at the MaRS Discovery District building in Toronto, Ont.

Affordability

Toronto's other big advantage? We're (relatively) light on the wallet.

Out of all the tech talent markets included in CBRE's study, Toronto was the second-cheapest to operate in with a $26 million total cost (only Vancouver did better), compared to $57 million for the Bay Area.

Unfortunately for those working in the field, Toronto's talent was also much cheaper than the competition, particularly considering their high level of performance. The average tech talent wage in Toronto was $62,400, a far cry from the $123,200 brought home on average in Silicon Valley. Even the U.S. city with the lowest average wages, Oklahoma City, saw employees make an average salary of $74,400.

Still, observers expect that the more competitive Toronto's tech talent scene becomes, the faster salaries will rise.

""As we look to Toronto as that hub, and as organizations are continually looking to invest in our infrastructure and talent, the focus of employers will shift to competitive pay and perks, efficient hiring methods, frequent reviews and positive corporate culture,"" said Nima Mirpourian, branch manager for Robert Half Technology in Toronto.

""Those are important points to help combat the war for top talent in tech.""

Canada's comparatively welcoming attitude toward immigrant workers has been a huge help.

Government immigration policy

As certain other countries competing for tech talent have tightened their borders, Canada's comparatively welcoming attitude toward immigrant workers has been a huge help for companies recruiting the most talented people.

In June, a new federal program gave Canadian companies the option to bring in foreign workers in as little as two weeks. It's a $7.8-million two-year pilot run as part of the government's Global Skills Strategy. The government also recently announced that the Start-up Visa Program, which allows foreign entrepreneurs to get permanent residency if they move their companies to Canada, would be extended.

These policies are still new, but both could increase Toronto's surging tech job numbers even further in the future.

""I think we're just starting to see the results of some of those policies,"" Torvi said. ""There's a lot more activity and excitement to come.""

Polarisation of Hindus alone will not work because of the state's unique demography (roughly, only half the population is Hindu).","ADVERTISEMENT

For years, the BJP has been desperate to make electoral inroads to Kerala, but has been unable to find a breakthrough because politically the party has nothing new to offer, except a continuum of bogus issues that the people in the state hardly care for.

On Tuesday, its national president Amit Shah flagged off a ""yatra"" - a significant, inherited tool in BJP's polarisation strategy elsewhere in India -- in Kannur in north Kerala where the ruling CPM and the RSS/BJP are locked on in a rancorous duel. The stated purpose of this ""Jan Raksha Yatra"" is to fight ""jihadi-red terror"" -- ""red"" signifying the ruling CPM, the backbone of Kerala's left politics and the strongest political party in the state, and ""jihadi"" denoting Muslims that account for about 28% of the state's population.

Unfortunately, it's an empty slogan against non-existing issues: Kerala may have some localised violence in Kannur and the (reported) presence of some Islamist elements, but nothing that could be classified as ""terror"" that threatens the safety of its people. In fact, the unnatural combo of Marxists and the Islamists that the BJP has invented is contrary to truth, and betrays its political ignorance as well as desperation.

Fatal attacks against each other in Kannur by the CPM and the BJP don't make ""red"" terror or affect the general lives of the people. If the CPM is responsible for the violence, the BJP is equally responsible too. The number of casualties demonstrates nothing else. As this Indian Express feature clearly established, the alleged red-terror is saffron-terror too. By spinning the violent clashes -- between the workers of his party and the CPM -- as ""terror"" by the CPM, and even holding the chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan responsible, Shah was faking a bogus case.

This is BJP's fundamental problem -- it neither has a political idea or nor a development agenda that will find resonance with the people of the state, thanks to the unique socio-political legacy of the state for more than a century.

What was worse still, was the statement by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath that Kerala should learn from UP on how to run hospitals. He was flown down to Kerala to participate in the Yatra on Wednesday amid a slew of others who are waiting to join in the coming days. The chief minister of one of India's worst performing states in human development preaching to the highest performer was ludicrous, particularly in the wake of the Gorakhpur tragedy.

Probably, Adityanath's ill-informed advisers or wicked spin-masters thought that they could convert the recent spurt of dengue cases in Kerala into a pitch to malign the state, but comparing it with UP was a bit of a stretch. A few seasonal dengue cases don't make Kerala look worse than UP, or even comparable, just as the child mortality statistics in a tribal enclave, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had used in May last, didn't make the state look like Somalia.

This is BJP's fundamental problem -- it neither has a political idea or nor a development agenda that will find resonance with the people of the state, thanks to the unique socio-political legacy of the state for more than a century. Unless it comes up with a welfare-state politics that's better than what Kerala has long since achieved, BJP's development rhetoric will continue to evoke nothing but derision; and unless it comes up with a political thought that's markedly superior to that of the CPM-led left-front or the Congress-led democratic-front, it will continue to draw a blank. Unfortunately, jihad and terror are uncool, or rather foolish ideas because both are just bad imaginations.

This is precisely why the party crash lands as soon as it takes off. There's no momentum except the push from Delhi to carry it forward. Bereft of a progressive ideology, the party is a misfit in Kerala's politics. It may have reached a 10% vote-share that's tantalising Shah and others; but that's it. Moving head is almost impossible unless it gets Christians, who account for about 18% of the population, also on its side. It's really a long shot and still, won't be enough.

Polarisation of Hindus alone will not work because of the state's unique demography (roughly, only half the population is Hindu).

The unnatural clubbing of the alleged violence by the CPM and ""jihad"" into a single slogan of ""jihadi-red terror"" is a sinister ploy to break through its present stagnation. By targeting the CPM, the BJP is trying poach the anti-CPM votes and by maligning the Muslims using the ""jihadi"" word, it's trying to woo more Hindus and Christians because the general belief is that there is no love lost between the latter and the Muslims when it comes to minority interests. Polarisation of Hindus alone will not work because of the state's unique demography (roughly, only half the population is Hindu). There's no other way than targeting the other non-Hindus, namely the Christians. Shah meeting leaders of various Christian denominations when he visited the state last and making a Syrian Catholic - KJ Alphons - the only cabinet minster from the state are part of its strategy. But this strategy has been on the works for long and hasn't paid off.

Just as clashes between the workers of the BJP and the CPM don't make ""red terror"", a handful of misguided Muslim youth travelling to ISIS-held areas or a few girls converting to Islam or marrying Muslim men doesn't make ""jihadi terror"". By harping on non-existent issues, BJP will gain nothing.

The party is cornered in Kerala because its development pitch is irrelevant to the state, and its anti-left and communal ideas are inconsistent with the the socio-political and cultural ethos of Keralites.

In other words, there's hardly any space for the BJP, except in troller-shops.",Why BJP's Polarisation Ploy Will Not Work In Kerala,http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/10/05/bjps-fundamental-problem-in-kerala-its-overused-polarisation-ploy-will-never-work-in-the-state_a_23233468/

A precious away goal has put the Socceroos in the driving seat to reach the final stage of World Cup qualifying after a 1-1 draw with Syria in Malaysia.

With five minutes to play on Thursday, Australia were on the cusp of a best-case-scenario away win in the first leg of their cut-throat play-off tie.

But a controversial late penalty goal to Omar al-Somah gave the war-ravaged nation the equaliser they craved to cancel Robbie Kruse's 40th-minute opener at Malacca's Hang Jebat Stadium.

Nevertheless, the vital goal and clean sheet could prove the difference when Ange Postecoglou's men host the second leg in Sydney on Tuesday.

With that match in mind, coach Ange Postecoglou left Tom Rogic, Massimo Luongo and Jackson Irvine on the bench and gambled with the greenest members of his squad.

It paid off handsomely.

Uncapped Matt Jurman, thrust into a three-man defence alongside Trent Sainsbury and Milos Degenek, looked like an old hand.

Trimmed-down right-back Josh Risdon, capped just three times, was a hive of industry at right wing-back and relieved a high-playing Mat Leckie of his defensive responsibilities.

Faced Youssef of Syria is pressured by Robbie Kruse during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Asian Playoff.

That re-jig bore fruit five minutes before the break, when Leckie blazed to the right byline and cut inside to turn a defender and let rip, Kruse timing his run perfectly to divert the shot home.

Under the weight of last month's failure to qualify directly for a fourth straight World Cup, a bobbly pitch and a sea of red to break down, the Socceroos had their work cut out.

The steady display yielded chances, Tomi Juric twice hitting the post in consecutive shots and Leckie somehow skying a sitter with ample time.

Captain Mark Milligan, who endured extra attention all night, pulled the midfield strings alongside Aaron Mooy and unwound from 25m to force a full-stretch save from Syrian goalkeeper Ibrahim Alma.

But Syria brought the pace, and none were more searing than Al Somah.

As Australia searched for a killer second goal, the danger man and his cohort amped up the pressure, slicing through the Socceroos' defence with increasing regularity and forcing a succession of corners and free-kicks.

Mat Ryan, hardly called upon in the first stanza, was suddenly in the firing line and made a string of saves including one superb injury-time effort to deny Syria the win.

Is #IWWIWWIWI Changing Fashion Week As We Know It? It may not be the most well-known hashtag, but the rise in popularity of the 'I want what I want when I want it' attitude is no secret. Shoppers don't want to fall in love with a dress and have to wait six months for it to be in season and on the rack. As a result, we're seeing the rise of ""seasonless fashion"" in every market and at every price point.

“We talked about ATF going back and reviewing whether these are in compliance with federal law.”Along with pointing the finger at the Obama administration, ATF and Hollywood, Cox questioned whether prescription drugs are influencing gun violence.
“If legislation worked, Boston massacre wouldn’t have happened, San Bernardino — where California has every gun law on the books — that wouldn’t have happened,” La Pierre said.
“In Paris, where they have complete gun bans, that wouldn’t have happened.
All over the world, where the people are disarmed, these monsters, these bad guys, go about their business.","The head of the National Rifle Association’s lobbying arm said Thursday that “gun control is a failed policy” and it’s time to have a broader conversation about the underlying problem of mass shootings — namely the role Hollywood has played by fetishizing firearms.

″The NRA spends millions of dollars every year teaching safe and responsible gun ownership, and Hollywood makes billions promoting and glorifying gun violence,” Chris Cox, executive director of NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. “And then the same hypocrites come in and suggest we’re to blame for this.”

Cox of course was referring to the massacre Sunday night in Las Vegas, in which a lone gunman rained bullets down onto a country music festival, killing at least 58 people and injuring hundreds more before turning the gun on himself. The shooter’s arsenal included 12 firearms outfitted with bump fire stocks, devices that effectively allow a semi-automatic weapon to function as a fully automatic one does.

In an out-of-character move for the NRA, on Thursday — following several days of silence — the group issued a statement in which it acknowledged such devices “should be subject to additional regulations.”

Echoing a statement he and NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre had made earlier in the day, Cox told Fox News it was the Obama administration that approved the sale of bump fire stocks, and called on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to “do their job.”

“We didn’t talk about banning anything,” he told Carlson. “We talked about ATF going back and reviewing whether these are in compliance with federal law.”

Along with pointing the finger at the Obama administration, ATF and Hollywood, Cox questioned whether prescription drugs are influencing gun violence.

Asked by Carlson what has changed since they were children to allow for an increase in deadly shootings, Cox said: “That’s a conversation that’s happening at dinner tables and in living rooms all over the country. I’m sure it’s happened in yours, it’s certainly happened in mine. And I don’t know the answer. And I think we need to look at the broader conversation, and have a broader conversation, about a violent culture, about what has happened with gratuitous violence out of Hollywood, what’s happened with prescription drugs.”

Like the rest of the country, the NRA is looking for answers, Cox said. And while the gun rights advocacy group wants “to be part of a constructive conversation,” that conversation must include respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens and allowing them to protect themselves, he said.

“We’re focused on keeping Congress out of Second Amendment freedoms, keeping Congress focused on expanding the rights of law-abiding people to protect themselves and their families,” he said.

“Allow good, honest people the ability to defend themselves. Pass reforms like National Right to Carry Reciprocity.” –@ChrisCoxNRA #2A #NRA pic.twitter.com/9un5x1lcNs — NRATV (@NRATV) October 6, 2017

In a separate interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday night, LaPierre touted the money the NRA spends teaching gun safety, and bashed Hollywood and the “elites” in Washington, D.C.

“This Hollywood crowd makes billions ... teaching gun irresponsibility to the American public,” he said. “The hypocrisy is beyond belief. They criticize me for saying people ought to be able to protect themselves from murderers, rapists and robbers, and then they make billions depicting every night those same situations.”

Like Cox, LaPierre said the NRA had suggested the ATF take a second look at bump fire stocks, but stressed he and Cox “didn’t say ban” and “didn’t say confiscate.” He added that tightening gun laws would not prove effective at stopping shootings like the one in Las Vegas.

“If legislation worked, Boston massacre wouldn’t have happened, San Bernardino — where California has every gun law on the books — that wouldn’t have happened,” La Pierre said. “In Paris, where they have complete gun bans, that wouldn’t have happened.

Moderator Plasberg hat im Interview mit dem ""Spiegel"" über die Sendung mit AfD-Mann Gauland gesprochen

Eine Antwort zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit der AfD immer noch fällt

Auch Wochen nach der Wahl ist das starke Abschneiden der AfD immer noch eines der beherrschenden Themen in den Medien. ""Hart aber fair""-Moderator Frank Plasberg nennt das Resultat der Bundestagswahl im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" einen ""gesellschaftlichen Hammer"".

Nicht wenige Politiker und Journalisten haben den Medien eine Mitschuld am Erstarken der Rechtspopulisten gegeben.

Noch-Familienministerin Katarina Barley (SPD) etwa kritisierte Plasberg hart, als sie kürzlich zu Gast in dessen Sendung war. ""Mich hat das rasend gemacht"", schimpfte sie darüber, dass die Themen der AfD - Migration und Flüchtlingspolitik - so häufig Thema in den Talkshows der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen gewesen seien.

Im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" weist Plasberg die Vorwürfe zurück, ARD und ZDF hätten die AfD erst groß gemacht. Er gestand aber auch, dass ihm der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten nicht leicht falle.

Vor allem Plasbergs Schilderung des Auftritts des AfD-Spitzenkandidaten Alexander Gauland bei ""Hart aber fair"" im August offenbart, wie hilflos der Moderator teilweise der AfD gegenüber stand.

""Die spielen irgendwie anders""

""Wir ha­ben früh fest­ge­stellt, dass die ir­gend­wie an­ders spie­len"", sagt ""Hart aber fair""-Redaktionsleiter Georg Diedenhofen über die AfD im Doppelinterview mit dem ""Spiegel"". Die Rechtspopulisten hätten die Regeln verändert.

""Sie wol­len nicht ein­mal mit den an­de­ren Gäs­ten dis­ku­tie­ren, lie­ber set­zen sie sich mit dem Mo­dera­tor aus­ein­an­der, weil so die Op­fer­rol­le schnel­ler her­stell­bar ist"", erklärt Plasberg.

Für ihn als Moderator sei das ein Dilemma, weil er immer beherrscht sein müsse - und sich nicht zum Richter über den AfD-Gast aufschwingen dürfe.

Wie dieses Dilemma in der Wirklichkeit dann aussieht, sahen ARD-Zuschauer im August bei “Hart aber fair”. Zu Gast war damals der Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland. Kurz zuvor hatte er für einen Skandal gesorgt, als er sagte, die Integrationsbeauftragte Aydan Özoguz könne in Anatolien entsorgt werden.

""Wie dämlich muss man denn sein..."" - Plasberg in der Kritik

Immer wieder versuchte Gauland, den Fragen Plasbergs auszuweichen. Journalisten wie ""Welt""-Autor Thomas Schmid empörten sich hinterher, dass die “Hart aber fair”-Redaktion Gauland überhaupt eine Bühne geboten habe.

“Wie dämlich muss man denn sein, einem solchen kühl kalkulierenden Provokateur, der sich als Unschuldslamm gibt, einen derart breiten und für Gaulands Partei unbezahlbaren öffentlich-rechtlichen Wahlkampfauftritt zu verschaffen”, schimpfte Schmid damals in einem Facebook-Post.

Im “Spiegel”-Interview schildert Plasberg, die Redaktion habe das ganze Wochenende vor der Sendung mit Gauland überlegt, ob sie den Politiker ausladen solle.

Plasberg hat keine eindeutige Antwort parat

Eine eindeutige Antwort auf die Frage nach dem richtigen Umgang mit der AfD kann Plasberg nicht geben. Sollte die AfD wie jede andere Partei behandelt werden?

“Ja. Und nein”, antwortet Plasberg da. Es würden jedenfalls die gleichen journalistischen Standards gelten. Man dürfe der AfD nicht den Gefallen tun, “eine spezielle Umgangsweise für sie zu entwickeln”.

Dass AfD-Politiker als Talkshow-Gäste allerdings doch eine ""besondere Vorbereitung"" bräuchten, wie Redaktionsleiter Diedenhofen sagt, oder einen ""besonderen Energieaufwand"", wie Plasberg meint, zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten doch fällt.

Plasberg verrät auch, was die Zuschauer der Sendung nicht mehr sahen, als Gauland eingeladen war.

Gauland privat nach der Sendung

Nach der Aufzeichnung sei er zu dem Politiker gegangen und habe ihm erklärt:

""Ab heu­te bin ich je­dem böse, der die­se Par­tei wählt, nach­dem er Sie, Herr Gau­land, heu­te bei 'Hart aber fair' ge­se­hen hat.""

Gauland sei klug, rhetorisch fit, verleugne aber seine eigene Intellektualität, wenn er sage, ""er habe nicht ge­wusst, was der Be­griff ‘Ent­sor­gen’ be­deu­tet.""

Gauland habe nur dagestanden, mit einem Glas in der Hand und habe das ""mit großer Gelassenheit zur Kenntnis"" genommen.

“Glee” star Mark Salling pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving prepubescent minors as part of a plea deal on Wednesday, according to court documents obtained by Deadline.

The 35-year-old actor could face four to seven years in prison followed by up to 20 years of supervised release. He must register as a sex offender and is banned from communication with anyone under age 18 without a legal guardian or parent present. Salling will also pay $50,000 in restitution to each victim who requested it.

The actor was arrested in December 2015 on suspicion of possessing “hundreds” of images plus two videos featuring underage girls on his personal computer after his ex-girlfriend reportedly alerted authorities. In fact, federal investigators discovered tens of thousands of pornographic images and hundreds of videos with children ages 2–6 on a hard drive, according to court documents.

After his release, Salling will be restricted from going within 100 feet of schoolyards, parks, public swimming pools, playgrounds, video arcades or any place frequented by minors. He must also enroll in a sex offender treatment program.

The decision comes more than a year after Salling pleaded not guilty following a federal grand jury indictment on two counts of possessing child pornography. The trial, however, was delayed as he sought new legal representation.

While the charges sent shockwaves through the “Glee” fandom at the time of his arrest, co-star and former girlfriend, Naya Rivera, wasn’t entirely surprised.

“He always was a very dark soul to me,” Rivera told Entertainment Tonight about Salling. “I just always felt like there was something he was wrestling with.”",'Glee' Actor Mark Salling Pleads Guilty To Child Pornography Charges,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glee-actor-mark-salling-pleads-guilty-to-child-pornography-charges_us_59d53a71e4b0cde45872a7da

Caroline Lucas said May’s disastrous party conference speech must have been “an excruciating experience”, but that her resignation - being called for by a number of Conservative MPs, led by former party chairman Grant Shapps - would fail to address any problems.

Speaking to HuffPost UK ahead of the Greens’ annual conference, which kicks off this weekend, Lucas said: “On a personal level my heart goes out to her, in the sense that it was clearly an excruciating experience that you wouldn’t wish on anybody. Having said that, the real disaster of that speech was not the prime minister’s cough, but more what was in the speech and a complete failure to address the overwhelmingly important issues of the day.

“On housing, for example, the idea that an extra five thousand council houses a year is really going to go anywhere towards addressing the absolute housing crisis that we face is just for the birds and a demonstration of just how out of touch the Tories are.

Empics Entertainment Theresa May struggles through her conference speech

“The content of the speech was what was so incredibly disheartening - the lack of vision and the lack of any kind of understanding about what people want to hear.

“They are well aware that they face a problem, that they need to be attracting more young people to their cause, and yet what they were offering was just so insignificant and unhelpful, it’s really hard to see what they were thinking.”

Lucas, who is co-leader of her own party, said changing the leadership of the Conservative party would do nothing to address “this absolute Brexit catastrophe at its heart”.

“Whoever takes over from Theresa is still going to have that same challenge,” she added.

“They have obviously got a completely split parliamentary party on the issue, they can’t keep the same line more than a couple of days and the negotiations themselves seem to be going incredibly badly.

“When you’ve got the CBI themselves saying to the Conservative Party ‘pull yourselves together, you’re incompetent and incoherent’, that surely demonstrates just what an abysmal state the party is in, so changing leader isn’t going to help them.”

Empics Entertainment The Greens want a 'ratification referendum' on Brexit

The Greens have long been pushing for a ‘ratification referendum’ on Brexit - a second chance for voters to decide whether they really want Britain to leave the EU once exit negotiations are complete.

Lucas said she hoped MPs from other parties who were concerned about the Brexit process would back her proposal for a second vote.

“We need to banish any ideas of this extreme Brexit, that no deal is better than a bad deal, all of this empty rhetoric that does not bear any scrutiny, because it’s quite clear that no deal would be an asbolute disaster for the economy,” she said.

“Get rid of that and look very seriously at the proposals for remaining inside the single market and maintaining freedom of movement.

“One way that both parties [Labour and Conservatives] could square the circle of the dilemma they have at the moment in terms of split views is to support the Green proposal for a ratification referendum.

“The process was started by the British people, who voted [Leave] by a narrow majority, and it feels to me that it should go back to them to have the final sign-off.

“If they like what they see, fine, but if they don’t, and if on balance they would prefer to remain inside the EU now they are equipped with an awful lot more information than they had when they voted to leave, then they should have the final say.”

Lucas, who job shares her leadership position with former Parliamentary hopeful Jonathan Bartley, said she hoped the hung parliament produced as a result of the 2017 election would afford her more chances to work with rival MPs.

“One positive thing I have discovered about Westminster is that contrary to some of the appearances, it is possible to work cross-party on a case-by-case basis.

“You can make headway on different issues and that obviously is crucial, because none of the opposition parties on their own are going to be enough - so we need to work together.”

The Greens have so far enjoyed a surprisingly civil working relationship with environment secretary Michael Gove, who since returning to the cabinet has pledged to champion a number of environmental issues, including animal welfare, air quality and tackling climate change.

“To his credit he does appear to want to make his mark on this department which is good, because recently we have had ministers who didn’t seem to care very much about the brief they have been given,” Lucas said.

“He is a big beast and he wants to make his mark, and as long as he is doing that in a positive way, then that’s great.

“That does not wipe clean his own voting record in this area - which has been far from positive - and there are plenty of challenges in terms of how he is going to square this new found environmental zeal with the fact the government is continuing to promote fracking and nuclear energy and airport expansion and HS2 and road-building and all of those other things.

“On the one hand, the idea that Gove is turning the Conservative Party into the real Green Party is genuinely laughable, but on the other hand, if we do now have somebody in that department who for whatever reason, whether they believe in it or not, is willing to be more positive and engage more seriously with these issues then that’s good, but the jury is out to see which way it goes.”

She said the Green conference, which is being held in Harrogate, Yorkshire, will focus on Brexit and its impact on the environment as its main theme.

Bartley will be in the spotlight as he delivers the leaders’ speech on Monday, and among policy motions to be voted on are proposals for a new bank holiday to celebrate “the contribution of migrants and people of colour” and enabling Parliamentary candidates to remain in place up to 18 months after a general election without being subjected to a new selection process.

Lucas said: “Ours is a very democratic, grassroots, bottom-up party, so essentially our policy is made by our members.",Caroline Lucas: Theresa May Quitting Cannot Solve Tories' Brexit Catastrophe,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/06/caroline-lucas-theresa-may-quitting-cannot-solve-tories-brexit-catastrophe_n_18206250.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

""Nate s'est transformée en ouragan"", a annoncé vers 7 heures le Centre national des ouragans (NHC) américain alors que Nate longeait la côte caribéenne du Mexique et se trouvait à environ 150 km au nord de l'extrémité occidentale de Cuba.

L'ouragan se trouve en catégorie 1 sur les 5 que compte l'échelle Saffir-Simpson. Selon le Service Météorologique national du Mexique (SMN), Nate se déplace à 35 km/h avec des pointes de vent jusqu'à 150 km/h et devrait toucher les Etats-Unis aux premières heures de dimanche.

Couvres feu et suspension des cours d'école

Au Mexique, le gouverneur de l'Etat de Quintana Roo, qui comprend la région touristique de Cancun, avait suspendu les cours dans les écoles dès vendredi après-midi, Carlos Joaquin demandant à la population de ""ne pas baisser la garde"" car, même si Nate ne devrait pas atteindre le territoire mexicain, elle pourrait provoquer de fortes pluies.

En anticipation de son passage dans le Golfe du Mexique, des plateformes pétrolières et gazières ont été évacuées. Les autorités de la Nouvelle-Orléans, en Louisiane dans le sud-est des Etats-Unis, ont imposé un couvre-feu vendredi après-midi ainsi que des mesures d'évacuation obligatoire et volontaire dans certaines zones de basse altitude, particulièrement vulnérables aux inondations.

""Notre plus grande menace n'est pas forcément la pluie mais les vents et les vagues"", a déclaré le maire de la Nouvelle-Orléans, Mitch Landrieu. ""Nous anticipons son impact"", a indiqué le gouverneur de la Louisiane, John Bel Edwards, qui a déclaré l'état d'urgence.

Le sud-est des Etats-Unis a déjà été durement frappé en août par deux ouragans: Harvey au Texas et en Louisiane, qui a fait 42 morts et causé des dégâts matériels considérables, et Irma, qui, après avoir traversé les Antilles, a atteint la catégorie 5 et fait 12 morts en Floride.

L'Amérique centrale dévastée

Ponts détruits, routes inondées, arbres au sol et glissements de terrain: Nate a causé de lourds dégâts lors de son passage en Amérique centrale. Le Costa Rica, le Nicaragua et le Honduras, les pays les plus durement touchés, commençaient à évaluer les dégâts alors que les pluies semblaient céder le pas.

Sous la violence de la tempête, des villages entiers étaient coupés du monde dans plusieurs pays de la région. Selon les derniers bilans officiels des services de secours, la tempête a fait 13 morts au Nicaragua, 10 au Costa Rica, trois au Honduras et deux au Salvador. Et ce bilan n'est que provisoire. Au Costa Rica, les équipes de secours recherchaient plus de 30 personnes disparues et plus de 5000 ont dû trouver refuge dans des abris.

Le président Luis Guillermo Solis a décrété trois jours de deuil national en hommage aux dix personnes tuées, dont une fillette de trois ans emportée par une coulée de boue. Malgré la légère accalmie sur le front des pluies, Guillermo Solis a prévenu que le risque d'inondations et de glissements de terrain persistait. ""Nous avons fait une évaluation très détaillée de la situation climatique, elle est en amélioration, sauf dans le nord-ouest et le sud. Cette situation est trompeuse car il va pleuvoir ce week-end et les sols sont saturés, donc les glissements de terrain sont possibles"", a-t-il prévenu.

Après la tempête, le danger des crocodiles

Dans ce pays, des villages situés sur la côte Pacifique restaient inondés vendredi matin alors que les équipes de secours cherchaient les personnes portées disparues. Le gouvernement costaricien a par ailleurs appelé la population à prendre des précautions car les crocodiles vivant dans les rivières côtières peuvent s'approcher des maisons à cause des inondations.

Le Nicaragua semble le pays le plus touché par la tempête avec, d'après la vice-présidente et porte-parole du gouvernement, Rosario Murillo, plus de 10.000 personnes affectées par des inondations et coulées de boue. Des milliers de familles restaient privées d'électricité vendredi matin.

La région Caraïbes, en pleine saison des pluies, est encore sous le traumatisme des ouragans Irma, José et Maria qui n'ont cessé de la frapper ces dernières semaines, laissant des paysages de désolation et de nombreuses victimes derrière eux.

Earlier this week, a 13-year-old jumped from the 11th floor of an apartment building to escape the beating and torture that she had endured for two years, exposing a horrific case of bonded labour in Faridabad, Haryana.

The minor fell through a bird net and landed in a balcony on the 10th floor of the Kanishka Towers in Faridabad, where she lay in a semiconscious state for seven hours until she was rescued by residents.

The teenager, who had worked as a domestic for two years in a rented apartment on the 11th floor, was allegedly beaten and tortured by her employer - a woman in her early twenties. The Times of India reported today that the survivor's body is marked by deep gashes, scratches, wounds on the head and burn marks on the back.

Rishi Kant, spokesperson of Shakti Vahini, an NGO that combats bonded labour in the country, told News 18, ""The victim has burn marks all over her back, she has bruises on her head and her hands have deep marks that appear old. The girl is extremely scared and is in a traumatic condition. Doctors say she has been starved for long.""

""The girl said the woman would hit her with pipes and rolling pins. If she made a mistake, boiling water would be thrown on her back. The evident injuries and burn marks all over her body confirm this,"" Kant told The Indian Express.

One neighbor said, ""We would often hear cries. But the woman, who told us that she studies at a private university, would tell us to mind our own business.""

The teenager, who hails from Bihar, has been sent to a Child Protection Home but the police are struggling to locate her parents in Patna.

The accused, who also hails from Bihar and is pursuing a BTech degree at Manav Rachna University in Faridabad, has been arrested and remanded in judicial custody. An FIR has been registered against her under Section 79 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

H.S. Malik, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee, Faridabad, HS Malik, told News 18, ""The accused is a student a private university in Faridabad. She used to beat up the girl regularly. Both the girls hail from Patna and the parents of the victim work as servants at the accused girl's home in Bihar.""

The Indian Express reported that the accused has been identified as Sneha, whose father owns mines in Bihar.

TOI reported that the teenager, who was performing all the household chores including sweeping, cooking, and washing clothes, was not paid a salary.

Aun así, muchos decidimos vivir en la periferia, en donde nunca había pasado nada y en donde, hasta el 19 de septiembre del 2017, creíamos que no pasaría nada nunca: la colonia del Valle.
Pero para los que vivimos cerca de una zona cero y vimos edificios caer, la paranoia es difícil de ignorar.
""En cualquier momento empezará a oler a muerto, así pasó en el 85"".
""Me regreso a mi tierra, me dijeron que la capital era un peligro y aquí estoy yo de necio"".","No habían pasado ni 10 años del terremoto del 85 cuando fui a la colonia Roma, a un 'toquín'. Fue la primera vez que vi, en vivo y a todo color, ruinas de edificios. Estar ahí sonaba a una gran aventura urbana, como aquellas anécdotas de la Alemania postmuro, en donde se celebraban conciertos de metal en edificios derruidos.

Pero cuando le conté a mi hermano mayor mi heroica visita, se enojó muchísimo. En los años 90, ir a la colonia Roma o a la Condesa sonaba a suicidio: además de que las ruinas del sismo del 85 seguían ahí, abandonadas, con el latente peligro de derrumbarse, la zona se había convertido en cuna de asaltantes y traficantes de fayuca... al menos eso se decía en donde yo vivía (Villa Coapa).

Muy pocos años después, cuando empecé a trabajar, esos mismos lugares sonaban como el lugar perfecto para empezar a vivir solo o con amigos: antes del año 2000 las rentas eran baratas, los lugares amplios y la zona céntrica. Poco tiempo después llegó eso llamado plusvalía y la zona se volvió no solo cara sino saturada y caótica.

Aun así, muchos decidimos vivir en la periferia, en donde nunca había pasado nada y en donde, hasta el 19 de septiembre del 2017, creíamos que no pasaría nada nunca: la colonia del Valle.

Yo viví una migración a la zona a finales de los años 90: fuimos muchos veinteañeros que llegamos a rentar pequeños lugares, las más de las veces remodelados, que habían estado desocupados por años. Eran baratos, cómodos y nadie moría por arrebatártelos. En aquella época todos mis vecinos eran como yo, parecía un campus universitario. Con el tiempo, comprar en la colonia no solo sonaba coherente, sino que era un gran negocio: el área subía su plusvalía cada año hasta 20%. Estar ahí era garantía de que estabas haciendo una gran inversión.

En aquella época todos mis vecinos eran como yo, parecía un campus universitario.

Hoy, menos de 20 años después, veo una segunda migración pero a la inversa: ahora todos parecen querer huir... y mientras más pronto, mejor.

Cierto. Hay áreas de la colonia del Valle que ni queriendo recuerdan que tembló: están intactas. Pero para los que vivimos cerca de una zona cero y vimos edificios caer, la paranoia es difícil de ignorar. ""En cualquier momento empezará a oler a muerto, así pasó en el 85"". ""No tardan en llegar oleadas de ratas, que saldrán de los escombros"". ""Prepárense, van a llegar decenas de asaltos"". Aquí todos tienen algo catastrófico que decir: taxistas, tenderos, personal de basura, porteros... Si no ha llegado el Apocalipsis es porque aún no ha habido tiempo. Y no es de a gratis: aún hay muchas calles cerradas, edificios acordonados y agrietados, coronas de flores en muros derrumbados...

En mi edificio ya no quedamos ni la mitad de los vecinos. En los aledaños sucede lo mismo. Desde el 19 de septiembre es común ver gente que sale con maletas o que está sacado muebles. La mayoría no se despide, simplemente se va.

La zona que se caracterizaba por estar en constante movimiento de autos, ruido, puestos, cafés y negocios locales para trasnochadores se ha transformado en un pequeño pueblo cercado y silencioso.

No te vas porque sería como darse por vencido, ¿no?"", escucho decir al portero de mi edificio.

Va más allá de eso: la oleada de gente que huye es tal, que encontrar un nuevo lugar cercano está resultando maratónico; no todos (por más que insistan que es zona de ricos) tienen recursos para pagar mudanza, depósitos y trámites para rentar. Y los que son propietarios aún evalúan qué sería lo menos doloroso: abandonar su lugar mientras esperan que lo complicado se supere, o rematar su propiedad a precio de ganga para no volver jamás. Habemos otros más que aún estamos en esa fase de incredulidad, aún no creemos todo lo que hemos visto.

¿A dónde se van todos?

¿Qué colonias se van a saturar ahora? ¿Y qué pasará después en las zonas abandonadas? Infinidad de amigos me hacen saber que están en las mismas. Han escapado de Reforma, Polanco, la Roma y la Condesa, incluso de zonas en donde no pasó nada, pero que ya no suenan seguras: Tlalpan, División del Norte, Narvarte y Nápoles. La mayoría se cambia solo 'a un ladito'... volver a empezar supongo que es más sencillo así.

Inmobiliarias han reportado que se ha incrementado su labor hasta 90%, sobre todo porque todos buscan mudarse a zonas aún céntricas, pero en edificios pequeños, o en un primer o segundo piso. Muchos más están dispuestos a venderlo todo para comprar algo fuera de la ciudad. ¿Cómo serán los problemas de movilidad que tendremos con todo esto? Ya lo sabremos pronto.

Ayer que llegaba a casa, un vecino me detuvo. No estoy segura de haberlo visto nunca y creo que él tampoco sabía a ciencia cierta quién era yo: solo necesitaba decirle adiós a alguien. ""Me regreso a mi tierra, me dijeron que la capital era un peligro y aquí estoy yo de necio"". Lo único que se me ocurrió fue ofrecerme para tomarle una foto con su celular: ""Para el recuerdo"", le dije, ""igual y dentro de poco regreses a este edificio a un concierto"".

Depuis 1986, l'Equipe de France n'a terminé qu'une seule fois à la première place de son groupe de qualifications pour la Coupe du monde, pour l'édition 2006. En proie au doute après un match nul frustrant face au faible Luxembourg, handicapée par de nombreux absents, la sélection tricolore affronte la Bulgarie ce samedi 7 octobre à Sofia, avec un seul petit point d'avance en tête de son groupe, devant la Suède.

En cas de victoire, les hommes de Didier Deschamps feront un grand pas vers le Mondial. Tout autre résultat les mettrait dans une situation inconfortable avant leur dernier match mardi à domicile face à la Biélorussie.

Une chose est sûre, malgré une supériorité incontestable sur le papier, le déplacement des Bleus en terre bulgare ne sera pas une sinécure. Outre le fameux spectre de 1993 et le fantôme d'Emil Kostadinov qui semble encore planer sur la sélection française, les hommes de Didier Deschamps vont devoir s'imposer face à une équipe qu'ils n'ont jamais battue à l'extérieur depuis l'après-guerre.

Au meilleur endroit, au meilleur moment

Les Bulgares ont transformé le Vassil-Levski, leur stade implanté en plein cœur de la capitale, en véritable forteresse. L'équipe, classée 38e au classement FIFA, a battu tout ses adversaires à domicile depuis le début de la phase de qualification pour ce Mondial en Russie. Une belle performance qui permet aux Bulgares de pouvoir encore rêver d'une qualification... à condition de renverser les Bleus.

Et quel meilleur adversaire que l'équipe de France pour réaliser l'exploit? ""Les matchs contre la France prennent une part importante dans le folklore du football national bulgare. On n'a jamais perdu contre votre équipe à domicile et cela contribue forcément à l'euphorie générale"" explique le journaliste sportif bulgare Teodor Borisov au HuffPost.

Et puis il y a le 17 novembre 1993. La terrible désillusion du match France-Bulgarie avec ce but d'Emil Kostadinov dans les arrêts de jeu, donnant la victoire aux siens (1-2) alors que les Bleus n'avaient besoin que d'un point pour se qualifier pour la Coupe du monde 1994. ""Croyez-moi, les Bulgares s'en souviennent. Ils n'ont pas oublié. Quand j'en discutais avec eux, ils me chambraient un peu"", raconte le footballeur Jérémy Manzorro -ancien pensionnaire du championnat bulgare- à LCI, en rappelant au passage que ce match constitue l'un des plus grands exploits du football bulgare.

Si de nombreux joueurs français n'étaient pas nés en 1993, les fantômes de cette tragédie footballistique ne manqueront pas de venir s'insinuer dans la conscience collective, ne serait-ce que par la présence sur la pelouse d'un Kostadinov (Georgi) évoquant le bourreau de 1993.

Des ""combattants""...

Sur le terrain, les Bleus vont devoir faire face à une équipe de ""combattants prêts à aller au charbon"", lance Teodor Borisov au HuffPost. ""A la maison, nous pouvons gagner contre toutes les équipes européennes"", assure le journaliste, louant l'état d'esprit qui règne au sein de la sélection: ""les joueurs n'ont pas de pression, ils n'ont rien à perdre (...) et c'est dans ces moments-là que l'équipe joue bien"".​​

Même son de cloche du côté de Cédric Bardon. L'ancien joueur français du Levski Sofia voit la sélection bulgare comme une équipe compacte avec ""un ou deux très bons joueurs."" Mais pour lui, la grande force de ces joueurs se retrouve surtout à travers leur amour pour leur pays. Un sentiment qui anime beaucoup les sportifs des pays de l'est. ""Tous les joueurs bulgares ont pour objectif ultime de jouer pour la sélection"", explique l'ancien footballeur.

En face, pour se sortir de ce qui se présente comme un ""gros piège"", les Bleus ne pourront pas compter sur plusieurs de leurs joueurs phares. Layvin Kurzawa, Benjamin Mendy, Paul Pogba, Laurent Koscielny ou encore la pépite Ousmane Dembélé manquent à l'appel. Une cascade de forfaits qui pourrait jouer un rôle dans ce match capital.

... au cœur d'une très chaude ambiance

D'autant que les Bulgares pourront également compter sur un stade plein à craquer, alléché par la perspective de faire tomber le meilleur ennemi français, et par la même occasion entretenir le petit espoir de se qualifier pour la Coupe du monde, eux qui en sont privés depuis 1998. ""Pour un tel événement, tout le monde va se déplacer. Il faut s'attendre à quelque chose d'énorme, avec une ambiance assourdissante"", prédit Jérémy Manzorro.

Cédric Bardon connaît bien le football et les supporters bulgares. ""Tous les éléments sont réunis pour que l'ambiance soit électrique"", explique au HuffPost celui qui a joué quatre ans à Sofia. Pour l'ancien joueur lyonnais, ""les supporters sont très fiers de leur pays, ils sont très présents lors de gros matchs comme celui là."" ""L'ambiance sera hostile à l'équipe de France. C'est dans la culture des clubs des pays de l'est"", explique-t-il.

Au total, quelques 43.000 supporters se masseront dans les travées du stade Vasil Levski, du nom du plus grand héros national, surnommé ""l'Apôtre de la liberté"" par le peuple bulgare. Dans cette enceinte symbolique devenue forteresse imprenable, les Bleus devront faire preuve de patience et d'application pour faire un pas de plus vers le Mondial.",Bulgarie - France: les secrets bulgares pour être invincibles à domicile (surtout contre les Bleus),http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/10/06/bulgarie-france-les-secrets-bulgares-pour-etre-invincibles-a-domicile-surtout-contre-les-bleus_a_23232728/

El romance de estos dos podría sorprender a más de uno, pero dado el récord de Disick...no tanto. Este año, por ejemplo, el padre de tres hijos inició un romance con Bella Thorne, 16 años más joven que él, después de haberse conocido en una fiesta. La actriz, tiempo después, habló sobre el estilo de vida del ex de Kourtney Kardashian.

""Yo no tomo, y él vaya que sí. De la noche a la mañana, terminó... no estaba lista. Simplemente me dije: 'esto no es lo mío'"", explicó Thorne a la revista Complex. ""Estábamos en Cannes y un día y medio después busqué un boleto para irme. Me gusta salir y divertirme, me encanta bailar, pero no soy tan fiestera, ese estilo de vida fue mucho para mí"".

Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit: Genau diese Zeilen gingen mir durch den Kopf am Abend des Wahlsonntags 2017.

Auf die Frage, warum mir die letzte Strophe unserer Nationalhymne in den Sinn kam, kann ich nur kopfschüttelnd antworten: weil wir längst keine Einheit mehr bilden in Deutschland.

Es fällt mir schwer zuzugeben, dass der international vorherrschende Populismus die Bundesgrenzen schon längst passiert hat. Doch noch trauriger ist, dass Jeder dem Anderen die Schuld in die Schuhe schiebt, dem Populismus den Einlass erleichtert zu haben.

Welche Zukunft wollen wir für Deutschland?

Man vergisst jedoch, dass unsere Grenzen längst undicht waren. Wir sind nicht fähig, uns auf einen großen gemeinsamen Nenner für die Zukunft Deutschlands einig zu werden. Eher zerbrechen wir uns den Kopf über den Brexit und die Aussagen Donald Trumps.

Der größte gemeinsame Nenner für Deutschland? Wie wäre es mit einer sicheren Zukunft für unsere Kinder?

Während die Medien sich im Wahlzeitraum über Erdogans Provokationen echauffierten, nutzte die AfD die Gelegenheit um vermehrt populistische Wahlpropaganda zu betreiben.

Natürlich führte das dazu, dass die Rechtspopulisten den Diskurs in der Medienberichterstattung zu ihren eigenen Gunsten nutzen konnte. Frei nach dem Motto: ""Bad news are good news.""

Und was haben die etablierten Politiker gemacht? Sie haben sich mitreißen lassen, wie etwa im TV-Duell Anfang September, und waren unfähig, zukunftsfähige Wahlversprechen zu machen.

Nach Überzeugungskraft in den Argumenten hat der Wähler vergebens gesucht, weshalb die Bewohner dieses Landers opportunistisch und trotzig gewählt haben. Beide Eigenschaften schaden dem Gemeinwohl einer Gesellschaft erheblich.

Chaos im politischen Deutschland

Nach der Wahl herrscht Chaos in der politischen Landschaft: alle sind empört und schockiert über den Wahlsieg der AfD und die Niederlage der Zentrumsparteien.

Hinzu kommt die Unruhe innerhalb der etablierten Parteien: Frauke Petry und Marcus Pretzell sind aus der AfD ausgetreten, Seehofer spielte kurz mit dem Gedanken sich von der Schwesterpartei CDU zu trennen und die CSU-Basis will den Rücktritt Seehofers.

Nur eins möchte ich vorne wegnehmen: Dieses Chaos wird durch die Medien ein lautes Echo in der Gesellschaft finden - das sollte uns allen klar sein.

Zu sagen, ""Ich gehöre zu den 87%"", bringt uns nichts. Genauso wenig wie auf die Mitbürger zu schimpfen, die wir leider immer noch als ""Ostdeutsche"" bezeichnen und damit auszugrenzen.

Es ist kein Wunder, warum so viele von diesen Mitbürgern sich der AfD zuwenden.

Wir vergrößern damit die Kluft innerhalb der Gesellschaft, was wiederum Nährboden für den Populismus birgt. Es hilft uns auch nicht die Flüchtlinge als Grund allen Übels zu sehen, oder die fehlerhafte Politik der Großen Koalition verantwortlich dafür zu machen.

Einheit heißt, gemeinsam für das Wohl dieses Landes zu handeln

Kurzum es bringt gerade nichts einen Sündenbock ausfindig zu machen, um diesen dann an den Pranger zu stellen, denn Deutschland ist damit nicht geholfen. Wir müssen von der altbewährten Handlungsweise der Marginalisierung absehen.

Sowohl die Gesellschaft, als auch die Medien und die Politik müssen gemeinsam nach Wegen suchen mit der neuen Situation im Bundestag und somit auch in der politischen Landschaft klarzukommen. Nur so lässt sich die gerade als trostlos bezeichnete Situation - nämlich der Einzug der AfD in den Bundestag - meistern.

Denn Einheit bedeutet für mich gemeinsam, ungeachtet der Herkunft, politischen Ideologie oder Religion, für dieses Land zu handeln. Für alles weitere lassen wir die Nationalhymne sprechen:

""Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit für das deutsche Vaterland! Danach lasst uns alle streben, brüderlich mit Herz und Hand!

Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit sind des Glückes Unterpfand: Blüh im Glanze dieses Glückes, blühe deutsches Vaterland!""",Am Tag der Deutschen Einheit wurde mir klar: Wir sind schon längst kein geeintes Land mehr,http://www.huffingtonpost.de/sebnem-karabeyaz/deutschland-tag-der-deutschen-einheit-bundestagswahl-wahlen_b_18171332.html?utm_hp_ref=germany

President Donald Trump tweeted Monday morning to offer his “warmest condolences and sympathies.”

In a statement to reporters, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders affirmed that Trump was being briefed on the situation.

“All of those affected are in our thoughts and prayers,” she said.

Nevada lawmakers, including the governor and U.S. senators, expressed their sympathies and affirmed that they were working with local officials to respond to the violence.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded in last night’s vicious and senseless attack outside the Mandalay Bay Resort,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) said in a statement, before thanking first responders and offering support to local officials.

A few lawmakers, mostly Democrats, noted the need for more than just thoughts and prayers. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was among them:

This senseless violence must end—thoughts and prayers are simply not enough. We must act to prevent this from happening again. — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) October 2, 2017

Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was wounded in a mass shooting in 2011, said that “no person should endure the horror Las Vegas experienced last night.”

Heartbroken by the scene our nation is waking up to this morning. No person should endure the horror Las Vegas experienced last night. — Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) October 2, 2017

Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, who have become prominent gun control advocates, held a press conference on Capitol Hill later in the day, imploring Trump and members of Congress to take action.

“What we’re hearing today at the Capitol and the White House are thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers are important. We send our thoughts and prayers, too. But they are not enough,” Kelly said. “Your thoughts and prayers aren’t going to stop the next shooting. Only action and leadership will do that.”

Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) wrote in a series of tweets that “it is not sufficient to just offer thoughts and prayers,” and he criticized his colleagues’ refusal “to take real, meaningful action to curb gun violence.”

Congress must engage in a robust debate about commonsense ways to keep guns, particularly military-style weapons, out of the wrong hands. — Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) October 2, 2017

And Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who became a fierce advocate for gun control following the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, did not mince words.

“The thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference,” he said in a statement. “It’s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.”

Yet Sanders insisted that it was “premature” to discuss policy changes regarding guns and urged people to wait for “all of the facts.”

“There’s a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,” Sanders said Monday during a White House press briefing, before also offering her “thoughts and prayers.”

Fox slammed the media for being “obsessed” with the issue after he was challenged to eat chlorine-washed chicken to show he was comfortable with the product entering the UK food market.
A vast array of institutions and scientific infrastructure keeps UK food fit to eat.
Yet both Falkenberg and Johnson admit that animal welfare and farming practices aren’t always at the top of politicians’ agendas.
A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.","There have been fresh warnings that Brexit could lead to British farming and food standards being lowered if meat from the United States is allowed to flood UK supermarkets.

The claims, which have been backed by passionate animal welfare advocate and former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson, come amid a conference this week of international agriculture and livestock experts in London.

Experts have said that Brexit could see a race to the bottom for Britain’s food quality in the interests of completing free trade deals with countries like the United States, and that food safety standards faced “serious risks” if the UK failed to adopt EU-style rules.

This follows previous warnings that rules around hormone-injected meat, chlorinated chicken, milk containing antibiotics and genetically modified vegetables could be weakened after the country severs ties with the European Union, which currently offers protections against such products.

EMPICS Entertainment Stanley Johnson warns that Brexit could force UK farmers to lower standards to compete with US market.

Johnson, who also revealed he now backs his son Boris on Brexit, told HuffPost UK it would be easy for Britain to go down the mass production route seen in the US.

“Just how animal friendly are some of these intensive rearing techniques... which result in cattle never getting out of the feed lot at all? I would be worried that, once we’re out of the EU, people will say ‘ok we can get American beef’.

“I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life, where you have got thousands and thousands of animals packed in,” he told HuffPost UK.

I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life Stanley Johnson

Johnson added that cheap meat from the US could also lead to farmers in the UK being forced to compete with food giants across the Atlantic: “I would be very worried that, as a result of letting that happen we then have increasing pressure in this country, because of competition reasons, to say ‘we must do that ourselves now, go down this mass production route’.”

International trade secretary Liam Fox has repeatedly talked up the benefits of free trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada after the UK leaves the EU.

But there was outrage in Britain this summer after it was revealed that chlorine-washed chicken, which is legal in the US, could enter the UK food chain in order to facilitate a trade deal with Washington.

Fox slammed the media for being “obsessed” with the issue after he was challenged to eat chlorine-washed chicken to show he was comfortable with the product entering the UK food market.

PA Wire/PA Images The practice of washing chicken in chlorine, common in the US but banned in the UK under EU regulations, has sparked concern.

Under current EU regulations, poultry meat which is rinsed in chlorine is banned, but after the UK leaves the EU it will be up to the government whether a ban stays in place.

Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University in London, has previously warned that Brexit could see a race to the bottom in terms of food quality.

He told the Compassion in World Farming’s Extinction and Livestock international conference on Friday: “We in Britain are currently away with the fairies, because of Brexit we are throwing everything into the air like children throwing toys out of the pram.

“Beware, intellectually and in principle we might get improvements from it (Brexit), but the likelihood of that is very low, because at the moment the food culture in Britain is based around price. The schemes to go for ever cheaper food will triumph over higher values.”

Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City, University of London

In a University of Sussex report co-authored by Lang in July, experts warned there were “serious risks that standards for food safety will decline if the UK ceases to adopt EU safety rules and instead accepts free-trade agreements with countries with significantly weaker standards”.

In addition to weaker standards in countries like China, the report also identified the US, warning: “Under the Trump administration US standards are likely to decline sharply.”

It continues: “Brexit campaigners ignored the inbuilt reliance the UK has on pan-European institutions, to which we contribute. A vast array of institutions and scientific infrastructure keeps UK food fit to eat.

“Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards, nor that foods derived on world markets use standards which are weaker than the EU’s and those of the USA.”

Examples of food practices used in the US, which are currently banned in the EU: Hormones Many beef producers in the US use implants of synthetic hormones under the skin of their beef cattle in order to promote growth, requiring the animals to need less food but still grow at a fast pace. The US says meat from hormone-treated cattle is safe, but the EU disagrees, citing the posed risks to vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and people with weak immune systems. Bovine somatotropin in dairy cows In the US, many dairy cows are injected regularly with a synthetic hormone called bovine growth hormone (BGH). In the UK and the EU the hormone is called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST). The growth hormone is used to to increase milk yield but it can cause mastitis in cattle, which is an inflammation of the udder that derives from a bacterial infection. This can lead to more antibiotics being given to the cows. The EU’s Scientific Committee on Animal Health found that the practice led to “very significantly poorer welfare because of increased foot disorders, mastitis, reproductive disorders and other production related diseases”. GM crops and animals More varieties of GM crops are allowed to be produced and sold in the US than in the EU. GM foods are not currently grown commercially in the UK, but they can be imported. In the EU, if a food contains or consists of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or contains ingredients produced from GMOs, this must be indicated on the label. In the US there is no mandatory labelling requirement. Chlorinated chicken Poultry dipped in chlorinated disinfectant hit the headlines in the UK this summer. In the USA, in an attempt to combat problems of microbiological contamination of poultry meat, manufacturers are required to dip the meat in disinfectant, which most commonly is a chlorine-based product. The practice is not lawful in the EU or the UK and in the US poultry meat is not labelled as having been dipped in disinfectant.

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, more than 99% of farm animals in the US are raised in factory farms.

Speaking about factory farming, which can see tens of thousands of animals crammed into one warehouse, Johnson said: “I wouldn’t want that to come back on the agenda merely because the Americans are able to sell their stuff over here”.

He also warned about UK policies possibly being swayed by US food giants in the future.

“Never underestimate the political influence of the big agricultural business ... they will ... take whatever advantages they find they can take.”

As part of the EU Withdrawal Bill, all existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law after March 2019.

This means there is unlikely to be an immediate impact on much of Britain’s industries, including farming, straight after leaving the EU.

Karl Falkenberg, a former adviser to president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, served as deputy director general for trade in Brussels for five years before becoming director general for environment between 2009 and 2015.

He told HuffPost that the EU’s extensive food product legislation has been heavily criticised by the US in the past: “In the United States GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) are common practice, hormone addition in producing meat is absolutely normal practice.

“We have decided that these are things that we don’t want to have in the European Union and therefore we have legislation that protects this.

“But when you leave the European Union, again you become free to modify those conditions, if you so want.”

That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union

Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union, claimed last month that free trade was a “myth” as so many countries subsidise their agricultural sectors.

“That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards.

“We don’t think that’s a very sensible scenario for anyone to just sign up to some ideological idea that free trade actually exists where I don’t think it does.” If the UK’s food safety standards do not meet the EU’s requirements, then exports from the UK to the European bloc would also be affected.

However, if the UK increases its food standards to a point that exceeds European Union guidelines, then it would be up to the EU to meet those requirements if it wants to sell to the British market.

Extinction and Livestock Karl Falkenberg speaking at Compassion in World Farming's Extinction and Livestock Conference.

Yet both Falkenberg and Johnson admit that animal welfare and farming practices aren’t always at the top of politicians’ agendas.

Environment secretary Michael Gove told a party conference fringe meeting he was aware of concerns and was committed to ensuring animal welfare standards in the UK do not slip after Brexit.

The Tory minister said: “Outside the European Union’s single market, we can improve animal welfare, supporting more humane methods of farming and restricting the live export of animals.”

And while Johnson praised Gove’s goal to restrict live animal exports, he said Theresa May’s government isn’t doing enough about sustainable farming.

The Government said that maintaining safety and public confidence in food available in the UK “is of the highest priority”.

A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.

“Any new products wishing to enter the UK market must comply with our rigorous legislation and standards – we will not compromise on animal welfare and food safety.”

Unlike his son, who was one of the main driving forces behind the Leave campaign, the Johnson was a staunch Remain supporter.

In the run-up to the European Referendum last year, the 77-year-old founded and co-chaired Environmentalists for Europe.

He said: “My position in the run up to the referendum I said let’s stay in.. because the gain is not only the gain in animal welfare in Britain but is the gain in terms of animal welfare throughout Europe as a whole.

“I think this whole question of chlorinate chicken, for example, was an issue… I mean certainly if you look at the way chickens are raised in the United States you do have to say to yourself, ‘look, come on, are we really talking about humane treatment of animals?’.”

Tracey CoxTracey Cox, sexóloga y experta en relaciones, indica que el punto G ""está, supuestamente, entre 5 y 8 centímetros en el interior de la vagina, en la pared vaginal frontal"".
El punto G suele estar en la pared vaginal frontal, entre la abertura vaginal y el cuello del útero.
Y concluye: ""El hecho de que la gente crea o no crea en el punto G no importa realmente.","La ciencia lleva años pregonando la importancia del punto G para alcanzar el orgasmo femenino, pero parece que mucha gente aún no sabe dónde se encuentra.

De hecho, esta es la pregunta sobre sexo más repetida en el buscador de Google entre adultos de 18 a 65 años, según demuestra un estudio de Durex, que también revela que más de un tercio (un 34%) de los jóvenes de entre 18 y 24 años no tiene confianza para hablar sobre sexo. De ahí que acudan en masa a buscar respuestas en Internet.

Por todo ello, la edición británica del HuffPost se ha puesto en contacto con varias expertas para llegar al fondo del asunto.

Según Alix Fox, experta de Durex, el punto G es la forma reducida de decir ""punto Gräfenberg"", nombre que toma del ginecólogo alemán que empezó a investigar sobre ello en los años 50.

""Los científicos no se ponen de acuerdo en si el punto G existe como una estructura anatómica real (como un clítoris interno) o si es simplemente una zona especialmente sensible para muchas mujeres"", señala. ""Lo que sí que se sabe con certeza es que estimular esa zona produce placer y puede llevar a las mujeres a tener orgasmos maravillosos"".

No todas las mujeres tienen un punto G, pero el 60% de ellas sí. Annabelle Knight

Annabelle Knight, sexóloga y experta en relaciones de Lovehoney, se encuentra entre quienes aseguran que el punto G es muy real: ""Ha habido estudios que han puesto en entredicho su existencia, pero ya han sido sobradamente refutados. No todas las mujeres tienen un punto G, pero el 60% de ellas sí"".

Aunque se suele hablar del punto G como una clave para que la mujer llegue al orgasmo, Samantha Evans, dueña del sex shop Jo Divine, asegura que no es lo único que lo puede provocar: ""Cuando se estimula el punto G, la mujer puede sentir como si necesitara hacer pipí, y por eso algunas mujeres reniegan de esa sensación, que confunden con las ganas de orinar"".

""Esa la sensación que viene antes de la eyaculación femenina. Algunas mujeres eyaculan cuando estimulan su punto G, algo que mejora la experiencia. La eyaculación femenina surge en las glándulas parauretrales, que se encuentran en los tejidos esponjosos que rodean la uretra"", aclara.

¿Dónde está el punto G?

No hay consenso a la hora de situar la zona exacta en la que está el punto G, aunque estas expertas coinciden en señalar que las mujeres tienden a sentir más placer en la pared vaginal frontal.

El punto G está, supuestamente, entre 5 y 8 centímetros en el interior de la vagina, en la pared vaginal frontal. Tracey Cox

Tracey Cox, sexóloga y experta en relaciones, indica que el punto G ""está, supuestamente, entre 5 y 8 centímetros en el interior de la vagina, en la pared vaginal frontal"". ""La zona del punto G sobresale ligeramente, pero solo cuando las glándulas que están en torno a la uretra se hinchan"", especifica.

Sin embargo, la experta hace hincapié que la localización exacta del punto G varía dependiendo de cada mujer.

Knight sugiere que las mujeres se lo encuentren ellas mismas antes de intentar estimularlo con sus parejas: ""La forma más fácil de localizar el punto G de cada una es tumbarse de espaldas e introducir el dedo corazón en la vagina. El punto G suele estar en la pared vaginal frontal, entre la abertura vaginal y el cuello del útero. Debería ser un poco rugoso, casi como la superficie de una nuez"".

¿Cómo se puede estimular el punto G?

Según Tracey Cox, en general las parejas prefieren estimular la pared vaginal entera en vez de buscar un escurridizo botón de placer que quizás exista o quizás no: ""La técnica habitual para estimular el punto G de tu pareja es meter los dedos y curvarlos hacia arriba como si estuvieras haciendo un gesto de 'ven aquí"".

Knight añade que algunos hombres tienen una ligera curvatura en el pene erecto que puede ayudar a estimular la pared vaginal frontal.

""Las mujeres pueden sacarle partido a esa curvatura escogiendo una postura que favorezca que su pene impacte con el punto G al penetrar"", señala. ""Si tiene un pene recto, también hay posturas que maximizan las posibilidades de estimular el punto G"". ""La mariposa es una buena opción. Te recuestas en una mesa mientras él, de pie, te penetra. Te tiene que agarrar bajo las caderas para que pueda sujetarte bien. Esta posición debería servir para dirigir su pene directamente a tu punto G"", propone.

¿Cómo me puedo estimular el punto G yo misma?

Samantha Evans asegura que una de las mejores formas de estimular el punto G es utilizar un juguete sexual curvado, algo para lo que no hace falta tener compañía: ""Pruébalo a lo largo de todo el mes, ya que los cambios hormonales que se producen en tu cuerpo pueden tener un efecto positivo en tus niveles de sensibilidad y excitación sexual"".

""Date primero un masaje vulvar o anal y, cuando veas que empiezas a estar suficientemente excitada para tener un orgasmo, o justo cuando acabes de tener uno, métete el dedo corazón en la vagina y cúrvalo haciendo el gesto de 'ven aquí' para acariciar la pared frontal"", plantea.

""Busca entre 3 y 6 centímetros en el interior de la vagina y presiona con firmeza. La zona del punto G se nota rugosa y se estimula con más presión que el clítoris"".

""Mueve los dedos por la zona y prueba distintos tipos de contacto. Intenta ver a través de la piel y percibir cómo va cambiando el tono muscular"", añade.

Todas las expertas con las que ha contactado el HuffPost han subrayado también que, ya sea un ""botón"" de placer o simplemente una zona más sensible, prestarle demasiada atención puede provocar el efecto contrario al deseado.

""No te obsesiones con tener un punto G, limítate a disfrutar de las sensaciones placenteras del sexo"", recuerda Evans. Y concluye: ""El hecho de que la gente crea o no crea en el punto G no importa realmente. Lo que de verdad importa es disfrutar del fantástico placer del sexo"".

J'ai réfléchi à des recettes pas trop difficiles, rapides et qui permettent de recycler certains plats que l'on mange chez soi.

Dans la mesure du possible, j'ai essayé de composer avec des légumes cuits et crus, des protéines animales et/ou végétales, des féculents, un laitage, un fruit frais ou cuit.

Voilà donc à quoi va ressembler ma semaine de déjeuners faits-maison:

Lundi 9 octobre: cuisiner les restes du poulet du dimanche

On a toujours besoin de deux cuillères en bois pour faire un bon poulet rôti.

Pour cuisiner les restes de poulet rôti du dimanche midi, je prépare une mini quiche poireau et poulet. Vous pouvez la faire en version normale en triplant les quantités. Elle se congèle très bien. Elle sera accompagnée d'une salade de carottes râpées. En dessert, ce sera du fromage blanc et une pomme.

Faites préchauffer votre four à 180°C. Effilochez l'équivalent d'un blanc de poulet. Coupez le poireau en fines rondelles, faites revenir à la poêle pendant cinq minutes dans un peu d'huile d'olive, salez, poivrez. Dans un saladier battez les œufs, mélangez le lait, ajoutez de la noix de la muscade si vous avez, salez, poivrez. Étalez la pâte feuilletée, piquez-la, versez les rondelles de poireau, ajoutez le poulet et versez par-dessus le mélange lait - œuf. Parsemez de gruyère et enfournez pendant 15 minutes. Pendant ce temps-là, râpez deux carottes. Pour l'assaisonnement, une vinaigrette classique: moutarde, vinaigre, huile d'olive.

Mardi 10 octobre: pimper ses pâtes pour le lendemain midi

Lundi soir, c'est un bon plat de pâtes qui m'attend. J'en fais un peu plus pour pouvoir les transformer pour le repas de mardi en gratin en m'inspirant d'une recette du livre ""Pasta cake"" de Christelle Huet-Gomez aux éditions Marabout. Du fromage blanc et une poire en dessert.

Faites préchauffer votre four à 180°C. Coupez la feta en dés, les olives en rondelle et les cœurs d'artichaut en deux. Mélangez le tout avec les pâtes cuites à la sauce tomate. Salez, poivrez. Versez dans un moule, parsemez de gruyère et enfournez pendant 15 minutes.

Lavez de la roquette, finissez la vinaigrette de la veille.

Mercredi 11 octobre: faire une salade presque comme au resto libanais

Ça devrait ressembler à un truc de ce genre pour mercredi midi.

Ce mercredi, je suis sûre que je vais commencer à fléchir et à rêver d'un bon traiteur libanais pour ma pause déjeuner. On fait donc un repas froid, simple, inspiré d'une recette du livre ""Simplissime Salades Complètes"" de Jean-François Mallet chez Hachette Cuisine.

Mélangez un avocat coupé en morceaux, le concombre en bâtonnets, des miettes de thon, le jus d'un demi citron, les pois chiches rincés et égouttés. Épluchez et coupez en fines rondelles l'oignon rouge. Ciselez du persil, de la coriandre, de la menthe selon votre goût (ajoutez-les au dernier moment). A côté, un peu de houmous et du pain pita.

En dessert, du raisin.

Jeudi 12 octobre: réussir des wraps aussi instagrammables que bons

Tout pareil mais sans le poulet, sans la tomate, sans les épinards et sans l'emballage.

Voilà qui va nous permettre de finir pas mal de choses utilisées plus tôt dans la semaine: les artichauts, les herbes aromatiques, l'oignon rouge, du houmous, de l'avocat, de la salade.

Dans une tortilla, mettez une bonne quantité de houmous, coupez l'avocat en tranches, égouttez les artichauts, coupez-en deux, découpez l'oignon en fines tranches, ajoutez de la salade. Roulez l'ensemble et découpez-le en tronçon, piquez d'un cure-dent. Si vous craignez d'avoir faim, ajoutez des blancs de poulet.

En dessert : une compote de poire et pomme au micro-ondes du bureau. Coupez les deux fruits en petits morceaux. Placez un plat adapté au micro-ondes et faites chauffer pendant deux fois huit minutes. Mélangez au milieu.

Vendredi 13 octobre: vendredi c'est veggie

Et on termine en beauté avec un dahl express de lentilles corail, avec une bonne salade et du pain pita. Pour la recette, je me suis inspirée de celle-ci sur le blog Papilles et pupilles.

Épluchez et pressez (ou coupez le plus petit possible) une gousse d'ail, coupez l'oignon très finement. Dans une grande poêle, versez un peu d'huile d'olive, mettez l'ail, l'oignon, une cuillère à café de gingembre (frais ou en poudre), deux brins de thym. Après 5 minutes ajoutez le concentré de tomate, du piment (si vous aimez ça!) et une cuillère à café de garam massala, ce mélange d'épices indiennes que vous trouverez à côtés des currys.

Versez 140g de lentilles crues, ajoutez 450ml d'eau. Laissez mijoter une douzaine de minutes. Prévoyez un peu de coriandre fraîche à ciseler au-dessus.

En dessert, du fromage blanc et ce qu'il reste de fruit.

Victoire, nous sommes les kings et queens du déjeuner fait maison.

NEW DELHI -- Lashing out at critics of his economic policies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the Indian economy was on firm footing and that he will never jeopardise the country's future for immediate gains.

In an over hour-long speech, punctuated with sharp comments and comparisons with a track record of previous UPA regime, Modi told a gathering of company secretaries that his government will continue reforms and will not hesitate to take decisions to reverse the GDP slowdown witnessed in the last two quarters.

In the same vein, he said his government will graciously accept criticism on the economic front and will make amends wherever necessary.

Inaugurating the Golden Jubilee Year Celebrations of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI), Modi said he has asked the GST Council to identify bottlenecks and technological hurdles faced by businesses, especially small and medium enterprises.

""I will not jeopardise the future of the country for my present gains,"" he said, adding the government would focus on structural reforms rather than giving doles to win praises.

Modi said his critics were seeing slowdown in the last two quarters but were ignoring the fact that the BJP government had brought down inflation from 10% in the UPA regime to 2.5%, shrunk Current Account Deficit to near 1% from 4% and brought down fiscal deficit to 3.5% from 4.5%.

GDP growth was 5.7% or less than that on eight occasions during previous UPA government, he said, lamenting how pessimists were describing the April-June growth of 5.7% as doomsday.

Modi made comments days after senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in an article headlined ""I need to speak up now"", described the economy as a ""mess"" that will not resuscitate before the next general elections.

""The government is committed to reverse this trend ... we are capable of that and ready to take decisions,"" Modi said, adding the decisions taken by the government will take India to a new growth trajectory.

Noting that his government has been criticised on economic front, Modi said: ""We are a sensitive government. We accept the strongest criticism and we have considered them with humility ... 125 crore people have an expectation of high growth"".

Quoting the RBI, the prime minister said the growth is expected to improve to 7.7% in the last quarter of the fiscal.

According to the RBI, the economic growth, which had slipped to 5.7 in the first quarter, is likely to improve to 6.4% in second, 7.1% in third and 7.7% in the last quarter.

Observing that the number of EPFO subscribers has gone up from 3.26 crore in 2014-end to 4.80 crore, the prime minister said this cannot happen without an increase in job creation.

Modi further said the NDA government in the last three years has undertaken 87 reforms in 21 sectors and the country has come out of ""policy paralysis"" to become a nation of ""policymaker and policy implementor"".

The prime minister said there was a time when India was part of 'fragile-5' and the BJP government pulled it out to make it the fastest growing economy for the most part of its three-year rule.

The government, he said, was aware that the growth has slowed and is taking steps to improve it.

The government, he said, is ready to make amends to help small traders.

Modi said registration of 2.1 lakh out of 3 lakh suspected shell companies identified post note ban have been canceled in a crackdown on the black money.

Immer mehr Menschen greifen zu Vitaminpräparaten anstatt zu frischem Obst und sind der Meinung, sich so gesund zu ernähren. Das ist nicht immer der Fall, denn wie eine Untersuchung jetzt zeigt, nehmen viele Menschen dadurch Vitamine in einer viel zu hohen Dosierung zu sich. Vitamine sind zwar gesund, wenn sie in der richtigen Menge zugeführt werden, oft werden sie aber viel zu hoch dosiert, wie die Stiftung Warentest jetzt herausgefunden hat.

Kaum Kontrolle

Anders als bei Medikamenten wird der Handel mit Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln deutlich weniger reguliert. Es gibt in Deutschland keine Regel, die die Dosis an Vitaminpräparaten eingrenzt, aber das ist offenbar dringend erforderlich. Jedem, der sich über einen Vitaminratgeber informiert, sollte schnell klar sein, dass zusätzliche Vitamine nicht in jedem Fall notwendig sind. Viele Lebensmittel, die täglich auf den Tisch kommen, sind mit Vitaminen angereichert, außerdem essen viele Menschen frisches Obst, wenn auch unregelmäßig. Dazu kommt, dass der Markt für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel mehr als groß ist. Wer sich mit den vermeintlich gesunden Vitaminen in Tablettenform versorgen möchte, der verliert sehr schnell den Überblick. Studien, die es zu diesem Thema gibt, sind leider oftmals nicht sehr hilfreich. Sie schüren teilweise die Angst vor Krankheiten, die entstehen können, wenn Vitamine fehlen.

Gut informiert mit der Stiftung Warentest

Die Stiftung Warentest hat sich die angebotenen Vitaminpräparate in ihrer aktuellen Ausgabe einmal genauer angesehen. Im Artikel ist unter anderem eine Tabelle zu finden, in der die 35 am häufigsten gekauften Vitaminpräparate in Deutschland aufgeführt sind. Der Leser kann sich auf diese Weise einfach, übersichtlich und vor allem ausführlich über den Namen des Produkts wie über den Preis und die empfohlene Tagesdosis informieren. Zudem bietet die Stiftung Warentest genaues Hintergrundwissen. Was ist beim Einkauf von Vitaminpräparaten besonders wichtig und welche gesetzlichen Vorgaben gibt es eigentlich für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel? Ausführlich berichtet die Stiftung Warentest zudem über die einzelnen Vitamine A, C, D, E, K sowie die B-Vitamine, und wofür der Körper sie benötigt.

Sind Vitamine als Nahrungsergänzung sinnvoll?

Rund 30 % der Menschen in Deutschland nehmen mehr oder weniger regelmäßig Vitaminpräparate zu sich. Sie fürchten sich davor, unterversorgt zu sein und dass die Ration an Obst nicht ausreicht, um den Vitaminhaushalt zu decken. In den meisten Fällen ist diese Sorge unbegründet. Leider ersetzt die Vitamintablette allein zudem keine gesunde ausgewogene Ernährung mit Obst und Gemüse. Die tägliche Dosis Vitamine kann aber auch hilfreich sein. Menschen, die krank sind oder wenn der Arzt es verordnet, können ihren Mangel an Vitaminen mit den entsprechenden Mitteln ausgleichen. Wie so oft, gilt auch hier: Die Dosis macht das Gift. Zu viele Vitamine wirken kontraproduktiv und sind nicht mehr gesund, zu wenige Vitamine hingegen lösen Mangelerscheinungen hervor.

TORONTO — Two Ontario cabinet ministers announced Friday they won't seek re-election next year, adding to a growing tally of prominent Liberals bowing out at a time when the party struggles in the polls.

Both Deputy Premier Deb Matthews and Treasury Board President Liz Sandals, however, insist that is not the reason for their upcoming departures.

Matthews will remain as the Liberals' campaign co-chair through the election, saying she has enormous respect for Premier Kathleen Wynne.

""I am confident that, on June 7, 2018, the people of Ontario will give her and her team the mandate to continue to serve,"" Matthews wrote in a statement Friday.

Various polls would suggest a different outcome, however, with most putting the Liberals behind the Progressive Conservatives, and one survey even putting the Liberals in third, behind the NDP.

Sandals, 70, stressed that her 30 years of service and her age were behind her decision to retire.

""This was a challenging decision to make because while I'm ready to be a full-time grandmother, I've never had more faith in Premier Kathleen Wynne and the Ontario Liberal Party,"" she wrote in a statement.

""Over the last several months, I've spent time knocking on doors across Guelph and I know that our policies are resonating with my constituents.""

Other key figures not seeking re-election

Matthews, who was elected in 2003, will stay as the representative for London North Centre and as advanced education minister until the election. Sandals, who first got into politics through her local school board and was elected to the legislature in 2003, will stay as the representative for Guelph, Ont., and in cabinet until the election, too.

Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid announced last month that he would not run in next year's provincial election.

Mais, en l'occurrence et à y regarder de plus près, la comparaison des deux verbatims et situations n'est pas totalement raison. Il y a certes de réelles similitudes de forme (au moins trois), mais aussi de nettes et importantes différences (au moins trois aussi, de forme et de fond).

Les trois similitudes d'abord. La première est l'apparent dérapage, d'un propos presque privé et non maîtrisé. Dans les deux cas, sur le terrain rural corrézien pour l'actuel Président, au Salon de l'agriculture pour l'ancien, la saillie verbale est apparue colérique, en tout cas ""lâchée"" sans retenue. Deuxième similitude de situation, les mots ont pu communément choquer, le langage grossier étant difficilement compatible, en France, avec la fonction suprême de l'Etat. Le trumpisme a eu beau, récemment, exporter le principe de l'outrance verbale présidentielle, les deux Présidents Français ont bien été critiqué par l'usage de ces ""gros"" mots qu'on a du mal à accepter quand ils sont prononcés par un chef de l'Etat en exercice.

Une même radicalité protestataire face à eux

Troisième point de similitude : dans les deux cas, c'est une radicalité protestataire et populaire, qui a enclenché le courroux présidentiel et le dérapage langagier. Un Président soumis à pression de manifestants, c'est le choc commun provoqué par ces deux épisodes, qui réunit les deux hôtes de l'Elysée dans le risque de l'isolement dans un Palais présidentiel coupé des réalités.

Mais au-delà de ces similitudes, trois différences majeures viennent distinguer la parole macronienne de celle de Sarkozy. La première, importante, est que Nicolas Sarkozy, lui, n'avait pas hésité à employer l'injure, et l'injure personnelle, nominative: le ""casses-toi pauv' con"" visait bien une personne précise. Dans le cas d'Emmanuel Macron, rien de tout cela. L'analyse du texte ne fait pas ressortir d'injure, le propos visant par ailleurs un collectif impersonnel, et indéterminé: ceux qui ""feraient mieux"" de chercher du travail plutôt que de faire du ""bordel"". Circonstance aggravante ou atténuante? Chacun jugera mais Emmanuel Macron, du point de vue langagier, n'est pas allé aussi loin que Nicolas Sarkozy, laissant peut-être à un autre épisode (ou à d'autres personnes) le dérapage de l'insulte.

Le Sarkozy du clivage permanent contre le Macron de l'anti-clivage idéologique

La deuxième grande différence réside dans le sujet qui a provoqué l'îre présidentielle. Dans le cas Sarkozy, c'est la manifestation d'une hostilité directe et personnelle à l'endroit du Président, qui a provoqué sa réplique, tout autant hostile et directe. Dans le cas Macron, ce sont certes des manifestations mais, au-delà, c'est la question sociale des emplois, ceux qui sont détruits et ceux qui sont à retrouver, qui a été au cœur de la polémique. En cet épisode, le décryptage du dérapage apparent est d'ailleurs autrement plus intéressant. Car il renvoie à la conception qu'on peut se faire du sujet de la destruction-reconstruction d'emplois dans une économie moderne. C'est pour cela, aussi, que l'actuel Président n'a pas vraiment tenu à s'excuser. C'est peut-être pour cela qu'on peut aussi estimer, quelques indices le laissant clairement transparaître, que le dérapage n'était qu'apparent, l'actuel chef de l'Etat ayant manifestement bien vu qu'une caméra pouvait le filmer et l'enregistrer. Ce Président est peut-être jeune mais il a appris, encore plus jeune, avec sa future épouse, le grand art de la mise en scène théâtrale.

Enfin, troisième et grande différence avec Sarkozy. Ce dernier avait théorisé, instrumentalisé et fini par surexploiter jusqu'à l'usure, le clivage permanent et répété, l'hystérisation volontaire du débat, écoutant beaucoup (trop) l'un des doctrinaires du clivage provocateur appliqué aux enjeux de société et aux questions dîtes ""identitaires"", Patrick Buisson, formé à l'école Le Pen père. Chez Emmanuel Macron, la théorie est présente mais inverse: pour le Président actuel, ce n'est pas une position ""ultra"" qu'il faut incarner, pour tenter de rallier ensuite des courants satellites dans un sillage de conquête (une stratégie qui a échoué en 2012 et aux primaires de la droite en 2016), c'est au contraire une posture du rassemblement ""et gauche, et droite"" qui a fait sa marque de fabrique et l'ample succès de la présidentielle de 2017, confirmée aux législatives qui ont suivi. L'homme du clivage idéologique d'un côté, l'homme de l'anti-clivage idéologique de l'autre: au-delà des paroles qui dérapent, et des tactiques d'une théâtralisation commune, la différence reste majeure.

This is Jagmeet Singh, the new leader of the federal New Democrats.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh arrives to his first caucus meeting since being elected to the leadership of the New Democrats, in Ottawa on Oct. 4, 2017.

The 38-year-old's victory in his party's leadership race has been hailed as a win for diversity and representation in politics. He's been called youthful, charismatic and energetic, but he's also been talked about in less, shall we say, commonplace ways:

'He's an alpha'

Behold what The Globe and Mail's Margaret Wente said, for example, in a column published the day after his leadership win. After declaring that Singh is ""hotter"" than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and has a ""brilliant branding device"" in his turbans, she writes:

""He has the posture of a warrior — brash, worldly, fearless and also supermanly. Not a beta male, as Justin sometimes tends to be. He's an alpha, with a full luxuriant beard and a serious kirpan to match.""

At the end of her column, Wente wonders if we could get the two of them in an MMA match. Are you there, God? It's Margaret, and she has a wonderful idea.

'A headache'

Over at the Toronto Sun, columnist Lorne Gunter describes Singh as bad news for the prime minister and great news for the Conservatives. He argues the NDP leader will be a ""headache"" for Trudeau because he is younger, ""smarter, at least as well-dressed and even more of a trendy, politically correct symbol.""

""Singh is as distinctive for his designer suits and immaculately tied turban as the Liberal leader is for his dandy socks,"" he writes.

'An Obama-like leader'

The National Post's John Ivison also sees Singh as potential good news for the NDP and Conservatives, especially if he can galvanize left-leaning voters who opted for the Liberals in the 2015 federal election.

Ivison argues Singh is an ""Obama-like leader"" who has ""interpreted his race as a social construct, not a biological reality."" He then points out there are doubts whether Singh is ""all pink turban and no perspicacity.""

'A dreamboat'

Slide back to The Globe and we find television critic John Doyle writing about Singh and...television, sort of? The columnist starts off his Tuesday piece by saying that although the soon-to-be-former Ontario MPP has yet to perfect his live-TV performance, he is already ""masterful"" in his use of visual imagery.

""What emanates from him is cosmopolitan masculinity, virility, style, confidence, ease with himself and empathy. He has sex appeal,"" Doyle writes.

""He is, to a lot of people, especially millennials, a dreamboat.""

Doyle lauds Singh for his reaction to a heckler who yelled at him about Shariah law at a campaign event in Ontario. He says the video of that moment is ""rich in meaning and fascination.""

'Spring chicken'

Finally, at the Toronto Star, columnist Emma Teitel describes the NDP leader as ""practically an adolescent"" when compared to Trudeau and other MPs, but points out that he is not the only ""spring chicken in the federal political coop.""

""Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is also 38 (though like most conservatives, his soul is around 83),"" Teitel wrote in Monday's piece.

""And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned 45 last year — decrepit for a music festival attendee, but a fledgling in the political arena.""

Nous l'avions tous imaginé avec plus ou moins de précision. C'est un dénouement qui ne surprend personne car tous les éléments y conduisaient: une marche arrière du gouvernement catalan (govern) était tout aussi impensable qu'une concession du gouvernement de Mariano Rajoy pour trouver une solution politique et éviter l'intervention des forces de l'ordre. Nous avons tous regardé venir la tempête avec incrédulité et notre esprit romanesque espérait peut-être que les événements prendraient un tour inattendu et que tout reviendrait à la normale au dernier moment. Mais nous ne sommes pas dans une fiction et aucun héros n'est venu nous sauver; les événements du 1er octobre sont la triste preuve qu'il vaut mieux nous contenter de la dure réalité.

De fait, le réalisme nous fait défaut depuis des mois déjà. Si seulement nous avions accepté de reconnaître qu'un nationalisme catalan existe depuis longtemps et qu'une grande partie de la société catalane demande à ce que la question soit soumise au vote démocratique, en particulier depuis 2010 (date à laquelle la cour constitutionnelle a fait échouer la réforme du statut d'autonomie négocié entre le parlement espagnol et le parlement catalan). Mais au lieu de reconnaître cette réalité sociale, ceux qui affirment représenter l'Etat de droit se sont retranchés derrière les murailles des formalités juridiques et oublient que les lois n'ont que faire de l'approbation de la société. Ce sont des mécanismes pour réguler les conflits qui ne manquent pas d'apparaître dans une société. Si d'autres conflits auxquels le législateur n'est pas préparé surgissent, des mécanismes différents entre en œuvre.

Ce qui s'est passé dimanche dernier est un exemple des conséquences néfastes d'une application aveugle de la loi. Ce dénouement était prévisible. Pourtant, personne ne veut l'admettre... Personne? Permettez-moi d'en douter. Si l'on a l'esprit mal tourné, il n'est pas insensé d'imaginer que les deux camps s'attendaient à ce qui s'est produit, et qu'ils l'ont même provoqué. Mais il se trouve que presque personne n'avait prévu de telles conséquences. Le gouvernement central cherchait à afficher son autorité et à étouffer les prétentions indépendantistes mais il a fini par perdre l'appui d'une bonne partie de l'opinion publique internationale. Quant au govern, il voulait isoler définitivement la Catalogne, mais ses citoyens se sont mis à espérer à nouveau une transformation au niveau de l'Etat espagnol.

Tout miser sur des élections n'aide pas à canaliser la haine engendrée par tout cela.

Même les partis Catalunya en Comù et Podemos avaient des raisons de désirer ce scénario en secret. Pour les formations d'Ada Colau et de Pablo Iglesias, la seule légitimité du 1er octobre était de mobilier les citoyens pour revendiquer le droit à organiser un référendum encadré. Cependant, rien dans la manière dont les événements se sont déroulés n'invitait à cette interprétation; de nombreux défenseurs du référendum étaient sincèrement persuadés de l'imminence historique de l'indépendance, et le govern s'est montré plus que déterminé. S'il y avait eu un minimum de contrôle des listes électorales et du vote, la république catalane aurait été acclamée avant minuit. L'appel au vote de Podemos et Catalunya en Comù semblait donc contradictoire. La seule condition pour que l'hypothèse de la mobilisation sociale soit valide était que la guardia civil et la police nationale sèment la confusion, et elles l'ont fait assez violemment pour rassembler la société contre le gouvernement de Madrid. Le rêve de transversalité, atteint grâce à une erreur de Rajoy. Quel paradoxe tragique!

La formation d'un nouveau front transversal qui s'oppose au gouvernement de Mariano Rajoy incite l'intelligentsia des nouveaux courants politiques à vouloir organiser des élections de toute urgence pour résoudre la crise systémique du pays. Le parti Unidos Podemos sait qu'il peut commencer à peser sérieusement en Catalogne tandis que les Ciudadanos comprennent qu'ils n'ont pas d'autre option s'ils veulent gagner du terrain sur le Parti populaire, sans avoir à attendre que les facteurs démographiques fassent le travail.

Au lieu de s'enfoncer dans l'impasse, il faut que les deux parties reconnaissent qu'il n'y a pas de sortie possible, qu'elles assument la responsabilité de leurs erreurs passées et qu'elles appellent leurs militants à rendre les armes.

Malheureusement, je ne pense pas que ce soit la solution pour la simple raison que tout miser sur des élections n'aide pas à canaliser la haine engendrée par tout cela. Même si l'équilibre des forces change difficilement, on ne peut effacer la haine que de nombreux citoyens espagnols avouent éprouver à l'égard des Catalans, ni le mépris pour un ""royaume"" espagnol jugé irrémédiablement rétrograde par les Catalans. Le raccourci peut sembler facile mais je crois que la haine autour de Piqué est un très bon indicateur. De nombreux Espagnols comparent la question catalane à la situation du joueur. Que faudrait-il pour qu'en dépit du contexte actuel les supporters applaudissent à nouveau les prouesses du défenseur du Barça dans ses matchs avec la sélection espagnole? Vous imaginez?

Selon moi, la politique ordinaire ne peut pas apporter la solution; il faut recourir à des mesures extraordinaires. Le discours de Felipe VI est la dernière preuve que le cadre constitutionnel n'est pas en mesure de neutraliser les émotions en jeu. Inutile d'organiser des élections qui ne feraient que nourrir les sentiments d'opposition, ou des négociations dans lesquelles les informations sont sciemment occultées. Il me semble qu'il est nécessaire d'entamer un processus de réconciliation impliquant toute la communauté politique.

Un processus de réconciliation consiste en une série de mécanismes publics donnant la possibilité à tous les citoyens d'assumer les conséquences du passé et de faire face à l'avenir ensemble. Cela s'est déjà vu dans les sociétés meurtries par des conflits de longue durée, comme en Colombie. La transposition au cas de l'Espagne peut sembler exagérée étant donné l'ampleur et la durée des violences dans ce type de cas. Toutefois, je suis convaincu que le mécanisme est adaptable. Le conflit entre la constitution et la légitimité sociale est insoluble.

Au lieu de s'enfoncer dans l'impasse, il faut que les deux parties reconnaissent qu'il n'y a pas de sortie possible, qu'elles assument la responsabilité de leurs erreurs passées et qu'elles appellent leurs militants à rendre les armes. Cela devrait se traduire par des commissions extraparlementaires investies par les partis, des experts et des représentants de la société civile. Chaque camp doit reconnaître la légitimité de l'autre et assumer un certain nombre de responsabilités: le govern doit admettre qu'il a enfreint les lois parlementaires et manqué de respect aux minorités; le gouvernement central doit reconnaître la mauvaise gestion du 1er octobre ainsi que la nécessité de réformer la cour constitutionnelle car, depuis 2010, le peuple ne lui fait plus confiance pour endosser le rôle de juge ultime dans la cohabitation.

C'est en adoptant une attitude humble que nous pourrons redonner un sens au civisme et à nos institutions. Si nous nous réconcilions tous, alors nous pouvons imaginer qu'un jour Piqué sera applaudi quand il portera le maillot de l'équipe nationale.

After the heady heights of winning all but three of Scotland’s Westminster seats in 2015, Nicola Sturgeon put all her chips on pro-Remain Scots getting behind a second independence referendum in order to escape Brexit.

But the First Minister’s gamble backfired and the party lost a third of its seats, including those of talismanic figures Alex Salmond, Angus Robertson and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.

So, as the SNP membership meets for its annual conference in Glasgow, what next for the party?

The Nats face an attack on two fronts. On one, an increasingly left-wing Labour Party under fresh leadership who will be perfectly positioned to absorb Yes-inclined voters with radical pledges such as the re-nationalisation of rail - which the SNP faithful back in greater numbers than Labour voters.

Secondly, a revived Scottish Conservative Party, under the talented and influential Ruth Davidson, has a foothold in the rural north-east and borders and are making hay from the Scottish Government’s faltering education reforms week-in week-out.

As Brexit looms large, the road ahead is far from clear now the voters have delivered their verdict on Sturgeon’s hasty post-Brexit claim that ‘Indy Ref 2’ was then “highly likely”.

Ruth Davidson’s ruthlessly efficient attack line – “get on with the day job” – could prove lethal if the SNP is unable to shake criticism the party is obsessed with the constitution.

But with the vote split across three main parties in Scotland, it is all to play for. The troops now have to figure out a formula that will shore up potential losses while remaining in government at Holyrood.

It would be premature for anyone, least of all Davidson, to declare we have reached ‘peak SNP’.

A YouGov poll for the Times sees Sturgeon’s party way out ahead on 35 percent, impressive for a party which has been in power for a decade, while Labour enjoys a 5 percent boost in support and the Tories are pushed from second to third place at Holyrood.

Ministers would point to support for their new programme for government, unveiled in September, which, after months of divisive campaigning, saw the First Minister take a more consensual approach.

Policies on business tax reform, extending free personal care to the under-65s, a ban on fracking, consulting with local government on education reform and a new National Investment Bank will quell some of the criticism levelled at her from left and right.

Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall after the Corbyn surge south of the border, Sturgeon also performed something of a U-turn and pledged to lift the public sector pay cap, too.

What she hasn’t spelled out is how she will pay for it, with her Finance Secretary Derek Mackay expected to trigger emergency borrowing measures - something Conservative backers who lend the SNP their vote may take a dim view of in the long term.

But despite furiously attempting to square all these circles, Mackay insists the party is up for the fight.

“I think the party is still positive and upbeat and we have a strong and united membership,” says Mackay, who will chair this year’s conference. “We are the ones who have returned from the summer recess with our tails up.

“It is the opposition that look tired and weary.”

With more than 118,000 members, the SNP is thought to be the second largest party in the UK, with Scottish Labour having just a fraction of that figure (21,500 to UK Labour’s 570,000) and the Tories as a UK group reported to have fewer than 100,000, though no official figures have emerged since 2013.

But as the SNP has recorded a drop from 120,000 in 2014 when the party put on around 100,000 members post-independence campaign, chiefs are searching for growth opportunities in order to survive into the future.

Mackay went on: “The Tory surge is well and truly over, their bubble has burst. They have fallen back into third place in Scotland in opinion polls and in membership.”

While Mackay would insist the SNP’s ten years in power have been “transformational”, scores would disagree.

Tax measures remain almost identical to those administered in England, despite promises of bold reform, economic growth sees the nation lagging behind other parts of the UK and despite Sturgeon staking her premiership on delivering better education outcomes, Scotland’s PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) ratings slump to below England, Estonia, Finland and Slovenia.

Labour frequently accuses Sturgeon of failing to fully use all of the welfare powers devolved to Edinburgh - though she will attempt to mitigate the impact of Universal Credit - and SNP voters who jumped ship to Corbyn’s Labour in June would say the party has failed to deliver on their promise of leading a progressive government.

Motions at the conference next week, put forward by various branches, seek to bolster the party’s leftist credentials.

While the party is already investigating a universal basic income, motions at the conference also call for the devolution of immigration controls, a resolution on treating drug misuse as public health rather than criminal matters and there will be a groundswell of support for Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald’s bid to outlaw unpaid trial shifts with a private members bill in Westminster.

Maintaining their left of centre stance is good politics, considering Scottish Labour looks set to elect Corbyn-support Richard Leonard as its next leader.

A Survation poll of SNP voters found they were more likely to vote Labour if it pledged more left-wing measures such as decommissioning Trident (30 percent), a mandatory living wage (37 percent) and renationalising the railways (27 percent).

Mackay said: “We have tried to show we are still radical and that we can deliver reforms. Our programme for government also shows that we are listening and engaging while also acting in the interests of the economy.”

The YouGov poll showed three quarters of Scots (72 percent) were pessimistic about the current state of the Brexit negotiations, while the number of Scots who believe that the Leave vote was the wrong decision has grown since April.



Excluding don’t knows, 66 percent of Scots thought Brexit was the wrong decision.

The same poll, however, showed virtually no shift in support for independence since Scotland voted No in 2014 by 55 percent and a surge in support for the pro-Union Scottish Labour Party.

Sturgeon’s strategy was to link a “hard Tory Brexit” so closely with a re-run of the independence poll, the issue must now be handled with extreme care if the party is to stem the flow of votes to their rivals.

Talk of ‘Indy Ref 2’ has been firmly put on the back burner, with senior figures even urging for the second poll to be kicked further down the road, from pre-Brexit to post-Brexit transition period.

Though this is not a shift in party policy - Alex Salmond positioned the party as pro-European in the 90s - voters were riled by Sturgeon’s “opportunistic” use of the Brexit vote to further the independence cause.

The failed approach has also led to calls for chief executive Peter Murrell, Sturgeon’s husband, to stand down.

Despite losing his Moray seat, Robertson will stay on as deputy leader, while former investment Skye and Lochaber MP Ian Blackford takes on the job of Westminster leader.

Should support for Sturgeon continue to wane among the public, party insiders say “leader in waiting” Robertson may soon find a way into Holyrood - either via a by-election or in 2021.

Robertson in the meantime will turn his talents to building the next case for independence, which must be watertight on its economics.

One of the resolutions is for a Bank of Scotland, suggesting the independence movement could back a breakaway national bank with its own ‘Scottish pound’.

Young firebrand Mhairi Black has previously said she would be prepared to play a leading role in the next independence campaign.

But, with the wider economic picture and the Brexit negotiations with Europe still so unclear, noone in the party is yet willing to champion a ‘Brexit or Independence’ manifesto.

Mackay said: “After the Westminster elections, the First Minister herself said that we would revisit the issue [of a second independence referendum] in light of Brexit.”

However, he added that scepticism for Brexit was growing UK-wide, hinting the SNP’s strategy would not change substantially.",What Next For Nicola Sturgeon's SNP After Their General Election Pummeling?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/07/nicola-sturgeon-snp_n_18211134.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Le domicile social sera transféré de Barcelone à Valence (sud-est) afin d'assurer ""la protection des clients, actionnaires et employés"" et de sauvegarder sa ""sécurité juridique et réglementaire"", précise la banque, dont le cours en Bourse a lourdement chuté cette semaine, alors que les autorités séparatistes menacent de déclarer l'indépendance unilatéralement. Ce changement ""n'implique pas de mouvements d'employés"", souligne-t-elle.

Banco de Sabadell, la cinquième banque espagnole, et le groupe Gas Natural ont eux aussi décidé de transférer leurs sièges sociaux hors de Catalogne, pour les mêmes raisons.

Banque après banque...

La puissante CaixaBank, emblématique en Catalogne comme ailleurs en Espagne, explique aussi vouloir ""garantir à tout moment sa présence dans la zone euro, sous la supervision de la Banque centrale européenne (BCE)"", qui représente pour elle une source vitale de financement. Une éventuelle indépendance de la Catalogne pourrait remettre en cause cette présence en excluant cette région de l'Union européenne.

La décision permettra de ""maintenir le flux de crédits aux familles et aux entreprises en Catalogne et dans le reste de l'Espagne, et de préserver l'intégrité des dépôts de (ses) clients"", assure la banque. La société a été confrontée ces derniers jours à des retraits d'argent de la part de ses clients dont l'ampleur est encore inconnue mais qui commençaient à susciter des craintes de panique bancaire.

En cause: les ""politiques irresponsables"" de l'exécutif catalan

Le transfert, décidé par le conseil d'administration, a été facilité par un décret adopté dans la matinée par le gouvernement central espagnol, qui dispense les entreprises de réunir en sus une assemblée générale d'actionnaires pour ce type de décision.

Le ministre de l'Economie Luis de Guindos a expliqué avoir pris ce décret en raison des ""politiques irresponsables"" de l'exécutif catalan, qui ""provoquent des alarmes, des inquiétudes, c'est le pire qui puisse arriver dans le monde de l'entreprise"".

Le transfert du siège de CaixaBank à Valence, même purement juridique, est un coup extrêmement dur porté aux indépendantistes étant donné l'influence de la banque, fondée en 1904. CaixaBank, forte de 14 millions de clients et 32.400 employées, détient des participations importantes dans d'autres grandes entreprises, finance de nombreuses bourses, du mécénat culturel et accorde des crédits à des partis politiques.

This is a major policy change from the Obama administration which directed NASA to divert all its efforts to getting humans to Mars.

While Mars is still very much on the agenda, it now looks as though the Moon will become the first step in that journey.

Speaking at the National Space Council meeting, Vice President Pence said that for too long America had not travelled beyond our own orbit.

You can watch the entire speech here:

Initially NASA had planned to test out its Mars mission by sending astronauts to an asteroid, however this will now be scrapped in favour of lunar missions instead.

How will NASA land humans on the Moon?

While there’s no official word from NASA it seems likely that the organisation will simply use the same spacecraft that it is currently developing for Mars: Orion and the Space Launch System rocket.

TOBIAS SCHWARZ via Getty Images

This would also tie in rather nicely with NASA’s recent agreement with Russia’s own space agency Roscosmos to build a Deep Space Gateway space station either on the lunar surface or orbiting around it.

Interestingly, the origins of both Orion and the SLS lie with the Moon. Both programs had initially been given the green light by the Bush administration as part of an earlier restarting of the lunar mission program.

When was the last Moon mission?

The last time humans landed on the Moon was Apollo 17, in 1972.

It was a mission of endings as well, marking the last time that the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V rocket would be used to send humans to the Moon. It was also the last time that humans travelled beyond low-Earth orbit.

Dans ces conditions comment incarner une opposition face à un Président qui prétend appliquer le programme défendu par celui qui fut notre champion lors de la dernière campagne présidentielle?

Nous devons commencer par réfléchir à notre organisation. La majorité des militants Républicains et UDI est aujourd'hui convaincue que la création de l'UMP fut une erreur majeure. Nous avons scié les branches historiques de la droite, gaullisme et centrisme, incarnées par le RPR et l'UDF, pour une entité abstraite sans racines, qui, avec le temps, a vu la gauche et le Front national lui rogner les ailes.

Le RPR était bonapartiste, populaire, social, eurosceptique et jacobin. L'UDF était girondine, européenne et patronale. Les procès en ""droitisation"" ou en ""gauchisation"" n'existaient pas. S'il arrivait à ses partis de s'affronter électoralement, parfois férocement, la nécessité de forger des alliances pour l'emporter à terme, était bien présente à l'esprit de tous leurs membres.

Telle n'est plus la situation. À ce clivage profond fondé sur des convictions, s'est substituée une opposition gauche-droite au sein même de la droite où certains n'hésitent pas à utiliser les arguments et valeurs de la gauche pour faire le procès de tel ou tel. Si notre rôle est de parler aux Français, on n'est jamais élu contre son camp. La primaire de 2016 l'a amplement démontré.

Ceux qui pensent de bonne foi, car ils sont attachés au pragmatisme économique, qu'Emmanuel Macron va dans le bon sens, se trompent et s'en apercevront bientôt. Les ordonnances travail ne sont pas la révolution annoncée et resteront sans effet sur l'économie réelle. Les mesures fiscales, les mesures en matière de logement sont toujours les produits de la machine technocratique de Bercy où les ministres se succèdent sans impact réel. La loi de moralisation de la vie politique fut un exercice d'autodénigrement inutile et dommageable sur le long terme car c'est l'efficacité du politique qui permettra de renouer avec les citoyens et non une transparence dévoyée révélant son indigence.

La droite française a perdu le gaullisme ou plutôt elle l'a abandonné au profit d'un modernisme dépourvu de sens, devenu religion. Malheureusement pour elle, Emmanuel Macron, plus prométhéen que jupitérien en l'occurrence, lui a volé le feu modernisateur, la laissant contempler le sentiment de sa propre inutilité. Afin de parer à cela, je veux remettre du sens dans notre droite. Le sens de la Nation, celui de l'Etat, de l'intérêt général. Mon obsession n'est pas la droite forte mais la France et l'Etat forts. Mon souhait est que notre politique soit celle de l'humain d'abord et non celle des critères du pacte de stabilité européen. Mon espoir est que notre famille soit capable de porter les idées nouvelles sur l'indépendance énergétique, la préservation de notre environnement et le bien-être au travail. Le gaullisme n'est pas populiste, il est populaire ; il n'est pas autoritaire il est fort ; il n'est pas technocratique, il est humain, il n'est pas idéologue, il est pragmatique.

Ma droite est celle de l'enracinement contre le nomadisme, celle de la primauté de la responsabilité individuelle sur la responsabilité collective, celle qui prend en compte le monde tel qu'il est et non tel que l'on aimerait qu'il soit pour élaborer un projet, celle pour qui la Nation est l'horizon indépassable de la démocratie, celle d'une France, française dans sa culture et son histoire et enfin celle d'une France où l'Etat ne dicte pas à chacun, tout le temps, la manière dont il doit vivre sa vie.

Ma droite est gaulliste, nationale, humaniste, sociale, populaire, patriote, volontariste en économie, pro-entrepreneurs et pro-salariés, voilà ce que j'aimerai pour mon parti, voilà le sens de ma candidature.

LEVOTHYROX - Comme un goût de trahison pour Anny Duperey. La comédienne, qui a fermement condamné la nouvelle formule du Levothyrox -traitement pour la thyroïde pour lequel de nombreux patients se plaignent d'effets secondaires- est très en colère contre Élise Lucet et son dernier reportage dans ""Envoyé spécial"".

La reporter a réalisé un documentaire consacré à ce ""fiasco sur ordonnance"" qu'est le nouveau Levothyrox, diffusé jeudi 5 octobre. La comédienne y avait d'ailleurs participé en témoignant. Dans une lettre ouverte destinée à la journaliste, Annie Duperey, qui confirme au HuffPost en être l'auteure, a exprimé son opinion sur le rendu du reportage. Et le message est on ne peut plus clair: elle n'a pas du tout apprécié.

Elle reproche notamment à la journaliste d'avoir privilégié la version du ministère de la Santé plutôt que de mettre en avant la souffrance de ceux qui ont subi les effets secondaires de ce médicament. Elle lui reproche également de ne pas avoir cherché à savoir quels sont les composants de ce nouveau Levothyrox ""qui rend les gens absolument malades"".

Anny Duperey avait déjà exprimé sa colère dans une lettre ouverte, destinée cette fois-ci à la ministre de la Santé Agnès Buzyn. Car les effets secondaires de la nouvelle formule du Levothyrox, en vente depuis avril, prescrit à 3 millions de Français malades de la thyroïde, sont un calvaire pour certains. Depuis douze ans, l'actrice est traitée avec ce médicament pour une hypothyroïdie, autrement dit sa thyroïde ne produit pas assez d'hormones et cela entraîne un ralentissement de son métabolisme.

La comédienne s'émeut particulièrement de l'argument de la fragilité émotionnelle des malades mis en avant par certains spécialistes. ""Je suis particulièrement révoltée lorsque j'ai lu des propos dans le style 'Tout changement est anxiogène...', surtout chez des patients soumis, de par leur pathologie, à des 'troubles de l'humeur' – comme si nous étions des imbéciles influençables, des faibles d'esprit prêts à 'se faire des idées' pour un rien. C'est insultant.""

The wave of demonstrations on the 65th birthday of President Vladimir Putin comes as Navalny serves a 20-day jail term for calling for an unsanctioned protest.

The opposition leader’s headquarters said protests would be held in nearly 80 Russian cities, the Press Association reported.

Rallies numbering from a few dozen to a few hundred people were held in several cities in Russia’s far east and Siberia.

Most of the demonstrations have not been sanctioned by authorities, and police have reportedly detained protesters and activists in some cities.

In Moscow, several hundred protesters, most of them young, gathered in Pushkinskaya Square, waving Russian flags and chanting “Russia will be free!” and “Free Navalny!”

Police warned the demonstrators that the rally has not been sanctioned and urged them to disperse, but did not immediately move to break up the protest.

Police and the National Guard showed up in full force in central Moscow and in St Petersburg, where a rally is set to be held later.

Navalny has declared his intention to run for president in the March election, even though a criminal conviction he calls politically motivated bars him from running.

The 41-year-old anti-corruption crusader has organised several waves of protests this year, casting a challenge to the Kremlin.

Putin has not yet announced his intention to seek re-election, but he is widely expected to run. With his current approval ratings topping 80%, he is set to win another six-year term in a race against torpid veterans of past election campaigns, like Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov.

Navalny argued that a high level of support for Putin results from the lack of real political competition and urged his supporters to help him get registered for the race.

“The 86% approval rating exists in a political vacuum,” he said. “It’s like asking a person who has been fed with rutabaga through his entire life how eatable they find it and the rating will be quite high. Listen, there are other things which are better than rutabaga.”

The sarcastic analogy demonstrated his stinging style, which has recently helped him get broad support among youths. He has worked to expand his reach with videos exposing official corruption and YouTube live broadcasts.

His documentary about prime minister Dmitry Medvedev’s alleged ill-gotten wealth has been viewed nearly 25 million times since its release in early March, helping galvanise protests.",Protests Held In 'Almost 80' Russian Cities On Putin's Birthday Over Presidential Race,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/07/protests-80-russian-cities_n_18211642.html

Die spanische Regierung zeigt sich im Katalonienkonflikt hart und versucht alles, um die Unabhängigkeitsbewegung zu stoppen

Nun verbietet das Verfassungsgericht den Separatisten im Regionalparlament zusammenzukommen

Manche warnen schon vor einem Bürgerkrieg

Die spanische Regierung versucht alles, um die immer schneller rollende Unabhängigkeitsbewegung in Katalonien noch zu stoppen.

Nun gibt es den nächsten Versuch: Wenige Tage vor der erwarteten Unabhängigkeitserklärung der nordwestlichen Region hat das spanische Verfassungsgericht die dafür vorgesehene Sitzung des katalanischen Parlamentes untersagt.

Dies berichteten spanische Medien am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf Justizkreise. Die katalanischen Sozialisten (PSC) - strikte Gegner der Separatisten - hatten Beschwerde gegen die geplante Sitzung eingereicht, weil sie die Verfassung verletzte und die Rechte der Abgeordneten missachte.

Das Regionalparlament wollte am kommenden Montag zusammentreten, um die Konsequenzen aus dem Volksabstimmung zu ziehen, bei der sich die große Mehrzahl der Abstimmenden für die Unabhängigkeit von Spanien ausgesprochen hatte. Schon das Referendum war von der Justiz untersagt worden - ohne Konsequenzen.

An der Abstimmung hatten sich 42 Prozent der Stimmberechtigten beteiligt, 90 Prozent stimmten für die Unabhängigkeit. Jedoch waren die Gegner einer Abspaltung der Wahl überwiegend ferngeblieben.

Kein Dialog mit der Regionalregierung

Der spanische Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy lehnt jeden Dialog mit der Regionalregierung Kataloniens ab.

In der Nacht zum Donnerstag wies er ein neues Gesprächsangebot der Separatisten energisch zurück. ""Sie haben schon viel Schaden verursacht, ziehen Sie die Drohung einer Abspaltung zurück"", hieß es in einem Kommuniqué an die Adresse des katalanischen Regierungschefs Carles Puigdemont.

Puigdemont hatte Madrid zuvor zu Verhandlungen aufgerufen. Er habe bereits viele Vermittlungsangebote erhalten und ""es wäre unverantwortlich"", diese nicht anzunehmen, erklärte der 54-Jährige in einer Fernsehansprache in Barcelona. Gleichzeitig stellte er klar, dass die Pläne zur Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit auf jeden Fall verwirklicht werden sollen.

Spanischen Medien zufolge werde es immer wahrscheinlicher, dass die Regierung versuche, die Regionalregierung zu entmachten und die Kontrolle über die autonome Region zu übernehmen.

Oettinger: ""Bürgerkrieg mitten in Europa""

EU-Kommissar Günther Oettinger (CDU) warnte derweil vor der Gefahr einer dramatischen Eskalation: ""Die Lage ist sehr, sehr besorgniserregend. Da ist ein Bürgerkrieg vorstellbar, mitten in Europa"", sagte er bei einer Podiumsdiskussion in München.

""Man kann nur hoffen, dass zwischen Madrid und Barcelona bald ein Gesprächsfaden aufgenommen wird."" Die EU könne sich in den Streit aber nicht aus eigenem Antrieb einmischen. ""Eine Moderation durch die EU wäre nur denkbar, wenn wir gefragt werden, aber nicht ungefragt"", betonte Oettinger.

Daher fordert die Partei nun umso lauter eine Verschärfung der Flüchtlingspolitik

6 Zitate zeigen, wie absurd die Diskussion über die Obergrenze mittlerweile ist

Deutschland braucht eine Regierung - aber die CSU braucht Aufmerksamkeit. Also blockieren die Christsozialen die Bemühungen von FDP, Grünen und CDU bei den Verhandlungen zur Gründung einer Jamaika-Koalition.

Zum Beispiel, indem sie offen die Partnerschaft mit der Schwesterpartei CDU in Frage stellen. Vor allem aber, indem die CSU bei jeder sich bietenden Gelegenheit auf ihre Forderung nach einer Obergrenze für Flüchtlinge pocht.

Dass FDP, Grüne und CDU die Festlegung einer solche Beschränkung für Asylsuchende ablehnen, dass der Vorsitzende des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, Andreas Voßkuhle, sie für unvereinbar mit dem Völkerrecht hält - dass Deutschland dafür womöglich sogar aus der Genfer Flüchtlingskonvention aussteigen müsste: Der CSU ist es egal.

Die Lokalpartei will ihren bayerischen Stiefel durchziehen - sie muss es, denn an der Basis rumort, es nach dem schwächsten Wahlergebnis seit 1949.

Und so wird die Obergrenzen-Diskussion zum Zwergenaufstand. Hier sind die 6 absurdesten Zitate und Aussagen in der CSU-Posse:

1. Alexander Dobrindt: ""Die CSU ist die einzige Volkspartei""

38,8 Prozent der Wahlberechtigten in Bayern haben die CSU bei der Bundestagswahl gewählt. Bundesweit macht das einen Anteil von 6,2 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen. Rechnet man diesen Anteil auf die Gesamtbevölkerung um, haben 4,62 Prozent der Deutschen die bayerischen Christsozialen gewählt - etwas mehr als 3,8 Millionen Menschen.

Die CSU ist also eine Kleinpartei. In ihrem Selbstverständnis ist dieser Umstand jedoch noch nicht angelangt. Und so sagte Alexander Dobrindt am Freitag dem Magazin ""Focus"": ""Die CSU ist aktuell die einzige Volkspartei. Sie ist modern und in der politischen Struktur der Bundesrepublik unverzichtbar.""

Kein Wunder, dass die Partei also glaubt, beim Thema Obergrenze auch bundesweite Ansprüche stellen zu können.

2. Nochmal Dobrindt: ""Die Obergrenze hat einen thematischen Unterbau""

Dabei weiß die Partei, wie unpopulär sie sich damit macht. Eine ihrer Taktiken ist deswegen: Die Obergrenze fordern - aber jeden Tag etwas anderes damit zu meinen.

Eigentlich ist die CSU-Definition der Flüchtlings-Obergrenze klar: Mehr als 200.000 Asylsuchende im Jahr sollen nicht nach Deutschland einreisen dürfen. Doch gleich mehrere der bayerischen Lokalpolitiker haben diese Definition zuletzt aufgeweicht.

Federführend war dabei Verkehrsminister Dobrindt. Der reinterpretierte den Begriff in einem Interview mit der ""Augsburger Allgemeinen"": ""Die Obergrenze hat einen thematischen Unterbau und der heißt: Fluchtursachen bekämpfen, Grenzen schützen, Integration fördern, Rückführungen beschleunigen.""

3. Joachim Herrmann: ""Es hat in der CSU-Führung nie jemand von einer Beschränkung des Asylrechts gesprochen""

In der Flüchtlingspolitik ist Bayerns Innenminister Joachim Herrmann ein Mann der harten Phrasen. Er fordert gern einmal härtere Grenzkontrollen, Smartphone-Verbote oder die präventive Gefangennahme und Aussetzung der Unschuldsvermutung für islamistische Gefährder.

Auch die Obergrenze fordert Herrmann immer wieder - wenngleich er fortwährend betont, dass in Deutschland das Asylrecht gelte.

So sagte Herrmann der ""Rheinischen Post"" zuletzt: ""Es hat in der CSU-Führung nie jemand von einer Beschränkung des Asylrechts gesprochen.""

Das eine Obergrenze genau das zur Folge hätte - wen kümmert's?

4. Horst Seehofer: ""Wir garantieren eine Obergrenze nach der Wahl""

Horst Seehofer schon mal nicht. Der verkündete im vergangenen Dezember vollmundig: ""Wir garantieren eine Obergrenze nach der Wahl."" Auf die Nachfrage, ob die CSU sonst in die Opposition gehe, sagte Seehofer: ""Das haben Sie richtig verstanden.""

Im August ruderte der CSU-Chef dann zurück. Die Zeiten im politischen Berlin hätten sich geändert - und überhaupt, die Zuwanderungszahlen seien ja nun zurückgegangen.

Da war die Obergrenze für Seehofer auf einmal keine Koalitionsbedingung mehr.

Parteikollege Dobrindt scheint das allerdings nicht mitbekommen zu haben. Er bekräftigte erst am Donnerstag, die Obergrenze sei für die CSU ""nicht verhandelbar"".

5. Angela Merkel: ""Mit der CDU wird es eine Obergrenze nicht geben""

Das ist in der Tat ungünstig. Denn das gleiche gilt für Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel.

Die hatte schon im vergangenen Jahr deutlich gemacht: ""Mit der CDU wird es eine Obergrenze nicht geben."" Bei ihrem ARD-Sommerinterview im Juli legte Merkel nach: ""Zur Obergrenze ist meine Haltung klar: Das heißt, ich werde sie nicht akzeptieren.""

Merkels klare Haltung zeigt, wie unsinnig die störrische Haltung der CSU bei der Obergrenze ist. Die Kanzlerin wird sich nicht von ihrem bayerischen Lokalpartner vorführen lassen. Dafür müsste dieser dann schon tatsächlich in die Opposition gehen - und das würde der CSU genauso schaden, wie der CDU.

6. Wolfgang Schäuble: ""Juristen wissen, dass überflüssige Dinge nicht extra erwähnt werden müssen""

Und so war es an Wolfgang Schäuble, Ende der vergangenen Woche der CSU den Spiegel vorzuhalten.

Der scheidende Finanzminister zeigte sich in einem Interview mit der ""Bild am Sonntag"" spürbar genervt. ""Hier wird um einen Begriff ein Scheinstreit geführt, obwohl es inhaltlich keine wirklichen Differenzen gibt"", sagte Schäuble.

Zwar erklärte Schäuble auch, in der Flüchtlingspolitik gelte, was der ehemalige Bundespräsident Joachim Gauck gesagt habe: ""Unser Herz ist groß, unsere Möglichkeiten sind begrenzt."" Auf die Hilfsbereitschaft der Deutschen würden kommende Generationen stolz sein, die Ordnung müsse in der Bewältigung der Flüchtlingskrise aber bewahrt werden.

Angesprochen auf die Obergrenze sagte Schäuble jedoch in Richtung der CSU: ""Juristen wissen, dass überflüssige Dinge nicht extra erwähnt werden müssen.""

Und ewig grüßt die Obergrenze

Doch die CSU tut genau das, aus einem guten Grund.

Denn die bayerischen Konservativen haben für sich schon immer in Anspruch genommen, der Ausdruck des Volkswillens zu sein. Das galt bei der Mütterrente und der PKW-Maut - und das gilt in der Flüchtlingspolitik.

Und tatsächlich: Laut einer aktuellen Umfrage will eine Mehrheit der Deutschen, dass eine Flüchtlings-Obergrenze eingeführt wird. 54 Prozent der Befragten sprachen sich dafür aus.

Das reicht der CSU als Rechtfertigung. Die Einführung einer Obergrenze wird dadurch nicht wahrscheinlicher - ebenso wenig wie die Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition.

Aber die Aufmerksamkeit der Republik, die ist der CSU gewiss. Und das ist schon einmal was, in diesen schwierigen Zeiten für die Konservativen.

While one cannot deny the major cultural influence that Hefner had on the sexual revolution, but his was not an intersectional or a feminist one.
But it was just a sexual revolution for him, not anyone else.
It’s astonishing how people have come to adore Hefner, a straight man, as the leader of the sexual revolution when his sexual virility has never been questioned.
His success came as a result of the sexual revolution, but he is not its cause.","Who actually led the sexual revolution? I’ll give you a hint, it wasn’t Hugh Hefner. When Hefner, the creator of Playboy Magazine, died on September 28th, an Associated Press writer splashed across the headline, “Hugh Hefner, leader of the sexual revolution, dies at 91.”

The sexual revolution was a movement during the 1960s and 70s that moved away from the strict moral codes that disapproved of sexual expression, and instead embracing sexual desire and moving beyond heteronormative standards. Hefner launched Playboy in 1953, known for its naked models, the magazine is credited with normalizing nudity during this era and moving a once forbidden subject into mainstream discussions. But Hefner’s magazine wasn’t uprooting any social norms, instead reinforcing patriarchal ideas about a woman’s role as an object, this time just without clothes.

While one cannot deny the major cultural influence that Hefner had on the sexual revolution, but his was not an intersectional or a feminist one. He built his fame exploiting women, and justified it by calling it sexual liberation. But it was just a sexual revolution for him, not anyone else. It’s astonishing how people have come to adore Hefner, a straight man, as the leader of the sexual revolution when his sexual virility has never been questioned. His success came as a result of the sexual revolution, but he is not its cause.

That revolution belongs to the queer folks and feminists who fought against the strict standards that forbid them from expressing their sexualities. It belongs to the women who for once could acknowledge and discuss their sexualities and personal pleasures, instead of just for their partner. It belongs to the gay, lesbian, trans and asexual folks who fought for the ability to express sexualities openly, despite the heavy harassment and violence they faced.

So instead of heralding Hefner as its leader, let’s celebrate the pioneers of the sexual revolution. Here are five true pioneers of the sexual revolution, who paved the way for the activists of today by fostering the open discussions about pornography, sexuality, contraception and nudity.

Helen Gurley Brown

For 32 years Helen Gurley Brown served as the Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan. Today’s monthly sex advice is seen as sexist, but at the time it was revolutionary to even acknowledge that a woman could want to have sex. Brown redefined Cosmo to catered towards career women who were sexually active. The magazine discussed reproductive health and in 1962, she published Sex and the Single Girl, which insinuated a then unthinkable notion, that a woman could be sexual satisifed, ambitious and single.

Marsha P. Johnson

Johnson was African American trans-woman who co-founded Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.) in New York’s Greenwich Village, providing support and shelter for homeless LGBTQ folks. She played a central role in the Stonewall Riots in 1969, and would remain active in the gay organizing that took place following the riot. Her body was found in the Hudson River in 1992 in what was ruled a suicide, while friends insisted it was murder.

Estelle Griswold

1954 to 1965, Griswold was the Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, a state which forbid women from purchasing any kind of birth control. Griswold opened a birth control clinic in New Haven, Connecticut for which she was arrested. She fought back, taking the case to the Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut which would not only overturned the law and allowed women to purchase contraception, but established the right to privacy.

Pat Maginnis

Pat Maginnis was one of the earliest abortion rights activists. Maginnis herself had gone to Mexico to have an abortion, but struggled to find a safe abortionist. While she was in college she founded Citizens Committee for Humane Abortion Laws to educate people about abortions, contraception and the dangers of self-induced abortions. Later, in 1966, she founded Association to Repeal Abortion Laws, an organization we know today as NARAL. The Association to Repeal Abortion Laws connected pregnant women with illegal abortion providers, allowing women access to safe abortions.

Il y a 22 ans, alors tout juste âgée de 2 ans, on lui diagnostique une forme sévère de cancer dans les tissus musculaires. Pour se soigner, la petite fille intègre le service pédiatrique pour les enfants malades de l'hôpital d'Atlanta, en Géorgie. Ce 18 septembre, sur son compte Facebook, c'est avec fierté qu'elle a annoncé être officiellement titulaire d'un diplôme d'infirmière et rejoindre ce même service, mais dans l'équipe des soignants cette fois!

""Je voulais prendre une minute pour dire MERCI à tous ceux qui m'ont appelée et envoyé des messages. Peut-être que certains ne sont pas au courant: aujourd'hui, c'est officiellement mon premier jour au service pédiatrique des enfants malades du cancer. À chaque fois que quelqu'un regarde mon badge et voit mon service, j'ai les larmes aux yeux. Je suis tellement comblée de cette vie étonnante que Dieu m'a donnée. Jamais je n'aurais imaginé qu'à 24 ans, j'aurais atteint mon rêve le plus fou: travailler à l'hôpital où j'étais soignée enfant et adolescente. C'est absolument incroyable et merveilleux de travailler dans un endroit aussi inspirant!""



""Les rêves peuvent devenir réalité si on se bat vraiment pour""

Rien n'a été facile pour que Montana en arrive là. Après le diagnostic de son cancer, elle a subi une chimiothérapie d'un an. Ses parents ont, eux, fait leur possible pour l'aider à supporter ses soins et lui offrir une vie normale.

Le traitement a finalement pris le dessus sur la maladie et Montana Brown a pu rentrer chez elle. Elle a recommencé ses études, s'est mise aux compétitions de gymnastique. Jusqu'à ses 15 ans, où son cancer l'a rattrapée.

Montana a dû abandonner la gymnastique et son équipe de pom-pom girls pour aller une fois par semaine à l'hôpital, subir de nouveau une chimiothérapie et un traitement par rayons.

""Battez-vous comme un enfant!""

Malgré cette épreuve, Montana est restée positive et garde un bon souvenir de cette période: ""Les infirmières sont aussi formidables que lorsque j'avais 2 ans. Ma mère m'a raconté qu'elles étaient toutes très aimantes, attentionnées et compatissantes. Tout cet amour qu'elles nous ont montré à ce moment, ça m'a beaucoup aidée"", a-t-elle raconté à la presse américaine. ""Ça m'a surtout poussée à devenir aussi gentille et compatissante qu'elles l'ont été avec moi""!

C'est son passé qui lui a permis de trouver sa vocation: devenir, elle aussi, infirmière. ""Une fois que j'ai intégré mon école, je voulais uniquement me diriger vers l'oncologie pédiatrique (le service dédié aux enfants souffrant d'un cancer). Je ne voulais rien faire d'autre. Je suis allée à l'école uniquement pour ça"", explique-t-elle.

Aujourd'hui, nouvellement diplômée, elle a réalisé son rêve. Elle espère maintenant être une source d'inspiration pour tous les enfants qui luttent, comme elle l'a fait. ""Je peux leur dire: 'Je comprends parfaitement ce que tu vis, j'y suis passée et maintenant je suis là'. Ça permet de former des liens forts.""

CPOLÉMIQUE - L'association la Voix de l'enfant s'est ""indignée"" vendredi 6 octobre de propos du chanteur Jean-Luc Lahaye, condamné pour corruption de mineure, qui déclare dans la bande-annonce d'un film bientôt à l'affiche que ""ses copines sont au lycée"".

Dans un extrait du film de Thomas Langmann ""Stars 80, la suite"", en salles le 6 décembre, l'interprète de ""Papa chanteur"", qui incarne son propre rôle, répond à l'un de ses interlocuteurs qui l'interroge sur ""ses copines"": ""T'inquiète pas, elles vont venir. A cette heure-ci, elles sont au lycée"". Avant d'ajouter: ""Bah oui, elles passent leur bac"", comme vous pouvez le voir à la fin de la bande-annonce du film ci-dessous.

Dans un communiqué, l'association de protection des droits de l'enfant ""s'indigne que de tels propos puissent être tenus par le chanteur dans la bande-annonce d'un film dont la diffusion est majeure"" et demande que ""ce passage révélant à nouveau son attirance pour des lycéennes et faisant référence à sa condamnation soit retiré"".

""La plaisanterie litigieuse, consistant en un trait d'humour ironique et dérisoire, s'inscrit uniquement dans le caractère comique de la réalisation et correspond strictement au script du film, dont Jean-Luc Lahaye n'est ni le dialoguiste, ni le réalisateur ni le producteur"", a réagi l'avocat du chanteur, Me Jean-Baptiste Jacquenet-Poillot, également dans un communiqué.

Ce dernier a souligné que son client n'avait ""jamais eu la moindre intention de blesser, de choquer ni de heurter quiconque"" et qu'il regrettait ""vivement si cela a pu être le cas"". ""Jean-Luc Lahaye tient exprimer sa désolation face à la une telle polémique ainsi qu'aux intentions qu'on lui prête"", a encore dit Me Jacquenet-Poillot

Jean-Luc Lahaye, 64 ans, a été condamné à un an d'emprisonnement avec sursis le 18 mai 2015 pour corruption de mineure, pour avoir demandé à une jeune fille de 14 ans de s'adonner à des jeux sexuels par webcam interposée. La Voix de l'enfant s'était portée partie civile dans ce procès.

As was reported earlier in the series, Cheryl will be helping the music mogul whittle down his remaining acts down at the final stage of the competition before live shows, after two years away from the show.

While we’re sure Cheryl’s fans will be excited to see back on the show that helped catapult her to national treasure status, one person who won’t be impressed is ‘So Macho’ singer, Sinitta.

Earlier this year, she announced that she’d be back as Simon’s right-hand woman at Judges’ Houses, only to eventually be ditched in favour of Cheryl.

Sinitta recently fumed: “I will always love Simon. He is like a father figure meets brother figure and ex-lover figure to me, and of course my mentor for over three decades - but right now he can kiss my black ass.”

Ken McKay/TalkbackThames/REX/Shutterstock That's a bit more like it

Cheryl first joined the show almost a decade ago in 2008, when she was still a member of girl group Girls Aloud, until eventually stepping down in 2011, after she and Simon fell out when he sacked her from the US version of the show.

In 2014, she and Simon buried the hatchet, and she spent two more series as a judge, until eventually bidding farewell for a second time, claiming she wanted to focus more on her career as a singer, rather than a TV talent show judge.

Le livre, de part sa nature même, est moins piratable que le disque.","Il en va ainsi à chaque automne. La saison des Prix Littéraire débute avec son cortège de parutions attendues et son graal, le prix Goncourt. Rien de tout cela pour la secteur musical (à l'exception à une toute autre échelle du Disquaire Day).

Bien sûr, la sortie française d'un nouvel album de Johnny Halliday à grand renfort de prime time télévisés ou l'arrivée express du nouveau Beyoncé saturé de clips vidéo tentent de remuer les masses inertes derrière leur claviers. Mais rien n'y fait.

Le support discographique se décharne depuis ces 30 dernières années et ne soutient plus la comparaison avec son cousin feuillu qui,malgré les coups de butoir de la digitalisation, se paie même le luxe de grignoter les rayons de disque des enseignes spécialisées.

Comment en est-on arrivé là?

L'objet livre tout d'abord se défend mieux que le disque face aux ogres de la numérisation. Il n'est pas encore venu le temps où un Spotify du livre uberisera nos bonnes vieilles librairies

Le livre reste également un bien culturel plus exigeant et exclusif. Le « time to market » et la barrière de la fabrication permettent également un écrémage que le disque n'a malheureusement pas le luxe de se payer. Quand on parle de 600 livres en rayonnage chaque automne, ce sont des centaines de nouveaux disques et titres qui déboulent chaque semaine et ceci tout au long de l'année. Un encombrement qui ne peut trouver sa solution que dans une distribution universelle et radicale comme le streaming le permet dorénavant.

Le livre, de part sa nature même, est moins piratable que le disque. Son prix d'impression reste paradoxalement le même mais on l'achète avant tout pour son contenu immatériel, l'intelligence qui a pré existé à son écriture.

De fait, on n'a jamais vu les présentoirs des marchés inondés de copies pirates de livre, comme cela est par exemple le cas pour un disque ou un DVD.

D'ailleurs l'implacable numérisation qui touche les marchés du disque et du film aboutissent de plus en plus à des ""leaks"" comme en a connu la saison 7 de Game of Thrones ou le dernier album de Lady Gaga.

On peut avancer une autre raison au manque d'évènementialisation du disque. Sa promotion est plus souvent centrée autour d'un titre playlisté en radio ou mis en orbite sur les chaînes musicales et youtube qu'à son contenu intégral. Pour rappel le concept d'""album œuvre"" est apparu dans la fin de années 60 (le légendaire ""Smile"" des Beach Boys en est le Rosebud ultime) et a dominé le marché mondial jusqu'à l'apparition du compact disque. Dès lors que les disques ont pu se parcourir par burinage numérique et l'œuvre disque a connu une lente désaffection des auditeurs, ceux-ci préférant petit à petit concevoir leurs playlists en fonction de leurs gouts et leurs envies.

Au final il n'est pas rare de voir cohabiter sur les iPads des millenials le dernier rap à la mode à deux clics de souris d'un vieux George Brassens, les deux fichiers étant identiques d'un point de vue numérique.

Cette perte de datation dont souffre actuellement le marché du disque fournit son lot d'anecdotes. Ainsi ""All Night"" tube de Parov Stelar sorti depuis quelques années s'est retrouvé récemment à la tête du top NRJ comme un retour en grâce. Le manager d'un groupe électro français nous faisait également la confidence d'avoir reçu un appel d'une major du disque bien connue qui lui réclamait urgemment des informations sur un single entendu sur une radio FM car il leur semblait un tube potentiel.... sauf que le titre en question était sorti depuis un an et demi.

Faut-il en rire ou en pleurer? Nous préférons terminer sur une note humoristique en rappelant qu'une étude récente a pointé les mots clés qui menait le plus souvent vers des virus et autre cheval de troie. En tête de cette liste... un musicien... notre DJ national David Guetta.

On ne veut pas maintenir une illusion, faire semblant qu'on est une femme quand on est né homme.","Si la possibilité de devenir parrain ou marraine d'un nouveau baptisé semble pour ainsi dire «impossible» pour une personne transgenre, qu'en est-il de son propre baptême ? À cet égard, il semble y avoir plus de flexibilité.

Imaginons le cas d'une personne qui entame une démarche de changement de genre au cours de l'adolescence. Chemin faisant, elle rencontre des catholiques qui l'épaulent et l'acceptent. Une fois la transition complétée, elle demande le baptême comme adulte. Peut-elle devenir catéchumène, c'est-à-dire un adulte qui demande à recevoir ce sacrement ?

«Toute personne non baptisée peut être baptisée. L'Église ne s'est pas prononcée plus loin que ça, à savoir si la personne est transgenre», précise Chantal Labrèche, professeure adjointe à la Faculté de droit canonique de l'Université Saint-Paul.

«Les critères sont peut-être moins rigoureux que pour être parrain ou marraine», renchérit l'abbé Francesco Giordano, vice-chancelier pour le diocèse de Montréal. La raison est simple: «On reconnait que le baptême est essentiel, fondamental, pour le salut de l'âme.»

Pour l'expert en droit canonique, il importe que la personne adulte qui fait cette demande soit pleinement consciente de ce que cela implique. C'est pourquoi le catéchuménat dure environ un an et permet aux personnes de bien comprendre les aspects essentiels de la foi.

«Si on accepte les croyances de l'Église, on peut les baptiser. S'il s'agit d'une personne transsexuelle [qui a eu une chirurgie de réassignation], on peut regarder comment on peut vivre avec ça. On ne peut pas défaire ou effacer sa vie antérieure. Mais s'il s'agit d'une personne qui prend un traitement hormonal, il pourrait être possible pour elle d'arrêter les traitements. On va l'encourager à assumer son identité sexuelle biologique», précise l'abbé Giordano, ajoutant du même souffle qu'il est difficile de répondre à cette question de façon générale.

À ses yeux, l'identité sexuelle est certes importante, mais l'identité catholique l'est aussi.

«Le sexe biologique est déterminant, on ne peut pas l'ignorer. Comment on peut intégrer ça avec une foi et une vie catholiques? On ne veut pas maintenir une illusion, faire semblant qu'on est une femme quand on est né homme. L'identité catholique est aussi quelque chose d'important. Si la personne ne peut pas ou n'est pas prête à assumer une identité catholique, on a le droit de refuser le baptême, car il s'agirait d'un contre-témoignage.»

Malgré tout, ce sacrement demeure bel et bien accessible pour les personnes transgenres et transsexuelles. «Ça n'empêche pas le baptême, car la baptême est tellement important dans la foi de l'Église.»

Le vice-chancelier du diocèse de Montréal le dit clairement: la porte est ouverte. «Grande ouverte», même. Il insiste cependant sur la nécessité pour l'Église qui accueille ces demandes de responsabiliser les gens et de leur dire à quoi «le Seigneur nous appelle».

«Dire la vérité, c'est une charité, c'est faire du bien aux autres. Évidemment, on est sensible, car la vérité peut être blessante, mais il y a une façon de le dire sans le nier», dit-il au sujet d'une personne qui a une identité sexuelle autre que son sexe biologique. Mais là encore, s'il voit un «effort manifeste, visible», pour vivre dans la foi catholique, le baptême demeure possible.

ANALYSIS

The numbers don't seem to add up for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in his bid to succeed President Jacob Zuma as leader of the governing ANC. That's if a first glance at the provincial voting allocations are anything to go by.

And David Mabuza, the ANC strongman in Mpumalanga and its provincial chairperson there, is now the kingmaker. He has recently advanced the candidature of Zweli Mklhize, the ANC's treasurer general, as a unity candidate.

There has been a surge in voting delegates in Mpumalanga and North West. This is bad news for Ramaphosa.

Gwede Mantashe, the ANC's secretary general, forwarded the final tally for voting delegates to all nine provincial secretaries on Friday, and it seems to indicate that Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, President Zuma's preferred candidate, to be in a very strong position ahead of the party's elective conference in December.

According to the letter by Mantashe 4 723 branch delegates will have the right to vote. The calculation is based on one voting delegate per branch that has 100 paid-up members. For every 250 paid-up members extra, branches receive one extra voting delegates. The branch delegates will be joined by representatives from the leagues, who also have voting rights. Provinces' voting size is based on proportional representation given the number of members in ""good standing"", or paid-up.

First thoughts

1. KwaZulu-Natal is still the biggest and most influential voting bloc, with 870 voting delegates for a share of 18,4%. No wonder Zuma is pushing for the provincial executive committee to appeal the ruling which disbanded it.

2. There has been a surge in voting delegates in Mpumalanga and North West. This is bad news for Ramaphosa.

3. The Eastern Cape has relinquished its position as the second biggest province in the ANC -- and that's even worse news for Ramaphosa.

4. Mabuza, Mpumalanga's premier, is now a kingmaker. His province's share of voting delegates jumped by 57,6% from 2012, from 467 delegates to 736 delegates and is now the second biggest voting bloc.

4. North West, where Supra Mahumapelo holds sway, more than doubled its share of voting delegates, jumping by 130%.

5. The erstwhile ""premier league"" (Free State, North West and Mpumalanga) command 35% of the vote, although Mabuza has since denounced its existence.

6. Limpopo, his place of birth, might be ray of light for Ramaphosa. (He has won the endorsement of the provincial chairperson as well as its biggest region.) It will be the fourth largest voting bloc at Nasrec with 13,6% of the voting delegates.

7. Dlamini-Zuma's path to the presidency: She needs KwaZulu-Natal, plus North West, Free State and Mpumalanga.

8. Ramaphosa's path to the presidency: He seemingly has the Eastern Cape, Western and Northern Cape, Gauteng and Limpopo. He needs Mpumalanga.

9. Dlamini-Zuma will win if she gets Mpumalanga, even if Limpopo goes to Ramaphosa.

10. The leagues (women, youth and veterans) will vote as provinces. Their share has yet to be determined, but all have pledged loyalty to Dlamini-Zuma.

Provincial voting allocations (Mangaung 2012 in brackets):

KwaZulu-Natal 870 (974) 18,4%

Mpumalanga 736 (467) 15,6%

Das Bundestreffen der Parteijugend am Samstag hat gezeigt: Eine Annäherung wird beiden nicht leicht fallen

Die Revolte ist ausgeblieben. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat den ""Deutschlandtag"", das Bundestreffen der Jungen Union, souverän überstanden.

""Die erste Runde im parteiinternen ‘Endspiel’ geht ganz klar an Angela Merkel"", kommentierte die ""Welt"" den Tag der Kanzlerin mit der Parteijugend, der als Tag der Abrechnung ausgerufen worden war.



Für Aufregung sorgte ein JU-Mitglied aus Bergisch Gladbach. Diego Faßnacht forderte die Kanzlerin zum Rücktritt auf.

Merkel konterte kühl. Der junge Mann wurde ausgebuht - nur von den Delegierten aus Bayern kam Applaus.

Bis zu einer Versöhnung mit den Mitgliedern der CSU scheint es nach dem desaströsen Wahlergebnis der Union noch ein weiter Weg zu sein.

Ist die Lösung im Streit um die Obergrenze gefunden?

Am Sonntag trifft Merkel den bayerischen Ministerpräsident Horst Seehofer, um eine Verhandlungslinie für eine Jamaika-Koalition festzulegen.

Das größte Streitthema, eine Obergrenze für die Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen, könnte dabei ansatzweise schon aus dem Weg geräumt werden. ""Welt""-Korrespondent Robin Alexander berichtet, wie die grobe Lösung an diesem Sonntag aussehen könnte.

Die CSU gestehe zunächst zu, dass das Recht auf Asyl für politisch Verfolgte - wie es auch im Grundgesetz verankert ist - nicht begrenzt werden könne. Das hatten CSU-Politiker zuletzt in Interviews mehrfach gesagt.

Für die vielen Migranten, die als Flüchtlinge nach der Genfer Konvention nach Deutschland kommen, sollen dann Kontingente festgelegt werden, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter. Die Regelung könnte Teil eines Einwanderungsgesetzes werden, das von der Jamaika-Regierung erarbeitet wird.

Merkel versucht die Annäherung - aber reicht das?

Merkel machte auf dem Deutschlandtag in ihrer Rhetorik deutlich, dass auch sie zu einer Annäherung an die Partner in Bayern bereit ist.

Sie sagte den Rechtspopulisten von der AfD eine harte Auseinandersetzung zu. ""Ich stehe dazu, dass rechts von der Union keine Partei sein sollte"", sagte die CDU-Chefin auf Nachfrage der Delegierten. Die entsprechende Aussage stammt bekanntermaßen von der CSU-Legende Franz Josef Strauß.

Doch reichen diese zaghaften Schritte als Annäherung? “Die Bundeskanzlerin will auf keinen Fall ihre Politik aus der Zeit der offenen Grenzen relativieren”, kommentiert die ""Welt"" die anstehenden Verhandlungen um die Obergrenze.

Und: Der ""Deutschlandtag"" hat gezeigt, wie tief der Graben zwischen bayerischer Basis und Berliner Kanzlerin sein kann.

Foster Care Cuts Across Race And Religion When Child Protection Is The Highest Priority What business does a white family have caring for black children, or a Muslim family caring for a white girl?

A spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPASA) said: “The fall in vasectomies may reflect the fact that there are more GP practices offering men this service which are not captured in the statistics.

“However, some men may be finding it harder to access the procedure – and we know women sometimes feel under pressure to accept a long-acting reversible contraceptive like a coil or an implant when their partner requests a vasectomy.

“This is not acceptable as vasectomy offers couples a way for a man to take the burden of contraception that his partner may have long shouldered.

“But the decline may also reflect social shifts – couples are waiting longer to start and complete their families, and there may also be greater awareness that relationships can fail and that vasectomy is generally an irreversible choice.”

Natika Halil, chief executive of the Family Planning Association (FPA), said: “Being able to choose the right contraceptive method for you is incredibly important, and given the lack of choices currently available for men, this makes access to vasectomies even more vital.

“Some commissioners in England, in areas including Essex, are now no longer offering vasectomies on the NHS, which means men may have to pay up around £500 for a private procedure.

“Unfortunately evidence shows that cuts to services, a fractured commissioning system, a lack of accountability, and a lack of training for healthcare professionals have all led directly to a reduction in access to contraception.

As the International Day of the Girl Child approaches on October 11, we are reminded of the lack of opportunity meted out to half of India's population, simply for being born–-or unborn–-as the 'wrong' sex. There has been no shortage of debate and discussion on the topic of female foeticide in the country, with Bollywood star Aamir Khan weighed on the discussion in 2012 on his talk show, Satyamev Jayate. While we have a wait until 2021 for India's next census to be conducted, the previous census shows an imbalance of 927 girls to 1000 boys. While there are many causes of this sex imbalance (for example, greater malnutrition of girls), the issue of sex-selective abortions, despite legal prohibitions, is well documented.

Respected Indian Economist and Philosopher Amartya Sen has argued the importance of analysing social and cultural influence in India's female foeticide problem, beyond a simplistic economic analysis. This is especially true considering that there is some suggestion that India's middle class has a greater gender bias in favour of boys, and that one in 10 girls conceived by Indian-born women in Britain as their third or fourth baby is missing. While this could still have an economic component, the middle class has more money and hence more to lose (and heftier dowries), an honest look at the social attitudes that lead to girls becoming an economic drain must also be assessed as part of the problem.

A study conducted by Bhagat, Laskar and Sharma in 2012 in Delhi slums found an increasing son-preference with increasing age among women, with adult women revealing such pressure primarily comes from their mother-in-law to carry out female foeticide. Another study in 2013 by Vedpathak et al. in Maharashtra, discovering that 37.85% of women justified female foeticide, with mothers-in-law being the greatest pressurising family member. Both studies confirm the primary reason for this being propagation of the family name and dependence in old age, which is already well-known. Study of family structure in affecting sex-ratios, particularly in relation to women's treatment towards other women, is clearly a topic which requires closer investigation.

India's Human Development Survey-II (IHDS-II) demonstrated that only 1.8% senior women in households surveyed play a role in deciding the number of children. This may indicate that women are simply carriers of female-sensitive topics within a family unit rather than decision makers behind the decision to abort the girl child. The lack of focus on the family structure, however, means that the identity imposed on the unborn child is not fully realised in current debates. After all, these decisions are familiar, whether they come from a male or female figure in the family.

Professionals from all fields rightly acknowledge the feminine identity imposed on the foetus which perpetuates the imbalanced sex-ratio outcome, but there is little acknowledgement of the other identities imposed on the fetus--particularly of the family. The call for further research in this area, therefore, may warrant us to reconsider the language we use, moving from 'female feticide' to 'granddaughter and daughter feticide', especially in academic and policy discussions around the issue. Acknowledging all identities imposed on the foetus and its perceived threat to the family, and possibly mothers-in-law particularly may be powerful in bolstering and personalising existing campaign efforts. Let's hope we soon also begin to hear 'poti bachao, poti padhao' (save the granddaughter, educate the granddaughter).

Más de 200 simpatizantes del opositor ruso Alexei Navalny, actualmente encarcelado, fueron detenidos el sábado en manifestaciones organizadas cinco meses antes de las presidenciales contra Vladimir Putin, que celebraba su 65º cumpleaños.

Tanto la movilización como la respuesta policial parecieron ser inferior a las manifestaciones de primavera, cuando decenas de miles de personas salieron a la calle, jóvenes en su mayoría.

Con todo, supuso un desafío directo al presidente ruso el día de su cumpleaños.

El opositor, de 41 años, había instado a sus seguidores a salir a las calles el lunes, tras haber sido condenado a 20 días de arresto por haber convocado manifestaciones no autorizadas, su tercera instancia en prisión en lo que va de año.

Se llevaron a cabo marchas en 80 ciudades de todo el país, del Extremo Oriente hasta el Báltico, incluyendo Moscú. Pero la mayor manifestación tuvo lugar en San Petersburgo (noroeste), segunda ciudad del país y ciudad natal de Putin, donde se concentraron 3 mil personas.

Hacia las 17H00 GMT, se habían efectuado 66 arrestos en esa ciudad, que, sumados a los registrados en otras partes de Rusia en marchas similares, daban un total de 235 en todo el país, indicó Artiom Platov, portavoz de la oenegé OVD-Info.

Testigos interrogados en el lugar mencionaron detenciones violentas y personas ensangrentadas.

""¡Putin es un ladrón! ¡Libertad para Navalny!"", gritaban los manifestantes, congregados en la plaza de la Insurrección, en pleno centro de San Petersburgo, frente a las fuerzas especiales ampliamente desplegadas en el lugar.

""Putin no me gusta"", explicó Igor Klimov, de 20 años. ""Desde que puedo recordar, siempre ha estado en el poder, y no vemos más que corrupción por todos lados"".

Calma en Moscú

Aunque en estos últimos meses se ha impuesto como el principal opositor al Kremlin, Alexei Navalny tiene pocas posibilidades de poderse presentar.

La comisión electoral central consideró en junio que no era apto para presentarse a las elecciones presidenciales, a causa de una condena por malversación de fondos que data de febrero de 2017.

Navalny, que denuncia la corrupción de las élites desde hace años, multiplicó en estas últimas semanas sus mítines para intentar ampliar su base electoral y había previsto celebrar uno este sábado en San Petersburgo, antes de ser detenido.

¿Quieres irte de viaje pero tu cuenta bancaria está prácticamente en números en rojos? No desesperes, viajar con poco presupuesto también es posible ¡y es más fácil de lo que crees!

Aquí te ofrecemos algunos trucos para viajar con poco presupuesto. Toma nota:

1.Destinos y timings

Cuando no cuentas con mucho dinero para viajar, recorre tu país o elige algún destino que sea económico como: Nicaragua, Colombia, Perú, Bolivia, muchos de los países del Sudeste Asiático o India, por ejemplo. En ellos, tu dinero rendirá mucho más y seguramente podrás viajar por más tiempo o darte incluso algunos gustos.

La mejor recomendación cuando estás ""apretado de dinero"" es viajar en temporada baja, ya que los precios no están inflados (como en temporada alta) y hay menos gente.

2. Transporte

Ahorra comprando tus boletos aéreos con antelación y comparando precios en plataformas como Skyscanner. Sé flexible en las fechas, pero también en los destinos. Fíjate si una misma ciudad tiene diferentes aeropuertos o incluso mira vuelos que lleguen a las ciudades cercanas a donde te diriges.

Aunque a veces parezca que un vuelo es más económico que el autobús o el tren, verifica los precios de transporte desde y hacia el aeropuerto, que pueden encarecer tremendamente el presupuesto. Para moverte entre ciudades dentro del mismo país e incluso entre países puedes utilizar trenes o autobuses, que normalmente son más económicos que los vuelos o checa también las aerolíneas low cost.

Y para recorrer una ciudad usa tus pies (caminar es la mejor manera de conocerlas), usa el transporte público y verifica si hay tarjetas que ofrezcan descuentos, como la Oyster Card en Londres o RapidPass en Panamá (que permite transbordos gratuitos). Si tienes que usar un transporte privado, opta por plataformas colaborativas como [Uber] o si decides usar taxis o tuk tuks (taxis motorizados en Asia) negocia la tarifa de antemano e intenta compartir el trayecto con otros viajeros.

3. Alojamiento

El mayor pellizco de tu presupuesto se lo llevará el alojamiento. Tienes varias opciones para disminuir los gastos de hospedaje, como por ejemplo optar por las plataformas colaborativas del estilo de Couchsurfing (dormir en la casa de un local gratis) o, si viajarás por largos periodos de tiempo y eres flexible, puedes probar haciendo housesitting (cuidar la casa y a veces las mascotas y plantas a cambio de quedarte gratis).

Otra opción es hacer camping pero averigua antes por las leyes de acampada libre del país que visitas ya que algunos tienen restricciones y zonas prohibidas.

4. Atracciones turísticas

Antes de visitar un país, investiga sobre las atracciones turísticas y decide a cuáles quieres ir. No vayas a una que no te interesa sólo porque todo el mundo va. Luego busca información sobre descuentos o días con acceso libre y gratuito. Por ejemplo, el Museo de Louvre, en Paris, es gratuito el primer domingo de cada mes o el Museo del Oro, en Bogotá, es gratuito el último domingo del mes.

Además, hay empresas que ofrecen grandes descuentos en museos y otras atracciones como el London Pass o el Paris Museum Card. Ten en cuenta también que en muchas de las grandes ciudades ofrecen ""caminatas turística guiadas y gratuitas"" con las que puedes aprender mucho sobre una ciudad y recorrerlas sin costo o por poco dinero ya que muchos guías viven de la propina.

5. Compras y souvenirs

Todos nos hemos visto tentados en más de una ocasión de comprar ropa, bolsos, adornos, imanes u otros souvenirs en los diferentes países que visitamos. Intenta ser inteligente a la hora de hacer estas compras: escoge puestos locales, para ayudar la economía del país, intenta no realizar tus compras en las zonas más turísticas o, peor aún, en las terminales de trenes, autobuses o aeropuertos. Si estás viajando por un país donde el regateo es parte de sus transacciones diarias, no seas tímido y regatea, esto no sólo para mantener tu presupuesto en línea, sino porque ellos esperan que lo hagas.

Como verás viajar con poco presupuesto es posible. Sólo tienes que cambiar la mentalidad de ""vacaciones"" y emprender un viaje más independiente y un poco menos estructurado.

It's worth remarking that this is quite a distance travelled. A few years ago, government policy was staunchly against building homes for social rent. Between 2010-2016, it reduced funding dramatically and even proposed selling off the few social homes we had left.

The government deserves credit for changing its course. It's good news that it is now acting to ease the misery of at least some private renters. If delivered, the new social homes promised will benefit some of the very people Shelter exists to help - those facing bad housing and homelessness.

It's true that the £2billion worth of funding that's been put forward is nowhere near enough by itself, especially when you consider that £10billion has been put behind boosting Help to Buy - a policy that does not help those on lower incomes who are in the greatest need of support.

The government has said that an investment of £2billion will buy the country an extra 25,000 social homes for rent. This will be 25,000 precious homes for families currently languishing in homeless hostels or those barely scraping by in expensive, unstable private renting.

But the job is not done. The new investment is a fraction of what's needed to address the sheer scale of the problem. There are currently 1.2million households on council house waiting lists, so let's hope the change of heart is worth more than the money currently on offer. This must be the start and not the end of the government's building ambitions.

We will be urging the government to ensure that this shift is more significant than the numbers behind it. We hope it represents a revived commitment to build a new generation of social housing with rents that are low enough to be genuinely affordable.

What is needed now is for the government to match its new rhetoric with policies designed to cope with how bad the housing crisis has become. This means a considerable increase in funding and a long-term investment plan, plus new powers for councils to help get land into development much more cheaply.

Only time will tell if ministers have the metal to turn these ambitions into reality, and finally deliver the homes that people on lower incomes desperately need. We will be working with them and campaigning hard to make sure that happens.

The followers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi are praising him to the skies after a video of him — balling up a used tissue and putting it in his pocket after the aarti on Dusshera at New Delhi's Madhav Das park — went viral on social media.

Modi can be seen performing an aarti (Hindu ritual of worship) of actors dressed up as Ram and Lakshman and putting tikas on their foreheads.

The alacrity with which his cheerleaders praised a gesture that should have been the norm instead of the exception points towards a deeply-rooted civic cultural problem in India.

Of course the PM did the right thing and led by example. He is the face of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan — a grand scheme to clean up Indian streets and instill a sense of civic duty in citizens.

Modi made the clarion call for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan during his maiden Independence Day Speech in 2014, and in the months since, several BJP politicians took to the streets, broom and bucket in hand, to show solidarity.

Three years later, Indian streets, railway stations, parks and other public places haven't drastically turned into spotless havens — littering is after all a difficult habit to break.

As a society, civic sense is something that we need to learn early on in life, especially since the onus is often solely on citizens to keep their cities clean.

India has a staggering garbage problem. According to a 2014 Planning Commission report, India generated an estimated 62 million tonnes of garbage annually by 377 million people in urban areas. More than 80% of this garbage is disposed off indiscriminately at dump yards by the municipal authorities.

While it is the responsibility of citizens to not litter, it is also the responsibility of the government to provide basic amenities, including dustbins, to them. There are laws and fines for littering, but hardly any implementation.

The responses to Modi's gesture also point towards an attitude that's unique in us — to award qualities that should be the way of life for individuals. We reward and celebrate common decency. When taxi drivers and rag pickers return lost packages or money, they are lauded for their honesty. It's almost as if we do not expect the poor to have integrity.

A climate of oppressive fear has enveloped India like a nuclear cloud

There were early ominous signs for the discerning to worry, for the optimist to ignore, and the die-hard acolyte to still applaud. When Modi became Prime Minister with an overwhelming mandate in May 2014, many I am sure fervently hoped that despite his egregiously controversial track-record with communal politics, Modi would rise above his characteristic sectarianism. They hoped that he would not be the agent provocateur of religious politics. He had aggressively sold himself as the talismanic avatar of modern development during the election campaign; the questionable substance of the much-touted Gujarat model fell quietly by the wayside.

Overnight, the man who willfully instigated a religious schism with deplorable lines such as ""'Hum paanch hamare pachees' (five of us, and our 25)"" began getting the sobriquet of being statesman-like by genuflecting editors. As things have since established, he is anything but. A climate of oppressive fear has enveloped India like a nuclear cloud.

A perfect example is the case of the three Khans. The incandescent silence of Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan despite brutal atrocities being perpetrated on innocent Muslims like Pehlu Khan and Junaid Khan is stupefying. They must realise that there is a life beyond an Eid film release that 170 million Muslims of India live in expectation of. But the fact is that they have been literally asphyxiated. Aamir Khan was targeted with frenzied ferocity by the right-wing brigade, particularly social media trolls and malicious BJP leaders. A Cabinet minister even alluded that Khan's celebrity endorsement deal with an e-commerce behemoth was abruptly terminated owing to pressures exerted on them. Democracy anyone? Shah Rukh Khan, who articulates with rare erudition on matters Catholic, has chosen the quiet solitude of his massive mansion at Bandstand over becoming easy pickings for the hate-mongers. His reluctance to even mention the issue of social subjugation of Indian minorities in his TED Talk disappointed me. But again, his film Dilwale suffered enormous losses as the Hindutva groups indulged in their mindless violence at cinema halls, threatening destruction and interruptions. Salman Khan has made intermittent protests, only to have his father issue apology statements. The irony is that the Khans have dominated Bollywood for over three decades, and their popularity is stratospheric, cutting across religious boundaries and narrow minds.

Trump, Modi, bhai, bhai!

But as India has made a sharp turn to the Right and becomes perceptibly conservative, they have been told to shut up. United States' President Donald Trump too is deliberately instigating a culture war in America to augment his white supremacist base. The ""others"" are being attacked and threatened.

Both Donald Trump and Narendra Modi have preternatural similarities in political strategy. They trigger a hyper-nationalistic fervour, exacerbate social divides, feed on the rising global Islamophobia that demonises domestic minorities, play on military adventurism and punitive attacks against adversaries, and vilify their predecessors' extravagant tolerance of cultural diversity as cheap vote-bank politics. Trump trashed the Washington establishment for creating a cosy cabal, and Modi postured as the iconoclastic outsider to the snobbish Lutyens crowd. There is one difference though: Trump is more honest about his unconscionable rabidity, no matter how stupid they are. Modi keeps silent. He dodges the issue altogether, and usually responds with grandiloquent theatrics months later, letting his rehearsed script befool all.

Modi seems blissfully nonchalant about his damaged reputation for social harmony. The Bhakts are happy. He merely wants to grow that tribe.

The end goal is, however, met both ways, you win through a free-kick or a penalty shoot-out. Trump's provocative broadside against Meryl Streep and NFL's Colin Kaepernick has invited an avalanche of ridicule, but he seems further emboldened by the liberal-centrist onslaught because his core constituency lionises him for the same outrageousness. Like him, Modi seems blissfully nonchalant about his damaged reputation for social harmony. The Bhakts are happy. He merely wants to grow that tribe.

Underlying the economic paralysis is the hidden factor; the government's fascination for communal polarization.

Trump and Modi certainly cheered stock-market bulls; both Dow Jones and the Sensex have demonstrated irrational exuberance, at odds with macroeconomic fundamentals. It may be early days for Trump, but the Indian economy has anaemic symptoms; virtually negligible private investments, falling consumer demand, stagnant exports, rising NPA's of public sector banks, a mounting job crisis, to name a few. It is unlikely that mere public expenditure can revive an economy with deep structural flaws, aggravated further by the Himalayan disaster called demonetisation, and the amateurish execution of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). But underlying the economic paralysis is the hidden factor; the government's fascination for communal polarisation. Economic growth needs a strong, united society as a prerequisite. Modi got his priorities wrong and has wasted 70% of NDA's term in creating religious tensions for winning state elections ('Kabristan/ Shamshan' being the astonishing marker in the UP elections).

The economy cannot be fixed through jingoistic sloganeering and sub-standard rhetoric delivered with an imperious flourish. That's why Yashwant Sinha hurt. That's why the Indian economy is hurting. That's why this could be the beginning of the end.

WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said ""only one thing will work"" in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results.

Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.

The president has previously said the United States would ""totally destroy"" North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang's nuclear threats.

Earlier this week, during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the ""calm before the storm."" Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said: ""You'll find out.""

Moderator Plasberg hat im Interview mit dem ""Spiegel"" über die Sendung mit AfD-Mann Gauland gesprochen

Eine Antwort zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit der AfD immer noch fällt

Auch Wochen nach der Wahl ist das starke Abschneiden der AfD immer noch eines der beherrschenden Themen in den Medien. ""Hart aber fair""-Moderator Frank Plasberg nennt das Resultat der Bundestagswahl im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" einen ""gesellschaftlichen Hammer"".

Nicht wenige Politiker und Journalisten haben den Medien eine Mitschuld am Erstarken der Rechtspopulisten gegeben.

Noch-Familienministerin Katarina Barley (SPD) etwa kritisierte Plasberg hart, als sie kürzlich zu Gast in dessen Sendung war. ""Mich hat das rasend gemacht"", schimpfte sie darüber, dass die Themen der AfD - Migration und Flüchtlingspolitik - so häufig Thema in den Talkshows der Öffentlich-Rechtlichen gewesen seien.

Im Gespräch mit dem ""Spiegel"" weist Plasberg die Vorwürfe zurück, ARD und ZDF hätten die AfD erst groß gemacht. Er gestand aber auch, dass ihm der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten nicht leicht falle.

Vor allem Plasbergs Schilderung des Auftritts des AfD-Spitzenkandidaten Alexander Gauland bei ""Hart aber fair"" im August offenbart, wie hilflos der Moderator teilweise der AfD gegenüber stand.

""Die spielen irgendwie anders""

""Wir ha­ben früh fest­ge­stellt, dass die ir­gend­wie an­ders spie­len"", sagt ""Hart aber fair""-Redaktionsleiter Georg Diedenhofen über die AfD im Doppelinterview mit dem ""Spiegel"". Die Rechtspopulisten hätten die Regeln verändert.

""Sie wol­len nicht ein­mal mit den an­de­ren Gäs­ten dis­ku­tie­ren, lie­ber set­zen sie sich mit dem Mo­dera­tor aus­ein­an­der, weil so die Op­fer­rol­le schnel­ler her­stell­bar ist"", erklärt Plasberg.

Für ihn als Moderator sei das ein Dilemma, weil er immer beherrscht sein müsse - und sich nicht zum Richter über den AfD-Gast aufschwingen dürfe.

Wie dieses Dilemma in der Wirklichkeit dann aussieht, sahen ARD-Zuschauer im August bei “Hart aber fair”. Zu Gast war damals der Spitzenkandidat Alexander Gauland. Kurz zuvor hatte er für einen Skandal gesorgt, als er sagte, die Integrationsbeauftragte Aydan Özoguz könne in Anatolien entsorgt werden.

""Wie dämlich muss man denn sein..."" - Plasberg in der Kritik

Immer wieder versuchte Gauland, den Fragen Plasbergs auszuweichen. Journalisten wie ""Welt""-Autor Thomas Schmid empörten sich hinterher, dass die “Hart aber fair”-Redaktion Gauland überhaupt eine Bühne geboten habe.

“Wie dämlich muss man denn sein, einem solchen kühl kalkulierenden Provokateur, der sich als Unschuldslamm gibt, einen derart breiten und für Gaulands Partei unbezahlbaren öffentlich-rechtlichen Wahlkampfauftritt zu verschaffen”, schimpfte Schmid damals in einem Facebook-Post.

Im “Spiegel”-Interview schildert Plasberg, die Redaktion habe das ganze Wochenende vor der Sendung mit Gauland überlegt, ob sie den Politiker ausladen solle.

Plasberg hat keine eindeutige Antwort parat

Eine eindeutige Antwort auf die Frage nach dem richtigen Umgang mit der AfD kann Plasberg nicht geben. Sollte die AfD wie jede andere Partei behandelt werden?

“Ja. Und nein”, antwortet Plasberg da. Es würden jedenfalls die gleichen journalistischen Standards gelten. Man dürfe der AfD nicht den Gefallen tun, “eine spezielle Umgangsweise für sie zu entwickeln”.

Dass AfD-Politiker als Talkshow-Gäste allerdings doch eine ""besondere Vorbereitung"" bräuchten, wie Redaktionsleiter Diedenhofen sagt, oder einen ""besonderen Energieaufwand"", wie Plasberg meint, zeigt, wie schwer den Medien der Umgang mit den Rechtspopulisten doch fällt.

Plasberg verrät auch, was die Zuschauer der Sendung nicht mehr sahen, als Gauland eingeladen war.

Gauland privat nach der Sendung

Nach der Aufzeichnung sei er zu dem Politiker gegangen und habe ihm erklärt:

""Ab heu­te bin ich je­dem böse, der die­se Par­tei wählt, nach­dem er Sie, Herr Gau­land, heu­te bei 'Hart aber fair' ge­se­hen hat.""

Gauland sei klug, rhetorisch fit, verleugne aber seine eigene Intellektualität, wenn er sage, ""er habe nicht ge­wusst, was der Be­griff ‘Ent­sor­gen’ be­deu­tet.""

Gauland habe nur dagestanden, mit einem Glas in der Hand und habe das ""mit großer Gelassenheit zur Kenntnis"" genommen.

Refusing To Take 'No' For An Answer Is Never Romantic At worst refusing to take ""no"" for an answer is predatory and contributes to the harassment women experience day-in, day-out.

Deaths By Suicide May Be Falling, But We Must Realise That Every Single One Can Be Prevented It's wonderful news that suicide rates among adults have fallen in the UK and are at a six-year low. But although prevention work by the government has been cited as a reason for success, I'd argue that not enough is being done. We could get there a lot faster and be way more effective about reducing suicides if the government actually prioritised this. We are still behind where we need to be and I'm left wondering what more justification does our government need to take things seriously? Author, Senior Editor and Blogger at Right Side Of 30

Silence is complicity and all that. But the real reason we critically need men to add their voice to the debate is their very notable absence from it.

""Hay que quemarla en una cruz"".

Desde hace años, la modelo y fotógrafa de origen sueco Arvida Byström está acostumbrada a recibir todo tipo de ataques verbales.

La artista, que cumplió 26 años este miércoles 4 de octubre, ha roto muchos de los códigos impuestos a las mujeres; ya sea relacionados con el vello corporal, la menstruación o las espinillas. Y, todo ello, con el único objetivo de reivindicar su propia sensualidad.

Arvida fue invitada por Adidas para posar en un anuncio. En la imagen se muestra con un vestido con corsé y unos tenis de la marca.

Lo que provocó el escándalo fue que la modelo apareciera en el anuncio con ¡pelos en las piernas!

""Mi foto de la campaña Adidas Superstar recibió muchos comentarios desagradables la semana pasada. Soy blanca, sin discapacidades, con un cuerpo cisgénero (no transexual); mi único rasgo diferenciador es que tengo unos cuantos pelos en las piernas"", explicó en la publicación que compartió en Instagram.

La modelo agregó que ha recibido amenazas de violación, literalmente, en su bandeja de entrada.

Y agregó: ""No me puedo imaginar cómo sería si no tuviera todos estos privilegios e intentara existir en este mundo"".

Creo que cualquiera puede ser femenino, pero en la sociedad actual tenemos miedo. Arvida Byström.

Arvida es feminista y una mujer queer. En una entrevista concedida a Dazed en 2015, la fotógrafa señaló que una amiga la introdujo a las ideas feministas cuando tenía 18 años, ""luego descubrí blogs sobre el feminismo queer"".

La modelo se dice fan de todo lo que habitualmente se ha considerado femenino, e impregna tintes rosas en la mayoría de sus fotos. No obstante, le encanta subvertir las normas dominantes.

Sigue existiendo la norma de que las mujeres tienen que depilarse y es una tontería. Arvida Byström

En su cuenta de Instagram cuenta con más de 191 mil seguidores. En ella publica selfies que muestran todos los pequeños detalles de su cuerpo: lunares, barritos, espinillas, moretones...

Y, evidentemente, su vello, ya sea en las piernas, en las axilas o en las ingles.

Arvida es aficionada a las selfies desde los 12 años. En una entrevista con el sitio web Wonderland Magazine explicó ""cuando eres preadolescente o adolescente, quieres saber cómo te ve el mundo en realidad, así que me hacía una cantidad enorme de selfies"".

Cuatro años más tarde, sus fotos llamaron la atención de Vice, que le propuso una primera colaboración.

""Creo que internet es muy importante para muchas personas. Para mí fue como una ventana abierta a la habitación estrecha de la depresión adolescente, porque podía estar en línea y conocer a gente, aunque me sintiera como una mierda"", le dijo a Dazed.

En Tumblr, la joven descubrió subculturas de la web, que le ayudaron a construir su estética kitsch y muy femenina.

🌨 Une publication partagée par arvida byström (@arvidabystrom) le 7 Juil. 2016 à 11h15 PDT

Desde entonces, esa estética no la abandona, pero ella la subvierte para cuestionar todas las normas impuestas a las mujeres.

En 2012 realizó con Vice un nuevo proyecto llamado There Will Be Blood [Habrá sangre], en él presenta en su día a día a mujeres menstruando, lo cual le ha valido numerosos comentarios agresivos.

""Era mi idea"", le contó a Nylon. ""No quería que fuera bello o vulgar, simplemente quería mostrar que las mujeres tienen la regla"".

""Cuando hice esas fotos de regla y de pelos hace años, estaba descubriendo el feminismo, y me parecía bien hacer algo como eso"", explicó.

Pese a las ataduras que sufren las modelos, ella se niega a depilarse.

Desde los 13 años, cuando empezó trabajando como modelo en Suecia, le decían que tenía las caderas demasiado anchas. Continuó trabajando en Londres, donde abrió su propia galería. Allí, se alió a una agencia de modelos para gente ""demasiado cool como para ser simplemente modelo"".

Su objetivo siempre fue romper con los códigos tradicionales de ese mundillo.

Entonces se instaló en Los Ángeles.En 2013, durante una semana, participó en una exposición en la galería Waywardn de Londres con el artista Tim Kelly. Se colocó sobre un colchón con un arnés con pene. Hablaban del amor exclusivo y del poliamor y después se acostaban.

hi this isn't breaching community guidelines Une publication partagée par arvida byström (@arvidabystrom) le 16 Févr. 2016 à 10h43 PST

Al día de hoy, Arvida sigue cuestionando la transgresión. De hecho, en marzo de 2017 publicó el libro Pics or it didn't Happen con su amiga Molly Soda, en este libro recogieron 250 fotos censuradas por Instagram. Fueron denunciadas, a veces porque no respetaban las reglas sobre la desnudez, y otras por razones más oscuras.

""El cuerpo de las mujeres está constantemente politizado"" —acusaba también Molly Soda—, ""¿por qué Instagram iba a ser una excepción?"".

En 2015, Facebook censuró una foto de su performance Selfie Stick Aerobic, porque la imagen dejaba ver la forma de su vulva a través de una sudadera.

A pesar de todo, Arvida Byström no considera que sus creaciones sean feministas. ""El feminismo es más un abanico, cambia y depende de su contexto"", argumenta. En cualquier caso, sirve para perturbar a los partidarios de las normas dominantes de la feminidad.

Trato de transmitir amor, e intento recordar que no todo el mundo tiene las mismas experiencias personales. Gracias por todo el amor, que de eso también me llega mucho. Arvida Byström.

Cette semaine, le partenaire de celle-ci Constantino Samaras, jeune policier au moment de l'affaire, vient d'être trouvé coupable en déontologie policière, pour ne pas être intervenu alors que sa consœur fait une arrestation musclée et à la limite de la légalité. Le policier aura deux jours de suspension.

Selon la déontologie policière, le constable Samaras aurait dû s'interposer pour faire cesser les agissements de sa partenaire. Dites-moi comment faire pour arrêter un confrère lors d'une arrestation qui tourne au vinaigre?

Les faits

Nous sommes devant un cycliste qui reçoit une contravention. Un citoyen sortant d'un taxi décidant de rester là pour servir de témoin au cycliste. Ceci au cas où celui-ci voudrait contester le billet. Puis, il y a aussi un groupe d'amis autour d'eux. Des paroles pas très agréables sont échangées et ce témoin se retrouve au sol menotté. Puis il fera un tour de voiture et laissé quelques coins de rue plus loin, sans accusations.

Il aurait peut-être pu en parler à ses supérieurs après le fait, mais sur le moment, il n'aura aucun contrôle sur la situation.

Que pouvait faire le constable Samaras? Il se trouve mêlé à une confrontation, lié à sa partenaire «senior», devant quelques personnes pour le moins mécontentes. Ne me dites pas que le plaignant dans cette affaire s'est contenté de regarder. Il aurait été choisi comme ça sur le lot d'amis du cycliste qu'il ne doit pas connaître en principe. Le constable Samaras doit en principe veiller à la sécurité de sa partenaire et de la sienne. L'article ne dit pas combien de personnes sont autour, mais parle d'amis, donc au moins deux, en plus du témoin. Que faire? Peut-être sauter sur sa partenaire et délivrer le pauvre témoin. Procéder à l'arrestation de celle-ci? Il aurait peut-être pu en parler à ses supérieurs après le fait, mais sur le moment, il n'aura aucun contrôle sur la situation.

Maintenant, voyons ça d'une autre façon.

Le cycliste reçoit une contravention, le témoin sort de son taxi et décide de rester là comme témoin de la scène. Il ne peut être témoin à l'infraction, puis qu'il n'était pas sur les lieux à ce moment. Il semble qu'il y ait aussi des amis du cycliste sur les lieux, donc la pertinence de sa présence est plus que douteuse. S'il ne dit pas un mot, regarde ce qui se passe et se fait arrêter, c'est une totale injustice. Mais, j'en serais fort surpris. Est-il possible qu'il ait voulu se mêler d'une chose qui ne le regardait pas et s'approcher assez pour que les policiers se sentent mal à l'aise. Je doute fort que le témoin soit demeuré hors de l'affaire. Il aura sûrement un tout petit peu participé à, disons une petite engueulade, juste assez pour se faire remarquer et que l'on sente son haleine.

La policière 728 aura mal agi en le plaquant au sol, elle aura eu des mots insultants à son égard, elle l'aura ensuite débarqué quelques coins de rue plus loin. Mais, son partenaire paye pour ne pas avoir su que faire lors de l'incident.

La déontologie policière, pour qui je n'ai qu'un mince respect, passe des mois à étudier le cas. Il y a trois commissaires dont un officier supérieur du SPVM qui habituellement s'est tenu loin de la rue, évaluent les gestes posés. Voilà ce qu'un policier aurait dû faire, nous le voyons comme ça . Ces trois personnes n'ont jamais fait de terrain, mais sont des légalistes.

Il y a déjà quelques années, cette même déontologie tentait de me blâmer dans un cas de violence conjugale: je n'avais pas été assez empathique envers l'agresseur. Pire, le représentant du SPVM ne connaissant pas les directives de son propre département me semonça pour ne pas avoir libéré le prévenu sur promesse de comparaître.

Mon ex-partenaire dans un autre cas de violence et de fraude a remis la moitié de l'argent du mari à l'épouse qui voulait disparaître avec les enfants. Il fut blâmé pour son geste humanitaire. Ce n'était pas permis, il fallait laisser la dame et les trois enfants sans le sou.

Alors, le constable Samaras sait maintenant qu'il faut arrêter son partenaire quand il croit qu'il est en tort.

After the heady heights of winning all but three of Scotland’s Westminster seats in 2015, Nicola Sturgeon put all her chips on pro-Remain Scots getting behind a second independence referendum in order to escape Brexit.

But the First Minister’s gamble backfired and the party lost a third of its seats, including those of talismanic figures Alex Salmond, Angus Robertson and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.

The Nats face an attack on two fronts.

Secondly, a revived Scottish Conservative Party, under the talented and influential Ruth Davidson, has a foothold in the rural north-east and borders and are making hay from the Scottish Government’s faltering education reforms week-in week-out.

As Brexit looms large, the road ahead is far from clear now the voters have delivered their verdict on Sturgeon’s hasty post-Brexit claim that ‘Indy Ref 2’ was then “highly likely”.

Ruth Davidson’s ruthlessly efficient attack line – “get on with the day job” – could prove lethal if the SNP is unable to shake criticism the party is obsessed with the constitution.

But with the vote split across three main parties in Scotland, it is all to play for. The troops now have to figure out a formula that will shore up potential losses while remaining in government at Holyrood.

It would be premature for anyone, least of all Davidson, to declare we have reached ‘peak SNP’.

A YouGov poll for the Times sees Sturgeon’s party way out ahead on 35 percent, impressive for a party which has been in power for a decade, while Labour enjoys a 5 percent boost in support and the Tories are pushed from second to third place at Holyrood.

Ministers would point to support for their new programme for government, unveiled in September, which, after months of divisive campaigning, saw the First Minister take a more consensual approach.

Policies on business tax reform, extending free personal care to the under-65s, a ban on fracking, consulting with local government on education reform and a new National Investment Bank will quell some of the criticism levelled at her from left and right.

Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall after the Corbyn surge south of the border, Sturgeon also performed something of a U-turn and pledged to lift the public sector pay cap, too.

What she hasn’t spelled out is how she will pay for it, with her Finance Secretary Derek Mackay expected to trigger emergency borrowing measures - something Conservative backers who lend the SNP their vote may take a dim view of in the long term.

But despite furiously attempting to square all these circles, Mackay insists the party is up for the fight.

“I think the party is still positive and upbeat and we have a strong and united membership,” says Mackay, who will chair this year’s conference. “We are the ones who have returned from the summer recess with our tails up.

“It is the opposition that look tired and weary.”

With more than 118,000 members, the SNP is thought to be the second largest party in the UK, with Scottish Labour having just a fraction of that figure (21,500 to UK Labour’s 570,000) and the Tories as a UK group reported to have fewer than 100,000, though no official figures have emerged since 2013.

But as the SNP has recorded a drop from 120,000 in 2014 when the party put on around 100,000 members post-independence campaign, chiefs are searching for growth opportunities in order to survive into the future.

Mackay went on: “The Tory surge is well and truly over, their bubble has burst. They have fallen back into third place in Scotland in opinion polls and in membership.”

While Mackay would insist the SNP’s ten years in power have been “transformational”, scores would disagree.

Tax measures remain almost identical to those administered in England, despite promises of bold reform, economic growth sees the nation lagging behind other parts of the UK and despite Sturgeon staking her premiership on delivering better education outcomes, Scotland’s PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) ratings slump to below England, Estonia, Finland and Slovenia.

Labour frequently accuses Sturgeon of failing to fully use all of the welfare powers devolved to Edinburgh - though she will attempt to mitigate the impact of Universal Credit - and SNP voters who jumped ship to Corbyn’s Labour in June would say the party has failed to deliver on their promise of leading a progressive government.

Motions at the conference next week, put forward by various branches, seek to bolster the party’s leftist credentials.

While the party is already investigating a universal basic income, motions at the conference also call for the devolution of immigration controls, a resolution on treating drug misuse as public health rather than criminal matters and there will be a groundswell of support for Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald’s bid to outlaw unpaid trial shifts with a private members bill in Westminster.

Maintaining their left of centre stance is good politics, considering Scottish Labour looks set to elect Corbyn-support Richard Leonard as its next leader.

A Survation poll of SNP voters found they were more likely to vote Labour if it pledged more left-wing measures such as decommissioning Trident (30 percent), a mandatory living wage (37 percent) and renationalising the railways (27 percent).

Mackay said: “We have tried to show we are still radical and that we can deliver reforms. Our programme for government also shows that we are listening and engaging while also acting in the interests of the economy.”

The YouGov poll showed three quarters of Scots (72 percent) were pessimistic about the current state of the Brexit negotiations, while the number of Scots who believe that the Leave vote was the wrong decision has grown since April.



Excluding don’t knows, 66 percent of Scots thought Brexit was the wrong decision.

The same poll, however, showed virtually no shift in support for independence since Scotland voted No in 2014 by 55 percent and a surge in support for the pro-Union Scottish Labour Party.

Sturgeon’s strategy was to link a “hard Tory Brexit” so closely with a re-run of the independence poll, the issue must now be handled with extreme care if the party is to stem the flow of votes to their rivals.

Talk of ‘Indy Ref 2’ has been firmly put on the back burner, with senior figures even urging for the second poll to be kicked further down the road, from pre-Brexit to post-Brexit transition period.

Though this is not a shift in party policy - Alex Salmond positioned the party as pro-European in the 90s - voters were riled by Sturgeon’s “opportunistic” use of the Brexit vote to further the independence cause.

The failed approach has also led to calls for chief executive Peter Murrell, Sturgeon’s husband, to stand down.

Despite losing his Moray seat, Robertson will stay on as deputy leader, while former investment Skye and Lochaber MP Ian Blackford takes on the job of Westminster leader.

Should support for Sturgeon continue to wane among the public, party insiders say “leader in waiting” Robertson may soon find a way into Holyrood - either via a by-election or in 2021.

Robertson in the meantime will turn his talents to building the next case for independence, which must be watertight on its economics.

One of the resolutions is for a Bank of Scotland, suggesting the independence movement could back a breakaway national bank with its own ‘Scottish pound’.

Young firebrand Mhairi Black has previously said she would be prepared to play a leading role in the next independence campaign.

But, with the wider economic picture and the Brexit negotiations with Europe still so unclear, noone in the party is yet willing to champion a ‘Brexit or Independence’ manifesto.

Mackay said: “After the Westminster elections, the First Minister herself said that we would revisit the issue [of a second independence referendum] in light of Brexit.”

However, he added that scepticism for Brexit was growing UK-wide, hinting the SNP’s strategy would not change substantially.",What Next For Nicola Sturgeon's SNP After Their General Election Pummeling?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/07/nicola-sturgeon-snp_n_18211134.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&amp;ir=UK

The protesters want to stop India-based Adani going ahead with the coal mine, which is set to be one of the biggest of its kind in the world.

Community groups and environmental organisations are staging over 45 events across the nation today against the project in Queensland's Galilee Basin.

Adani plans to import 60 million tonnes of coal from Australia each year, sourced from the company's $21 billion Carmichael mine.

The mine is set to bring thousands of jobs to the region, but opponents are worried about its impact on the environment and tourism.

Australian Youth Climate Coalition national director Gemma Borgo-Caratti said the mine posed an ""unacceptable threat"" to the nation's future.

""Young people won't stand by and let another massive coal mine be built in this country,"" she said on Saturday.

""Australia just sweltered through the hottest September on record, with the hottest days more than 16 degrees warmer than the average. Right at the time we need to take substantive climate action, Adani's coal mine would take us in the wrong direction.""

Billionaire Gautam Adani has previously emphasised the job creation potential of the project, taking to Twitter earlier this year to say it could result in an extra 10,000 positions.

The company has promised thousands of local jobs for residents of Townsville and Rockhampton to work on the massive project.",Carmichael Mine Protesters Turn Bondi Beach Into Massive 'Stop Adani' Sign,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/06/carmichael-mine-protesters-turn-bondi-beach-into-massive-stop-adani-sign_a_23235665/

Police admit they're baffled by the disappearance of the 43-year-old who went missing at the weekend from a holiday house at Aireys Inlet, a small town on the Great Ocean Road.

Widespread air, land and water searches have failed to find the avid runner, who regularly jogged long distances from the property, which was again swarming with police on Thursday as the investigation continued.

Inspector Peter Seel told reporters it's possible Ms Curry went for a run and has become disoriented in bushland.

However, the likelihood of finding her alive in the bush after at least four days is remote, he added.

""Just so many days without food, water, shelter and just the elements,"" makes it a grim outlook, he said.

Investigators aren't ruling out suspicious circumstances.

The last confirmed sighting of Ms Curry was by a neighbour, who saw her get into bed on Saturday night after the pair had a ""personal"" conversation.

""The neighbour and her husband were over there, they left and then the wife came back,"" Inspector Seel said.

""It's a personal matter.""

But he said there was no incident on Saturday night that caused the woman distress.

Ms Curry's neighbours visited after another friend had already been at her house for dinner.

Husband David Curry and their three children watched the AFL grand final in Melbourne before returning to the holiday house on Sunday to find her missing and lodging a report with police.

Text messages on Saturday night between the couple, showed no reason for concern, Inspector Seel said.

There has been no activity on Ms Curry's phone since 10.30pm on Saturday and she did not use her Fitbit for several days before she went missing, limiting police ability to track her more recent movements.

Thursday's search included scouring vacant homes, sheds, gardens and door-knocking properties within a 300-metre radius of the house where she was last seen and efforts are due to resume on Friday.

The disappearance has rocked the close-knit community.

""It's just really scary I think because Aireys is such a small little town and it just doesn't happen,"" resident Laura Stocks told the AAP on Thursday.

""It's scary, it's just really eerie.""

Das Bundestreffen der Parteijugend am Samstag hat gezeigt: Eine Annäherung wird beiden nicht leicht fallen

Die Revolte ist ausgeblieben. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) hat den ""Deutschlandtag"", das Bundestreffen der Jungen Union, souverän überstanden.

""Die erste Runde im parteiinternen ‘Endspiel’ geht ganz klar an Angela Merkel"", kommentierte die ""Welt"" den Tag der Kanzlerin mit der Parteijugend, der als Tag der Abrechnung ausgerufen worden war.



Für Aufregung sorgte ein JU-Mitglied aus Bergisch Gladbach. Diego Faßnacht forderte die Kanzlerin zum Rücktritt auf.

Bis zu einer Versöhnung mit den Mitgliedern der CSU scheint es nach dem desaströsen Wahlergebnis der Union noch ein weiter Weg zu sein.

Ist die Lösung im Streit um die Obergrenze gefunden?

Am Sonntag trifft Merkel den bayerischen Ministerpräsident Horst Seehofer, um eine Verhandlungslinie für eine Jamaika-Koalition festzulegen.

Das größte Streitthema, eine Obergrenze für die Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen, könnte dabei ansatzweise schon aus dem Weg geräumt werden. ""Welt""-Korrespondent Robin Alexander berichtet, wie die grobe Lösung an diesem Sonntag aussehen könnte.

Die CSU gestehe zunächst zu, dass das Recht auf Asyl für politisch Verfolgte - wie es auch im Grundgesetz verankert ist - nicht begrenzt werden könne. Das hatten CSU-Politiker zuletzt in Interviews mehrfach gesagt.

Für die vielen Migranten, die als Flüchtlinge nach der Genfer Konvention nach Deutschland kommen, sollen dann Kontingente festgelegt werden, berichtet die ""Welt"" weiter. Die Regelung könnte Teil eines Einwanderungsgesetzes werden, das von der Jamaika-Regierung erarbeitet wird.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Größte Hürde für Jamaika: Was die Parteien über die Obergrenze sagen - und wo ein Kompromiss möglich ist

Merkel versucht die Annäherung - aber reicht das?

Merkel machte auf dem Deutschlandtag in ihrer Rhetorik deutlich, dass auch sie zu einer Annäherung an die Partner in Bayern bereit ist.

Sie sagte den Rechtspopulisten von der AfD eine harte Auseinandersetzung zu. ""Ich stehe dazu, dass rechts von der Union keine Partei sein sollte"", sagte die CDU-Chefin auf Nachfrage der Delegierten. Die entsprechende Aussage stammt bekanntermaßen von der CSU-Legende Franz Josef Strauß.

Doch reichen diese zaghaften Schritte als Annäherung? “Die Bundeskanzlerin will auf keinen Fall ihre Politik aus der Zeit der offenen Grenzen relativieren”, kommentiert die ""Welt"" die anstehenden Verhandlungen um die Obergrenze.

Und: Der ""Deutschlandtag"" hat gezeigt, wie tief der Graben zwischen bayerischer Basis und Berliner Kanzlerin sein kann.

Madsen bestreitet jedoch, Wall ermordet zu haben. Zunächst hatte er ausgesagt, die Journalistin nach der Fahrt mit dem U-Boot wieder an Land abgesetzt zu haben. Nach technischen Problemen sei das Boot dann gesunken.

Später änderte Madsen seine Aussage. Er behauptet nun, Wall sei bei einem Unglück an Bord des U-Bootes zu Tode gekommen. Anschließend habe er die Leiche in die Bucht geworfen.

Secondly, a revived Scottish Conservative Party, under the talented and influential Ruth Davidson, has a foothold in the rural north-east and borders and are making hay from the Scottish Government’s faltering education reforms week-in week-out.

As Brexit looms large, the road ahead is far from clear now the voters have delivered their verdict on Sturgeon’s hasty post-Brexit claim that ‘Indy Ref 2’ was then “highly likely”.

Ruth Davidson’s ruthlessly efficient attack line – “get on with the day job” – could prove lethal if the SNP is unable to shake criticism the party is obsessed with the constitution.

But with the vote split across three main parties in Scotland, it is all to play for. The troops now have to figure out a formula that will shore up potential losses while remaining in government at Holyrood.

It would be premature for anyone, least of all Davidson, to declare we have reached ‘peak SNP’.

A YouGov poll for the Times sees Sturgeon’s party way out ahead on 35 percent, impressive for a party which has been in power for a decade, while Labour enjoys a 5 percent boost in support and the Tories are pushed from second to third place at Holyrood.

Ministers would point to support for their new programme for government, unveiled in September, which, after months of divisive campaigning, saw the First Minister take a more consensual approach.

Policies on business tax reform, extending free personal care to the under-65s, a ban on fracking, consulting with local government on education reform and a new National Investment Bank will quell some of the criticism levelled at her from left and right.

Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall after the Corbyn surge south of the border, Sturgeon also performed something of a U-turn and pledged to lift the public sector pay cap, too.

What she hasn’t spelled out is how she will pay for it, with her Finance Secretary Derek Mackay expected to trigger emergency borrowing measures - something Conservative backers who lend the SNP their vote may take a dim view of in the long term.

But despite furiously attempting to square all these circles, Mackay insists the party is up for the fight.

“I think the party is still positive and upbeat and we have a strong and united membership,” says Mackay, who will chair this year’s conference. “We are the ones who have returned from the summer recess with our tails up.

“It is the opposition that look tired and weary.”

With more than 118,000 members, the SNP is thought to be the second largest party in the UK, with Scottish Labour having just a fraction of that figure (21,500 to UK Labour’s 570,000) and the Tories as a UK group reported to have fewer than 100,000, though no official figures have emerged since 2013.

But as the SNP has recorded a drop from 120,000 in 2014 when the party put on around 100,000 members post-independence campaign, chiefs are searching for growth opportunities in order to survive into the future.

Mackay went on: “The Tory surge is well and truly over, their bubble has burst. They have fallen back into third place in Scotland in opinion polls and in membership.”

While Mackay would insist the SNP’s ten years in power have been “transformational”, scores would disagree.

Tax measures remain almost identical to those administered in England, despite promises of bold reform, economic growth sees the nation lagging behind other parts of the UK and despite Sturgeon staking her premiership on delivering better education outcomes, Scotland’s PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) ratings slump to below England, Estonia, Finland and Slovenia.

Labour frequently accuses Sturgeon of failing to fully use all of the welfare powers devolved to Edinburgh - though she will attempt to mitigate the impact of Universal Credit - and SNP voters who jumped ship to Corbyn’s Labour in June would say the party has failed to deliver on their promise of leading a progressive government.

Motions at the conference next week, put forward by various branches, seek to bolster the party’s leftist credentials.

While the party is already investigating a universal basic income, motions at the conference also call for the devolution of immigration controls, a resolution on treating drug misuse as public health rather than criminal matters and there will be a groundswell of support for Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald’s bid to outlaw unpaid trial shifts with a private members bill in Westminster.

Maintaining their left of centre stance is good politics, considering Scottish Labour looks set to elect Corbyn-support Richard Leonard as its next leader.

A Survation poll of SNP voters found they were more likely to vote Labour if it pledged more left-wing measures such as decommissioning Trident (30 percent), a mandatory living wage (37 percent) and renationalising the railways (27 percent).

Mackay said: “We have tried to show we are still radical and that we can deliver reforms. Our programme for government also shows that we are listening and engaging while also acting in the interests of the economy.”

The YouGov poll showed three quarters of Scots (72 percent) were pessimistic about the current state of the Brexit negotiations, while the number of Scots who believe that the Leave vote was the wrong decision has grown since April.



Excluding don’t knows, 66 percent of Scots thought Brexit was the wrong decision.

The same poll, however, showed virtually no shift in support for independence since Scotland voted No in 2014 by 55 percent and a surge in support for the pro-Union Scottish Labour Party.

Sturgeon’s strategy was to link a “hard Tory Brexit” so closely with a re-run of the independence poll, the issue must now be handled with extreme care if the party is to stem the flow of votes to their rivals.

Talk of ‘Indy Ref 2’ has been firmly put on the back burner, with senior figures even urging for the second poll to be kicked further down the road, from pre-Brexit to post-Brexit transition period.

Though this is not a shift in party policy - Alex Salmond positioned the party as pro-European in the 90s - voters were riled by Sturgeon’s “opportunistic” use of the Brexit vote to further the independence cause.

The failed approach has also led to calls for chief executive Peter Murrell, Sturgeon’s husband, to stand down.

Despite losing his Moray seat, Robertson will stay on as deputy leader, while former investment Skye and Lochaber MP Ian Blackford takes on the job of Westminster leader.

Should support for Sturgeon continue to wane among the public, party insiders say “leader in waiting” Robertson may soon find a way into Holyrood - either via a by-election or in 2021.

Robertson in the meantime will turn his talents to building the next case for independence, which must be watertight on its economics.

One of the resolutions is for a Bank of Scotland, suggesting the independence movement could back a breakaway national bank with its own ‘Scottish pound’.

Young firebrand Mhairi Black has previously said she would be prepared to play a leading role in the next independence campaign.

But, with the wider economic picture and the Brexit negotiations with Europe still so unclear, noone in the party is yet willing to champion a ‘Brexit or Independence’ manifesto.

Mackay said: “After the Westminster elections, the First Minister herself said that we would revisit the issue [of a second independence referendum] in light of Brexit.”

However, he added that scepticism for Brexit was growing UK-wide, hinting the SNP’s strategy would not change substantially.",What Next For Nicola Sturgeon's SNP After Their General Election Pummeling?,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/07/nicola-sturgeon-snp_n_18211134.html

Viele Menschen haben in ihrem Leben Phasen, in denen sie weniger Lust auf Sex haben

Das kann sowohl psychische als auch physische Gründe haben

Ein Sextherapeut verrät, was ihr gegen die Unlust tun könnt

Frauen verlieren häufiger das Interesse an Sex als Männer. Zu diesem Ergebnis ist eine aktuelle britische Studie gekommen. 34 Prozent der Frauen aber nur 15 Prozent der befragten Männer beklagten mangelndes Interesse an Sex.

Und für mehr als die Hälfte - 62 Prozent Frauen und 53 Prozent Männer - ist dieses mangelnde Interesse ein großes Problem.

Aber: Die Lust kann zurückkehren.

Es gibt eine Reihe an Gründen, wieso Frauen das Interesse an Sex verlieren, erklärt Sex-Therapeut Peter Saddington - von Mutterschaft bis zu psychischen Problemen.

""Typisch ist die Unlust, wenn jemand gerade Kinder bekommen hat oder junge Kinder hat und sich müde fühlt oder nicht viel Zeit hat oder sich nicht so attraktiv fühlt wie früher”, sagt Saddington. ""Ein anderer häufiger Grund, über den nicht viel geredet wird, ist psychische Gesundheit und Depressionen. Wenn du dich depressiv fühlt, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich, dass deine Libido weniger wird.""

Mit diesen sechs Tipps kannst du deine Lust steigern:

1. Kommuniziert mehr

“Als erstes muss man merken, dass tatsächlich etwas anders ist. Es reicht nicht, wenn das Problem nur der Partner anspricht oder wenn man es ignoriert”, sagt Saddington. “Danach solltet ihr mit eurem Partner sprechen. Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass er etwas bemerkt hat und dass das vielleicht Spannungen in eurer Beziehung erzeugt"", rät der Therapeut.

""Darüber zu reden bringt das Problem von Innen nach Außen, ihr erkennt an, dass euer sexuelles Verlangen weniger ist. Dann habt ihr die Chance, darüber nachzudenken, was ihr machen könnt um das Verlangen zurückzubekommen.”

Außerdem sind Menschen, für die es leicht ist, mit ihrem Partner über Sex zu sprechen, weniger anfällig für sexuelle Unlust, wie die Studie herausfand.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Neue Studie zeigt: Das steckt dahinter, wenn euer Partner keine Lust auf Sex hat

2. Nehmt euch Zeit für Date-Nights

Saddington glaubt an die Kraft von Date Nights. “Denkt darüber nach, eine Date Night einzuführen und nehmt euch Zeit, statt zu erwarten, dass es schnell zum Sex kommt”, rät er Frauen.

“Wenn ihr es euch erlaubt zu entspannen und euch gut zu fühlen und euch nicht nur als Mutter, die gestresst ist und zu wenig Zeit hat, dann bemerkt ihr vielleicht, wie das Interesse wieder auflebt.""

3. Baut eine emotionale Verbindung auf

Date Nights sind auch wichtig, um eine emotionale Bindung aufzubauen. ""Männer können durch Bilder oder Gedanken an sie erregt werden, das ist viel visueller. Frauen brauchen eine emotionale Verbindung"", sagt er.

""Wenn ihr Zeit miteinander verbringt und miteinander sprecht, ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass ihr Sex haben wollt. Es ist außerdem wichtig, alle Probleme zu lösen, weil unterschwelliger Groll euch daran hindern wird, Verlangen zu spüren.”

4. Konzentriert euch auf eure mentale Gesundheit

Menschen, deren Libido unter ihrer Depression oder Unsicherheit leidet, kann es helfen, sich mit der Krankheit auseinanderzusetzen oder mit dem Hausarzt zu sprechen.

Um die Erregung zurückzubringen, rät Saddington, Sport zu treiben und sich auf Aktivitäten zu konzentrieren, die euer Wohlbefinden steigern.

""Sport ist im Allgemeinen etwas Gutes. Denn Sport treiben setzt Endorphine, die dich selbst gut fühlen lassen werden. Wer sich gut fühlt, fühlt sich auch eher sexuell.""

5. Arbeite daran

Er habe schon viele ältere Frauen erlebt, die neue Beziehungen eingegangen seien, deren Verlangen aber dann nach einer Zeit gesunken sei, sagt der Sextherapeut. Es sei wichtig, sich daran zu erinnern, dass man an Beziehungen und an der Libido arbeiten muss.

""Am Anfang ist Lust da, man will eine Verbindung eingehen, aber entwickelt sich schnell weiter. Und es ist ein Teil des Alterungsprozesses, dass wir nicht immer so eine hohe Libido haben"", sagt er.

""In diesen Fällen muss man sich Zeit nehmen um Möglichkeiten zu schaffen. Ihr müsst daran arbeiten.""

6. Macht euch keine Sorgen

Wenn ihr euch über mangelnde sexuelle Lust Sorgen macht, bitte lasst es.

""Es ist sowohl für Männer als auch Frauen nicht ungewöhnlich, wenn die Libido einmal einbricht"", sagt Saddington. Es könne physische Gründe dafür geben: ""schlechte Gesundheit, Müdigkeit, Unsicherheit, sich überarbeitet zu fühlen.""

Und es gebe psychologische Gründe: ""Eltern werden, Stress in der Arbeit, Depression."" Es könne eine Mischung aus allen Gründen sein und es müsse einfach auch nicht sein, dass jeder immer das gleiche Level an Lust habe.

""Es muss normal werden, dass jeder Zeiten hat, in denen er keine Lust hat. Es geht darum, wie man damit umgeht und darum, darüber zu reden. Und es nicht ignoriert oder vergisst - das ist wichtig.""

CNN and NBC News reported Thursday that Mueller's investigators have spoken to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier. A separate report by Reuters said Mueller's team had taken over the FBI's inquiries into the dossier as part of the special counsel's investigation into whether Trump associates had colluded with Russian officials to influence the 2016 election.

The document, which Trump was informed about shortly before his inauguration by then-FBI Director James Comey, alleges compromising details about the president and his ties to Russia, including claims that Trump associates did indeed collude with Russians.

It also alleges that Russian officials are sitting on damaging information about the president, including accusations that Trump hired ""a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show in front of him"" while staying in a hotel suite in Moscow that was under surveillance by Russian intelligence.

The dossier's claims have not been substantiated, and Trump has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them ""totally made-up stuff.""

Speaking to Metro, she explained: “There are real racial injustices going on in the world and I think is dangerous to throw the race card in for something that has no bearing.

Chizzy had a particularly emotional reaction when she first discovered that she’d be leaving the competition, leaving us all crying along at home with her, later thanking professional partner Pasha Kovalev for helping her throughout her time on the show.

She said: “This dude, I have loved every minute dancing with him and it will continue because I will just be going round his house to dance now. But I don’t have his address so if anyone could email me I would appreciate it.”

Shapps admitted that he is one of five former Cabinet ministers among more than 30 Tory MPs who want the Prime Minister to step down.

He said that MPs were “perfectly within their rights” to ask May to quit and said she should “take responsibility” for calling the snap general election and losing her Commons majority.

“We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

“This is a view I have held for quite some time and quite a lot of colleagues feel the same way, including five former cabinet ministers. I think she should call a leadership election. The writing is on the wall.”

PA Wire/PA Images Theresa May coughing during her Tory party conference speech.

Shapps, who has told HuffPost UK that he has made no secret of his intentions to Downing Street, confirmed his role in the plot after the Times newspaper reported he was the man organising the rebellion.

A raft of Cabinet ministers and senior backbenchers have come out to defend May after her Tory conference speech was derailed by a failing voice, a prank protest and a collapsing backdrop.

But despite the rearguard action, one MP texted the Government Chief Whip on Thursday evening to say May “needs to go and go now”, HuffPost UK revealed.

Some 48 MPs are needed to formally trigger a confidence vote in the Tory leader, but Shapps hopes that she will resign after an informal approach from MPs who worry she is damaging the party’s chances of re-election.

Shapps told Radio Four’s Today Programme that Number 10 had known for a while he was leading the rebels and phoned him before the conference, “pleading” with him not to say anything.

He also said he had only stepped forward because the party whips briefed The Times that he was leading the rebellion.

He confirmed he had spoken to serving Cabinet ministers but would not say how many. He repeated that five former ministers were on his side.

Shapps later told Sky News “one or two” Cabinet ministers agreed May should resign.

He told Today he wanted to oust the prime minister by applying private pressure to “avoid embarrassment”. “I’m very sorry the whips have not made that possible,” he said.

Shapps added that May’s disastrous conference speech meant that “some colleagues feel it would be better to have that leadership election sooner or rather later”.

“There’s nothing wrong or illegitimate in saying we can do better than this,” he said.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who ran in last year’s leadership contest, told Today he had not had any messages from any ministers agreeing with Shapps.

He said May should remain prime minister “as long as she wants”.

“The prime minister’s been doing a fantastic job. She showed an amazing degree of resilience and courage this week,” he said.

“The truth is that the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs, the entirety of the Cabinet, the overwhelming majority of people want the prime minister to concentrate on doing the job which 14 million people elected her to do.

“It would be disrespectful to those people to do anything other than concentrate on those areas where action is necessary.”

Business Minister Margot James hit out at the plotters, declaring they were embittered individuals.

EMPICS Entertainment Business Minister Margot James.

She told BBC2′s Newsnight: “There are some ex-cabinet ministers or ex-ministers who are extremely embittered individuals who just want to get their own back – on the fact that they don’t feel recognised and, you know, life is full of that, you have to move on, keep going and disregard it. That would be my advice to the Prime Minister.”

May’s de facto deputy Damian Green said it was “nonsense” to suggest she should go over conference speech, adding that the prankster who presented her with a fake P45 was “a pillock”.

The First Secretary of State told BBC One’s Question Time: “I know that she is as determined as ever to get on with her job - she sees it as her duty to do so. She will carry on and she will make a success of this government.”

HuffPost UK revealed that if she refuses to resign before the weekend, the plotters are prepared for a “slow and gradual” process to remove her and have been taking tips from those who took months to oust Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader in 2003.

The PM was at home with husband Philip on a rare “day off” in her Maidenhead constituency on Thursday, and MPs keen on her resignation were hoping that Mr May could play a key role in persuading her to give up.

One former minister told HuffPost UK that some hoped the PM’s husband would play a key role this weekend, but added that he and fellow critics were prepared to wait months to build enough numbers to persuade her privately to leave office.

“I think Philip might in these circumstances say ‘darling, let’s not do this anymore’. But on balance that’s unlikely and she will need a further shove.”

The last 24 hours had “moved the dial” against her, one rebel said, adding the idea she could remain in Downing Street until Brexit takes place in 2019 was “laughable”.

By Sanjiv Phansalkar*

Three years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Make in India campaign. The idea behind this was to make India a major manufacturing hub. It would achieve at least three things—cause a flow of investment into the country, lead to significant boost in exports, and absorb at least some of the skilled and educated people into the workforce. With fairly significant and consistent efforts in this direction, the Make in India strategy is yielding some results. Whether they are satisfactory or not is for the government to figure out.

To a large extent, the three objectives of Make in India are applicable with even a greater force to ""Make in Rural India"" as well. While formal definitions by puritanical economists will suggest that many of the newly set up Exclusive Economic Zones or even the older style industrial estates were indeed in rural India, clearly they are of little direct help to the rural poor. Such industrial locales and investments therein are more like extensions of nearby urban centres and do not directly lead to benefits to rural folk.

A significant portion of the Make in India initiative can be realised in rural areas through enterprises that have potential to benefit and provide employment to a large number of people.

Much of rural India suffers from a want of economic diversification and income increase. Agriculture is experiencing an onslaught of mechanisation and hence expansion of labour absorption in agriculture without significant change in product mix is unlikely. Even if it were likely, the demand for employment in agriculture is falling as survey after survey reveals that young people simply do not wish to join the workforce in agriculture.

With the unabated vagaries of weather, risks in agriculture do not seem to be reducing. Income risks too are huge, as indicated by wild variations in the prices of pulses and fortunes of pulse growers in recent years. Finally, if Make in Rural India fetches more income in rural areas, the money multiplier effect will trickle down the benefits for many more persons in that society. Thus a strong movement for Make in Rural India is needed.

Manufacturing in rural areas

It is important to understand the factors that hinder investment in manufacturing in rural areas. The advantages of locating any sort of manufacturing activity in rural India are in terms of reduced cost of land and perhaps cheaper labour. The other ""advantages""—in reality enjoyed by the industry though its captains will hotly deny it—relate to unchecked effluent release and much laxity in enforcement of any other regulation.

The disadvantages can be in terms of particularly unreliable power supply, distance from centres where frequently needed services (cargo movement, repair teams, supply of parts and stores, etc.) are concentrated and the staff's reluctance to face the daily drudgery of travelling to and from the facility to their homes.

Hardcore industrial activities are unlikely to be initiated by urban entrepreneurs in rural areas to any significant extent unless some significant mediation introduces compatibility between rural lifestyles and urban industrial work demands. At the same time, it would appear that a fair range of industrial activities, particularly pertaining to supplying products and stores for agricultural operations on one hand and post-harvest processing of farm produce on the other can be conveniently located in rural areas. This may cover manufacture of feeds, sorting, grading and packing of seeds, primary and even secondary processing of horticultural produce, etc.

Primary products

A similar possibility can be envisaged for primary products. In fact there is nothing new in this—most sugar mills, a fair number of oil mills, marble-cutting units, brick kilns, etc., are located in rural areas since this makes sense both for the farmers and suppliers of other inputs as well as for the processors.

The lower order bureaucracy... tends to be stubborn, corrupt and often pliable at the hands of those who feel threatened by emergence of new enterprises.

When one begins exploring the extent of expansion of such industry and what new lines can be considered as relevant, one suddenly encounters a difficulty hitherto not encountered. This is in the nature of stranglehold of the local rural power structures and their unrepentant and rapacious rent-seeking behaviour. When one goes to understand the ownership of stone quarries or oil mills, cold storages or fertiliser mixing units, one often encounters the reality that they are established and run by well-entrenched local economic powers. The people involved enjoy all the celebrated advantages of caste, class and political power and hence experience little difficulty in ensuring that their fiat runs unchallenged.

But when farmer-producer companies of poor or, worse, Dalit, members try to start industrial activity of this nature, snags emerge and become life threatening for the nascent units. The local overlords and their minions swing into action, fearing that the new enterprises will lead to liberation of the oppressed from the shackles they impose.

Calculus of economic gain

I actually witnessed a situation when the local feudal lord in Mahakaushal's Wainganga command had tried his best to sabotage a canal bringing water because the irrigation would have set all his serfs free of his domination. This was despite the fact that his own farms would have received water as well! How the calculus of economic gain competes with raw social power is truly unfathomable to an outsider!

The lower order bureaucracy, which is really the cutting edge in regulating the units or supplying essential inputs like electricity to them, tends to be stubborn, corrupt and often pliable at the hands of those who feel threatened by emergence of new enterprises. It is possible that uninitiated urban entrepreneurs venturing into enterprises for which Make in Rural India is a sensible proposition may not be prepared to deal with these threats, or may not even understand their gravity.

If urban entrepreneurs not already aligned to the local power structures and farmer-producer companies face difficulties in starting enterprises in rural India, what would seem to be the choices then? Either the enterprises have got to be owned by the local overlords or they must as a first step learn how to manage them.

Does that seem fair or promising? Or, is it possible to trigger sufficiently strong economic incentives, which persuade the local power structures in their own interest to facilitate the new enterprises? This question needs further exploration and thought.

WASHINGTON — A book which Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland shared with her U.S. and Mexican colleagues during the last round of NAFTA negotiations, offers a dark message about globalization's collapse, the rise of nationalism and humanity tumbling into an abyss of death and destruction.

She brought three books to an informal book club with peers Robert Lighthizer and Ildefonso Guajardo. Two tell a positive tale of human advancement. The third serves up a bleak historical lesson about the big anti-globalization backlash of the last century.

It's no accident she chose to share ""The War That Ended Peace,'' Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan's look at the factors that led to the first of two world wars. Freeland, the book and, in an interview, the book's author, all cite similarities to today.

Freeland's third book delved into anti-globalization backlash

Freeland and other Canadian officials have been struck by the book's haunting tale: how a period of fast-paced globalization, prosperity, disruptive technology and increased trade was brutally upended by nationalism, zero-sum logic, a global terrorism panic and glorified militarism, ushering in the most blood-soaked era in history.

""(It) documents the speed and ferocity with which reaction can set in, even at times when the world feels safely rooted in a progressive and peaceful era,'' Freeland said in response to a question about the book.

Foreign Affairs Minister speaking about NAFTA talks:

""As with today, the beginning of the 20th century was marked by unprecedented globalization and growth. The events between the turn of the century and the outbreak of war in 1914 are a useful reminder (of) the fragility of the world order and the pitfalls of protectionism and retreat.''

The book starts with the 1900 Paris world's fair and the Belle Epoque.

That world was unprecedentedly interconnected by railways and the telegraph. Trade skyrocketed. Germany and England even traded weapons. People lived longer, healthier lives. New international mechanisms were created to settle disputes. Countries signed arbitration agreements, refined international rules of war and even talked about creating global governance bodies.

The book describes a growing belief that war itself was becoming obsolete, quoting one author: ""People no (more) believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses ... (than) in ghosts and witches'.''

MacMillan's book on 1900s echoes current turbulent times

But these were also disruptive times.

Economies underwent radical transformations and workers left farms for new manufacturing jobs in the cities.

Terrorism was rampant. Anarchists had killed, bombed, stabbed and shot a French president, two Spanish prime ministers, an Italian king, a U.S. president, an Austrian empress, a Russian statesman and a Russian royal.

MacMillan writes of the militaristic backlash. People fumed about the new softness of European men, responding with military-themed organizations for boys. Politicians increasingly wore uniforms in public.

Soft-centrist politicians were booted from power.

Militaristic chest-thumping was rampant

Classical liberal parties devoted to open markets were demolished, left and right. On the left, by socialists, and on the right by, ""chauvinistic nationalist parties... A new breed of politicians was going outside established parliamentary institutions to appeal to popular fears and prejudices and their populism ... frequently included anti-Semitism.''

MacMillan is thrilled policy-makers might draw lessons from that time. She also credits them for trying to squeeze her 649-page book, and two other books, into busy schedules.

""I'm impressed,'' MacMillan said in an interview from England.

""How they find time to read anything, much less a huge, fat book like mine, I can't imagine. I wonder if they looked at (Freeland) and thought, 'What is she doing giving us this enormous book?'...

I always find it reassuring when statesmen do have a sense of history. ... It helps them — to give them perspective. Author Margaret MacMillan

''(But) I always find it reassuring when statesmen do have a sense of history. ... It helps them — to give them perspective.""

MacMillan cautions that there are no perfect parallels in history, that circumstances change.

But she said there are obvious echoes in this anti-globalization, America First, Brexit era — with nationalist politicians complaining about foreigners, international agreements, duty-free imports and global institutions forged after the Second World War.

""There are, I think, warning signs,'' she said.

""There are parallels that should make us at least stop and think.''

If policy-makers take away one message from her book, she says, it's this: The pursuit of narrow self-interest can inspire others to respond in kind and everyone winds up worse off.

There are parallels that should make us at least stop and think. Author Margaret MacMillan

The other books Freeland shared are more optimistic.

She gave colleagues, ""Sapiens,'' a sweeping history of the human species by Noah Harari, a favoured author of Guajardo's. The final tome was from prize-winning economist Angus Deaton.

In his, ""The Great Escape,'' the Scottish-American author unleashes an avalanche of data illustrating the good fortune of living today in an era of unprecedented wealth, health and human lifespans.

The other two books were more hopeful

He even argues that growing inequality —within and between countries— is a natural effect of rapid technological change, as people catch up at different paces. He suggests ways to address that inequality, including trade and education, rather than traditional international assistance, which he criticizes.

Even MacMillan's book ends on a slightly optimistic note.

After chronicling the tragic decisions that pushed Europe into a canyon of catastrophe, she concludes with four hopeful words: ""There are always choices.''

On Friday, the government decided to offer a number of relief measures that will particularly help exporters, and owners of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Gujarat.

The GST council has lowered the tax rates on 27 products and a few services and asked a panel of state ministers to examine if the 18% GST on air-conditioned restaurants could be lowered. Of the 27 broad categories of items that saw a reduction in GST rates, at least eight were in segments where Gujarat is a dominant player, reports Indian Express.

The tax rates for a bunch of products were reduced from 12 percent to 5 percent. These products include sewing thread of manmade filaments and thread of manmade staple fibres and synthetic filament yarn (nylon, polyester). Tariff was also brought down for ""cullet or other waste or scrap of glass"".

Gujarat has a significant industrial footprint in these segments. As IE notes in this piece, the state accounts for 12 percent of the country's textile exports, it is also the largest manufacturer of manmade fibre.

Meanwhile, the tax rate for food items such as khakhra, ""namkeens"" and sliced dried mango have been reduced.

It's no surprise that Gujarat goes to polls later this year.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the rule changes are in line with the assurance given by the government that if ""any sector needs temporary assistance"" on account of structural reforms like GST, the government will provide it, many on Twitter doesn't quite believe that's the reason.

New Delhi, Oct 7 — Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan's name figures in this year's list of possible winners of Nobel Prize in economics brought out by Clarivate Analytics.

The economics prize will be announced in Stockholm on Monday, according to Nobelprize.org.

Clarivate Analytics, earlier a Thomson Reuters unit, publishes a list of possible Nobel Prize winners based on research citations, ahead of the formal announcement by the Nobel committee.

Rajan is currently the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the Booth School of Business, University of Chicago.

Giving the list of six possible candidates for the economics Nobel, Clarivate said these were Citation Laureates — standouts whose research is clearly ""of Nobel Class"" according to its significance and utility, as attested by markedly high citation tallies recorded in the Web of Science.

According to information available on Clarivate's website, in the last 15 years, 45 of the selected researchers had gone on to receive a Nobel — nine in the same year in which they were tipped by Clarivate and 18 within two years of the distinction.

Rajan's three-year term as RBI governor ended on September 4, 2016.

Exactly one year after his term as RBI governor came to an end, Rajan published a book with his ""commentary and speeches"" to convey what it was like to be at the helm of the central bank in ""those turbulent but exciting times"".

Rajan, who was considered a vocal RBI Governor, in his book I Do What I Do said the demonetisation tool used by the Indian government to drive out black money could have long-term benefits but its short-term economic costs would outweigh them.

""I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my views on demonetisation, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely short-term economic costs would outweigh them, and felt there were potentially better alternatives to achieve the main goal,"" he wrote.

The Indian government undertook the demonetisation drive on 8 November 2016 by banning high denomination Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes.

Rajan is said to have predicted the 2008 market crash caused by the housing market crisis in the US that put its economy into deep recession and set off a global slowdown.

In 2011, he published the acclaimed Fault Lines on how hidden financial fractures threaten the world economy.

He has won the British magazine Central Banking's Central Banker of the Year award for his handling of the rupee crisis in 2013 and bringing back foreign investors to the country.

A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Rajan served as visiting professor at Stockholm School of Economics and at Kellogg School of Management.

He was also a visiting professor at MIT Sloan School of Management.

Für mich, für meine Familie und für alle, die sich selbst nicht wehren können.","Mein ganzes Leben lang habe ich gekämpft. Gegen Ämter, gegen Vorschriften, gegen schlechtgelaunte Sachbearbeiter. Dabei habe ich mich immer für meine Mitmenschen eingesetzt.

Für Menschen, die alles opfern, um ihre erkrankte Familien zu pflegen; für Menschen, die schon jung schwer erkranken; für Menschen die an den Rollstuhl gebunden sind, aber sich trotzdem nicht aufgeben und gegen Sozialämter die den Schwächsten von uns das Leben zur Hölle machen.

Denn das größte Problem in Deutschland sind nicht etwa die Politiker oder der Mangel an politischen Initiativen, sondern die Bürokratie. Und dagegen kämpfe ich - zusammen mit vielen anderen Mitstreitern.

Ich habe alles für meine Familie getan

Mein Vater war schwer krank, ein Pflegefall. Sein ganzes Leben lang hat er sich den Arsch für seine Familie aufgerissen. Nachdem er aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft in Sibirien zurückkehrte, hat er als Fabrikarbeiter gearbeitet.

Deutschland musste nach dem Krieg wieder aufgebaut werden. Zusätzlich arbeitete er noch als Kleppner und beim Kohlehändler. Die drei Jobs hat er im Prinzip sein ganzes Leben gemacht. Am Ende hat ihn das seine Gesundheit gekostet.

Meine Mutter starb, als es meinem Vater immer schlechter ging. Auf der Beerdigung sagte ich ihm, er könne zu uns ziehen. Von da an habe ich mich rund um die Uhr um ihn gekümmert.

Meine zwei Kinder habe ich so gut wie alleine großgezogen. Beiden diagnostizierten die Ärzten ein Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Syndrom. Mein Ex-Mann war ebenfalls ein Pflegefall. Wie meinen Vater pflegte ich ihn bis zu seinem Tod.

68 Jahre alt, 580 Euro Rente und schwerstbehindert

Inzwischen sitze ich selbst im Rollstuhl. 68 Jahre alt, 580 Euro Rente und schwerstbehindert, doch trotzdem weit davon entfernt den Kampf gegen die Ungerechtigkeit in Deutschland aufzugeben.

Denn was mich wirklich wahnsinnig macht, ist die abwertende Haltung vieler Sachbearbeiter gegenüber Hilfesuchenden.

Oft hinterfragen sie überhaupt nicht, wie und warum unsere Lebenssituation so schwierig ist. Für viele Beamte sind Schwerstbehinderte Faulenzer, die einfach keine Lust haben, zu arbeiten und den Staat um ihr Geld betrügen wollen.

Als ich 2014 unverschuldet einen Autounfall erlitt, half der Verein ""Mobil mit Behinderung"", mir einen gebrauchten PKW zu kaufen. Natürlich nicht umsonst. Ich wurde Mitglied bei dem Verein und sammelte Spenden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Nach 51 Jahren Arbeit werde ich meinen Ruhestand in Armut verbringen

Der Sachbearbeiter im Sozialamt hielt das allerdings überhaupt nicht für angebracht. Er zog mir prompt acht Monate lang einen Teil meiner Grundsicherung ab, weil er die Kosten für das Auto mit diesem Betrag verrechnen wollte.

Dabei ist die Grundsicherung für mich überlebenswichtig. Nur so kann ich meine lächerliche Rente von 580 Euro im Monat aufzustocken. Ich musste mir Geld von meinen Freunden leihen, anders hätte ich die Monate nur schwer überlebt. Die Bürokratie des Sozialamts hat mich in eine lebensbedrohliche Armut getrieben.

Monatelang führte ich einen Papierkrieg mit dem zuständigen Sachbearbeiter. Erst der Weg zum Sozialgericht konnte ihn umstimmen. Das Gesetz sieht nämlich klar vor, dass zweckgebundene Spenden mit der Grundsicherung nicht verrechnet werden dürfen. Das weiß eigentlich jedes Sozialarbeiter in Deutschland.

Die deutsche Bürokratie - nichts weiter als eine Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahme?

Oft habe ich das Gefühl, dass die ganze Bürokratie in Deutschland eine Art Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahme für die Angestellten der Ämter und Versicherungen ist. Als ob die Regierung diesen Leuten einfach eine Arbeit geben möchte, die zwar nicht besonders sinnvoll, aber immerhin zeitaufwendig ist.

Die Vorgänge in den Behörden sind möglichst komplex organisiert. Dadurch nimmt die Bearbeitung unmengen an Zeit und Geld in Anspruch. Wären die Abläufe einfacher, könnte sich der deutsche Staat Milliarden Euro an Steuergelder sparen, Geld, dass für eine bessere Versorgung von Behinderten, Senioren und Alleinerziehenden ausgegeben werden könnte.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Top-Ökonom: ""Deutschland ist bereits eines der ungleichsten Länder der industrialisierten Welt""



Für uns dadurch benachteiligte Menschen ist die Bürokratie daher der größte Feind. Wir sind vom Glück eh nicht gerade verfolgt, wieso müssen wir uns auch noch mit unfreundlichen Sachbearbeitern und existenzbedrohenden Gesetzesregelungen herumschlagen?



Es gibt dutzende Fälle in denen Anträge auf Zahlungen, Zuschüsse und Pflegestufen jahrelang bei den Krankenkassen und Ämtern liegenbleiben, einfach weil es nicht genügend Sachbearbeiter gibt, die all die vom Gesetz gebotenen Vorschriften abarbeiten können.



Die betroffenen Menschen sind dann so lange auf sich allein gestellt, bis das Amt sich einmal erbarmt, ihren Fall sachgerecht zu bearbeiten - wenn überhaupt. Doch oft ist es dann schon zu spät.

Seit über einem Monat ist mein Rollstuhl in Reparatur. Die Krankenkasse schickte mir zwar einen Ersatzrollstuhl, doch dieser ist einem furchtbaren Zustand. Die Räder eiern, der Rollstuhl fährt nicht in die gewünschte Richtung. Das Display und der Joystick zum Lenken funktionieren nur schwer. Das Gerät ist eine Gefährdung für den Straßenverkehr.

Als ich neulich über einen Lift in einen Zug einsteigen wollte, wäre ich beinahe umgekippt - einfach weil die Räder kaum noch Stabilität bieten. Dann fiel unterwegs auch noch das Bedienungsfeld des Rollstuhls auseinander. Ich konnte ihn nur noch manuell bedienen. Ohne die Hilfe meiner Mitmenschen, wäre ich ziemlich blöd dagestanden.



Die Krankenkasse habe ich schon mehrmals darauf angesprochen. Doch auf meine Anrufe und Briefe wird einfach nicht reagiert.

Ich habe das Gefühl, dass sich dort niemand für eine behindertengerechte Versorgung interessiert. Manchmal frage ich mich ernsthaft, ob da nicht sogar eine perfide Methode dahinter steckt.



Man stelle sich vor, ich hätte einen tödlichen Unfall, weil mein Rollstuhl verrückt spielt und ich auf die Straße rolle. Die Krankenkasse könnte dann zumindest Kosten einsparen. Ein Schelm ist, wer da böses denkt.



Ich weiß natürlich, dass solche Überlegungen absurd sind. Aber allein, dass ich inzwischen so etwas denke, zeigt mir, wie ratlos mich der Kampf mit den Krankenkassen und Sozialämter diesen Landes inzwischen gemacht hat. Trotzdem: Ich werde weiterkämpfen! Für mich, für meine Familie und für alle, die sich selbst nicht wehren können.

For Monika Berlot, just making the start line of the world's most famous solar car race is as good as winning it.

""To be honest, we just really want to cross the start line and get a reasonable distance,"" says the Australian National University student, who's part of a team in this year's World Solar Challenge.

""Not many teams make it the whole way, so we want to get as far as we can"".

Berlot's team is participating for the first time in the race, which will see at least 95 cars race the 3,000 kilometres from Dawin to Adelaide.

Building the car has been a massive effort for the students, who start the epic race on Sunday as huge underdogs against top teams from Stanford and Cambridge universities.

According to 21-year-old Berlot, it has taken the local undergraduate team two years of hard work to build one of the most energy efficient vehicles in the world, entirely from scratch.

Less than 24 hours out from the race, the team is excited about seeing their significant efforts pay off after the ANU car, known as ""Super Charge"", passed its final checks.

The last barrier was a technical one, Berlot says, with the team receiving safety clearance for their electrical system after failing on Friday.

""It's super stressful, there are a lot of hard deadlines to make, we've now passed everything,"" Berlot adds.

Coming up against teams that have been competing in the race for decades, ANU's team has humble aims.

""To be honest, we just really want to cross the start line and get a reasonable distance. Not many teams make it the whole way, so we want to get as far as we can,"" Berlot tells HuffPost Australia from Darwin.

""The team is super great at dealing with any issues that arise, and we're all just so stoked we got this far"".

The challenge, which is in its 30th year, sees vehicles drive the massive stretch of highway between Darwin and Adelaide using only power from the sun, or from vehicle movement.

Founded by Danish-born Australian Hans Tholstrup, the man who developed the first ever solar car, the race takes place once every two years and is one of the world's most well known solar races.

ANU's bid for a title comes after a number of impressive efforts from Australian cars. In 2009, a University of New South Wales team won the Solar Cell division and in 2013, another UNSW team came third.

But to win, the Aussie students will have to beat the formidable team from Holland's Delft University of Technology, which has taken out the challenge six times.

However, even if they bow out before the finish line, Berlot is confident this is just the start of ANU's solar car ambitions.

Nos deux autres revendications, le 5 et le 10, sont des mesures simples qui amélioreront grandement la conciliation travail-vie personnelle.

Le 5 : pour permettre à toutes et à tous d'organiser leur vie personnelle et leurs obligations familiales, la Loi sur les normes du travail doit obliger les employeurs à fournir l'horaire de travail au moins cinq jours à l'avance. Rien de moins.

Le 10 : pour soutenir les travailleurs et travailleuses qui sont confrontés à la maladie ou à des obligations familiales, il faut garantir dix jours de congé payé. Plus de 60 % des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec n'ont toujours pas accès à cette protection. Quand on a un budget serré, la perspective de perdre quelques jours de salaire incite bon nombre de personnes à travailler même lorsqu'elles sont malades. Si on s'absente pour prendre soin d'un proche gravement malade, ce sont des dépenses essentielles qui sont sacrifiées. Pour protéger des aléas de la vie, c'est 10 jours de congé payé. Rien de moins.

Malheureusement, le gouvernement semble trouver que les travailleuses et les travailleurs ne méritent ni de sortir de la pauvreté ni d'améliorer leurs conditions de travail.

À un an des élections, la campagne 5-10-15 veut inviter l'ensemble des partis politiques à clarifier leurs engagements en matière de salaire minimum et de conditions de travail, mais aussi augmenter la pression sur le gouvernement pour le forcer à s'intéresser au sort des travailleuses et des travailleurs pauvres et à défendre leurs intérêts avec la même vigueur qu'il défend les intérêts du patronat.

Viele Mütter haben Gewissensbisse, wenn sie nach der Geburt ihres Babys schnell wieder in den Job zurückkehren

Dabei zeigen Studien: Kinder profitieren in den meisten Fällen sogar davon

Ein größeres Selbstvertrauen und bessere Leistungen in der Schule sind nur zwei der vielen positiven Effekte

Viele Mütter, die nach der Geburt ihres Kindes früh in den Job zurückkehren, plagen sich Monate, manchmal Jahre mit einem schlechten Gewissen: Schade ich meinem Kind, wenn es früh in die Kita kommt? Würde es sich besser entwickeln, wenn ich den ganzen Tag da gewesen wäre? Hat mein Kind dadurch womöglich eines Tages Bindungsprobleme?

Der vorwurfsvolle Blick vieler Mütter, die später (oder gar nicht) wieder anfangen zu arbeiten, macht die Sache nicht besser. Sogar die “New York Times” stellte kürzlich fest, dass Deutschland ein merkwürdiges Verhältnis zu arbeitenden Müttern habe. Kein Wunder, dass es Ausdrücke wie ""Rabenmutter"" in anderen Sprachen nicht gibt.

Dabei zeigen Studien: Es schadet Kindern nicht, wenn Mütter - aus welchen Gründen auch immer - schnell in die Arbeitswelt zurückkehren. Im Gegenteil.

1. Ein früher Kita-Besuch beeinflusst die Psyche von Kindern positiv

Die meisten Kinder, deren Mütter kurz nach der Geburt in den Job zurückkehren, kommen mit einem Jahr oder früher in die Kita.

Die Angst vieler Eltern: Die Kinder könnten noch nicht weit genug sein. Schaden nehmen.

Doch solange die Kleinen in der Kita gut betreut werden, ist die Sorge laut Experten unbegründet. Wissenschaftler stellten im Gegenteil fest: Für die Entwicklung der Kinder wirkt es sich in den meisten Fällen eher positiv aus, wenn sie außer Haus betreut werden.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: An die berufstätige Mama: Du bist meine Heldin

So leiden sie etwa später seltener an psychischen Störungen, wenn sie schon in den ersten zwei Lebensjahren fremdbetreut werden, wie Veit Roessner, Leiter der Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie der Uniklinik Dresden, 2016 in einer Untersuchung herausfand.

Eine Studie der London School of Economics und der Oxford University zeigte 2016 außerdem: Kinder, die ganztags von ihren Müttern betreut werden, haben schlechtere Sprachkenntnisse und motorische Fähigkeiten als Kinder, die eine Kita besuchen.

""Das Ergebnis der Erhebung sollte Eltern zeigen, dass Kitas ihren Kindern nicht schaden werden und ihnen wahrscheinlich sogar gut tun"", sagte Studienautor Laurence Roope vom Health Economics Research Centre in Oxford der britischen Zeitung ""Telegraph"".

2. Kinder, deren Mütter arbeiten gehen, sind intelligenter und mutiger

Ebenso erstaunlich: Kinder schneiden in Intelligenztests besser ab, wenn ihre Mutter früh an den Arbeitsplatz zurückkehrt.

Zu diesem Ergebnis kamen Forscher der Universität Minnesota in einer Untersuchung, für die sie mehrere Einzelstudien seit 1960 auswerteten.

Die untersuchten Kinder konnten sich außerdem besser anpassen, zeigten ein kooperativeres Verhalten und waren auch seltener ängstlich als die Kinder von Müttern, die nicht arbeiteten.

3. Sie haben mehr Selbstvertrauen

Spätestens in der Schule zeigt sich nach Ansicht von Experten der positive Effekt deutlich.

In einem Papier mit dem Titel ""Wie viel Mutter braucht das Kind?"" stellte die ansonsten konservative Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) 2015 fest: In der Schule zeigen Kinder berufstätiger Mütter mehr Selbstvertrauen als die anderen.

Das Papier greift mehrere Studien aus Nordamerika und verschiedenen europäischen Ländern auf. Allein an Teilstudien aus Deutschland waren 7000 Familien beteiligt.

4. Sie haben bessere Chancen in der Schule

Die Experten der KAS konnten außerdem nachweisen: Kinder von berufstätigen Müttern sind nicht nur selbstbewusster in der Schule, sie sind auch leistungsbereiter.

Zudem schaffen sie häufiger den Sprung aufs Gymnasium als Kinder von Müttern, die zuhause bleiben.

Die KAS kommt zu der Erkenntnis: Kinder lernen so von Beginn an, dass sich mit Engagement im Leben positive Resultate erzielen lassen.

So wie beide Eltern täglich arbeiten, um Geld für die Familie mit nach Hause bringen zu können, bekommen Kinder in der Schule für ihre Bemühungen gute Noten.

5. Sie denken weniger stark in Rollenklischees

""Kinder profitieren nachweislich davon, wenn ihre Mütter arbeiten gehen"", sagte Petra Timm, Arbeitsmarktexpertin vom Personaldienstleister Randstad, zu den Ergebnissen der KAS. ""Wenn Eltern ein entsprechendes Rollenbild vorleben, verinnerlichen ihre Kinder dies von Beginn an. Denn Vater und Mutter sind immer auch Vor- und Leitbilder.""

Forscher der Harvard Business School kamen 2015 in diesem Zusammenhang zu erstaunlichen Ergebnissen. ""Kaum etwas hat unserer Erkenntnis nach einen derart großen Einfluss auf die Überwindung von Geschlechterungleichheit wie von einer berufstätigen Mutter großgezogen zu werden"", sagte die Hauptverantwortliche der Studie, Kathleen L. McGinn.

Für die Untersuchung werteten sie und ihre Kollegen die Aussagen von über 13.000 Frauen und 18.000 Männer aus 24 Industriestaaten aus.

6. Sie sind entscheidungsfreudiger und können sich besser organisieren

Laut KAS haben Kinder von berufstätigen Eltern außerdem eine realistischere Vorstellung vom Arbeitsalltag. Deshalb falle es ihnen leichter, sich nach der Schule für einen Ausbildungsweg zu entscheiden, schreiben die Experten in ihrem Papier.

""Mütter, die den Umgang mit beruflichen Anforderungen und Wissen über unterschiedliche Aspekte beruflichen Lebens vermitteln können, fördern schon dadurch ihre Kinder"", heißt es.

Außerdem kommen die Experten zu dem Ergebnis: Wenn eine berufstätige Mutter etwa in Teilzeit arbeite, lerne ihr Kind von Anfang an, dass zur Arbeit auch die Selbstorganisation gehöre und wie sich Beruf und Privatleben trennen lassen. Vorausgesetzt natürlich die Mutter ist in diesen beiden Bereichen selbst ein Vorbild.

7. Speziell Mädchen sind später erfolgreicher in ihrem eigenen Beruf

Speziell bei Mädchen stellten McGinn und ihre Kollegen von der Harvard Business School einen erstaunlich positiven Effekt fest: Frauen, deren Mutter berufstätig war, entscheiden sich später häufiger, mit Kind ebenfalls in den Job zurückzukehren.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Studie beweist: Berufstätige Mütter haben erfolgreichere Töchter

Außerdem sind sie öfter in verantwortungsvollen Positionen zu finden und verdienen mehr als Frauen, deren Mutter Vollzeit zuhause war, als sie Kind waren.

8. Jungen hingegen bringen sich später stärker in der Familie ein

Auch einen auffälligen Effekt auf Jungs beobachteten die Forscher von der Harvard Business School: Wenn sie von einer berufstätigen Mutter erzogen werden, bringen sie sich später stärker im Haushalt ein und verbringen mehr Zeit mit ihrer Familie als Männer, deren Mutter nicht arbeiten ging.

9. Berufstätige Mütter sind zufriedener - und das wirkt sich positiv auf die Kinder aus

Um schließlich auch die Perspektive der Mutter noch zu berücksichtigen: Wenn Mütter rasch nach der Geburt wieder ihrem Beruf nachgehen, steigert das häufig deren Zufriedenheit. Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt eine 2013 veröffentlichte Langzeitstudie der Bochumer Ruhr-Universität, eine der am größten angelegten Familienstudien in Deutschland überhaupt.

Die Hauptfrage der Untersuchung war: Welche Faktoren tragen zum Wohlergehen von Kindern bei und wie spielen staatliche Rahmenbedingungen, Persönlichkeits- und Bildungsmerkmale der Eltern sowie wirtschaftliche und Einkommensverhältnisse der Familie dabei zusammen?

Das Ergebnis: Schon Babys profitieren, wenn die Mutter sich nicht ausschließlich dem Muttersein widmet. Die Studie belegt einen signifikant positiven Effekt auf Neugeborene und Einjährige, wenn die Mutter bis zu 20 Stunden pro Woche arbeitet und sie außer Haus betreut werden.

Die Forscher führen das auf die bereits erwähnte größere Zufriedenheit berufstätiger Mütter zurück - und die, so schlussfolgern die Experten, wirke sich direkt auf das Wohlergehen des Kindes aus.

""Insofern erscheint im Hinblick auf das Wohlergehen von Kindern eine Ausweitung der Partizipation an der Arbeitswelt von Müttern als frei von negativen Wirkungen"", summieren die Autorinnen und Autoren der Studie.

Im Klartext: Wenn ihr arbeiten wollt, geht arbeiten. Es schadet euren Kindern nicht. Im Gegenteil.

Der Vorwurf: Die Politikerin soll Anschriften und Telefonnummern von AfD-Mitgliedern geklaut haben

Die AfD will offenbar ihre Ex-Chefin Frauke Petry verklagen. Das berichtet das Magazin ""Stern"".

Nach Informationen des ""Sterns"" wirft der AfD-Bundesvorstand Petry vor, Daten geklaut zu haben. Die Partei vermute, dass sich Petry an den Mitgliederdaten bedient habe.

Der interne Parteimanager enthalte demnach die Anschriften und Telefonnummern von knapp 30.000 AfD-Mitgliedern.

Offenbar wolle Petry die Daten zum Aufbau ihrer eigenen Partei nutzen, berichtet der ""Stern"". Die AfD werte derzeit die Softwaredaten aus. Petry nahm zu den Vorwürfen nicht Stellung.

Petry und ihr Ehemann Macrus Pretzell sind nach der Bundestagswahl aus der AfD ausgetreten. Pretzell war Landes- und Fraktionschef der AfD in Nordrhein-Westfalen.

Die Bundesfraktionschefin Alice Weidel hält weitere Austritte aus der AfD-Fraktion für möglich. ""Vielleicht gibt es ein, zwei weitere Austritte, die möchte ich mittlerweile nicht mehr ausschließen"", sagte Weidel am Donnerstag am Rande einer Fraktionssitzung in Berlin.

Am Mittwoch hatte der Bundestagsabgeordnete Mario Mieruch seinen Austritt aus der Fraktion bekanntgegeben.

Er begründete seinen Schritt gegenüber der ""Bild""-Zeitung mit einer mangelnden Abgrenzung nach rechts. Ähnliche Gründe hatte auch die frühere Parteichefin Petry angeführt.

Die ehemalige Chefin ist also weiterhin präsent in ihrer Partei - auch wegen einer möglichen Anklage, die laut ""Stern"" nun im Raum stehe.

Die spanische Regierung lehnt weiter jeden Dialog mit der Führung Kataloniens ab

Jetzt will sie die Region wirtschaftlich ausbluten

Dabei macht sie besorgten Unternehmen und Geldhäusern den Abzug leichter

Die Lage in Spanien spitzt sich immer weiter zu. Jetzt will die spanische Regierung im Katalonien-Konflikt den wirtschaftlichen Druck auf die nach Unabhängigkeit strebende Region erhöhen.

Beide Parteien rücken keinen Millimeter von ihren diametral entgegengesetzten Forderungen ab - aus Sicht vieler Beobachter könnte das gar zu einem Bürgerkrieg führen. Denn auf beiden Seiten stehen sich hartgesottene Nationalisten gegenüber.

Nun also die nächste Eskalationsstufe: Am Freitag hat Madrid ein Dekret verabschiedet, das Firmen und Banken den Weggang aus Katalonien erleichtert.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Der Katalonien-Konflikt gilt als Freiheitskampf - doch er ist vor allem ein Duell rigoroser Nationalisten

Firmenumzüge im Schnellverfahren

Spanische Medien sprachen bei dem Vorgang von einer ""salida exprés"" - einem Weggang im Eilverfahren. Demnach reicht für einen Ortswechsel künftig eine Entscheidung des Aufsichtsrats, eine Gesellschafterversammlung muss nicht mehr einberufen werden.

Bereits am Donnerstag hatte die fünftgrößte Bank des Landes, Banco Sabadell, angekündigt, nach Alicante umzuziehen. Am Freitag folgte die zweite Großbank: La Caixa. Die größte Sparkasse Europas will aus ""politischen und sozialen"" Gründen ihren juristischen Sitz nach Valencia legen, wie sie mitteilte.

Es wird erwartet, dass dank des Dekrets schnell weitere Geldhäuser und Firmen folgen könnten.

Hintergrund dafür dürfte vor allem der unklare Verbleib Kataloniens in der Europäischen Union sein, sollte die Region sich wirklich von Spanien abspalten.

Abspaltung: ""Kein Scherz, sondern echte Katastrophe""

Doch nicht nur Banken planen eine Verlegung. So will der Energieriese Gas Natural Fenosa seinen traditionellen Hauptsitz in Barcelona aufgeben und nach Madrid umziehen. Auch Freixenet, einer der größten Cava-Produzenten Spaniens, könnte Katalonien den Rücken kehren.

""Wenn es wirklich zu einer einseitigen Unabhängigkeitserklärung kommen sollte, dann werden viele Firmen aus Katalonien abziehen, was großen Schaden anrichten wird"", zitierte die Zeitung ""La Vanguardia"" Freixenet-Chef José Luis Bonet. Eine Abspaltung sei ""kein Scherz"", sondern ""eine echte Katastrophe"".

Selbst deutsche Unternehmen würden laut ""Spiegel Online"" ""detaillierte Notfallpläne für den Fall"" diskutieren.

Denn von etwa 1600 in Spanien aktiven deutschen Konzernen haben die Hälfte ihre lokale Zentrale in Katalonien, darunter die Lebensmittel-Discounter Lidl und Aldi, der Elektro-Händler Media Markt Saturn oder der Pharmariese Bayer.

Unbeirrt auf Abspaltungskurs

Die Katalanen hatten sich am Sonntag bei einem umstrittenen und von der Justiz untersagten Referendum mit deutlicher Mehrheit für eine Abspaltung der bisher wirtschaftsstärksten Region von Spanien ausgesprochen.

Die Regierung in Madrid hatte wochenlang mit allen Mitteln versucht, die Volksabstimmung zu verhindern. Bislang lehnt sie jeden Dialog mit der Regionalregierung ab.

Denn diese bleibt nahezu unbeirrt bei ihrem Abspaltungs- und Konfrontationskurs: Zwar wurde eine für Montag angesetzte Parlamentssitzung, bei der die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens erklärt werden sollte, am Donnerstag vom Verfassungsgericht verboten.

Aber der Chef der ""Generalitat"" (Regionalregierung), Carles Puigdemont, will nun am Dienstag vor dem Parlament in Barcelona Stellung zur ""aktuellen politischen Lage"" beziehen.

Ob er dabei die Unabhängigkeit ausrufen oder lediglich das weitere Vorgehen seiner Regierung vorstellen will, wurde nicht bekannt.

Kleiner Schritt der Annäherung

Derweil drängt die EU-Kommission Madrid und Barcelona, schnell miteinander ins Gespräch zu kommen. ""Wir wollen, dass dies rasch passiert"", sagte ein Sprecher in Brüssel.

Er blieb aber bei der Haltung der Kommission, sich nicht als Vermittler einzumischen. Die Behörde sieht den Konflikt als innere Angelegenheit Spaniens.

Immerhin: Einen kleinen Schritt der Annäherung machte Enric Millo, ein Vertreter der spanischen Regierung in Katalonien.

Fünf Tage nach der von Polizeigewalt überschatteten Abstimmung entschuldigte er sich als erster Vertreter der Zentralregierung bei den knapp 900 Verletzten.

Gleichzeitig gab er der Regionalregierung die Schuld an den Vorfällen, weil diese die Bürger zu den Wahllokalen geschickt habe, obwohl die Abstimmung von der Justiz verboten worden war.

Die Situation bleibt also angespannt.

The narrow roads are lined with pot holes and residents walk great distances to draw drinking water from the river. Welcome to Groot Marico.

Named after the Groot-Marico River -- one of the few perennial rivers in this area -- despite its name, the North West town is very small.

The town's website boasts that Groot-Marico renowned for its beautiful African bushveld surroundings and special kind of hospitality. ""It is the ideal place to come to when you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city life,"" it suggests.

On Wednesday the town welcomed President Jacob Zuma to the unveiling of the R1.8m monument that replaced plans to erect a multi-million rand, life-sized sculpture of Zuma.

The monument, at the entrance of the town, is symbolic to 1963 when Zuma, along with 51 others, were arrested by the apartheid security branch police.

Squandering public funds

While the North West government defended its decision to erect the monument, opposition parties accused it of abusing public funds.

""We reject this statue as a monument of corruption, and it must be added to all the statues that must fall,"" said the EFF.

The monument's unveiling was heavily criticised on Twitter, with many questioning surrounding the need for the monument.

The residents of Groot Marico are also so divided.

Llewellyn Kriel, who was born in Groot Marico and returned to the town a year ago, said he has nothing against the erections of statues and memorials for communities to commemorate.

But he added: ""There is a dire need for clean water, sanitation, for better roads, jobs and housing. There is a far better way to spend nearly R2m than erecting a statue.""

The father of two said the money could have been rather been spent on a four-year uncomplete sanitation project in the area.

Pie in the sky promises

""I think all of these promises about income being generated from this statue are just pie in the sky promises,"" said Kriel.

Pensioner Bokkie Harmse, who strongly agreed with Kriel, said residents are forced to fetch water from the local river.

""People are suffering in this town. That million rands could have helped so many community members.""

She also decried the state of the roads and crime in the area. ""They steal the tap heads and the pipes,"" Harmse said.

'Zuma is a wonderful man'

However, Joseph Simpson, also a pensioner, who often visits his family in the town, said the president deserves the statue.

""Zuma is a wonderful man; he is a very good human being.""

Also speaking fondly of the president was Tsungai Masangwe.

Masangwe moved to South Africa from Zimbabwe in 2012 and sells second-hand clothes and goods from a garage which she rents for R250.

""I was happy to see Zuma so close to me because in Zimbabwe I can't see my president,"" she said.

Masangwe, however said some of the money spent on the monument could have been utilised to help battling business people like herself.

""People support me, but I am struggling to get stuff. If I get money, maybe I can grow my business,"" she said. -- News24",Groot Marico Residents Are Divided On Zuma's Statue While Opposition Parties Dub It 'A Monument Of Corruption',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/10/07/groot-marico-residents-are-divided-on-zumas-statue-while-opposition-parties-dub-it-a-monument-of-corruption_a_23235740/

‘Little Britain’ was a huge hit for the BBC between 2000 and 2007, spawning many a catchphrase, including Emily the transvestite’s ‘I’m a lady’ and gay Welshman Daffyd’s ‘I’m the only gay in the village’.

In the previous six months, the first half-year in which medical assistance in dying was legal, there were 803 assisted deaths, or 0.6 per cent of all deaths.

The department says the overall numbers are consistent with international experience.

Average age: 73

Cancer was the most frequent underlying medical condition in assisted deaths, cited in 63 per cent of cases.

The Health Canada findings in its second interim report on medical assistance in dying say the average patient was 73 at death.

While some patients were between 18 and 45 at the time of death, the vast majority of cases involved people aged 56 to 85.

More people chose to die at home

The report says there was a slight decrease in the number of patients dying in hospitals, with more people choosing to end their lives at home.

The law allowing medical assistance in dying went into effect in June 2016.

Since then, provincial laws dealing with assisted death have been clarified or expanded and other changes are likely.

""It is expected that how services are organized, delivered and monitored will continue to evolve as data becomes more available and jurisdictions are able to evaluate existing policies and service delivery models,'' the report said.

Use this time to connect with your baby -- you can walk with the pram and do kegels while breastfeeding,"" Towersey said.
Towersey says the key to bouncing back is being realistic about how fit you were before you had your baby.
Getting back into some form of physical exercise isn't just good for your body, it's very important for mental health.
Learn to love your body with all its flaws at this time because producing a baby is a gift,"" Scott said.","You've recently had a bub. Congrats! It's likely you're wading through the midst of three-hourly feeds, cracked nipples and endless cycles of washing right now. The last thing you probably want to do is think about exercise and if that's the case, no problem.

But, with so much pressure on new mothers to 'bounce back', often women put unnecessary pressure on themselves to lose the baby weight and get back into shape right after the baby is born, at what is already a difficult time.

Not only that, doing the wrong thing can cause damage or harm.

""Postpartum training, just like any other training, is a very individual process,"" personal trainer and sports management expert Alexa Towersey told HuffPost Australia.

""At the most basic level what you are able to do can be dependent on the type of birth -- C-section versus natural -- and whether there were any health complications during the pregnancy or during the birthing process itself.""

The first six weeks

""As a general rule of thumb (and under your doctor's guidance), the emphasis in the first six weeks is on light stretching, easy, low impact cardio and strengthening the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles. Skipping, running and kickboxing classes are out -- walking and kegels are in. Use this time to connect with your baby -- you can walk with the pram and do kegels while breastfeeding,"" Towersey said.

Gentle stretching at home while baby is sleeping is a realistic activity to add to your routine.

Renee Scott, Founder and Director of Balance Moves, agrees.

""I generally suggest walking outside in the fresh air and breathing techniques for meditation and gentle core activation. These things will allow the mother to ideally have a positive mindset and will give a small amount of routine to the day.

""Their body is adjusting to very little sleep and the demands of a newborn, so try and enjoy the quiet, peaceful moments and the beauty of producing life. I only suggest further exercise after six to eight weeks with clearance from the doctor,"" Scott said.

Towersey suggests that the first few months is also a good time to slowly work on strengthening your pelvic floor again.

""I recommend starting pelvic floor exercises as soon as possible. The easiest way to think about switching it on is to imagine you're stopping yourself from peeing mudflow -- draw everything in and up.""

""Try using your baby's age for guidance. One-week-old equals 10 sets of one-second holds. Two-weeks-old equals 10 sets of two-second holds and so on until you reach 10 weeks -- you get the picture,"" Towersey said.



If your doctor gives you the OK you can work on your pelvic floor while breastfeeding.

It's tempting to want to do crunches right away seeing as the tummy area has changed so much during pregnancy. The problem here is that your abdomen have been through a lot, so you need to go slow.

""For the abdominals, a lot depends on the nature of the birth itself, and also as to whether rectus diastasis occurred and to what level. Rectus diastasis is essentially the splitting of the stomach muscles to accommodate the growth of the baby. The emphasis should be on ""knitting"" the midsection together. Crunches and sit-ups are out, heel slides and shoulder raises are in. I'm a big advocate of both pre and postnatal pilates,"" Towersey said.

The first six months

You've made it through the first six weeks and you're perhaps feeling slighting more human. Then again, maybe not. That's why you need to listen to your body.

""I believe that you get in exercise where you can. A walk for 20 minutes once a day can do amazing things for the body and mind,"" Scott said.

Where you can, try to get to postnatal pilates, barre attack or swimming session where you can focus on yourself and not worry about your newborn for that small amount of the day. Ideally two to three times a week will get you back in shape after six to eight months, but be patient -- it can take up to 12 or 18 months to feel normal and energised again. Be kind on yourself with whatever exercise you choose and be proud of even making it to one or two classes a week, just moving your body again will help.""

Towersey says the key to bouncing back is being realistic about how fit you were before you had your baby.

""You need to take into account your fitness level, training experience and lifestyle both before and during pregnancy. If fitness has always been a part of your life and you have built and maintained a strong foundation throughout, then both the timing of and the type of exercises you can go back to will vary greatly from those who have led more sedentary lifestyles.""

If you lifted weights before and during your pregnancy you will be able to get back into it faster.

""I have had clients who have lifted weights all the way through their pregnancy, and are given the all clear to start back in training four to six weeks later (albeit with specific modifications), and I've also had clients who have used pregnancy to become motivated to start training, and that is a very different process,"" Towersey said.

As for what you should focus on, a combination of strength training and low impact cardio is the best combination.

""Posture and core strength is usually compromised during pregnancy, so I suggest focusing a lot on lengthening the front of the body and strengthening the back of the body. A combination of weight training, pilates, and low impact aerobic based exercise would be my suggestion,"" Towersey said.

""Power walking is amazing for fat loss which can be a primary concern for women. In terms of exercise selection, the only other thing you need to take note of here is whether any pubic symphysis is present which can mean single leg exercises are minimised initially.""

Getting back into some form of physical exercise isn't just good for your body, it's very important for mental health.

""I believe that incorporating fitness and feeling physically strong post partum is incredibly important for women, not just for the aesthetic benefits, but also when it comes to the mental health side and helping to prevent and/or treat postpartum depression,"" Towersey said.

Scott also emphasises that above all, you need to be gentle with yourself. The pressures of social media can get to you when you're housebound and vulnerable so put the phone down and focus on being happy and healthy.

""If you mentally can't get your head around working your post-baby body then prioritise healthy food and being active in some way, but it is also important to remember that it took 10 months to produce a baby it will take at least 10 months to get your body back. You have a beautiful healthy child that you, and only you could create.

""You are amazing and your body doesn't need to reflect perfection for you to know and believe that. Learn to love your body with all its flaws at this time because producing a baby is a gift,"" Scott said.

When a divorce is being bitterly contested we forget everything else, except the case. The case consumes us, and we live, eat, and breathe it. Initially, the divorce case seems like a distinct entity, almost alive, but alienated from us. But as time progresses, especially in extremely long drawn out cases, the distinction gets blurred. And before we realise it, the case becomes us. We speak about it almost as if it is a part of us with the possessive pronoun 'my case', rather than staying, 'the case filed in court'.

The use of the possessive pronoun to describe a divorce case asserts how we feel about it and what it really means to us. The divorce case becomes our life. It's as though without it, we would cease to exist. It becomes a personal crusade of sorts, where we must win, at all costs.

On each date of hearing, we trudge to the court expecting justice and to triumph over the other side. The decision in court becomes a 'character certificate' and a validation of the belief that, 'I am right, and they are wrong'. There's a certain guilt attached to missing a date as though we have purposely ignored our ailing child. As a litigant, we will organise our calendar around the dates in court, and readjust our work, social commitments. It's a loop.

The question of readjusting our time for leisure doesn't even arise. Once we are attached to our divorce case, all leisure and relaxation go out of the window.

The divorce case is dragged endlessly in court, and that can impact our emotional, physical and spiritual health. I put on so much weight when my divorce case was going on that it is a miracle that I didn't collapse. We keep waiting for the justice in court, which in India takes its own sweet time. In the meantime, we keep ignoring all other aspects of our life

We tend to forget that the divorce case is a minuscule part of our life and that the court is a subset of our life and not vice versa. Before we filed for divorce, we had a life, which included friends, family, work, leisure activities, spirituality, but all this gets relegated to the bin marked 'after my case is over'. How long the case takes to get over is almost anybody's guess.

So do we keep putting all that is precious to us in life just for the sake of a divorce case? Should we plan to live our lives only after the case is over? Unfortunately, that is what a majority of us end up doing, but we should try to change this.

Our resolution should be to remember that there is life beyond the case. We must not let the case consume us; else we will be left wondering where the time went.

LONDON — A car crash that injured 11 people outside a major London tourist attraction Saturday sparked fears of a terrorist attack but turned out to be simply a traffic accident, London police said.

The accident at 2:20 p.m. outside the popular Natural History Museum in the heart of central London brought a gigantic police response, including helicopters and hazardous area response teams, because of terrorist concerns.

Police said 11 people were injured when a car apparently mounted the pavement and hit pedestrians. Nine people were hospitalized with head and leg injuries that were not judged to be life-changing.

Police: Not terrorism, despite similarities

Panicky scenes ensued after the pedestrians were struck and it took nearly four hours for police to reassure the anxious public that it was not another terrorist attack.

Britons in general, and Londoners in particular, have been jumpy after a string of extremist attacks this year, including deadly attacks using vehicles to hit pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.

People behind a police tape near the Natural History Museum, after a car mounted the pavement on Saturday.

Britain has been on a ""severe'' terrorist threat level indicating that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Center believes an attack is viewed as highly likely.

Police said one man at the scene, thought to be the driver, was detained. He has not been charged or identified.

Shops, museum cleared out; crowds feared terrorism

Witnesses described a rush to leave the scene, nearby shops were evacuated and the sprawling museum, a favourite site for families with children, closed down early. Police established a large security cordon around the area within minutes.

Workers in a cafe near the Natural History Museum say they fled the scene in fear.

Marilin Mueller, 20, said she thought at first it was a traffic accident but had doubts when ""loads of police cars'' arrived.

Dieon Rurora said people were running down the street to get away and some fell.

""It was quite scary,'' he said.

Police officers speak to people on Exhibition Road after a car mounted the pavement on Saturday.

One woman draped in a red blanket was led away by a paramedic after the crash. Others were seen leaving with their legs bandaged.

The crash took place on a day when the central London museum district was teeming with pedestrians. Photographs showed a dented silver car and a man being pinned to the ground outside the museum. A police forensics officer in blue coveralls took pictures of the crash site.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that he was in close contact with Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley, who plays a lead role in the police's counter-terrorism operation.

The Natural History Museum closed after the crash but its neighbour, the famed Victoria and Albert Museum, remained open.

British Prime Minister Theresa May thanked the first responders and the public for their help and said her thoughts were with the injured.

In a landslide victory, Jagmeet Singh has become the new leader of Canada's New Democratic Party.

Despite predictions that voting could go into multiple rounds and ostensibly drag on until mid-October, Singh won 53.6 per cent of the first-ballot votes on Sunday. He easily beat out his closest rival, Charlie Angus, who garnered only 19.3 per cent.

Singh's victory is historic.

He is the first person of colour to be elected leader of a major Canadian political party. He is a proud Sikh; he wears a turban, and carries a kirpan — a ceremonial knife. He openly talks about his experiences with racism, and has fought for policies that would combat racism.

As a member of provincial parliament in Ontario, he worked to pass legislation that banned so-called carding — a practice whereby police officers stop individuals ""randomly"" and ask for their identification and used to disproportionately target people of colour.

One of the best known moments of Singh's campaign was when a heckler accused him of being ""in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood."" He responded to her by leading the audience in a chant of ""love and courage."" The video of the encounter went viral — and he was praised for his response by commentators all over the world.

'Love and courage'

Indeed, ""love and courage"" seem to have won the day. Singh's message clearly resonated with NDP members. Even more than that, his campaign has claimed to have signed up 47,000 new members for the party, although this claim has been disputed.

Nonetheless, Singh has his work cut out for him before Canada's 2019 federal election. It remains to be seen if Singh will be embraced by the rest of Canada in the same way he has been embraced by the NDP. In particular, it's unclear whether Singh can win over Quebec, and if he can expand the NDP's base to Canadians who traditionally vote Liberal or Conservative.

The Quebec question looms over the new NDP leader. Quebec has been seen as essential to the party's success. The 2011 ""orange wave"" that swept the NDP to their biggest victory was strongest in Quebec.

In reflecting on his legacy, former NDP leader Tom Mulcair noted that he was most proud of his efforts in Quebec. He added that the party's future in Quebec was the thing he worried most about going forward.

Conventional wisdom suggests that Singh will face significant hurdles in the province. Religious headgear and symbols are frequently at the centre of heated debate in Quebec.

In 2013, the Quebec Charter of Values was proposed. If passed, the bill would have banned the wearing of ""conspicuous"" religious symbols for government personnel and mandated that, in order to receive government services, one's face must be uncovered.

The Charter had the support of roughly 50 per cent of the province. Currently, Bill-62 is being debated in Quebec. The bill would not allow women wearing burkas or niqabs to provide or receive public services.

Quebecers 'open-minded'

Martine Ouellet, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, has condemned Singh for not respecting the separation of church and state. She stated that Singh's ""primary values are related to his religion"" and has argued that's a problem for those in public office.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot

Singh has addressed such concerns frequently during his campaign. Quebecers are more ""open-minded and open-hearted"" than his critics were giving them credit for, he insisted.

During his victory speech, Singh addressed Quebecers directly. He stated that he knew what it is like to have your culture and language marginalized. He said he learned French ""in solidarity"" and promised to ""be an ally in the defence and promotion of"" their language and culture.

Perhaps this promise of kinship will be enough to make gains in Quebec, or at least maintain the current NDP base. But it will definitely continue to be a challenge for Singh as 2019 approaches.

Winning over the rest of Canada

Another major question is whether Singh can expand the NDP's base, and win over voters who cast their ballots for either Liberals or Conservatives in the last election.

In 2015, Trudeau won over many voters who traditionally voted NDP. And he appealed to and attracted young and new Canadians. Trudeau ran the 2015 campaign as the young, fresh, optimistic candidate, in contrast to former prime minister Stephen Harper and Mulcair.

He was 43 years old and taking on much older and more experienced politicians. He utilized social media and connected with young people better than either of his opponents. He championed diversity better, and more fully too. ""A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian"" and ""Canada is strong, not in spite of our differences, but because of them"" were campaign slogans that resonated.

But much of what Trudeau used to differentiate himself is no longer in play with Singh in the picture. At 45, Trudeau is now the oldest candidate of a competitive Canadian party — both Singh and Andrew Scheer, the new Conservative leader, are 38.

Singh is the new outsider to federal politics, as he's never held federal office. And given Singh's history of working on issues related to racial justice on the provincial level, and his personal identity and the challenges he's faced, he seems much better-suited to be the champion of people of colour and new Canadians.

'Sunny ways'

In 2015, Trudeau's ""sunny ways"" won over more traditionally NDP supporters than Conservative supporters. Can Singh's ""love and courage"" win them back?

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young

And if Singh does win them back, will that simply serve to split the left, and allow the Conservatives to regain government?

Singh could actually win over voters that the Conservatives will be counting on. The Conservatives' biggest gains under Harper were in the suburbs, and with new Canadians. The Conservatives lost much of those voters in 2015, but Scheer will try to win them back.

The Conservatives could benefit from Singh if he simply splits the left and steals votes from the Liberals. But he could also make the NDP more competitive in the suburbs, and with new Canadians.

Singh has strong ties to the suburbs of Toronto, and to new Canadians and people of colour. If the Conservatives were planning on courting these voters, Singh's presence could throw a wrench in their plans. And Singh might be able to expand the NDP's base beyond its traditional demographics of labour groups, and people in urban areas.

The NDP and all Canadians have much to celebrate today. A country that prides itself on multiculturalism finally has a major political party that is led by a person of colour, and one who has spent his career working to address issues of racial injustice and inequality. This is historic, and is a major step for equality and representation in Canada.

But many questions remain between now and the 2019 election. It's clear that Singh offers a new direction for his party — and perhaps the country. How Canadians will respond to it remains uncertain.

In einer YouGov-Umfrage im Auftrag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur plädierten 36 Prozent dafür, dass die CDU-Vorsitzende ihren Platz an der Regierungsspitze vor Ende der Wahlperiode 2021 räumt und an einen Nachfolger oder eine Nachfolgerin übergibt. 44 Prozent sind für eine volle Amtszeit der Kanzlerin. 20 Prozent machten keine Angaben.

Mit drastischen Worten hat der berühmte Ökonom Joseph Stiglitz die Präsidentschaft von Donald Trump beurteilt

Im Interview mit der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" erklärte er: ""Keine Firma kann mehr kontrollieren, was in den USA geschieht""

Doch Stiglitz warnte auch vor einer gefährlichen Entwicklung in Deutschland

Nobelpreis-Ökonomen sind nicht gut auf Donald Trump zu sprechen. Das gilt vor allem für Paul Krugman, der den US-Präsidenten täglich auf Twitter attackiert und zurechtweist. Und das gilt auch für Joseph Stiglitz.

Der Nobelpreisträger wirft Trump in einem Interview mit der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" vor, die regelbasierte Weltordnung irreparabel zu schädigen. ""Trump sagt: Es gibt wieder Grenzen. Ein Land kann jeden Moment einen verrückten Typen wie mich wählen. Waren können dann nicht mehr frei über die Grenzen verkauft werden“, erklärte Stiglitz der Zeitung.

Stiglitz: ""Dass der Erfinder dieses Systems eine Granate hineinwirft, ist erstaunlich“

Jedes Unternehmen gehe bei weltweiten Lieferketten auf einmal ein hohes Risiko ein, so der frühere Chefökonom der Weltbank. ""Keine Firma kann mehr kontrollieren, was in den USA geschieht.“

Dabei seien die Vereinigten Staaten traditionell Vorkämpfer freier Märkte gewesen, so Stiglitz. ""Die USA spielte eine große Rolle beim Aufbau der regelbasierten Weltordnung. Dass der Erfinder dieses Systems eine Granate hineinwirft, ist erstaunlich.“



Stiglitz sieht im Wahlsieg Trumps und dem Erfolg der AfD in Deutschland einen Aufstand der Globalisierungsopfer. ""Die Menschen erkennen, dass die Globalisierung für Unternehmen und Reiche super funktioniert hat, aber nicht für die übrigen Bürger.“

Speziell auf die AfD bezogen erklärte er: ""Es gibt eine ökonomisch begründete Angst in Deutschland. Es gibt jede Menge Leute, die sehr wenig verdienen, deren Einkommen seit Jahren stagnieren und die sehr unglücklich sind. Die Regierungen haben unterschätzt, wie wichtig ein anständiges Einkommen für die Würde der Menschen ist.“

Stiglitz: ""Deutschlands Wachstum ist nicht so großartig wie viele glauben""

Stiglitz rät zu einem politischen Kurswechsel, um den wirtschaftlich Abgehängten zu helfen.

""Deutschland muss die Einkommen der Menschen steigern, die schlecht oder mittelmäßig verdienen“, sagte Stiglitz. Eine Möglichkeit dazu sei ein Konjunkturprogramm mit Investitionen in die Infrastruktur.

Stiglitz forderte zudem einen höheren Mindestlohn. ""Und das Geld dafür ist da, Deutschland erzielt einen Haushaltsüberschuss"", sagte Stiglitz. ""Das Wirtschaftswachstum ist nicht so großartig wie viele glauben.“

Last month, it extended the deadline for obtaining Aadhaar for availing government schemes and subsidies by three months to December 31. Earlier, those who did not have Aadhaar were asked to procure it by September 30.

As many as 135 schemes (of 35 ministries) including the free cooking gas (LPG) to poor women, kerosene and fertiliser subsidy, targeted public distribution system (PDS) and MGNREGA will be covered by the extension.

""As a result of the review of welfare schemes covered and to provide the benefits of such schemes to all eligible beneficiaries of the scheme, it has been decided to further extend the stipulated date in all such notifications up to December 31, 2017,"" an order dated September 26 said.

The extension would also apply for Employees' Pension Scheme of 1995, scholarships, housing subsidy benefit, stipend to SC/ST trainees for coaching guidance and vocational training, stipend to handicapped and Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana.

Besides, it would be applicable for national apprenticeship and skill development schemes, crop insurance schemes, interest subvention scheme, scholarship and fellowship schemes, various education programmes such as mid- day meal for children and Atal Pension Yojana.

Written by famous poet Narsinh Mehta back in the 15th century, the bhajan Vaishnava Jana To has become synonymous with Mahatma Gandhi.

Adopted by Gandhi into the routine of his prayers, the bhajan has been sung by several different artists over the years. It talks about equality, respecting others and helping those who are in misery.

At a time when India is struggling with intolerance towards minorities like Dalits and Muslims, this song assumes great significance.

The bhajan was originally written in Gujarati. Here are the lyrics and their English translation.

वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिये

जे पीड परायी जाणे रे । पर दुःखे उपकार करे तो ये मन अभिमान न आणे रे ॥ सकळ लोकमां सहुने वंदे, निंदा न करे केनी रे । वाच काछ मन निश्चळ राखे, धन धन जननी तेनी रे ॥ समदृष्टि ने तृष्णा त्यागी, परस्त्री जेने मात रे । जिह्वा थकी असत्य न बोले, परधन नव झाले हाथ रे ॥ मोह माया व्यापे नहि जेने, दृढ़ वैराग्य जेना मनमां रे । रामनाम शुं ताळी रे लागी, सकळ तीरथ तेना तनमां रे ॥ वणलोभी ने कपटरहित छे, काम क्रोध निवार्या रे । भणे नरसैयॊ तेनुं दरसन करतां, कुळ एकोतेर तार्या रे ॥

TRANSLATION

Call those people Vaishnavas who Feel the pain of others, Help those who are in misery, But never let self-conceit enter their mind. They respect the entire world, Do not disparage anyone, Keep their words, actions and thoughts pure, The mother of such a soul is blessed. They see all equally, renounce craving, Respect other women as their own mother, Their tongue never utters false words, Their hands never touch the wealth of others. They do not succumb to worldly attachments, They are firmly detached from the mundane, They are enticed by the name of God (Rama), All places of pilgrimage are embodied in them. They have forsaken greed and deceit, They stay afar from lust and anger, Narsi says: I'd be grateful to meet such a soul, Whose virtue liberates their entire lineage.

Help To Buy Will Help To Bury Home Ownership, And The Tories' Hopes For A Political Resurgence With It Tackling the housing crisis will take time, reform won't deliver immediate benefits and will need longer than one parliamentary term to make a real difference. Yet instead of offering the bold reform needed the Conservatives have gone for the easy option. But Help to Buy is not the answer, instead it will help to bury the next generation's aspirations for home ownership and the Tories' hopes for a political resurgence with it.

The Conservatives Have Run Out Of Ideas Of How To Repair Our Broken Justice System Crisis after crisis rocked the justice system this summer. Conservative Justice Secretary David Lidington had an opportunity to show that he was getting a grip during his keynote speech at Conservative Party conference. Sadly for the millions who depend on a properly functioning justice system, he fluffed his chance. Labour MP for East Leeds, Shadow Justice Secretary

The Road To Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions On the face of it, Universal Credit is a good idea. The benefits system is ridiculously complex, simplifying it is common sense. Except people are not simple, they don't fit into boxes. My sister-in-law and my brother could not have more different needs, experiences and circumstances.

Britain Sets An Example With Its Human Rights Laws - Counter-Extremism Policy Must Be No Different The government's most recent proposals for counter-extremism legislation are extremely worrying.

How Jeremy Corbyn Moved The Centre Ground Perhaps his greatest achievement in Brighton was to hide the deep Brexit divide that threatens Labour every bit as much as it threatens the Tories. But he also, shamefully, continued to ignore the existence of the ugly underbelly of the Corbynista bandwagon -- the misogynistic, and sometimes anti-Semitic, bullying that is too often targeted at anyone regarded as not sufficiently loyal to the cause. Journalist and broadcaster

Theresa May's Tories Have Made Britain's Broken Housing Market Worse - Labour Will Fix It This week at Labour Party conference, Jeremy Corbyn powerfully argued the case for change on housing. Labour will do things differently, and we'll be looking for the widest possible input, not just from experts but tenants, community groups and the public as we shape our social housing review to tackle the big problems that the Grenfell Tower fire means we must now urgently confront. A failing housing market seems inevitable when you have failing Conservative Ministers, bound by their ideology from doing what is needed. Labour is giving people hope that things can change. Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne and Shadow Housing Secretary

The Public Must Be Heard In The EU Negotiations By and large, our political parties have failed to articulate the contradictions and trade offs of our future relationship with the EU preferring to hide behind our ability to ""have our cake and eat it"". Meanwhile, the nuances of public opinion are lost behind an avalanche of opinion polls and focus groups which can offer only a tiny glimpse of emerging views on the highly complex and contested decisions that need to be made, on everything from the customs union to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The UK desperately needs a process which brings together people of all persuasions to find common ground.

TOKYO -- Japan's public broadcaster has vowed to reform its working practices as it revealed that a young reporter died of heart failure after logging 159 hours of overtime in a month.

NHK reporter Miwa Sado, 31, who had been covering political news in Tokyo, was found dead in her bed in July 2013, reportedly clutching her mobile phone.

A year later, Japanese authorities said her death was linked to excessive overtime. She had two days off in the month before she died.

NHK eventually made the case public four years afterwards, bowing to pressure from Sado's parents to take action to prevent a recurrence.

The case again highlights the Japanese problem of karoshi, or death from overwork, amid the country's notoriously long work hours.

It is also an embarrassing revelation for NHK, which has campaigned against the nation's long working culture.

Sato covered Tokyo assembly elections in June 2013 and an upper-house vote for the national parliament the following month.

She died three days after the upper-house election.

""My heart breaks at the thought that she may have wanted to call me"" in her last moments, her mother told the Asahi daily.

""With Miwa gone, I feel like half of my body has been torn off. I won't be able to laugh for real for the rest of my life.""

The revelation shocked the nation as NHK has actively reported tragic deaths at other companies, including the 2015 suicide of a young woman at major advertising agency Dentsu after logging more than 100 hours of overtime a month.

The chief of NHK has pledged to improve work conditions at the broadcaster.

""We are sorry that we lost an excellent reporter and take seriously the fact that her death was recognised as work-related,"" President Ryoichi Ueda said yesterday.

""We will continue to work for reform in cooperation with her parents,"" he told reporters.

""Since the massive power blackout last year and our record power prices, I have concluded they are symptoms of a much bigger and deeper problem. I've decided that you can't fix South Australia's problems in Canberra without first fixing our broken political system back home,"" he said.

""Our state politics is broken, politically bankrupt. We have the same old soap opera script between Labor and Liberal, but little real policy debate, let alone solutions for the State's many troubles.""

Xenophon had been one of seven federal members caught up in the Section 44 citizenship controversy. He had inherited British citizenship through his father, who was a citizen of Cyprus.

He said he ""will be replaced by an NXT candidate"" in the Federal parliament, regardless of the High Court decision in his case. If the High Court rules Xenophon was a dual citizen at the time of his election, the court may declare his seat vacant and to be filled either by a casual vacancy rule or by a countback -- both options which would almost certainly deliver another NXT candidate as his replacement.

Xenophon said he had ""a very good case"" to survive the court challenge, but that he will leave Federal parliament ""irrespective"" of the judgement. Xenophon did not cite exactly when he would officially leave parliament.

In a video posted shortly after his announcement, he called the Labor and Liberal parties the ""Tweedledee and Tweedledum"" of politics, and said his plan to run for state office was because his state had been ""all too often overlooked"".

David Curry, husband of missing woman Elisa Curry, has made an emotional plea for assistance in finding his wifeFurther to that, Seel also told media that the husband and also Curry's three children are struggling with coming to terms over the disappearance.","The disappearance of Melbourne mum Elisa Curry has left members of the Victoria Police, State Emergency Service (SES) and search authorities well and truly stumped.

As rescuers intensively scour the Great Otway National Park around her Aireys Inlet residence for her whereabouts, the 43-year-old mother of three remains missing five days after she was last seen on Saturday, September 30.

And while the search area has been scaled back from a 20km radius around her house -- including nearby bushland, beaches and cliffsides close to the Great Ocean Road -- to just a 300m radius, it's the timeline and nature of events leading up to and after her disappearance that really makes this story so peculiar.

So what do we already know? Let us fill you in.

How Elisa's Disappearance Unfolded

While the details of Curry's movements prior to her disappearance remain unclear, she was reportedly last seen on the night of the AFL Grand Final on Saturday, September 30 at her Aireys Inlet home.

Her husband and children -- who are aged between seven and 12 -- had all travelled to Melbourne to attend that sporting event and, earlier in the day, it has been claimed that the keen marathon runner sent the Herald Sun a text message around the time the match started.

It is believed she watched the Final with a female friend before a separate neighbouring couple then came to visit Curry at her home later on in the night, also leaving together.

Police are appealing for public assistance to help locate missing woman Elisa Curry. https://t.co/vj3Tgc7Zzk pic.twitter.com/pP98VfIv3i — Victoria Police (@VictoriaPolice) October 3, 2017

The female neighbour of that couple is then thought to have returned to Curry's home at around 10:30pm to discuss what has been described as a ""personal matter"" -- this is also believed to be the last moment the mother was seen as she prepared to get into bed.

Her mobile phone has also been reported as being detected by local mobile phone towers from the residence on Saturday night.

Initially, theories were floated that Curry may have gone for a run during the night along familiar bush tracks near her home, however police have since ruled that out -- although the possibility of her having done so on the following morning still remains.

Her family then returned from the Grand Final during the day on Sunday to find Curry, the family dog and her mobile phone missing. Her dog was later found wandering around the local streets around 6pm on Monday, leading to hopes that Curry would be found soon too but there is still no trace of her.

Fairfax has also reported that there were no obvious signs of a break-in or scuffle at the home following Curry's disappearance and her bank accounts have not been touched.

How Has The Search Developed?

Since the alarm was raised on Sunday, more than 100 volunteers and members of emergency services, the SES, the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Parks Victoria and Victoria Police Mounted Branch, Water Police and Search and Rescue have gone about looking over bushland, walking tracks, beachsides and cliffs within a 20km radius of the Aireys Inlet home.

As the search ramped up, the inspections also included a police helicopter scouring over the area, police officers examining empty houses and sheds and water police looking over nearby creeks and beaches.

Inspector Peter Seel said that search parties had examined many tracks more than twice and were still left at a loss for signs of where the mother may be.

""Unfortunately we just haven't been able to locate this lady. So, we've gone a radius of 20km from Aireys Inlet,"" he said.

""We've covered a lot of the tracks two and three times. We've had the Mounted Branch go along at a bigger height.

""They're looking for a person, obviously, but also things like clothing, footwear, mobile phone. Anything that would link her to that area.""

And while that seems positive, Seel also told media that due to the harshness of the local bushland and the possibility that Curry may be stuck somewhere nearby to her home and still alive appear grim.

""Unfortunately the best medical advice is that if she is in the bush that the chances of her being alive are very remote,"" he said.

On Thursday, the search was ultimately scaled back following another full day of investigations after rescue parties were still unable to come up with any concrete answers.

Now, the official search area has been wound back to just a 300m radius around Curry's residence, with authorities to resume looking at 9am on Friday morning.

On Wednesday, Seel also confirmed that local police are looking at setting up ""an information caravan"" on the Great Ocean Road over the weekend to appeal to local residents who may be able to assist the investigation.

""We'll have a detective and another uniform member in there on Saturday and Sunday,"" he said.

""We're asking for anyone that may have some information to please call in and speak to the members. We're trying to glean some more information, as much information as we can.""

How has the family responded?

On Tuesday, David Curry, Elisa's husband, made an emotional appeal to the public to come forward if they know anything about the disappearance of his wife.

David Curry, who heads of regulatory and corporate affairs at the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group, urged anyone who has seen his wife to call police.

""I, my kids, we just want her to come home,"" Curry told the media.

""Elisa if you're out there can you please contact us? If anyone has seen anything or heard anything, can you please, please call police, please call triple-zero.""

David Curry, husband of missing woman Elisa Curry, has made an emotional plea for assistance in finding his wife

Further to that, Seel also told media that the husband and also Curry's three children are struggling with coming to terms over the disappearance.

""The family are really struggling. I spoke to the husband yesterday and I'm going back shortly. He tells me that the children are doing it hard,"" he said on Wednesday.

""He's trying to be strong for them, but he's also obviously very worried.""

Curry is described as Caucasian, about 167cm tall, with an athletic build, brown eyes and brown shoulder-length hair. It's not known what she was wearing when she disappeared.

Local authorities claim that funding measures from their own budgets would mean less money to invest in new council homes or pay for running repairs on existing stock, the Press Association reports.

Jane Urquhart, who holds the housing portfolio on Nottingham City Council, said the works planned on high-rises in her area were considered “additional rather than essential” by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Empics Entertainment Sajid Javid's Department for Communities And Local Government is refusing to meet promises to fund fire safety improvements, councils claim

“We found that really difficult to understand given that in the refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament sprinklers are considered essential, so we thought it was quite incredible that they were essential for the Houses of Parliament but not essential for residents of high-rises,” she told The Today programme.

The Labour councillor said: “Safety must come at the top of the list and the works that we have considered will be done; the impact will be that fewer new homes will be built and our other housing will not have the repairs that it needs.”

Adam Hug, leader of the Labour opposition group on Westminster City Council, said his authority faced similar problems getting money from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid’s department to pay for the installation of sprinklers and removal of cladding.

“Ultimately these are things that the London Fire Brigade says have to be done and ultimately the cost is having to be borne by the housing revenue account, which is tenants’ rents and service charge fees,” he told Today.

“Councils across the country are asking the Government for the help that Sajid Javid promised and they are being told ‘no, only in exceptional circumstances when you literally don’t have the money in any form’.”

He said Westminster stood to lose about £20 million to pay for the work: “That means either 100 affordable homes can’t get built or it means that for 20 or 30 years our residents are going to not have their damp dealt with, when things break not being repaired.”

He added: “It’s a national civil emergency across the country, councils have complied with the regulations that have been there and the Government is not stepping up to the plate.”

The Guardian reported that other councils, including Croydon and Wandsworth, had also had requests for funding declined.

A DCLG spokesman said: “Public safety is paramount which is why, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Government established a comprehensive building safety programme to ensure a fire like this can never happen again.

“This included commissioning an independent review of building regulations and fire safety. We will consider this issue in light of the recommendations of this review and the findings of the public inquiry.

WASHINGTON — A book which Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland shared with her U.S. and Mexican colleagues during the last round of NAFTA negotiations, offers a dark message about globalization's collapse, the rise of nationalism and humanity tumbling into an abyss of death and destruction.

She brought three books to an informal book club with peers Robert Lighthizer and Ildefonso Guajardo. Two tell a positive tale of human advancement. The third serves up a bleak historical lesson about the big anti-globalization backlash of the last century.

It's no accident she chose to share ""The War That Ended Peace,'' Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan's look at the factors that led to the first of two world wars. Freeland, the book and, in an interview, the book's author, all cite similarities to today.

Freeland's third book delved into anti-globalization backlash

Freeland and other Canadian officials have been struck by the book's haunting tale: how a period of fast-paced globalization, prosperity, disruptive technology and increased trade was brutally upended by nationalism, zero-sum logic, a global terrorism panic and glorified militarism, ushering in the most blood-soaked era in history.

""(It) documents the speed and ferocity with which reaction can set in, even at times when the world feels safely rooted in a progressive and peaceful era,'' Freeland said in response to a question about the book.

Foreign Affairs Minister speaking about NAFTA talks:

""As with today, the beginning of the 20th century was marked by unprecedented globalization and growth. The events between the turn of the century and the outbreak of war in 1914 are a useful reminder (of) the fragility of the world order and the pitfalls of protectionism and retreat.''

The book starts with the 1900 Paris world's fair and the Belle Epoque.

That world was unprecedentedly interconnected by railways and the telegraph. Trade skyrocketed. Germany and England even traded weapons. People lived longer, healthier lives. New international mechanisms were created to settle disputes. Countries signed arbitration agreements, refined international rules of war and even talked about creating global governance bodies.

The book describes a growing belief that war itself was becoming obsolete, quoting one author: ""People no (more) believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses ... (than) in ghosts and witches'.''

MacMillan's book on 1900s echoes current turbulent times

But these were also disruptive times.

Economies underwent radical transformations and workers left farms for new manufacturing jobs in the cities.

Terrorism was rampant. Anarchists had killed, bombed, stabbed and shot a French president, two Spanish prime ministers, an Italian king, a U.S. president, an Austrian empress, a Russian statesman and a Russian royal.

MacMillan writes of the militaristic backlash. People fumed about the new softness of European men, responding with military-themed organizations for boys. Politicians increasingly wore uniforms in public.

Soft-centrist politicians were booted from power.

Militaristic chest-thumping was rampant

Classical liberal parties devoted to open markets were demolished, left and right. On the left, by socialists, and on the right by, ""chauvinistic nationalist parties... A new breed of politicians was going outside established parliamentary institutions to appeal to popular fears and prejudices and their populism ... frequently included anti-Semitism.''

MacMillan is thrilled policy-makers might draw lessons from that time. She also credits them for trying to squeeze her 649-page book, and two other books, into busy schedules.

""I'm impressed,'' MacMillan said in an interview from England.

""How they find time to read anything, much less a huge, fat book like mine, I can't imagine. I wonder if they looked at (Freeland) and thought, 'What is she doing giving us this enormous book?'...

I always find it reassuring when statesmen do have a sense of history. ... It helps them — to give them perspective. Author Margaret MacMillan

''(But) I always find it reassuring when statesmen do have a sense of history. ... It helps them — to give them perspective.""

MacMillan cautions that there are no perfect parallels in history, that circumstances change.

But she said there are obvious echoes in this anti-globalization, America First, Brexit era — with nationalist politicians complaining about foreigners, international agreements, duty-free imports and global institutions forged after the Second World War.

""There are, I think, warning signs,'' she said.

""There are parallels that should make us at least stop and think.''

If policy-makers take away one message from her book, she says, it's this: The pursuit of narrow self-interest can inspire others to respond in kind and everyone winds up worse off.

There are parallels that should make us at least stop and think. Author Margaret MacMillan

The other books Freeland shared are more optimistic.

She gave colleagues, ""Sapiens,'' a sweeping history of the human species by Noah Harari, a favoured author of Guajardo's. The final tome was from prize-winning economist Angus Deaton.

In his, ""The Great Escape,'' the Scottish-American author unleashes an avalanche of data illustrating the good fortune of living today in an era of unprecedented wealth, health and human lifespans.

The other two books were more hopeful

He even argues that growing inequality —within and between countries— is a natural effect of rapid technological change, as people catch up at different paces. He suggests ways to address that inequality, including trade and education, rather than traditional international assistance, which he criticizes.

Even MacMillan's book ends on a slightly optimistic note.

After chronicling the tragic decisions that pushed Europe into a canyon of catastrophe, she concludes with four hopeful words: ""There are always choices.''

Ishiguro es autor de ocho libros, entre las que destaca The Remains of the Day (1989), más conocido como Lo que queda del día, que luego fue adaptado para el cine y protagonizado por Anthony Hopkins en 1993.

Cuando se estrenó la película, la delicadeza de su historia de amor conquistó a los espectadores de todo el mundo y fue nominada a ocho Oscar, pero pocos conocían al autor de la novela en la que se basaba, de acuerdo con un perfil de EFE.

Gracias a este libro y guión, la gente quedó fascinada por el retrato entregado: gran sensibilidad sobre la formalidad y el control de las emociones tan característicos de la personalidad británica.

También se ha adentrado en la ciencia ficción con su obra distópica Never let me go (Nunca me abandones, 2005) y en su último trabajo, The buried giant (El gigante enterrado, 2015), exploró ""cómo la memoria se relaciona con el olvido, la historia con el presente y la fantasía con la realidad"", de acuerdo con el fallo.

Ishiguro nació en 1954 en Nagashaki y vivió en Japón hasta los cinco años, ya que en 1960 su familia se trasladó al Reino Unido, donde su padre trabajó como oceanógrafo, de acuerdo con EFE.

America has experienced yet another mass shooting, this time at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is reportedly the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

As a criminologist, I have reviewed recent research in hopes of debunking some of the common misconceptions I hear creeping into discussions that spring up whenever a mass shooting occurs. Here's some recent scholarship about mass shootings that should help you identify misinformation when you hear it.

#1: More guns don't make you safer

A study I conducted on mass shootings indicated that this phenomenon is not limited to the United States.

Mass shootings also took place in 25 other wealthy nations between 1983 and 2013, but the number of mass shootings in the United States far surpasses that of any other country included in the study during the same period of time.

The U.S. had 78 mass shootings during that 30-year period.

The highest number of mass shootings experienced outside the United States was in Germany – where seven shootings occurred.

In the other 24 industrialized countries taken together, 41 mass shootings took place.

In other words, the U.S. had nearly double the number of mass shootings than all other 24 countries combined in the same 30-year period.

Another significant finding is that mass shootings and gun ownership rates are highly correlated. The higher the gun ownership rate, the more a country is susceptible to experiencing mass shooting incidents. This association remains high even when the number of incidents from the United States is withdrawn from the analysis.

Similar results have been found by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, which states that countries with higher levels of firearm ownership also have higher firearm homicide rates.

My study also shows a strong correlation between mass shooting casualties and overall death by firearms rates. However, in this last analysis, the relation seems to be mainly driven by the very high number of deaths by firearms in the United States. The relation disappears when the United States is withdrawn from the analysis.

#2: Shootings are more frequent

A recent study published by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center shows that the frequency of mass shooting is increasing over time. The researchers measured the increase by calculating the time between the occurrence of mass shootings. According to the research, the days separating mass shooting occurrence went from on average 200 days during the period of 1983 to 2011 to 64 days since 2011.

What is most alarming with mass shootings is the fact that this increasing trend is moving in the opposite direction of overall intentional homicide rates in the U.S., which decreased by almost 50 percent since 1993 and in Europe where intentional homicides decreased by 40 percent between 2003 and 2013.

#3: Restricting sales works

Due to the Second Amendment, the United States has permissive gun licensing laws. This is in contrast to most developed countries, which have restrictive laws.

According to a seminal work by criminologists George Newton and Franklin Zimring, permissive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which all but specially prohibited groups of persons can purchase a firearm. In such a system, an individual does not have to justify purchasing a weapon; rather, the licensing authority has the burden of proof to deny gun acquisition.

By contrast, restrictive gun licensing laws refer to a system in which individuals who want to purchase firearms must demonstrate to a licensing authority that they have valid reasons to get a gun – like using it on a shooting range or going hunting – and that they demonstrate ""good character.""

The type of gun law adopted has important impacts. Countries with more restrictive gun licensing laws show fewer deaths by firearms and a lower gun ownership rate.

#4: Background checks work

In most restrictive background checks performed in developed countries, citizens are required to train for gun handling, obtain a license for hunting or provide proof of membership to a shooting range.

Individuals must prove that they do not belong to any ""prohibited group,"" such as the mentally ill, criminals, children or those at high risk of committing violent crime, such as individuals with a police record of threatening the life of another.

Here's the bottom line. With these provisions, most U.S. active shooters would have been denied the purchase of a firearm.

#5: Not all mass shootings are terrorism

Journalists sometimes describe mass shooting as a form of domestic terrorism. This connection may be misleading.

There is no doubt that mass shootings are ""terrifying"" and ""terrorize"" the community where they have happened. However, not all active shooters involved in mass shooting have a political message or cause.

For example, the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina in June 2015 was a hate crime but was not judged by the federal government to be a terrorist act.

The majority of active shooters are linked to mental health issues, bullying and disgruntled employees. Active shooters may be motivated by a variety of personal or political motivations, usually not aimed at weakening government legitimacy. Frequent motivations are revenge or a quest for power.

#6: Historical comparisons may be flawed

Beginning in 2008, the FBI used a narrow definition of mass shootings. They limited mass shootings to incidents where an individual – or in rare circumstances, more than one – ""kills four or more people in a single incident (not including the shooter), typically in a single location.""

In 2013, the FBI changed its definition, moving away from ""mass shootings"" toward identifying an ""active shooter"" as ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area."" This change means the agency now includes incidents in which fewer than four people die, but in which several are injured, like this 2014 shooting in New Orleans.

This change in definition impacted directly the number of cases included in studies and affected the comparability of studies conducted before and after 2013.

Some researchers on mass shooting, like Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, have even incorporated in their studies several types of multiple homicides that cannot be defined as mass shooting: for instance, familicide (a form of domestic violence) and gang murders.

In the case of familicide, victims are exclusively family members and not random bystanders.

Gang murders are usually crime for profit or a punishment for rival gangs or a member of the gang who is an informer. Such homicides don't belong in the analysis of mass shootings.

Bill Shorten wants imports of polyethylene cladding stopped, committing Labor to that course of action if it wins government.

He said the government needed to do everything possible to protect Australians from a tragedy like the deadly Grenfell Tower fire in London.

But assistant industry minister Craig Laundy, who is meeting with state and territory ministers in Brisbane on Friday, accused Labor of being ignorant of how the industry works.

""This product is actually also made by companies in Australia so a ban at the border would do nothing about those companies,"" he told ABC radio.

The cladding could also be used legally in shop fronts and outdoor signage.

""You would be banning across the board something that can be used legally in certain environments.""

It was already illegal to use the material on high-rise buildings and the law should be enforced, Mr Laundy said.

""Scaring people is not the answer.""

But opposition industry spokesman Kim Carr said it is was wrong to say highly flammable polyethylene cladding was manufactured in Australia, when it is imported by local distributors.

""Assistant Minister Laundy is clearly out of his depth,"" he said.

""Each day the Turnbull government fails to respond to the widespread misuse of these dangerous products, more Australian lives are put at risk.""

Mr Shorten doubled down during a visit to central Queensland on Friday.

""Keeping Australians safe from the risk of fires should be a matter which is above politics,"" he told reporters in Mackay.

""I honestly don't know why Mr Turnbull and the government are willing to take the risk. I don't think when it comes to the safety of Australians we can afford to take any risks.""

The Property Council of Australia has backed an importation ban and audit of existing buildings, while the Queensland government will push to prohibit the PE aluminium composite panels at Friday's meeting.

Y concluye: ""El hecho de que la gente crea o no crea en el punto G no importa realmente.","La ciencia lleva años pregonando la importancia del punto G para alcanzar el orgasmo femenino, pero parece que mucha gente aún no sabe dónde se encuentra.

De hecho, esta es la pregunta sobre sexo más repetida en el buscador de Google entre adultos de 18 a 65 años, según demuestra un estudio de Durex, que también revela que más de un tercio (un 34%) de los jóvenes de entre 18 y 24 años no tiene confianza para hablar sobre sexo. De ahí que acudan en masa a buscar respuestas en Internet.

Por todo ello, la edición británica del HuffPost se ha puesto en contacto con varias expertas para llegar al fondo del asunto.

Según Alix Fox, experta de Durex, el punto G es la forma reducida de decir ""punto Gräfenberg"", nombre que toma del ginecólogo alemán que empezó a investigar sobre ello en los años 50.

""Los científicos no se ponen de acuerdo en si el punto G existe como una estructura anatómica real (como un clítoris interno) o si es simplemente una zona especialmente sensible para muchas mujeres"", señala. ""Lo que sí que se sabe con certeza es que estimular esa zona produce placer y puede llevar a las mujeres a tener orgasmos maravillosos"".

No todas las mujeres tienen un punto G, pero el 60% de ellas sí. Annabelle Knight

Annabelle Knight, sexóloga y experta en relaciones de Lovehoney, se encuentra entre quienes aseguran que el punto G es muy real: ""Ha habido estudios que han puesto en entredicho su existencia, pero ya han sido sobradamente refutados. No todas las mujeres tienen un punto G, pero el 60% de ellas sí"".

Aunque se suele hablar del punto G como una clave para que la mujer llegue al orgasmo, Samantha Evans, dueña del sex shop Jo Divine, asegura que no es lo único que lo puede provocar: ""Cuando se estimula el punto G, la mujer puede sentir como si necesitara hacer pipí, y por eso algunas mujeres reniegan de esa sensación, que confunden con las ganas de orinar"".

""Esa la sensación que viene antes de la eyaculación femenina. Algunas mujeres eyaculan cuando estimulan su punto G, algo que mejora la experiencia. La eyaculación femenina surge en las glándulas parauretrales, que se encuentran en los tejidos esponjosos que rodean la uretra"", aclara.

¿Dónde está el punto G?

No hay consenso a la hora de situar la zona exacta en la que está el punto G, aunque estas expertas coinciden en señalar que las mujeres tienden a sentir más placer en la pared vaginal frontal.

El punto G está, supuestamente, entre 5 y 8 centímetros en el interior de la vagina, en la pared vaginal frontal. Tracey Cox

Tracey Cox, sexóloga y experta en relaciones, indica que el punto G ""está, supuestamente, entre 5 y 8 centímetros en el interior de la vagina, en la pared vaginal frontal"". ""La zona del punto G sobresale ligeramente, pero solo cuando las glándulas que están en torno a la uretra se hinchan"", especifica.

Sin embargo, la experta hace hincapié que la localización exacta del punto G varía dependiendo de cada mujer.

Knight sugiere que las mujeres se lo encuentren ellas mismas antes de intentar estimularlo con sus parejas: ""La forma más fácil de localizar el punto G de cada una es tumbarse de espaldas e introducir el dedo corazón en la vagina. El punto G suele estar en la pared vaginal frontal, entre la abertura vaginal y el cuello del útero. Debería ser un poco rugoso, casi como la superficie de una nuez"".

¿Cómo se puede estimular el punto G?

Según Tracey Cox, en general las parejas prefieren estimular la pared vaginal entera en vez de buscar un escurridizo botón de placer que quizás exista o quizás no: ""La técnica habitual para estimular el punto G de tu pareja es meter los dedos y curvarlos hacia arriba como si estuvieras haciendo un gesto de 'ven aquí"".

Knight añade que algunos hombres tienen una ligera curvatura en el pene erecto que puede ayudar a estimular la pared vaginal frontal.

""Las mujeres pueden sacarle partido a esa curvatura escogiendo una postura que favorezca que su pene impacte con el punto G al penetrar"", señala. ""Si tiene un pene recto, también hay posturas que maximizan las posibilidades de estimular el punto G"". ""La mariposa es una buena opción. Te recuestas en una mesa mientras él, de pie, te penetra. Te tiene que agarrar bajo las caderas para que pueda sujetarte bien. Esta posición debería servir para dirigir su pene directamente a tu punto G"", propone.

¿Cómo me puedo estimular el punto G yo misma?

Samantha Evans asegura que una de las mejores formas de estimular el punto G es utilizar un juguete sexual curvado, algo para lo que no hace falta tener compañía: ""Pruébalo a lo largo de todo el mes, ya que los cambios hormonales que se producen en tu cuerpo pueden tener un efecto positivo en tus niveles de sensibilidad y excitación sexual"".

""Date primero un masaje vulvar o anal y, cuando veas que empiezas a estar suficientemente excitada para tener un orgasmo, o justo cuando acabes de tener uno, métete el dedo corazón en la vagina y cúrvalo haciendo el gesto de 'ven aquí' para acariciar la pared frontal"", plantea.

""Busca entre 3 y 6 centímetros en el interior de la vagina y presiona con firmeza. La zona del punto G se nota rugosa y se estimula con más presión que el clítoris"".

""Mueve los dedos por la zona y prueba distintos tipos de contacto. Intenta ver a través de la piel y percibir cómo va cambiando el tono muscular"", añade.

Todas las expertas con las que ha contactado el HuffPost han subrayado también que, ya sea un ""botón"" de placer o simplemente una zona más sensible, prestarle demasiada atención puede provocar el efecto contrario al deseado.

""No te obsesiones con tener un punto G, limítate a disfrutar de las sensaciones placenteras del sexo"", recuerda Evans. Y concluye: ""El hecho de que la gente crea o no crea en el punto G no importa realmente. Lo que de verdad importa es disfrutar del fantástico placer del sexo"".

Einer seiner Peiniger wurde nun in Deutschland verurteilt

Und Campeau erzählt eindringlich, wie er in Gefangenschaft für sein Leben kämpfte

Im Video-Interview mit der HuffPost erklärt er, warum aber nicht alles getan hätte, um seine Haut zu retten

Sie hatten ihn gefangen. Eingesperrt. Gequält. Aber seine Seele, die sollten sie nie bekommen. Das hatte sich Carl Campeau geschworen.

Es war der 17. Februar 2013 als der UN-Jurist aus Kanada das Camp südwestlich von Damaskus verließ, von dem aus die Vereinten Nationen die Golanhöhen überwachen. Er wollte zu einem Termin in die syrische Hauptstadt. Dinge klären, die man nicht am Telefon bespricht oder mailt. Und zu einem Physiotherapeuten, der sich um sein frisch operiertes Knie kümmern sollte.

Leben und sterben lagen da schon sehr nahe beieinander in Syrien. Das Camp war zwar noch nicht von Al-Qaida-nahen Rebellen überrannt. Aber in der Region kämpfte das Assad-Regime gegen die Rebellen. Und die Rebellen gegen wieder andere Rebellen.

Campeaus Frau, selbst Syrerin, hatte ihn angefleht, die Fahrt nach Damaskus nicht anzutreten. Aber Campeau arbeitet seit vielen Jahren in Krisengebieten. Angehörige zu beruhigen, das gehört zum Job, findet er. Ein gepanzerter Wagen war keiner frei, also nahm Campeau ein normales Auto, Helm und schusssichere Weste, und fuhr los.

In einem Vorort der syrischen Hauptstadt, Khan al-Shih, stoppten ihn zwei Männer, Kämpfer der islamistischen Al-Nusra-Front, die Gewehre im Anschlag. Sie zerrten ihn ums Auto, zwangen in auf den Rücksitz, karrten ihn zu einer Villa, die sie besetzt hatten. Campeaus dachte, sie würden ihn jetzt umbringen. (Wie er die Entführung erlebt hat, könnt ihr hier in einem Buchauszug lesen.)

Einer der Dschihadisten wurde nun in Deutschland verurteilt

Heute ist Campeau 53 und versucht, das Erlebte zu verarbeiten. Den Zwang, zum Islam zu konvertieren. Acht Monate Angst bis zu seiner Flucht. Die Erfahrung, dass weder der Arbeitgeber noch der Heimatstaat Lösegeld zahlen wollten, dass sie auch sonst kaum halfen. Das Wissen, dass die Gefahr für ihn heute kleiner geworden ist – aber nicht vorbei.

Einer der vielen Dschihadisten, mit denen Campeau während seiner Geiselhaft zu tun hatte, kam als Flüchtling nach Deutschland. Vor drei Wochen hat das Oberlandesgericht Suliman al S. verurteilt, zu drei Jahren und sechs Monaten Gefängnis. Die Bundesanwaltschaft hatte sieben Jahre gefordert. Nach ihren Angaben war es das erste Mal, dass in Deutschland ein Flüchtling wegen Kriegsverbrechen vor Gericht stand.

Suliman al-S. sitzt schon seit Anfang 2016 in Untersuchungshaft, bei guter Führung könnte er bald wieder frei kommen. Außer, die Bundesanwaltschaft, die in Revision gehen will, hat Erfolg.

Die Angst vor Rache

Wer Campeau, markante Brille, schwarzer Rollkragenpulli, an diesem windigen Herbsttag in München trifft, der lernt einen Menschen kennen, der sich wegen des Prozesses sorgt.

Nicht weil er das Urteil für zu milde hält. Sondern weil er fürchtet, dass Suliman al-S. sich weiter radikalisieren und rächen wird, wenn er noch länger eingesperrt bleibt. ""An mir, meiner Familie oder der deutschen Gesellschaft.""

Nach Syrien abschieben, sagt der Jurist, wird Deutschland Suliman al-S. nicht können. Das könnte dessen Tod bedeuten. Und das würde er auch nicht wollen, sagt Campeau.

Er weiß, dass der Versuch, ehemalige Dschihadisten zu resozialisieren, teuer wird. Es ist der Versuch, ""Zeitbomben"", wie er sie nennt, zu entschärfen. Vor allem, wenn sie wie Suliman al-S. auch von Deutschland aus noch Kontakt gehalten haben zu ihren Kumpanen, wie Campeau sagt.

Aber er findet, die Gesellschaft habe keine andere Wahl, als ""gute Imame"" zu suchen, die die Dschihadisten religiös aufklären. Und Psychiater zu bezahlen, die ihnen helfen, ihre eigenen Traumata aufzuarbeiten.

Campeau hält nich alle seiner Entführer für schlechte Menschen

Der Vater von inzwischen drei Kindern sucht, tastet nach Worten, wenn er über seine Entführer spricht oder schreibt. Überhaupt, wenn er über Menschen urteilen soll.

Denn eines will er unbedingt vermeiden: Er will nicht in so eine Spirale des Hasses geraten wie viele seiner Entführer. Er wollte nie so undifferenziert urteilen wie viele von ihnen.

""Wenn ich Abneigung oder Hass empfinde, dann nicht so sehr gegen meine Kidnapper, sondern gegen ihre Ideologie"", sagt er. ""Es ist eine totalitäre Ideologie.""

Nicht alle seiner Entführer seien schlechte Menschen. ""Es gibt Gründe, warum sie in diese Sache hineingeraten sind und manchmal gute Gründe.""

Campeau erzählt von einem jungen Mann, der von Soldaten gefangen und drei Monate jeden Tag gefoltert wurde, bevor er sich den Rebellen anschloss. Er findet die Reaktion nachvollziehbar. Rebellion an sich sei auch nicht das Problem. ""Aber man muss sich fragen, was diese Rebellion erreichen will.""

Junge Menschen aber hätten oft nicht die Weisheit, das zu sehen.

Gratwanderung zwischen Selbstaufgabe und Hass

Was der Jurist da macht, ist eine schwierige Gratwanderung. Eine auf einem Grat zwischen Abgründen aus Stockholm-Syndrom und Islamhass.

Und nicht immer gelingt Campeau das. In seinem Buch ""Meine Seele kriegt ihr nie"" schreibt er, dass er immer wieder Sätze durchstreichen musste, in denen die Gefühle stärker wurden als der Verstand. Aber diese ""intellektuelle Faulheit"", wie er es nennt, wollte und will er sich nicht gestatten.

Denn dann, so empfindet er es, hätten seine Kidnapper gewonnen. Sie hätten nicht nur acht Monate die Gewalt über seinen Körper gehabt, sondern lebenslang über seine Seele.

""Ich hätte keinen Unschuldigen getötet""

""Ich fragte mich nicht nur einmal, wer hier eigentlich in Wahrheit der Gefangene war. Inzwischen scheint mir die Antwort klar"", schreibt er in seinem Buch über die Entführung.

""Wenn sie mich gezwungen hätten, einen Unschuldigen zu töten oder eine Frau zu vergewaltigen, das hätte ich nicht getan, nur um meine Haut zu retten"", sagt er im Gespräch mit der HuffPost. Denn mit so einer Tat hätte er immer leben müssen. ""Und wenn man an das Leben nach dem Tod glaubt, dann könnte es da auch Konsequenzen geben.""

Die verzweifelte Hoffnung auf Hilfe, wenn schon nicht von Menschen, dann vom Erzengel

Campeau hält sich nicht für einen besonders religiösen Menschen. Aber in der Verzweiflung fing er an zu beten. ""Ich dachte mir, was habe ich zu verlieren?""

Tatsächlich hätte er sein Leben verloren, wenn die Entführer gemerkt hätten, zu wem er da betete.

Aber Campeau bat den Erzengel Michael, er möge ihm die Flucht ermöglichen.

Am 16. Oktober, einem hohen muslimischen Feiertag, vergaßen die Entführer dann tatsächlich, die Tür zu seinem Zimmer abzusperren und verschwanden zum Sporttraining. Campeau floh zu Fuß durch die zerbombten, zerschossenen Straßen, rannte und wanderte Stunden, bis er auf Soldaten des Regimes traf, die ihn erst für einen Spion hielten. Erst nach langen Befragungen ließen sie ihn frei.

""Es ist egal, ob der Erzengel eine Idee oder Wirklichkeit ist, denn es hat mir geholfen, ihn um Hilfe zu bitten"", sagt Campeau. ""Es hat mir Hoffnung gegeben.""

Als der 53-Jährige diese Sätze gesagt hat, bleibt es eine kurze Weile still im Raum. So beherrscht er über seine Erfahrungen spricht, so ruhig, so sehr quält ihn die Erinnerung, die ihm noch immer den Schlaf raubt. Und die jetzt seine Augen feucht werden lässt.

""Ich hätte ihn gern gefragt, ob es ihm gut geht""

Er weiß nicht, was passiert ist, nachdem er geflohen ist. Wann seine Entführer es gemerkt haben, ob sie ihm auf den Fersen waren.

Er hat nach seiner Rückkehr jedoch eine Anfrage über Facebook bekommen. Er vermutet, dass sie von einem der Entführer ist, wohl von einem, den er als einen der ""guten"" in Erinnerung hat. ""Ich hätte ihn gern gefragt, ob es ihm gut geht"", sagt Campeau. Aber aus Sicherheitsgründen ließ er es bleiben.

Um der Sicherheit willen darf die Öffentlichkeit auch nicht wissen, wo die UN ihn jetzt eingesetzt haben.

Seine Seele, die haben sie wohl nicht bekommen

Er arbeitet noch immer für die Organisation, die ihn nach seiner Einschätzung so hängen ließ, als sein Leben davon abhing. Die zuließ, dass eine Ehefrau maßgeblich die Verhandlungen führen musste mit Entführern und Behörden.

Selbst der Richter, der Suliman al-S. in Stuttgart verurteilte, machte den UN und dem kanadischen Geheimdienst laut der ""Stuttgarter Zeitung"" massive Vorwürfe: ""Man mag es kaum glauben, aber die UN hat kein Interesse daran gezeigt, die Entführung ihres Mitarbeiters aufzuklären“, so Richter Anderer.

Am 17. Oktober 2013, einen Tag nach der Flucht, übergibt der syrische Vize-Außenminister Faisal al-Makdad (r.) Campeau (M.) in die Obhut an den UN-Vertreter Yacoub El Hillo. Foto: Reuters.

""Ich arbeite noch dort, weil ich eine Familie habe und eine Job brauche. Und weil ich an die Ideale der UN glaube, daran, dass man die Menschen unterstützen und Staaten ein Diskussionsforum bieten muss.""

Wer Campeau so zuhört, der hört einen ebenso rationalen wie verletzlichen Menschen, der viel Dinge erlebt hat, die niemand jemals hätte erleben sollen. Aber er hört eben immer noch einen Menschen. Einen, dessen Seele die Entführer verwundet haben. Aber bestimmt nicht besiegt.

The practice, created in the 1920s by Joseph Pilates to rehabilitate soldiers returning from war, can seem daunting with the variety of poses and extended terminology (and doesn’t always look great for our bank balance, either).

But Cassey Ho, a fitness instructor from the US, wanted to change that. The 30-year-old began posting YouTube workout videos in 2009 on a channel now called ‘Blogilates’.

To modernise it and make the practice accessible to everyone, she fused pop music with simple Pilates routines and put them online so anyone with an internet connection could watch.

Her fusion workout is now known as ‘POP Pilates’ and she has garnered more than four million subscribers, all following her YouTube workouts for free.

Ho’s passion for her online community goes far beyond her popularity on social media, as she told HuffPost UK: “What I do isn’t for the likes, views, or comments - it’s about the lasting positive impact you can have on someone’s life.”

We caught up with her to chat about her journey to success and what a week is like in her world for the latest in our ‘Fit Fix’ interview series.

CasseyHo

My Journey 🌍

What do you credit to your success in your fitness journey?

“I’m an instructor at heart, so when I first started my YouTube channel, it wasn’t about the money, the fame, or the subscribers. It was about teaching people how to get stronger. That mission has stayed true throughout my career and that’s why the community that makes up ‘Blogilates’ is so solid.”

What’s one of the most memorable moments in your career and why?

“Recently I went on on tour in Singapore to teach some big fitness classes. It’s always exciting going somewhere international and seeing firsthand how much POP Pilates has expanded from just one YouTube video in 2009! When I was there, some of my biggest fans reached out. It was incredible to have deep conversations with these girls and get to know them on a human level. You’re reminded that what you do isn’t for the likes, views, or comments - it’s about the lasting positive impact you can have on someone’s life.”

Was there ever a low point in your career and how did you get past it?

“There are moments when online harassment can get pretty tough. There was definitely a point in my career when it got really bad and I just wanted to hide. But the thing is, if you know who you are and why you’re doing what you’re doing, you can harness so much inner strength to fight past those days. I wasn’t going to let negativity stand in the way of what makes me happy and fulfilled.”

CasseyHo

My Training 💪

Talk us through your week in fitness.

“I try to workout and move my body every day. Sometimes that’s in the morning or in the evening, it all depends on what my schedule allows for that day. If I am pressed for time, I love doing PIIT28 (Pilates Intense Interval Training). I get my cardio and my strength training done all in a session that’s under 30 minutes.”

What’s your favourite type of workout and why?

“POP Pilates fuses dance with music and Pilates so I don’t feel like I am working out. I also really love dancing, especially ballroom dancing.”

What’s your favourite way to spend your rest day?

“I think rest days are really necessary. I used to try to schedule them, but now I let them happen more organically. So if I know it’s a travel day and I’ll be sitting on a plane, that’s my rest day. On the other hand... things that relax me? A massage!”

CasseyHo

My Food 🍳

What do you eat throughout the week to complement your training schedule?

“I love quick, healthy meals. Fish tacos made with lettuce wraps or coconut flour tortillas are my favourite - with tons of homemade guacamole.”

What are your pre- and post-workout snacks?

“Power smoothies are always a good go-to because they’re delicious and quick. There are so many different recipes and combinations you can try, AND it’s a great way to get healthy carbs, protein, and fats. Oh, and one snack I really like (I know it might sound weird) is peanut butter and carrots - try it before you judge.”

What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned about food?

“Everyone has different needs and that’s okay. Food is prescriptive and what works for one person might not necessarily work for someone else. There’s not one manual that everyone has to follow.”

CasseyHo

My Motivation 🙌

Do you have a motivational mantra that keeps you going?

“It’s: ‘If you want it bad enough, you’ll figure out how to make it happen’.”

Do you always have fitness goals you are aiming for?

“My fitness goals are always about strength. I’m constantly pushing myself to grow stronger, both physically and mentally.”

What’s your ultimate workout track and why?

‘Right now, I’m obsessed with Taylor Swift’s single ‘Look What You Made Me Do’. It’s funny because the first time I heard it, I wasn’t a fan. But it started growing on me and now I love blasting it while I sweat.”

Σύμφωνα με μια δημοσιογράφο του BBC, την Chloe Hayward , η οποία εκείνη την ώρα έβγαινε από το Μουσείο, ένα αυτοκίνητο διέσχισε διαγώνια τον δρόμο και κατευθύνθηκε προς το πεζοδρόμιο όπου βρίσκονταν ελάχιστα άτομα.

Σύμφωνα με την ίδια στο σημείο έσπευσαν ισχυρές αστυνομικές δυνάμεις, ενώ από αέρος πετούσαν ελικόπτερα.

Ο οδηγός επίσης τραυματίστηκε. Αρχικά μεταφέρθηκε στο νοσοκομείο, κατόπιν συνελήφθη και παραμένει υπό κράτηση σε αστυνομικό τμήμα στο βόρειο Λονδίνο, σύμφωνα με ανακοίνωση της αστυνομίας.

Στις φωτογραφίες που κυκλοφόρησαν στο Twitter διακρίνεται ο οδηγός, που φορά μπλε πουκάμισο, να βρίσκεται πεσμένος στο έδαφος, ενώ δύο άλλοι άνθρωποι τον κρατούν ακινητοποιημένο, ενδεχομένως περαστικοί.

Σε άλλες φωτογραφίες, εικονίζεται ένα μαύρο αυτοκίνητο το μπροστινό μέρος του οποίου έχει σφηνώσει μεταξύ δύο άλλων οχημάτων που είναι σταθμευμένα κατά μήκος του πεζοδρομίου.

Et il le fait savoir. Dans la soirée du 5 octobre, le réalisateur a publié un long billet sur son compte Instagram. Un texte aux allures de tribune contre les méthodes journalistiques, particulièrement sur le web.

La cause de ces fulgurances digitales? Une rumeur sur une suite de ""Lucy"" dans les petits papiers d'Europa Corp, la société de production audiovisuelle fondée par Luc Besson, pour 2018. Tout part des États-Unis, où de nombreuses déclarations ont été entremêlées. Depuis, beaucoup d'informations différentes circulent à ce sujet.

""Quel honneur pour vous d'informer, de prévenir, de guider, de décrypter même... Mais ça c'était AVANT. Avant Internet et sa course effrénée et idiote au scoop"" déclare le réalisateur dans son long texte adressé principalement à la presse.

""Lucy"" ou la lumière au bout du tunnel

Sorti en 2014, ""Lucy"", portée par Scarlett Johansson, est le plus gros succès du cinéma français avec 460 millions de dollars de recettes. Pas étonnant donc qu'une suite du film soit pressentie.

Et pourtant, en août 2014, Besson coupait court à toutes les rumeurs lors d'une interview à Taïwan relayée dans un article du Hollywood Reporter: ""Je ne vois pas comment on peut en refaire un. Il n'a pas été conçu pour ça. Si je trouve une super idée, je le ferai peut-être. Mais pour l'instant, je n'y pense même pas.""

Des déclarations qui semblaient presque sceller tout espoir quant à un second opus de ""Lucy"". Mais ça, c'était AVANT. Avant que la société Europa Corp ne perde 115 millions d'euros en 2016 à cause d'un accord de financement de 8 à 12 films par an avec la société américaine ""Relativity Media"".

Après de nombreux projets infructueux comme ""Valérian"", ""Miss Sloane"", ""The Circle"", Europa Corp a donc été obligé de revoir ses ambitions à la baisse pour les années à venir. Selon Première, Europa Corp chercherait désormais à produire entre deux et trois films anglophones et deux films francophones par an.

Tout a bien changé donc depuis le flop de l'accord avec ""Relativity Media"". Marc Shmuger, directeur général de Europa Corp, a révélé à Variety fin septembre que Europa Corp développait activement une suite à ""Lucy"". Et bien qu'aucune autre précision n'ait été faite sur le synopsis du film, le directeur général de la société de production de Luc Besson affirme que ce dernier a déjà écrit le script.

Alors à moins d'avoir cité à tort le DG de Europa Corp, Variety a bel et bien fait savoir que ""Lucy 2"" était en préparation. Affaire à suivre.

Erst am Mittwoch hat Macron mit einer unbedachten Aussage für einen erneuten Skandal gesorgt

Wieder einmal hat Emmanuel Macron seine scharfe Zunge in Schwierigkeiten gebracht.

Am Mittwoch hatte der französische Präsident eine von einer Schließung bedrohte Fabrik in Südwestfrankreich besucht.

Vor den Werkstoren protestierten aktuelle und ehemalige Arbeiter eines Automobilzulieferers. Drinnen erklärte Macron, einige der Demonstranten täten besser daran, sich nach Stellen in einem anderen Unternehmen umzuschauen, “anstatt einen Saustall zu hinterlassen”.

Der 39-Jährige benutzte dabei den Ausdruck ""foutre le bordel"", der als derb und umgangssprachlich gilt. Ein Audiomitschnitt entrüstet die Franzosen nun schon seit Tagen.

Der Zeitpunkt der sprachlichen Eskapade ist denkbar ungünstig: Denn die Reformen der Macron-Regierung nehmen gerade Fahrt auf - und die Zustimmungswerte des Präsidenten bessern sich.

Exklusive Zahlen der französischen Ausgabe der HuffPost zeigen jedoch: Zugleich nimmt die Ablehnung gegen Macron zu. Der Präsident, der angetreten ist um Europa zu einen, ist dabei, sein eigenes Land zu spalten.

Auf dem Weg der Besserung?

In einer Umfrage des Meinungsforschungsinstituts YouGov im Auftrag der HuffPost und der französischen Nachrichtenseite ""CNews"" gaben 32 Prozent der Befragten an, mit der Arbeit von Macron zufrieden zu sein. Das sind zwei Prozentpunkte mehr im Vergleich zum Vormonat (grüne Linie in der Grafik oben).

Deutlich wird auch: Macron war seit Beginn seiner Amtszeit im Mai in den Umfragen regelrecht abgestürzt. Kein Präsident seit Jacques Chirac 1995 verlor so rapide an Beliebtheit wie der junge Shootingstar.

Nun also bessern sich die Werte langsam - zumindest auf den ersten Blick. Denn zugleich sind auch mehr und mehr Menschen mit dem Präsidenten unzufrieden. 56 Prozent lehnen die Arbeit des Präsidenten ab, zwei Prozentpunkte mehr als im September (rote Linie in der Graphik oben).

Macron ist dabei, die französische Gesellschaft in Befürworter und Gegner seiner Politik zu spalten.

Macron will Europa und Frankreich vereinen

Vergangene Woche hatte der französische Präsident seine Vision für Europa vorgestellt. In einer visionären Rede versuchte Macron, eine Neugründung der EU zu skizzieren. Er möchte die Union stärken und die europäischen Nationen zusammenführen.

Auch für Frankreich wollte Macron ein Kandidat der Einheit sein. Immer wieder beteuerte der 39-Jährige, linke und rechte Wähler gleichermaßen abholen zu wollen.

Fünf Monate nach seinem überraschenden Sieg bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen muss sich Macron allerdings eingestehen: Die Strategie funktioniert nicht - zumindest in Frankreich.

Anstatt die Gräben zu überbrücken, ist Frankreich weiter ein politisch gespaltenes Land. Bei seinen eigenen Anhängern konnte Macron in der YouGov-Umfrage zwar ganze 15 Prozentpunkte zulegen, Federn ließ er aber bei allen anderen politischen Lagern.

Lediglich 20 Prozent der linken Wähler sind mit ihm zufrieden. Das sind drei Prozentpunkte weniger als im Vormonat. Bei den Wählern der konservativen Republikaner verlor Macron sogar 5 Prozentpunkte, hier sind nur noch 21 Prozent mit ihm zufrieden.

Die Fehltritte

Gründe für Macrons Unbeliebtheit bei linken wie konservativen Wählern gibt es viele:

► Seine liberalen Arbeitsmarktreformen stoßen auf Widerstand im linken Lager. Über hunderttausend Menschen gingen dagegen auf die Straße, angestachelt von der Hardliner-Gewerkschaft CGT und dem ultralinken Politiker Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

► Weitere Reformen der Sozialabgaben und der Rente werden für manche Menschen in Frankreich Einbußen bedeuten.

► Konservative Politiker stehen Macrons Europa-Kurs kritisch gegenüber. Der Republikaner Laurent Wauquiez legte der deutschen Kanzlerin Angela Merkel gar kritische Worte über Macrons Europa-Rede in den Mund, um den Präsidenten zu kritisieren.

► Schon mehrfach hat Macron mit Aussagen über seine Reformen für Empörung gesorgt. In Bukarest hatte der Präsident im August gesagt, die Franzosen würden Reformen hassen. Die Gewerkschaften protestierten.

Bei einem Besuch in Athen hatte Macron beteuert, er werde sich den ""Zynikern"" und ""Faulenzern"" nicht beugen und seine Vorhaben umsetzen. Wieder war der Aufschrei in Frankreich groß, die Gegner des Präsidenten bezogen die Aussagen auf sich.

Und nun Macrons desaströser Auftritt am Mittwoch. Auch Politiker der konservativen Republikaner kritisierten die Aussagen des Präsidenten. Macron lasse keine Gelegenheit aus, seine Verachtung gegenüber den Franzosen auszurücken, schrieb die Sprecherin der Konservativen, Valérie Boyer auf Twitter.

Macron mag angetreten sein, das im Wahlkampf so erhitzte Frankreich zu versöhnen. Gelungen ist ihm das bisher nicht.

""Emmanuel Macron wird immer Emmanuel Macron bleiben"", kommentierte die französische Tageszeitung ""Le Monde"" vor kurzem den Politikstil des Präsidenten: ""Grenzüberschreitend auf die Gefahr hin, spaltend zu sein, offensiv auf die Gefahr hin, anzuecken.""

Su amor por Dylan hizo que en 2016, cuando le concedieron al cantante el Nobel de Literatura, se alegrara públicamente.","El escritor británico de origen japonés Kazuo Ishiguro, cuya obra se centra en la memoria, el tiempo y el desengaño, ha sido galardonado este jueves con el Premio Nobel de Literatura 2017. Algunas de sus novelas más conocidas —ha publicado siete, más un libro de relatos— son Lo que queda del día (llevada a la gran pantalla y protagonizada por Anthony Hopkins y Emma Thompson), Nunca me abandones (cuya adaptación cinematográfica corrió a cargo de Carey Mulligan y Andrew Garfield) o El gigante enterrado.

Tanto si ya lo conocías pero te interesa saber algo más acerca de él o, si por el contrario, nunca habías escuchado su nombre pero te despierta curiosidad saber por qué merece el Nobel, aquí puedes leer estas once datos sobre Ishiguro:

1. Nació en Nagasaki (Japón) en 1954. Su madre sobrevivió a la bomba atómica cuando era adolescente y su padre era oceanógrafo. Fue la profesión del padre la que llevó a la familia a mudarse a Guilford, al sur de Inglaterra. Tenía cinco años en aquel momento e iba a ser una mudanza temporal. Sin embargo, la familia acabó instalada en el país e Ishiguro no visitó Japón hasta 29 años después. En una entrevista en Paris Review de 2008 contó que su mayor decepción acerca del traslado de la familia fue que su abuelo le compró un juguete de una gallina a la que se podía disparar y no le dejaron llevárselo en el viaje.

2. A los 9 o 10 años descubrió los libros de Sherlock Holmes en la biblioteca y no sólo los leyó ""obsesivamente"", sino que comenzó a hablar y comportarse como él. Su historia favorita es El sabueso de los Baskerville. ""Era aterrador y me provocaba noches en vela pero sospecho que me atraía el mundo de Conan Doyle porque, paradójicamente, era muy acogedor"", reconoció en una entrevista en The New York Times en 2015.

3. De pequeño quería ser músico. Empezó a estudiar piano a los cinco años y lo hizo hasta cumplir los 12. Después quiso seguir los pasos de sus ídolos Bob Dylan y Leonard Cohen. ""Escribes tus canciones, las cantas tú mismo, las arreglas. Lo encontré atractivo y empecé a escribir canciones"", contó en una entrevista con cohencentric.com. Tiene más de cien títulos. ""Creo que la primera frase [de su primer tema] decía: 'Tus ojos nunca volverán a abrirse en la playa donde una vez vivimos y jugamos"".

4. No fue hasta que se convirtió en veinteañero cuando la pasión por los libros llegó a su vida —antes era únicamente la música—. Entonces descubrió a Dostoyevski y a Charlotte Brontë, sus autores de cabecera, y la literatura se convirtió en el centro de su vida. Ha llegado a afirmar que le debe su carrera a esta última escritora.

5. Ishiguro sólo ha escrito ocho libros. Preguntado en 2005 en Der Spiegel por si se debe a que escribe despacio, el autor señaló: ""Nunca he sentido la necesidad de escribir más rápido. Nunca pienso que deba contribuir a la cantidad de libros. Es más importante escribir uno que aporte algo diferente"".

6. Tanto es así que tardó diez años en escribir su última novela, El gigante enterrado. En eso tuvo mucho que ver su mujer, Lorna MacDougall, con la que está casado desde hace 29 años y en la que tiene fe ciega a la hora de escribir. De hecho, ella fue la que retrasó la publicación de este libro tras leerse las 40 primeras páginas. ""Me dijo: 'Esto no funciona. Y no me refiero a que tengas que cambiar esto o aquello, o a aspectos que puedas mejorar editando el texto. Lo que está mal es el lenguaje. Por momentos, hasta provoca risa. Tíralo y empieza de nuevo"", y así hizo.

7. Es un firme defensor de la ficción. En una entrevista con The Independent se lamentó de que en las últimas décadas ""el cometido de la educación era lograr que los alumnos abandonaran la fantasía, que es natural en los niños, y prepararlos para las demandas del mundo laboral"".

Viele Beobachter stilisieren den Konflikt nun zu einer Schlacht um Demokratie und Freiheit

Doch tatsächlich findet in Katalonien ein politischer Machtkampf rigoroser Nationalisten statt

Spaniens Demokratie ist zu jung, als dass sie dem ganzen Land eine gemeinsame Identität geben könnte.

Im Jahr 1975 starb der Diktator Francisco Franco - doch erst sieben Jahre später war der Faschismus in Spanien endgültig besiegt. Seitdem kämpfen die Spanier vor allem mit dem Nationalismus im Land, besonders dem der Regionen.

Bis April diesen Jahres terrorisierte die national-baskische ETA das Land. Nur wenige Monate später begehren nun die Katalanen gegen den spanischen Staat auf und verlangen so laut wie nie ihre Unabhängigkeit.

Die Regierung des konservativen Premiers Mariano Rajoy reagierte brutal - die Bilder spanischer Polizisten, die friedliche Demonstranten blutig schlugen, schockierten zurecht die Welt.

Jetzt wird in vielen internationalen und deutschen Medien von einem Freiheitskampf der Katalanen geschrieben. Von einer Schlacht um die Demokratie.

Ja, es geht im Streit um Kataloniens Unabhängigkeit auch um die Wehrhaftigkeit und Freiheit der spanischen Demokratie. Doch nach wie vor ist der Katalonien-Konflikt vor allem eines: Ein rigoroser Machtkampf zwischen nationalistischen Ideologien.

Das nationalistische Demokratieverständnis der katalanischen Separatisten

Da sind zum einen die katalanischen Separatisten.

Die Regionalregierung des Bundesstaates stellte ihr Unabhängigkeitsreferendum als Ausdruck des Volkswillens und demokratischen Akt dar. Dabei hatte das spanische Verfassungsgericht den Vorgang zuvor als verfassungswidrig eingestuft - eine Einschätzung, die auch die EU-Kommission teilt.

Der Regierung Kataloniens ist das egal: Sie will am Montag die Unabhängigkeit verkünden, nachdem angeblich mehr als 90 Prozent der Katalanen dafür gestimmt hätten.

Laut Günther Maihold, Spanien-Experte der Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, verstehe diese linke Regierung die Unabhängigkeit als Verkörperung der Suche nach Autonomie. ""Sie schreckt dabei auch vor einer Knebelung des regionalen Parlaments in Barcelona nicht zurück"", sagt Maihold der HuffPost.

Demokratie ist in Katalonien also dann erwünscht, wenn sie als direktdemokratisches Scherbengericht nationalistische Bestrebungen fördert. In institutioneller Form - als Verfassungsgericht, Parlament oder internationaler Regierungskörper - wird sie nach dieser Logik zum Instrument der Unterdrückung des Volkes.

Rajoy und die Verteidigung der Nation gegen die Nationalitäten

Diesem katalanischen Nationalismus steht derjenige der spanischen Zentralregierung gegenüber.

In Katalonien selbst hat Spaniens Premier kaum Unterstützer. Nur 8 Prozent der Wähler haben hier bei der letzten Wahl seiner Partido Popular (PP) ihre Stimme gegeben. Im Gegenzug nutzt Rajoy die Katalanen als Steigbügel für seinen Erfolg im Rest des Landes.

Diesen hat der 62-Jährige vor allem durch den spanischen Nationalismus erzielen können, erläutert Politikwissenschaftler Maihold: ""Für Rajoy bedeutet ein Nachgeben in seinem Anti-Katalanismus mögliche Verluste in der starken Position, die er als Vertreter von Rest-Spanien einnimmt.""

Der Premier braucht also den starken Zentralstaat, um seine Macht in Spanien zu sichern. Für Rajoy und die PP geht es laut Maihold um nichts Geringeres als ""die Verteidigung der Nation gegen die Nationalitäten.""

Der Nationalismus regiert, die Demokratie verliert

Für das aggressive und brutale Vorgehen Rajoys gegen die katalanischen Demonstranten ist das keine Entschuldigung. Doch der Nationalismus des Premiers ist eine Erklärung für seine harte Gangart gegen die katalanische Regionalregierung.

Diese besteht aus einem Bündnis der progressiven Liste Junts pel Sí und der anarchistisch ausgerichteten Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (CUP). ""Diese beiden Kräfte führen die jetzige Unabhängigkeitskampagne nach Maximen von Extrempositionen und Mobilisierung durch Konfrontation"", sagt Experte Maihold.

Deren Höhepunkt ist in Katalonien nun erreicht. Der Dialog zwischen den Konfliktparteien ist endgültig gescheitert. Populismus, Anfeindungen und nun auch Gewalt bestimmen die Lage.

In Katalonien wie in Spanien gilt nun eine neue Ordnung: Der Nationalismus regiert - und die Demokratie verliert.

And to make such predictions in time to prevent their murderous intent being translated into mass murder?
So, will the FBI announce soon that it has uncovered one of the causes of the Las Vegas massacre?
The sad truths are that we already know the cause of the Las Vegas mass murder, and we already know that it will be the cause of future mass murders.","""Without the guns, Mr Paddock -- no matter how murderous his intentions -- would not have been able to murder more than a handful of people.""

Following last weekend's massacre in Las Vegas by Stephen Paddock, in which 58 people were murdered and 500 were injured, law enforcement agencies are devoting large resources to try to find out the causes of the mass murder.

According to The New York Times, baffled FBI agents are trying to reconstruct Mr Paddock's actions, including finding and interviewing ""everyone and anyone who crossed his path in recent weeks"". They seek to explain why a man with no evident criminal history became a mass murderer.

Law enforcement agencies are scouring the scene at which 10,000 bullets rained down on a crowded outdoor concert. They are painstakingly taking apart the hotel room from which the bullets were fired. They are searching, inch by inch, Mr Paddock's home and elsewhere. They are scouring electronic and paper files for anything about his life and activities.

Their task is made all the more difficult by the fact that, as a deputy director of the FBI said, the murderer was:

""... an individual who was not on our radar or anyone's radar prior to the event. So we really have a challenging bit of detective work to do here, to kind of put the pieces back together after the fact.""

What is all of this very expensive activity for? It is being undertaken in an attempt to ascertain the causes of the massacre. If you asked the law enforcement agencies why they were doing this, they would regard it as a silly question.

If they bothered to answer it, they probably would say something like, ""Well, as law enforcement agencies, it's our duty to find out the causes of the massacre, so we can try to make sure something like this never happens again"".

Here's how the FBI and all the other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation can save lots and lots of public money.

We already know the causes of the mass murder. There are two causes. First, Stephen Paddock decided to murder as many people as he possibly could by shooting into a crowded concert in Las Vegas.

Second, to carry out this plan, he effortlessly and legally was able to accumulate 47 guns. More than 20 of them were in the hotel suite from which he murdered the people below. There also were thousands of rounds of ammunition in the suite, apparently not including the 10,000 estimated bullets he shot into the crowd.

According to the Times, Mr Paddock had been buying guns since 1982, including 33 in the past year. Twelve of the guns found in his hotel suite were semi-automatic rifles. A gun like this fires every time the trigger is pulled. But several had been fitted with a cheap and legal device, called a 'bump stock', which harnesses a gun's recoil effectively to convert it into a machine gun that fires fast and continuously.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, there was no Federal law requiring a seller of multiple semi-automatic rifles to report the sales to the Bureau, nor to anyone else.

Without the guns, Mr Paddock -- no matter how murderous his intentions -- would not have been able to murder more than a handful of people. With the guns, it was easy to translate his murderous intentions into mass murder.

Let's be clear about something. Guns like the semi-automatic rifles bought by Mr Paddock have only one use: To kill or maim people. Because they originally were military assault weapons, they are particularly good at both. They fire bullets designed to inflict either death or maximum damage on victims' bodies.

Now, if your job was to work out the causes of the massacre, with a view to making sure something like this never happened again, where would you devote your scarce resources?

To piecing together the strange life of an unpredictable man, never 'on anyone's radar', now dead, in the hope of being able to predict how similar but unknown and equally unpredictable people might behave in the future? And to make such predictions in time to prevent their murderous intent being translated into mass murder? That sounds like an almost hopeless quest.

Or, would you focus on the second cause of the massacre, without which it could not have happened, the easy and legal availability of weapons of mass murder? To people outside the United States, the question seems ridiculous. Of course you would devote your resources to dealing with the cause which is obvious and preventable.

There would be no need for deep psychological analysis; there would be no need for speculation about what drove the murderer; there would be no need for analysis of what might drive future murderers to commit mass murder; and there would be no need to try to find ways of trying to prevent future mass murderers from pulling the trigger.

Instead, there would be no need for anything but preventing the second cause of the massacre -- the availability of weapons of mass murder -- from leading to future massacres.

So, will the FBI announce soon that it has uncovered one of the causes of the Las Vegas massacre? And tell us that the cause was unfettered access to weapons of mass murder? And also tell us that all that has to be done to prevent future mass murders is to stop the sale of weapons of mass murder and to make possession of them illegal except by the police and the military?

Sadly and predictably, we all know the answer to this question: The FBI will say no such thing. Instead, politicians such as Republican leader Mitch McConnell will say that it is ""premature"" to talk about gun control because ""we're in the middle of an investigation"" and that his priority was tax reform. (Does he think, perhaps, that the investigation, when concluded, will reveal that guns were not the cause of the massacre?)

And other politicians, such as President Trump, will utter platitudinous nonsense such as:

""Our unity cannot be shattered by evil. Our bonds cannot be broken by violence. And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today -- and always will, forever.""

""Ist das wirklich ein Interview?""

Zwischen hysterischen Lachanfällen stellt Schauspieler Ryan Gosling diese Frage. Denn das Gespräch mit der Journalistin Alison Hammond von der britischen TV-Show ""The Morning"" ist zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits völlig außer Kontrolle geraten.

Eigentlich sollte Gosling zusammen mit seinem Kollegen Harrison Ford Fragen zu ihrem Film ""Blade Runner 2049” beantworten. Doch schon die ersten Sätze von Journalistin Hammond lösen bei den beiden Schauspielern hysterisches Gelächter aus.

""Das ist uns nicht gesagt worden!""

""Trostlos, öde, ein absoluter Albtraum, um ehrlich zu sein - und das sind nur meine Interview-Methoden"", sagt Hammond. ""Aber lassen Sie uns über den Film reden.""

""Mach dich mal locker"", witzelte Harrison. ""Das ist nicht die Einführung, die uns versprochen wurde."" Harrison Ford ist bekannt für seine Scherze in Interviews.

Bei der nächsten Frage öffnet Gosling eine kleine Whiskey-Flasche und schenkt sich etwas Alkohol ein. ""Fühlt sich an, als ob es in diese Richtung geht"", sagt er trocken. Viel ernsthafter wurde es in der Folge tatsächlich nicht.

Was habe er gedacht, als er erfahren habe, dass es einen neuen ""Blade Runner""-Film geben solle, fragt Hammond Ford. ""Na und?"" Harrison Ford war 1982, dem Erscheinungsjahr des ersten ""Blade Runner"", bereits berühmt, den ""Star Wars""-Filmen sei dank. Doch ""Blade Runner"" wurde zu einem Kult-Film - und Ford zum Filmstar.

Das Interview dauert fünf Minuten, immer wieder ist das Gespräch von den Lachern der drei Beteiligten unterbrochen. Mal klaut Ford das Whiskey-Glas von Gosling, dann erzählen beide, wie Ford aus Versehen Gosling beim Dreh ins Gesicht schlug - und irgendwann steht Gosling auf und tut so, als ob er das Interview abbrechen würde.

Viel erfährt der Zuschauer nicht über ""Blade Runner"" in diesen fünf verrückten Minuten. Unterhaltsam ist das Interview aber allemal.

India voted with the US, Saudi Arabia, China and a handful of nations to counter a resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Friday to abolish death penalty, which continues to be enforced by at least six countries for consensual same-sex relations, adultery, blasphemy and apostasy.

The motion was passed nonetheless, with 27 members voting in favour, 13 against, and 7 nations abstaining from the election. The US and India, which are active participants in the war against terror, didn't seem to note the irony in their support for death penalty for LGBTQ people — a move endorsed by their arch-enemy the ISIS in the parts it controls in Syria and Iraq.

India's attitude to the issue, an unnamed lawyer told The Telegraph, didn't necessarily reflect its stand on sexual minorities: the government's refusal to commit itself to opposing the death penalty probably shows its intention of not wanting to meddle in the sovereignty of other nations. Propped by a pernicious logic of diplomacy, such a line of reasoning goes against the first principles of human rights, embraced by so-called civilised nations.

The debate at the UNHRC was structured around the discriminatory application of the death penalty — on members of minority communities, including LGBTQ people, women and minors. As Pink News reported, it called for the abolition of the death penalty ""as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations"", while opposing its use on minors, the mentally-ill and pregnant women. Be that as it may, India's stance should hardly surprise anyone.

India-watchers are already aware of the country's growing fondness for the death penalty. An Amnesty International report recently showed a jump of 81% in the awarding of capital punishment this year, as compared to the last. India gave as many as 136 death sentences in 2016 as compared to 75 in 2015.

It's true that a majority of these rulings will languish for years, awaiting parole. Many of the sentenced may even be dead of natural causes by the time a final call on the judgment is passed. But none of that changes the essential fact that India's judiciary prefers to send dozens of convicted criminals to the gallows, or that such verdicts appease the public's appetite for wild justice. Indians make no bones of the fact that they are often driven by a primal bloodlust by marching on the streets holding placards, asking for the most barbaric form of punishments. Unsurprisingly, at their extreme, such demands assume the form of mob lynching.

In 2013, India's Supreme Court reversed a progressive ruling passed by the Delhi High Court in 2009, to re-instate the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a relic from the colonial rule books, which stipulates punitive measures against anyone engaging in unnatural sex. As sex against the order of nature is a nebulous and could include a range of activities, the law may penalise anyone having sex that doesn't lead to procreation.

The fight to read down this biblical injunction, foisted on India by Britain, which, ironically, now recognises LGBTQ rights, is prolonged and persists till date. Successive governments at the Centre have lacked moral conviction to remove this blight from the world's largest democracy. Shashi Tharoor, currently a member of Parliament from the opposition Congress Party, has tried introducing a private members' bill to root out the anti-LGBTQ legislation. His proposal was shot down by irate colleagues. It's a pity though that the MP didn't raise the issue in the House when his party was in power, rather than functioning as a pitiful excuse for an opposition as it is now.

In spite of its anti-LGBTQ law, the Indian State hasn't really carried out an organised crackdown on sexual minorities in the way, say, the Egyptian government is doing over the past few days, with 57 people being held for ""debauchery"" and ""inciting sexual deviancy"". It's hard to prosecute LGBTQ people using Section 377 and harder still to convict them using any evidence. Yet, the undercurrent of fear and intimidation among queer people in India is omnipresent and very real.

It's hard enough to struggle against a society, where the majority mindset condemns sexual difference. If such contempt is then encouraged by the law, the challenge to exist with dignity and demand equal rights with any other individual amplifies manifold. A report, released earlier this year, revealed a horrific truth of beatings, rape, intimidation and sundry other horrors being visited members of the LGBTQ community — with the police leading the list of abusers. While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is opposed to same-sex relations, it is in favour of granting civil rights to transgender people. Its dithering arises from internalised prejudices, especially those planted by the firebrand ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and a fear of alienating its vote-bank, both among the Hindu and Muslim hardliners.

With such a scenario prevailing over the legal, political and social landscape of the country, it's not hard to see why a majority of the youth oppose homosexuality. Even those, who, on principle, support equal rights for all citizens, and want to be allies of the LGBTQ community, without being sexual minority themselves, are deterred by the discourse of disapproval that infects the mind of the nation as a whole. Yes, India now has a right to privacy, which may be used to safeguard the rights of sexual minorities in future. But until a more fundamental shift happens to the national hunger for violent retribution — against anyone at fault or refusing to subscribe to the mainstream — it would be disingenuous to feign surprise at India's stance at the UNHRC.

J. Calvo: La llamada de los resultados de taquilla y que la gente está interesada de la película y la gente va al cine a verla.
J. Calvo: La llamada de la gente.","Madrid, ocho y poco de la tarde. Los Javis llegan corriendo, justos de tiempo. Como les pasa todos estos días, vienen de algún sitio para saltar rápidamente a otro. No pueden entretenerse demasiado, pero regalan todo el tiempo que su apretada agenda les permite. La terraza de Gran Vía 32, donde se encuentran los estudios de la Cadena Ser, es el marco para ver cómo cae la noche sobre Madrid, su ciudad, donde lleva representándose la obra de teatro que les ha dado la fama, convertida hace pocos días en uno de los estrenos más exitosos y esperados del cine español.

Porque esos Javis, que nada más llegar y dar un par de besos apretados buscan un enchufe como agua en el desierto para cargar sus exhaustos móviles, son Javier Calvo (Madrid, 1991) y Javier Ambrossi (Madrid, 1984), los creadores de La Llamada. Ellos, con el objetivo de darle algo de trabajo a su amiga Belén Cuesta, entonces una actriz parada y desesperada, concibieron una obra de teatro que se representaría en el hall del Teatro Lara de Madrid durante cuatro días. De aquello han pasado cuatro años y 300.000 espectadores.

Calvo y Ambrossi llegan a la entrevista tras pasar por San Sebastián y estrenar la adaptación cinematográfica de la obra (en una multitudinaria premiere en Madrid en la que Ambrossi le pidió matrimonio a Calvo ante cientos de personas), a dos días de irse a presentarla a Japón y cuando les quedan dos semanas para mudarse a Barcelona y entrar a formar parte del profesorado de la nueva academia de Operación Triunfo. Con el cielo de Madrid apagándose a sus espaldas y tras un divertido ""¡En esta terraza me suicidé yo!... En un corto, claro!"", por parte de Javier Calvo —ambos tuvieron una etapa como actores—, comienza la tanda de llamadas, perdón, preguntas. Sus respuestas, rápidas como metralletas y muy compenetradas (tanto que comparten hasta micrófono), no tienen desperdicio.

¿En qué momento de vuestras vidas sentisteis la llamada del cine?

Javier Calvo: Cuando salí de ver Volver del cine con mis padres —yo soy muy pequeño, eh—.

Javier Ambrossi: A mí me marcó mucho Lucía y el sexo, que me la recomendó mi madre en un ataque. Yo era muy pequeño, no era para recomendar a un niño tan pequeño. Pero la llamada real, real, real, fue cuando [el productor de cine] Enrique Lavigne dijo: ""Dirigid vosotros La Llamada"". Y yo fui como ""No, no, no"", y Javi [Calvo] fue como ""Sí, sí, sí"".

Javier Calvo: Venga, lo hacemos y ya vemos [título de una canción de la película y nombre de su productora].

¿Por qué os vino esa llamada de Dios, ese concepto divino?

J. Calvo: Tenía en la cabeza hacer una historia en un campamento de verano, un campamento cristiano en el que surgía el amor entre dos chicas...

J. Ambrossi: ... y a mí siempre me había obsesionado la historia de una conocida de mi hermana cuya familia la había educado en la religión, en el cristianismo, y cuando ella decidió que iba a dejarlo todo para ser monja su familia se entristeció mucho y le pidió que no lo hiciera. Siempre me había obsesionado mucho la idea de la contradicción y el límite, hasta dónde cree uno, cuando llega la hora de la verdad no creemos tanto.

J. Calvo: Y luego queríamos hablar de nuestra llamada al mundo del cine y lo mal que lo habíamos pasado como actores, intentando encajar y no ser nosotros mismos. Todo se tradujo en una llamada de Dios pero al final es una metáfora para hacer lo que nos gusta. Queríamos hacer una comedia costumbrista sobre un campamentito al que de repente viene Dios a ver y la que se forma. Nos parecía una premisa muy divertida.

J. Ambrossi: ¿Pero en la vida real no nos ha llamado Dios, no? De momento, no.

J. Calvo: No. Hoy me ha llamado Mario Vaquerizo. Y Alaska. Que es un poco comparable. [Risas]

Esta peli es una llamada al acción, al optimismo, al buen rollo. ¿Es eso lo que transmite?

J. Ambrossi: Total. Queríamos que fuera un empujón, un abrazo a toda esa gente que está luchando por encontrar su lugar en el mundo y un canto a la libertad, a que cualquier camino es válido y que si tú eres tú mismo vas a encontrarlo.

J. Calvo: Es también lo que cuenta Paquita Salas y toda nuestra obra. ¡Uy, nuestra obra, ni que fuera yo Camilo José Cela! Todas las cosas que hacemos, todas hablan de un poco de eso, de encontrar tu lugar en el mundo, de encontrar el éxito aunque no sea el éxito que tú creías.

Estoy de visita en las oficinas de Netflix. ¡Y como que me llamo Paquita Dalas que me van a ver! Una publicación compartida de Paquita Salas (@paquitasalasps) el 4 de Oct de 2017 a la(s) 1:04 PDT

J. Ambrossi: Queríamos que fuera una fiesta, que transmitiera alegría y que transmitiera sobre todo respeto. Que el respeto sólo se recibe dando respeto. Que parece una tontería pero no. A la gente le gusta, le llega y nos están escribiendo un mensaje por segundo en Instagram, en Twitter... de lo mucho que les gusta, que les toca, pero nosotros no hemos pretendido decirle a nadie lo que tiene que hacer, solo hablábamos de nosotros.

J. Calvo: Hemos conseguido hacer el cine que queríamos, que puede ser un cine con una reflexión profunda sin perder la festividad y soltando las imposturas, que no tiene por qué estar reñido un material que tenga profundidad intelectual y a la vez sea divertido y festivo.

Queríamos que fuera una fiesta, que transmitiera alegría y que transmitiera sobre todo respeto. Que el respeto sólo se recibe dando respeto"". Javier Ambrossi, director y creador de 'La Llamada'

La llamada de Jorge Javier Vázquez, productor de la película, ¿la hicisteis, la recibisteis... cómo fue?

J. Ambrossi: La hizo José Corbacho [también productor de la película]. Le llamó para ver si se quería meter en el proyecto. Pero en realidad la primera llamada de Jorge la recibimos, porque fue a ver La Llamada al teatro y lo dijo en Sálvame Deluxe dijo: ""He ido a ver una obra maravillosa de dos chicos, Javier Calvo, Javier Ambrossi, y me ha encantado, qué talento tienen"".

J. Calvo: Y nos vino muy bien, porque se llenó el teatro el fin de semana siguiente. Es mucho poder de convocatoria.

J. Ambrossi: A raíz de eso se involucró en el proyecto.

¿La llamada del matrimonio en plena sala de cine, esa locura?

J. Calvo: Él me lo ha propuesto, ahora tiene que organizarlo...

J. Ambrossi: Yo quería explicarle a la gente que estaba en el estreno que la peli habla del amor, que está hecha por amor, que todo lo que rodea a este proyecto era por amor y ¡ya!

J. Calvo: Es nuestro próximo proyecto. A ver si en Flooxer o dónde, a ver dónde se emite [risas]

J. Ambrossi: A mí me gustaría hacer una cosa tipo Las Vegas... Algo que nos representara a nosotros.

J. Calvo: ¿Una fiesta, no? Una fiesta.

Llamadas que esperáis o que no esperáis: ¿la de la Academia de Cine?

J. Ambrossi: No, no...

J. Calvo: La espero. Yo la espero, claro que la espero. ¡La quiero! La estoy esperando...

J. Ambrossi: La esperamos pero con muchísima modestia y muchísima humildad, sería un regalazo.

¿La llamada de Hollywood?

J. Calvo: También, también la esperamos.

J. Ambrossi: Esa creo que la peli es tan universal que podría suceder.

J. Calvo: ¡Las dos podrían suceder!

¿Y la llamada de Broadway?

J. Calvo: Esta yo creo que es más difícil por los derechos de Whitney Houston, que ya tiene su propio musical.

J. Ambrossi: Lo veo más complicado, pero creo que la peli podría tener un remake maravilloso con muchas actrices de Hollywood que ya tenemos pensadas

J. Calvo: Se van a hacer mayores...

J. Ambrossi: Y la llamada de los Goya yo no digo que no la quiera, digo que me abruma tanto que prefiero decir que... [lo dejan en el aire entre risas nerviosas]

Entonces, ¿a qué actrices de Hollywood haríais una llamada?

J. Calvo: Yo quería Selena Gómez, Miley Cyrus, Kristen Wiig como Milagros y una Whoopi Goldberg para hacer un homenaje a Sister Act y un Tom Jones de Dios.

J. Ambrossi: Pero yo creo que ya nos hemos quedado mayores...

J. Calvo: Sí, las chicas jóvenes tiene que ser nuevas. Me gusta mucho la de Pitch Perfect [Dando la nota], Hailee Steinfield.

J. Ambrossi: O de Milagros. De Milagros hemos hecho una encuesta en Twitter, esta actriz de Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt que no sé cómo se llama... [Ellie Kemper ]

J. Calvo: Yo quiero que sea Kristen Wiig, que me gusta mucho.

J. Ambrossi: Susana yo me iría por una mundo latino...

J. Calvo: ¡Tu amiga!

J. Ambrossi: Diane, Diane Guerrero, de Orange is the new black. Y canta increíble. Íbamos juntos al clase de interpretación.

J. Calvo: Es que claro, es artista [risas].

J. Ambrossi: Me he hecho cursos [risas].

Arriba, Kristen Wiig y Ellie Kemper, y en la foto grande Hailee Steinfield. Abajo, Whoopi Goldberg y Diane Guerrero.

¿No habéis recibido la llamada de algún actor pidiendo papeles? Porque casi todas vuestras protagonistas son chicas...

J. Calvo: ¡Qué va! Secun de la Rosa, Richard [Collins- Moore], Brays [Efe]...

J. Ambrossi: ¡Pero si sólo hemos hecho una película, una pequeña serie...! Todo está por ver.

J. Calvo: Algún día haremos una de chicos.

J. Ambrossi: Además cada vez me gustan más. Antes estaba separado del mundo de los actores y muy cerca del de las actrices pero últimamente estoy disfrutando mucho de su talento.

¿A quién se le ocurrió hacer la llamada Esty Quesada, la youtuber Soy una pringada?

J. Calvo: A mí. La había visto, no era tan famosa todavía, el año siguiente ya empezó a hacerse famosa pero a mí me gustaba ya de antes. Buscábamos una actriz gordita porque todas estaban muy delgadas y yo no podía soportarlo, tanta delgada. Quería una gorda.

¿Cómo vivisteis la llamada de Operación Triunfo?

J. Calvo: Estábamos en la playa y a Javi le llamó Tinet [Rubira, productor ejecutivo de Gestmusic y responsable de OT]

J. Ambrossi: Me mandó un mensaje privado Tinet Rubira y me dijo que quería hablar con nosotros. Le dije a Javi: ""¿A que nos van a proponer ser profesores de la Academia?"". Y dije, ¡qué barbaridad! Nos llamó y me puse muy nervioso, la verdad, pero me hizo mucha ilusión, la verdad.

J. Calvo: Es que tú siempre has tenido mucha vocación de profesor.

J. Ambrossi: A mí me encanta. Es que he hecho tanto curso, tanta cosa, tanto libro... que me encanta.

¿De quién no dejaríais pasar ESA llamada?

J. Ambrossi: De mucha gente, no sé, alguien así... [Se la piensan] ¡De Letizia Ortiz! [risas]

¿Creéis que habrá visto La Llamada?

J. Calvo: No, no la ha visto. Lo sabríamos.

J. Ambrossi: No, por eso. Le enviamos una carta, a Protocolo, para invitarla. Pero no...

J. Calvo: Pero Protocolo no. No contesta Protocolo. [Risas]

J. Ambrossi: La reina está muy bien. ¿No querrías la llamada de la reina?

J. Calvo: Pues no, me interesan más otras. Ehhh... Es que hemos tenido muchas llamadas que nos interesaban. Por ejemplo, tú has tenido la de Lydia Bosch, que fue...

J. Ambrossi: ¡Uf! Yo tengo unas notas de audio de Lydia Bosch... La adoro.

J. Calvo: Pero yo... ¿de quién espero yo esa llamada? Yo...

J. Ambrossi: ¡No sé chico, pero corta ya!

¿A quién pondríais en espera si os llama?

J. Ambrossi: Yo creo que no somos nosotros muy de hablar mal de nadie ni de decirle a nadie lo que tiene que hacer. Pero hay como un universo político crispado que es como para decir...

J. Calvo: ¡A todo el que esté enfadado! ¡A todo el que esté enfadado!

J. Ambrossi: Que piensen lo que están haciendo. Hay una generación de personas que han creado este mundo que deberían ser responsables, no los jóvenes que están construyendo su pequeño universo. Me encantaría decir: ¿qué es lo que habéis creado? ¿Os estáis dando cuenta?

NEW DELHI-- A woman and her three daughters were found stabbed to death along with their security guard in their house in Mansarovar Park area of Shahdara this morning, the police said.

The deceased have been identified as Urmila Jindal (82), her daughters Sangeeta Gupta (56), Nupur Jindal (48) and Anjali Jindal (38) and their security guard Rakesh (42), the police said. They were found with their neck slit. Their bodies had multiple stab wounds.

Police officials are suspecting that someone known to the victims might have killed them, since, till now, there is no evidence of forced entry into the house.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahadara) Nupur Prasad said that he suspects that the killings could be a fallout of a property dispute.

The police has said that the family owns Jindal Oil Mill in the national capital. According to an Indian Express report, the family had recently sold a plot worth crores which led to a dispute.

However, the police has said that they are investigating the matter from all angles.

— Chris Squirrelpot (@squirrelpot) October 5, 2017","A London bus driver has been filmed in a remarkable altercation with a disabled man trying to board her vehicle.

Chris Stapleton, 60, told HuffPost UK the tirade was so abusive he is going to report it as a hate crime.

He said: “What I was asking for here was that the wheelchair space be cleared, not that I absolutely had to get on the bus but I wanted her to fulfil her obligation to at least ask so I would have a chance.”

Instead the driver gets increasingly irate, culminating with her calling him “ignorant and selfish”.

Pointing to the wheelchair, she adds: “No one put you in there but we must show you pity because of the law.”

Worst thing about being a #wheelchair user? Bus drivers. Note especially the rant starting at 00:51 and resuming at 01:21 pic.twitter.com/LLsC9h60kW — Chris Squirrelpot (@squirrelpot) October 5, 2017

A Supreme Court ruling in January found that although bus drivers could not be legally compelled to remove other passengers to make way for disabled users, they should take steps beyond just a simple request.

This could include rephrasing the request as a requirement or refusing to drive on “with a view to pressurising or shaming the recalcitrant non-wheelchair user to move”.

Stapleton said: “This is not an isolated incident, I’m a member of Transport for All and they get reports of this sort of behaviour all the time.

“Whilst I think her behaviour is appalling, the people ultimately responsible for this are TfL and the bus operators who are not training their staff properly.

“They give out what they call ‘guidance’ but what they should do is issue mandatory instructions with the understanding that if they’re not followed, severe disciplinary action will follow.”

In a statement to HuffPost UK, Claire Mann, TfL’s Director of Bus Operations, said: “We are appalled by this and apologise to our customer. An urgent investigation is underway. We expect the highest standards from bus operators and their drivers and something has clearly gone wrong here.”

“We work hard to ensure that bus operators are regularly reminding their drivers that the priority space is for wheelchair-users.”

Stapleton stopped short of calling for the driver to be sacked but said she should be disciplined and and thoroughly retrained and very closely monitored and if she fails again in this type of situation she should be sacked”.

He also said he was reporting the incident to police as a hate crime as she was “being abusive to me for a reason related to my disability”.

No one else on the bus appears to intervene.

A travers ICAN, cette distinction honore l'ensemble des associations et des acteurs qui œuvrent dans ce sens et elle reconnaît l'importance de leur action pour rendre le monde plus sûr. Cette coalition a permis de rassembler des soutiens du monde entier et de faire prendre conscience à de plus en plus de citoyens du danger que représente l'arme nucléaire et de la nécessité urgente de les éliminer. Ce prix vient couronner une campagne internationale qui s'est concrétisée en juillet dernier à l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies par l'adoption d'un traité d'interdiction de l'arme atomique par 122 pays.

Notre association agit également pour mobiliser citoyens, associations, médias et politiques sur un sujet dont la gravité est encore trop souvent ignorée. Elle est enfin force de propositions concrètes sur tous les aspects du désarmement nucléaire. IDN ne réclame pas un désarmement unilatéral, inconditionnel et immédiat, mais un désarmement multilatéral négocié, progressif et contrôlé.

Notre action est soutenue par d'importantes personnalités françaises [1] et, au niveau international, par d'éminentes personnalités [2] .

Loin d'être les naïfs irresponsables, si souvent caricaturés par les tenants du lobby militaro-industriel, si bien décrit par l'ancien Président des Etats-Unis, le général Eisenhower, ils ont forgé leur conviction par leur exercice de responsabilités majeures.

Si ce prix Nobel honore ICAN International ainsi que celles et ceux qui agissent dans le même sens, c'est également un cruel désaveu pour les pays qui, comme la France, pratiquent la politique de l'autruche. Notre pays semble oublier qu'il est signataire du Traité de Non-Prolifération, dont l'article VI stipule qu'il ""s'engage à poursuivre de bonne foi des négociations sur des mesures efficaces relatives à la cessation de la course aux armements nucléaires à une date rapprochée et au désarmement nucléaire, et sur un traité de désarmement général et complet sous un contrôle international strict et efficace"".

Ce traité de désarmement, 122 pays ont décidé de l'adopter cette année, ce qui permettra vraisemblablement son entrée en vigueur dès 2018, pour les cinquante ans du Traité de Non-Prolifération. Malheureusement, ni la France, ni aucune des huit autres puissances nucléaires n'a daigné participer aux discussions à l'ONU pour un monde enfin débarrassé des armes atomiques, et s'emmure dans un déni coupable sur le danger de son armement nucléaire. Cette distinction est donc une condamnation de l'inaction des puissances nucléaires qui préfèrent l'apparent confort de l'immobilisme et la fausse impression de sécurité à la prise en compte de la réalité de la menace et à l'audace du changement.

Comme l'a justement rappelé la présidente du Comité Nobel, ""nous vivons dans un monde où le risque que les armes nucléaires soient utilisées est plus élevé qu'il ne l'a jamais été depuis longtemps"". L'actualité et sa succession de déclarations irresponsables au sujet de la Corée du Nord ou de l'Iran nous interpellent sur l'urgence du désarmement nucléaire, alors que certains Etats parlent de ces armes comme d'une solution et non d'un problème. Car non seulement la possession d'armes nucléaires est incapable de répondre aux défis de la sécurité internationale à venir, qui ne ressembleront pas aux conflits de la Guerre froide, mais elle favorise la prolifération nucléaire. Comment ne pas être étonné par exemple lorsque l'on entend le même discours à Washington, à Paris et à Pyong Yang sur le nucléaire ""garantie ultime de la sécurité du pays""!

Alors que la responsabilité qu'impose la détention d'un arsenal nucléaire exigerait que la France entame dès maintenant des négociations sérieuses avec les autres puissances nucléaires à propos du désarmement, notre pays refuse de voir la réalité soulignée récemment par deux tiers des Etats représentés à l'ONU. Cette réalité, c'est que les armes aujourd'hui considérées comme positives et efficaces pour dissuader toute attaque ennemie, sont en réalité un danger pour l'humanité. La France, qui pourrait jouer un rôle diplomatique actif et être le porte-drapeau du désarmement nucléaire, traite pourtant avec mépris cette coalition d'Etats qui ont compris les enjeux de la paix du XXIe siècle.

Contrairement aux engagements auxquels elle a souscrit en signant le TNP, la France n'a pas entrepris d'avancées significatives vers le désarmement depuis l'arrêt des essais nucléaires il y a vingt ans de cela. Profitant d'un désintérêt de l'opinion publique et des médias français savamment entretenu, les responsables politiques, à de trop rares exceptions, refusent de couper les amarres avec le monde ancien. Pire, on se prépare à ""moderniser"" notre arsenal nucléaire en doublant les crédits qui lui sont affectés La reconnaissance internationale accordée par ce prix Nobel est une invitation à ouvrir un débat qui demeure toujours interdit dans notre pays sur la pertinence et l'avenir des armes nucléaires.

Cheryl's Best 'X Factor' Moments","Well, one of the worst-kept secrets in ‘X Factor’ history has officially been confirmed, with Cheryl Tweedy having posed with Simon Cowell as she makes her return to Judges’ Houses.

As was reported earlier in the series, Cheryl will be helping the music mogul whittle down his remaining acts down at the final stage of the competition before live shows, after two years away from the show.

While we’re sure Cheryl’s fans will be excited to see back on the show that helped catapult her to national treasure status, one person who won’t be impressed is ‘So Macho’ singer, Sinitta.

Earlier this year, she announced that she’d be back as Simon’s right-hand woman at Judges’ Houses, only to eventually be ditched in favour of Cheryl.

Sinitta recently fumed: “I will always love Simon. He is like a father figure meets brother figure and ex-lover figure to me, and of course my mentor for over three decades - but right now he can kiss my black ass.”

Ken McKay/TalkbackThames/REX/Shutterstock That's a bit more like it

Cheryl first joined the show almost a decade ago in 2008, when she was still a member of girl group Girls Aloud, until eventually stepping down in 2011, after she and Simon fell out when he sacked her from the US version of the show.

In 2014, she and Simon buried the hatchet, and she spent two more series as a judge, until eventually bidding farewell for a second time, claiming she wanted to focus more on her career as a singer, rather than a TV talent show judge.

Actresses including Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan are reported to have been harassed by Weinstein, as well as a number of industry professionals, from production assistants to college students.

After the Times published the piece, Ontario-based writer Anne T. Donahue tweeted to her 39,000 followers asking about when they met their “Harvey Weinstein” ― or when they were first harassed by an older man in the workplace ― before sharing her own story.

Donahue told HuffPost that after reading the Times report, she “was angry and also not surprised.”

“I don’t think I know a single woman who hasn’t been sexually harassed during the course of her life, especially at work or in school, which is terrible and awful and exhausting,” she continued. “So I did what I usually do when I’m angry ― I tweeted about it.”

Donahue said that considering how angry the report made her, she figured other women might have the same reaction and want a space to tell their stories as well.

“That’s the thing about this shit: it’s happened to so many of us,” she said. “And it makes us feel weak and powerless and worthless and full of self-doubt and completely alone ... so now I’m talking about it, and figured maybe a few other women would want to talk about what’s happened to them, too.”

She was right.

Since she posted the tweet on Thursday afternoon, Donahue has received hundreds of responses.

In UPA-1, HRD minister Arjun Singh had managed to push OBC reservations on prestigious central educational institutions.","ADVERTISEMENT

The President of India has notified a commission to explore the idea of OBC sub-categorisation. It's an idea long overdue, and one that is sure to pay off rich dividends for the Bhartiya Janata Party in the 2019 general elections.

Sub-categorisation will divide the OBCs into two groups: the more affluent ones and the less affluent ones.

Currently, the more affluent OBC communities are better placed at taking advantage of the 27% reservation for OBCs in central government jobs and educational institutions.

Dividing this 27% pie into two will mean that the less affluent OBC communities – such as, say, Teli, the prime minister's caste – will be able to get somewhat more seats in jobs and colleges. It will also mean that the number of seats taken by the more affluent communities, such as, say, Yadavs, will reduce.

Sub-categorisation will divide the OBCs into two groups: the more affluent ones and the less affluent ones.

The political impact of such a move will be obvious. The lower OBCs will be thrilled and are likely to vote for the BJP for many elections to come. In short, it is the ultimate 'surgical strike'.

The upper OBCs, however, will be unhappy with the BJP and this may reflect in their choices before the electronic voting machines, but that's fine for the party. You can't please all, but lower OBCs are a very large chunk of the population – around 35% of the population in Uttar Pradesh for instance.

This is in keeping with the big picture of how the BJP has been positioning itself. In many state elections, the BJP campaign has sought to marginalize and polarise against the dominant OBC or upper caste community. In Uttar Pradesh, it can not just an anti-Muslim but also anti-Yadav campaign. BJP leaders accused the incumbent Samajwadi Party government of benefitting 'only one caste and one religion' through its schemes.

The lower OBCs will be thrilled and are likely to vote for the BJP for many elections to come.

Similarly, the BJP has alienated Jats in Haryana, Patels in Gujarat and Marathas in Maharashtra – all upper caste peasant communities that have been demanding inclusion in the OBC list. Their agitations for reservations are proof of how politically potent an issue reservations are even today.

Reservations remain a powerful political tool because they affect government jobs. In absence of a manufacturing growth, India's jobless growth keeps alive the politics of reservations. Government jobs are as prized as they ever were. They give communities access to power and privilege.

The move is also in keeping with the Modi-Shah duo's broad intention of rebranding the BJP as a party of the poor, rather than a Brahmin-Baniya party. Its upper caste core, as well as its Hindutva ideology, mean that the party can have limited success with Dalits. Dominant OBC communities tend to be better mobilized by regional satraps. Wooing them also alienates the large but disparate chunk of lower OBCs. The lower OBC – such as a Teli selling tea for a living – is the bull's eye of the target audience of the new BJP.

India's jobless growth keeps alive the politics of reservations.

Before every state election, governments add new communities to some OBC list or the other – the states have their own lists for reservations. That OBC sub-categorisation works politically is proven by the 9 states that have already done it: West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Bihar and Haryana. And the union territory of Puducherry too.

Sub-categorisation of the central OBC list is an idea that has been long overdue. It would have been politically beneficial for the Manmohan Singh-led UPA to do so, but they didn't. In UPA-1, HRD minister Arjun Singh had managed to push OBC reservations on prestigious central educational institutions. He died in 2011, by which time the UPA had forgotten how to do the right thing politically.

It's unthinkable for the Yadav-dominated Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh to have hurt Yadav chances at jobs and college seats through OBC quota. But why did Mayawati never do it? Caste politics rules in UP as much as in Bihar. Nitish Kumar's main instrument in creating long-term space for himself in Bihar politics has been OBC sub-categorisation.

That this has so far not been done in UP, or at the central level, are political gaps waiting to be exploited. The Modi government's intention to do OBC sub-categorisation of the central list could soon be replicated in Uttar Pradesh.

Des plongeurs les ont retrouvés vendredi dans la baie de Køge, à une cinquantaine de km au sud de Copenhague, a précisé aux journalistes l'inspecteur de la police de Copenhague, Jens Moller Jensen.

""La nuit dernière, notre dentiste légiste a confirmé qu'il s'agissait de la tête de Kim Wall"", a-t-il déclaré.

Selon lui, un premier sac a été retrouvé contenant les vêtements de la reporter âgée de 30 ans. ""Dans le même sac, il y avait un couteau et des tuyaux en plomb pour lester le sac"", a-t-il expliqué. Les deux jambes ont ensuite été découvertes ainsi qu'""une tête qui se trouvait également dans un sac, lequel était également lesté de multiples pièces de métal"".

L'inspecteur Jensen a ajouté que la police poursuivrait ses recherches pour retrouver ses bras.

Auparavant, le tronc de Kim Wall, dont les membres et la tête avaient été délibérément sectionnés et qui était aussi lesté de métal, avait été découvert par un cycliste en baie de Køge le 21 août, onze jours après la disparition de la jeune journaliste.

'Aucun signe de fracture'

L'inspecteur Jensen a souligné qu'il n'y avait ""aucun signe de fracture sur le crâne ni aucun signe d'autre violence brutale sur le crâne"".

Détenu depuis le 11 août et inculpé de meurtre et atteinte à l'intégrité d'un cadavre Peter Madsen, 46 ans et marié, se dit innocent malgré un large faisceau d'indices à charge.

Le 10 août, il avait embarqué Kim Wall à bord du sous-marin UC3 Nautilus, un submersible qu'il a conçu et construit. La journaliste indépendante souhaitait faire le portrait de cet ingénieur autodidacte obsédé par la conquête des mers et de l'espace.

Après avoir assuré l'avoir débarquée à sa demande en soirée du même jour non loin de Copenhague, il a ensuite affirmé qu'elle avait succombé à un accident à bord et que, pris de panique, il avait jeté son corps à la mer.

Selon cette version, il était monté sur le pont, retenant la porte de l'écoutille d'accès à la tourelle dans laquelle se trouvait Kim Wall. Glissant brutalement, il avait lâché prise et le panneau de 70 kilos était retombé sur la tête de la jeune femme qui avait lourdement chuté.

Le corps de la journaliste était intact selon lui lorsqu'il l'avait passé par-dessus bord.

L'accusation soutient que M. Madsen a tué Kim Wall afin de satisfaire un fantasme sexuel, puis démembré et mutilé son corps.

L'autopsie du torse n'avait pas permis d'établir les causes de la mort. Elle avait en revanche mis en évidence de multiples mutilations infligées aux parties génitales de la victime.

Films de femmes décapitées

Des films ""fétichistes"" dans lesquels des femmes ""réelles"" étaient torturées, décapitées et brûlées ont été retrouvés sur un disque dur dans son atelier, avait annoncé mardi le parquet danois.

""Ce disque dur ne m'appartient pas"", a rétorqué Peter Madsen, laissant entendre que de nombreuses personnes avaient accès à son atelier.

Il a assuré qu'il n'y avait eu aucune relation sexuelle entre eux et que leurs contacts avaient été purement professionnels.

Le 11 août, M. Madsen avait été secouru dans le détroit de l'Öresund, entre Danemark et Suède, alors que sombrait son sous-marin, volontairement sabordé par lui selon les autorités danoises. La journaliste avait disparu.

M. Madsen avait d'abord été inculpé le 12 août d'""homicide involontaire par négligence"" avant de voir le chef d'inculpation requalifié le 5 septembre en meurtre et atteinte à l'intégrité d'un cadavre.

La police a également indiqué qu'elle réexaminait l'affaire non résolue d'une touriste japonaise dont le corps mutilé avait été découvert dans un port de Copenhague en 1986, pour vérifier si elle pouvait avoir un lien avec l'affaire Kim Wall.

Les jambes de Kazuko Toyonaga, 22 ans, avaient été découvertes dans un sac en plastique flottant dans les eaux.

Caroline Lucas said May’s disastrous party conference speech must have been “an excruciating experience”, but that her resignation - being called for by a number of Conservative MPs, led by former party chairman Grant Shapps - would fail to address any problems.

Speaking to HuffPost UK ahead of the Greens’ annual conference, which kicks off this weekend, Lucas said: “On a personal level my heart goes out to her, in the sense that it was clearly an excruciating experience that you wouldn’t wish on anybody. Having said that, the real disaster of that speech was not the prime minister’s cough, but more what was in the speech and a complete failure to address the overwhelmingly important issues of the day.

“On housing, for example, the idea that an extra five thousand council houses a year is really going to go anywhere towards addressing the absolute housing crisis that we face is just for the birds and a demonstration of just how out of touch the Tories are.

Empics Entertainment Theresa May struggles through her conference speech

“The content of the speech was what was so incredibly disheartening - the lack of vision and the lack of any kind of understanding about what people want to hear.

“They are well aware that they face a problem, that they need to be attracting more young people to their cause, and yet what they were offering was just so insignificant and unhelpful, it’s really hard to see what they were thinking.”

Lucas, who is co-leader of her own party, said changing the leadership of the Conservative party would do nothing to address “this absolute Brexit catastrophe at its heart”.

“Whoever takes over from Theresa is still going to have that same challenge,” she added.

“They have obviously got a completely split parliamentary party on the issue, they can’t keep the same line more than a couple of days and the negotiations themselves seem to be going incredibly badly.

“When you’ve got the CBI themselves saying to the Conservative Party ‘pull yourselves together, you’re incompetent and incoherent’, that surely demonstrates just what an abysmal state the party is in, so changing leader isn’t going to help them.”

Empics Entertainment The Greens want a 'ratification referendum' on Brexit

The Greens have long been pushing for a ‘ratification referendum’ on Brexit - a second chance for voters to decide whether they really want Britain to leave the EU once exit negotiations are complete.

Lucas said she hoped MPs from other parties who were concerned about the Brexit process would back her proposal for a second vote.

“We need to banish any ideas of this extreme Brexit, that no deal is better than a bad deal, all of this empty rhetoric that does not bear any scrutiny, because it’s quite clear that no deal would be an asbolute disaster for the economy,” she said.

“Get rid of that and look very seriously at the proposals for remaining inside the single market and maintaining freedom of movement.

“One way that both parties [Labour and Conservatives] could square the circle of the dilemma they have at the moment in terms of split views is to support the Green proposal for a ratification referendum.

“The process was started by the British people, who voted [Leave] by a narrow majority, and it feels to me that it should go back to them to have the final sign-off.

“If they like what they see, fine, but if they don’t, and if on balance they would prefer to remain inside the EU now they are equipped with an awful lot more information than they had when they voted to leave, then they should have the final say.”

PA Archive/PA Images Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley

Lucas, who job shares her leadership position with former Parliamentary hopeful Jonathan Bartley, said she hoped the hung parliament produced as a result of the 2017 election would afford her more chances to work with rival MPs.

“One positive thing I have discovered about Westminster is that contrary to some of the appearances, it is possible to work cross-party on a case-by-case basis.

“You can make headway on different issues and that obviously is crucial, because none of the opposition parties on their own are going to be enough - so we need to work together.”

The Greens have so far enjoyed a surprisingly civil working relationship with environment secretary Michael Gove, who since returning to the cabinet has pledged to champion a number of environmental issues, including animal welfare, air quality and tackling climate change.

“To his credit he does appear to want to make his mark on this department which is good, because recently we have had ministers who didn’t seem to care very much about the brief they have been given,” Lucas said.

“He is a big beast and he wants to make his mark, and as long as he is doing that in a positive way, then that’s great.

Leon Neal via Getty Images Caroline Lucas says environment secretary Michael Gove is a 'big beast'

“That does not wipe clean his own voting record in this area - which has been far from positive - and there are plenty of challenges in terms of how he is going to square this new found environmental zeal with the fact the government is continuing to promote fracking and nuclear energy and airport expansion and HS2 and road-building and all of those other things.

“On the one hand, the idea that Gove is turning the Conservative Party into the real Green Party is genuinely laughable, but on the other hand, if we do now have somebody in that department who for whatever reason, whether they believe in it or not, is willing to be more positive and engage more seriously with these issues then that’s good, but the jury is out to see which way it goes.”

She said the Green conference, which is being held in Harrogate, Yorkshire, will focus on Brexit and its impact on the environment as its main theme.

Bartley will be in the spotlight as he delivers the leaders’ speech on Monday, and among policy motions to be voted on are proposals for a new bank holiday to celebrate “the contribution of migrants and people of colour” and enabling Parliamentary candidates to remain in place up to 18 months after a general election without being subjected to a new selection process.

If you start running the same distance every day you'll increase your base level of fitness, but you'll plateau after a while. from www.shutterstock.com.au

Many of us exercise on a regular basis, and we become comfortable with the same exercise routine. But is your standard routine leading to a plateau in fitness gains? Once the body becomes used to running a few kilometres each day, is it basically the same as doing no exercise?

One of the most beautiful things about the human body is its resilience and its ability to adapt to physical demands like exercise training. Our bones, muscles, tendons, heart, and lungs, will adapt to the stress exposed to it. This means if you undertake exercise that's physically challenging, your body will adapt to this stress to ensure the same activity feels slightly easier in the future.

This mechanism of adaptation is both a blessing and a curse. The adage ""if you don't use it, you'll lose it"" can be applied here. If you've ever been bedridden due to a major illness, or gone into hibernation over the winter, you'll be familiar with the dramatic loss of fitness associated with reduced exposure to physical stress (exercise training).

But, do we lose gains from exercise as our bodies get used to it? If we keep on with the same exercise regime, we'll maintain the current gains in fitness, but further gains will diminish and we'll eventually reach a plateau. These adaptive responses are called the ""training effect"".

from www.shutterstock.com

The training effect can only occur when adequate stimulus (exercise stress) is applied to the body, and sufficient recovery is allowed. Muscle is a great example. Many adaptations occur, but from a mechanical perspective, small micro-tears in the muscle are experienced when you lift a heavier weight than you normally would. Immediately after training, your body gets to work to heal the ""damage"" and rebuilds the muscle so it's strong enough to more easily cope with those demands in the future.

Progressively increasing load and adding variation are two important progression strategies to help ensure fitness gains are realised. Progressive overload refers to frequent yet small increases in stress. If stress is increased too rapidly or with insufficient rest, you can risk overtraining and injury. So, what's the solution to preventing a plateau in fitness?

Increase your intensity

When walking around the local lake for the first time a few months ago, you may have noticed your breathing was rapid but you could carry on a conversation (moderate intensity) or very rapid breathing where talking was more difficult (vigorous intensity). But now, you can walk the same route without a noticeable change in your breathing (light intensity). These are important cues to show that you're now fitter.

If the time it takes you to do the same route remains the same, you are no longer applying the same stress (moderate or vigorous intensity exercise). Intensity is important. To move beyond a plateau, you will need to walk or jog faster, take a slightly more undulating course, or introduce regular short bouts of higher intensity work (run for thirty seconds or so every few minutes) so you're exercising at a moderate to vigorous intensity.

Train for longer

Your endurance performance can be influenced by the amount of time you spend completing your desired activity. You might decide that one of your cycling, running or rowing sessions each week becomes a slightly longer one. Increasing all of your endurance workouts during the week is not recommended, as you might overdo it and injure yourself.

It's advised to increase your running distance by no more than 10% and certainly no more than 30% per week to move beyond a plateau without increasing the risk of injury.

Exercise more often

Increasing how often you train each week can help to move beyond a plateau in your fitness.

For example, increasing the total amount of weight lifted each week (total weekly volume) in the gym should translate to increased strength and muscle size.

Change the order of your exercises

Most of us are limited for time and cram both aerobic and resistance exercise into the same session, but this might cause an interference effect, resulting in smaller gains in muscle strength or size. Some strategies to reduce this effect is to separate most of your aerobic (running, cycling, rowing, swimming) exercise from your resistance training sessions by at least six hours. Alternatively, you can limit combined aerobic and resistance exercise sessions to three or fewer bouts per week.

Preventing a plateau can be tricky, but listen carefully and your body will give you clues along the way. Be mindful that sleep, good nutrition, flexibility, and recovery days are just as important for progressing your fitness as the most challenging session you do in the gym or on the road this week.

La famille Mausling d'Aurora, au Colorado, a participé à une visite guidée sur les esprits à l'hôtel Stanley à Estes Park le mois passé. Après leur retour à la maison, ils ont remarqué une photo prise par John ''Jay'' Mausling qui semble montrer une jeune fille descendre les marches.

John Mausling et sa femme, Jessica Martinez-Mausling, ont expliqué au HuffPost par courriel qu'il n'y avait pas de jeunes filles dans leur visite guidée de 11 personnes.

«Au début, on a essayé d'être logiques et on pensait qu'on l'avait peut-être manquée, donc on a demandé à nos enfants, à leurs copines et à notre ami s'ils se souvenaient d'avoir vu une petite fille», ont-ils écrit. «Personne ne s'en souvenait. On ne se souvient pas d'avoir vu quoi que ce soit sur les escaliers au moment de prendre la photo.»

Voici un gros plan de la figure mystérieuse sur les escaliers:

Ben Hansen, ancien agent du FBI et animateur de Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files a dit qu'une analyse attentive de la photo ne montre aucun signe de trucage.

«J'aime vraiment cette photo», a avoué Hansen. «Supposant qu'elle n'est pas falsifiée, c'est une des meilleures photos d'évidence paranormale que j'ai vue. Si elle est fausse, je dois admettre leur niveau de détail et de créativité parce qu'il y a assez de signes faciles d'habitude qui suggèrent qu'on se fait jouer un tour.»

Et si c'est la fille fantôme qui se démarque le plus, la photo pourrait présenter une deuxième apparition.

Les Mausling ont dit qu'au moment où la photo a été prise, il y avait seulement deux personnes sur les escaliers: la guide de la visite, et quelqu'un d'autre avec un téléphone cellulaire. Cependant, l'image montre ce qui pourrait être une troisième figure qui semble monter les marches.

Hansen dit qu'il a supposé que cette silhouette était seulement une autre personne qui monte les marches, avec le même flou de mouvement entourant d'autres gens dans l'image. Il a ensuite remarqué quelque chose d'autre.

«À travers la rampe et les barreaux, vous pouvez voir la moitié de la personne et ses souliers... mais je ne peux pas voir la moitié de la silhouette», dit-il.

Hansen a ajouté qu'il n'y a pas de test décisif pour une photo de fantômes, donc c'est impossible d'être certain de qu'il y a dans la photo. Les Mausling, quant à eux, disent qu'ils ne croient pas nécessairement aux fantômes, mais qu'ils sont ouverts d'esprit et qu'ils n'ont pas écarté la possibilité qu'ils peuvent exister.

Si l'hôtel Stanley est une destination de choix pour les gens qui veulent visiter le parc national Rocky Mountain à proximité, c'est aussi un endroit de prédilection pour ceux qui veulent vivre une expérience d'un autre monde. L'année dernière, une photo d'un supposé fantôme à l'hôtel a fait les manchettes autour du monde. La photo a été prise au même endroit.

By golly! I think I may have captured a #ghost at #StanleyHotel. #EstesPark Une publication partagée par Henry Yau (@ares415) le 12 Avril 2016 à 7h33 PDT

Après un séjour à l'hôtel en 1974, King l'a appelé «le cadre parfait — peut-être l'archétype — pour une histoire de fantômes.» King a écrit sur son site web officiel que lui et sa femme, l'auteure Tabitha King, étaient les seuls invités quand l'hôtel allait fermer pour l'hiver.

«Cette nuit-là, j'ai rêvé que mon fils de trois ans courrait à travers les corridors, regardait derrière ses épaules, les yeux grands ouverts, et criait. Il était chassé par un tuyau d'incendie. Je me suis réveillé avec une secousse, en sueur, à un pouce de tomber du lit. Je me suis levé, j'ai allumé une cigarette et je me suis assis dans une chaise en face des montagnes. Avant que la cigarette ne se termine, j'avais la structure du livre dans ma tête.»

Ce rêve est devenu le troisième livre de King, The Shining, sorti en 1977, dont l'action avait lieu dans l'hôtel hanté Overlook. En 2014, le livre a été nommé le troisième meilleur livre de tous les temps dans un sondage Rolling Stone.

Today (Oct 6th) marks World Cerebral Palsy day and I hope by raising awareness of this condition, we can help prepare new parents should their child be diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy.","The day before our 12 week scan I remember a friend clearly saying ""at least you'll know it doesn't have Down syndrome tomorrow"" and my baby didn't. We 'passed' that test with flying colours, nope no down syndrome here.

But it never occurred to us that our baby might still be born with a disability.

I was 37 weeks pregnant when I noticed the baby had stopped moving. Back then (2009) midwives were advising that if your baby stopped moving it probably wasn't anything to worry about and that eating some chocolate or having a hot drink would probably wake up the baby.

So that's what I did. I ate chocolate, drank tea and didn't panic. Turns out maybe I should have.

William was born at 7.25pm that day via emergency c-section. But during the time he had stopped moving, he had suffered from a lack of oxygen which had led to severe brain damage and a condition we were later told was called Cerebral Palsy (CP).

William was diagnosed with brain damage when he was 4 days old

Until we were given that diagnosis we'd never even heard the term and hearing it that day was terrifying.

But we aren't alone. In the UK, it is estimated that one in 400 babies have a type of cerebral palsy. Figures indicate that with the birth rate in excess of 700,000 per year there may be as many as 1,800 new cases of CP in children each year source

I wonder whether we would have been more able to cope with the diagnosis of cerebral palsy had we been aware of its existence? Would it have been easier if we'd had a small understanding of what might lay ahead for William, and for us as his parents?

Conditions which can be diagnosed prior to birth can be researched so that parents can ready themselves and be a little more prepared to deal with the consequences when their baby arrives.



But if, like us, your baby's disability is caused at the end of the pregnancy or during birth then it's likely you are not prepared for it at all, especially if you've never even heard of the condition.

I don't want to panic expectant mothers or give them even more to worry about during their pregnancy, but I do feel it is important that this condition is discussed more openly because as Robyn Cummins, World CP Day Manager explains,

""Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood and is also one of the least understood. There are over 17 million people living with CP and 350 million family, friends and supporters who care about them.""

Perhaps if I had been aware of it then I might have taken William's reduced movements more seriously? Had I been aware of this condition when I was pregnant, although it still would have been devastating to hear the diagnosis, maybe it wouldn't have been so terrifying to think about the future.

I may have known a little more about what to expect for my baby. Not knowing what lies ahead can be terrifying. All you want to know is what might happen, how you'll deal with it, and who will help you through it.

What is cerebral palsy?

Cerebral Palsy is a complex, lifelong disability. It primarily affects movement, but people with CP may also have visual, learning, hearing, speech, epilepsy and intellectual impairments. It can be mild - a weakness in one hand - to severe - where people have little control over movements or speech and may need 24-hour assistance.

William's CP is at the severe end of the scale, GMFCS V, so his whole body is affected. He cannot sit or stand, he cannot use his hands and is non-verbal. All of this sounds terrible, and I know the very thought of your baby being as disabled as William, is terrifying.

That is why it is always important to balance the statistics, medical and physical issues with the daily reality and the positives.

William needs 24/7 care, but he loves being with people, whether they are children or 'grown-ups'. If you're (not) expecting a child with cerebral palsy you won't be expecting the feelings of relief, comfort and happiness when you see them build relationships with adults who want to help them as much as you do.

William cannot stand or sit unaided but he has support from an incredible NHS team who provide him with specialist equipment so he can sit comfortably and is able to stand up to play. If you're (not) expecting a child with cerebral palsy you won't realise how much you will come to rely on the NHS and how hard people will work to make sure your child is comfortable and able to participate in daily life.

If you aren't expecting a child with cerebral palsy then you probably won't be expecting incredible moments like this

William cannot use words to communicate, but he can vocalise and tries really hard to express himself. If you're (not) expecting a child with cerebral palsy you won't be expecting the overwhelming joy of hearing them laugh or responding to an ""I love you"" with a squeal.

William faces daily challenges but despite that he is one of the happiest children you could ever meet. He smiles all day, laughs at the silliest things and loves to watch the world. If you're (not) expecting a child with cerebral palsy you won't be expecting life to be good, your child to be happy and people to want to spend time with them.

He might not be able to do things in the same way that other children his age can but that doesn't mean that he doesn't live a full and active life. He cycles a bike, swims and even horse-rides at his incredible school. In fact, the main thing that holds him back isn't even his disability, it's the world around him not being adapted to cater for it.

As a family, of course it has changed our lives. Having a child with a disability means we don't do the same things other families do. But sometimes I am actually grateful for that! I don't have to stand in the cold watching a football game on a Sunday morning and I don't have to do the school run in the rain!

Having a child with CP is difficult, I won't lie and people often assume that I would want to 'cure' William if I could. But the truth is that no, I wouldn't change him for the world. Of course, if there was a 'cure' then I would do it for him, if I thought that was what he would want, but no, not for me.



To me he is perfect just the way he is.

L'installation d'une crèche de Noël ""par une personne publique dans un emplacement public (...) méconnaît le principe de neutralité en l'absence de caractère culturel, artistique ou festif"", souligne dans un communiqué le tribunal, saisi par la Ligue française pour la défense des droits de l'homme et du citoyen et la Fédération de la Libre pensée et d'action sociale du Rhône.

Après avoir rappelé les dispositions constitutionnelles relatives à la neutralité des personnes publiques à l'égard des cultes, le tribunal, reprenant les conditions définies par le Conseil d'Etat, précise qu'une telle installation ""n'est légalement possible que lorsqu'elle présente un caractère culturel, artistique ou festif sans exprimer la reconnaissance d'un culte et ne marque aucune préférence religieuse"".

""Un caprice"" et ""une provocation à la laïcité"" de Laurent Wauquiez

Le tribunal considère qu'en l'espèce, l'installation ne présentait pas un caractère culturel, artistique ou festif. Il souligne notamment que ""la fabrication de santons par des artisans locaux ne suffit pas à démontrer le caractère artistique"" et qu'aucune crèche n'a jamais été installée dans les locaux du siège lyonnais de la région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

""La Région va évidemment faire appel de cette décision. Le tribunal administratif a manifestement confondu le culturel et le cultuel"", a indiqué à l'AFP le cabinet de Laurent Wauquiez.

Installée le 14 décembre 2016 dans le hall d'entrée du siège de la région, la crèche avait suscité l'émoi de nombreux conseillers régionaux de gauche, dont les élus du PRG, qui avaient été les premiers à réagir évoquant ""un caprice"" et ""une provocation à la laïcité"" de Laurent Wauquiez.

Le département de la Vendée aura sa crèche, lui

Au même moment, la cour administrative d'appel de Nantes a autorisé ce vendredi le département de la Vendée à installer temporairement une crèche de Noël dans ses locaux, estimant qu'elle résultait d'un ""usage local"" qui n'était pas contraire au principe de laïcité, a-t-on appris de sources judiciaires.

Les juges administratifs ont ainsi annulé le jugement rendu le 14 novembre 2014 par le tribunal administratif de Nantes, qui avait interdit cette crèche au nom du principe de la laïcité contenu dans la loi de 1905 sur la séparation de l'Église et de l'État, selon l'arrêt dont l'AFP a eu copie. La cour de Nantes avait déjà annulé une première fois ce jugement, le 13 octobre 2015, et autorisé cette crèche de la Nativité, mais l'affaire avait été portée devant le Conseil d'État, qui lui avait demandé en novembre dernier de revoir sa copie.

Appliquant les critères du Conseil d'État, les juges nantais ont estimé ""que l'installation temporaire d'une crèche de Noël dans l'hôtel du département de la Vendée résulte, compte tenu des caractéristiques de la crèche et de ses conditions d'utilisation, d'un usage culturel local et d'une tradition festive de plus de 20 ans constituant des circonstances particulières"", écrit la cour dans un communiqué.*

La crèche litigieuse est, ""depuis décembre 1990, installée chaque année, durant la période de Noël, dans le hall de l'hôtel du département de la Vendée, soit depuis plus de 20 ans à la date de la décision contestée"", soulignent notamment les juges dans l'arrêt rendu vendredi.

La ""crèche de trois mètres sur deux"" est par ailleurs ""située dans un hall d'une superficie de 1.000 m2 ouvert à tous les publics et accueillant, notamment, les manifestations et célébrations laïques liées à la fête de Noël, en particulier l'Arbre de Noël des enfants des personnels départementaux et celui des enfants de la DDASS"", est-il également justifié.

Russland-Experte Boris Reitschuster schreibt ihm zu seinem Ehrentag einen Brief - mit 10 ungewöhnlichen Geburtstagswünschen

Lieber Wladimir Wladimirowitsch,

ich kenne Sie seit mehr als anderthalb Jahrzehnten persönlich; noch länger verfolge ich Ihr Wirken, habe mehrere Bücher darüber geschrieben.

Zu Ihrem heutigen 65. Geburtstag möchte ich Ihnen diese 10 Wünsche mit auf den Weg geben:

1. Dass Sie den Kontakt zur Realität wiederfinden

Macht macht selbst in demokratischen Ländern einsam. Absolute Macht, wie Sie sie haben, koppelt einen von der Wirklichkeit ab.

In Ihrer Umgebung traut sich niemand mehr, Ihnen unangenehme Wahrheiten zu sagen.

Etwa, dass Ihr Auftritt als Sänger und Pianist vor laufenden Kameras nur peinlich war.

Sie erklären Ihren Vertrauten morgens die Welt, die erklären die Welt dann genau so den Chefredakteuren – und abends sehen Sie im Fernsehen genau die Welt, die Sie am Morgen selbst entworfen haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie die Stärke finden, kritische Stimmen nicht mehr zu unterdrücken.

Das wäre zumindest ein erster Schritt.

Für eine grundlegende Rückkehr zur Realität, die ich Ihnen von Herzen wünsche, wäre allerdings die Erfüllung meines zweiten Wunsches notwendig.

Mit 65 Jahren sind sie bereits fünf Jahre über dem Renteneintrittsalter von russischen Männern, und auch wenn Sie Deutscher wären, dürften Sie jetzt bald mit dem Arbeiten aufhören.

2. Ich wünsche Ihnen: Gehen Sie in den Ruhestand

Fast 18 Jahre lange ein und dieselbe Arbeit zu machen, ist auch für weniger qualifizierte Jobs wie Arzt oder Professor ein langer Zeitraum; 18 Jahre an der Spitze Russlands ist für sie als Regierender sicher ebenso ermüdend wie für die Regierten.

Sie haben einmal gesagt, sie würden so hart arbeiten wie ein Sklave auf einer Galeere. Wählen Sie die Freiheit, schmeißen sie ihr Ruder weg!

Sie legen damit nicht nur die Einsamkeit der Macht ab.

Sie lassen immer verbreiten: Russland ist umzingelt, und meinen damit die NATO. In Wirklichkeit sind Sie umzingelt. Von Schönrednern und Claqueuren.

Befreien Sie sich!

3. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie endlich Ihre KGB-Brille ablegen können

Sie haben beim Geheimdienst gelernt, die Welt klar in Schwarz und Weiß zu teilen, in Freund und Feind.

KGB-Offiziere im mittleren Dienst wie Sie wurden darauf abgerichtet, überall Verschwörungen und Verrat, Provokationen und Angriffe zu wittern.

Viele Ihrer weltgewandteren Kameraden haben das abgelegt.

Ihre Politik zeigt, dass Sie bis heute in diesem Denken verfangen sind.

Die russischen Medien, die Sie steuern, lassen den Menschen ständig eintrichtern, die NATO plane einen Überfall auf Russland.

Ich fürchte, dass Sie selbst inzwischen daran glauben. An Ihre eigene Propaganda.

Wenn man überall Verrat, Provokation und Aggression wittert, muss das Leben eine Hölle sein.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie sich aus dieser Hölle befreien.

Russland ist nicht von Feinden umzingelt.

Die NATO plant keinen Angriff auf Ihr Land.

Wir wollen Partnerschaft mit Russland – nur tun wir uns schwer damit, solange Sie Nachbarländer überfallen und Ihre Kritiker gewaltsam ums Leben kommen.

4. Ich wünsche Ihnen ehrliche und freie Wahlen

Niemand zweifelt daran, dass Sie im Frühjahr zum vierten Mal zum russischen Präsident gewählt werden, mit einem überwältigenden Ergebnis.

Jeder, der Russland auch nur halbwegs kennt, ist sich bewusst, dass diese Wahlen massiv manipuliert werden.

Weil Sie Ihre Gegner gar nicht zur Wahl zulassen, sie in den Medien mit Schmutz bewerfen, statt sie zu Wort kommen zu lassen, weil Sie in und um die Wahllokale massiv und dreist betrügen.

So ein Wahlsieg muss so befriedigend sein wie ein Boxkampf, in dem der Sieger seinen Gegner vorab knebeln und auf den Boden fesseln lässt.

Ich wünsche Ihnen den Mut, eine echte Wahl zuzulassen.

Sie würden dann erfahren, was die Menschen wirklich von Ihnen denken.

Und egal, wie die Wahl ausgeht - sie könnten in jedem Fall stolz sein: Auf einen Sieg, der er ehrlich wäre. Und sogar auf eine Niederlage könnten sie stolz sein, weil Sie die Größe gehabt hätten, diese zu riskieren.

5. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie keine Angst mehr haben vor Ihren politischen Konkurrenten

Gerade hat ein Moskauer Gericht wieder in einem peinlichen Schauprozess Ihren bekanntesten Kritiker, Alexej Nawalnij, für 20 Tage einsperren lassen.

Zum wiederholten Male.

Selbst Ihre Marionette Dmitrij Medwedew hat, als er pro forma für Sie Präsident war, zugegeben, dass in Russland""Telefonjustiz"" herrscht – also Gerichtsurteile per Telefon von ganz oben an die Richter diktiert werden.

Es ist deshalb klar, dass auch Sie für das Urteil gegen Nawalnij Verantwortung tragen. Ebenso dafür, dass sein Bruder, der drei kleine Kinder hat, seit Jahren unschuldig in Haft sitzt – de facto als Geisel.

Sehr viele Menschen sitzen in Russland im Straflager, weil Sie gegen Sie sind.

Wer seine Gegner wegsperren lässt, muss große Angst haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie diese Angst besiegen.

Nicht nur Ihre Gegner werden dann frei sein – auch Sie werden sich freier fühlen.

6. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie im 21. Jahrhundert ankommen. Oder zumindest im 17. Jahrhundert

Ihr politisches Denken ist nicht mal in den Zeiten Bismarcks verhaftet – die Grundlagen für die Souveränität von Nationalstaaten wurden bereits 1648 mit dem Westfälischen Frieden gelegt.

Sie hingegen glauben immer noch, dass Russlands Nachbarländer wie kleine Kinder nicht ganz erwachsen sind und Sie über deren Schicksal mitbestimmen müssen.

Sie sind deshalb in diesen Ländern verhasst wie kaum ein anderer Politiker.

Lassen Sie diese Länder in Ruhe.

Akzeptieren Sie, dass nicht Sie, sondern die Menschen in diesen Ländern selbst über ihre Leben und ihr Schicksal entscheiden dürfen.

Ich zweifle, ob die Menschen dort wirklich dankbar sein werden, wenn Sie sie endlich in Ruhe lassen – dafür haben sie zu viel Angst dort ausgelöst, und zu viele Menschen sind gestorben.

Aber zumindest der Hass gegen Sie würde nachlassen.

Und weniger gehasst zu werden, sollte befreiend wirken.

7. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie Ihre Sowjetnostalgie ablegen. Sie ist schlecht für Sie und für Ihr Land

Sie haben den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion als die größte geopolitische Tragödie des 21. Jahrhunderts bezeichnet.

Unter Ihnen ist es in Russland zu einer Stalin-Nostalgie gekommen. Der grausame Massenmörder wird heute wieder gefeiert. Sie lassen Seine Verbrechen relativieren und seine angeblichen Verdienste preisen.

Sie stehen in der sowjetischen Denk-Tradition, wonach der Staat alles und der Mensch nichts ist.

Solange Russland diese Denkweise nicht ablegt, solange Stalin verehrt wird, hat Russland keine Zukunft. So treten Sie und Ihr großartiges Land immer wieder auf die alten Mistgabeln.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie verstehen, dass Russlands Zukunft nicht darin besteht, dass die Nachbarländer es fürchten.

Russland hat eine große Zukunft, wenn die Nachbarn es beneiden.

Wenn die Menschen nicht auf Russlands Bedrohungspotential stolz sind, sondern Stolz sein könnten auf eine funktionierende Gesundheitsversorgung, auf würdige Renten, funktionierende Gesetze und eine erfolgreiche Bekämpfung von Korruption und Willkür.

8. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie in die Geschichtsbücher nicht nur als Krieger eingehen

Sie sind für den Krieg in der Ostukraine verantwortlich, der mehr als 10.000 Menschen das Leben kostete und noch heute fast täglich Opfer fordert.

Die Truppen von Ihnen und Ihrem Verbündeten Assad haben massive Kriegsverbrechen in Syrien begangen.

Sie tragen die politische Verantwortung für den Abschuss des Fluges MH-17 über der Ostukraine mit fast 300 Toten und für die Ermordung des Ex-KGB-Agenten Alexander Litwinenko in London 2006 mit radioaktivem Polonium, wie niederländische Ermittler und ein britischer Richter feststellten.

Die Liste ließe sich lange fortsetzen.

Machen Sie sich ein Geburtstagsgeschenk, indem sie den blutigen Krieg in der Ukraine beenden. Sie müssen dazu nur die Grenzen dichtmachen und aufhören, aus Russland Waffen und Geld an Ihre Befehlsempfänger zu liefern, die Sie als ""pro-russische Rebellen"" ausgeben.

Vielleicht haben Sie Angst, dass Frieden statt Krieg zu beginnen Sie schwächer dastehen lässt.

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie das verstehen.

9. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie nicht nur als Spitze der russischen Korruptions-Pyramide in die Geschichte eingehen – sondern als jemand, der auch einen Teil seines Geldes zurückgibt

Sie müssen ja nicht gleich Robin Hood sein.

Enge Vertraute von Ihnen brachten es auf dubiose Weise zu unvorstellbaren Milliardenvermögen, seit Sie an der Macht sind.

Ihre Kritiker bezeichnen Sie als reichsten Mann der Welt, weil sie sagen, dass Sie auf dieses Geld Zugriff haben.

Geben ist seliger als Nehmen, sagt ein deutsches Sprichwort.

In Russland leben Millionen Menschen in bitterer Armut; viele können sich nicht vollwertig satt essen, vielen fehlt das Geld für dringend benötigte Operationen.

Sagen Sie Ihren Freunden, dass Sie – als Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie, statt Yachten und goldenen Toiletten für Ihre Flugzeuge – zumindest einen Teil Ihrer Milliarden den Menschen in Russland zurückgeben sollen.

Die Dankbarkeit der Menschen wird ein schönes Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie werden.

10. Ich wünsche Ihnen echte Freunde

Nicht solche wie Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder, deren angebliche Freundschaft mit Ihnen einen schalen Beigeschmack hat, weil er von Ihnen – über den Umweg Ihrer Konzerne – Unsummen an Geld verdient.

Genauso wie so viele Ihrer anderen Kumpels, die zu Milliardären wurden, beruhen solche Beziehungen auf Abhängigkeiten – und nicht auf Freundschaft.

Ich wünsche Ihnen Menschen, die kein Geld von Ihnen wollen, keine Macht, keine Posten – sondern die Sie um Ihrer selbst willen wollen.

Chelmsford MP Vicky Ford told the BBC Shapps was “completely out of touch” with the vast majority of MPs and Tory members.
— Michael Fabricant (@Mike_Fabricant) October 6, 2017Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who ran in last year’s leadership contest, said May should remain prime minister “as long as she wants”.
“The prime minister’s been doing a fantastic job.
She can decide she’s had enough and quit this autumn...but history suggests that party leaders, let alone prime ministers, rarely jump before they are pushed — David Cameron was the recent exception.","Theresa May today refused to stand down despite mounting pressure, claiming it is business as usual.

The embattled prime minister told reporters at an event in her Maidenhead constituency: “What the country needs is calm leadership and that is what I am providing, with the full support of my cabinet.”

May’s defiant message comes after Tory chairman Grant Shapps revealed on Friday morning he was leading a plot to oust her.

Shapps said he was one of five former Cabinet ministers among more than 30 Tory MPs who were “perfectly within their rights” to ask May to quit, and said she should “take responsibility” for calling the snap general election and losing her Commons majority.

“We did have a result that was not at all what anyone wanted, least of all what she wanted or anticipated, and... sometimes when things happen you have to take responsibility for them,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Shapps later told Radio Four’s Today Programme that Number 10 had known for a while he was leading the rebels and phoned him before the conference, “pleading” with him not to say anything.

He also said he had only stepped forward because the party whips briefed The Times that he was leading the rebellion, and that he wanted to oust the prime minister by applying private pressure to “avoid embarrassment”.

“I’m very sorry the whips have not made that possible,” he said.

Shapps added that May’s disastrous conference speech meant that “some colleagues feel it would be better to have that leadership election sooner or rather later”.

“There’s nothing wrong or illegitimate in saying we can do better than this,” he said.

A raft of Cabinet ministers and senior backbenchers came forward to defend May after her speech on Wednesday, which was marred by a persistent cough, a prank protest and a collapsing backdrop.

Despite the rearguard action, one MP texted the Government Chief Whip on Thursday evening to say May “needs to go and go now”, HuffPost UK revealed.

And on Friday Sky News revealed the PM had postponed a planned trip to China because Beijing had decided to “prioritise a visit from President Trump”.

But making clear she intended to pursue business as usual, May said she had “had a cold all week”, and planned to update Parliament next week on progress since her Brexit speech in Florence and plans announced in her address to conference to introduce an energy price cap.

The intervention, made from a fundraising event in Kent on Friday, could mean rebels will now face a longer fight to depose her.

In order to trigger an official confidence vote through the party’s 1922 Committee of backbenchers, 48 MPs would need to formally say she should stand down.

And while he would not give an exact figure on those who were backing his intervention, Shapps admitted it was less than the number needed.

Chelmsford MP Vicky Ford told the BBC Shapps was “completely out of touch” with the vast majority of MPs and Tory members.

“Furthermore, I do not think it’s what the public want. They want us to get on with the job...stick together and act as a team,” she added.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who ran in last year’s leadership contest, said May should remain prime minister “as long as she wants”.

“The prime minister’s been doing a fantastic job. She showed an amazing degree of resilience and courage this week,” he said on Friday morning.

“The truth is that the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs, the entirety of the Cabinet, the overwhelming majority of people want the prime minister to concentrate on doing the job which 14 million people elected her to do.

“It would be disrespectful to those people to do anything other than concentrate on those areas where action is necessary.”

Events which could now force the PM’s hand include mass cabinet resignations - after her claim she has their full suppport - and longer term, poor performances for Conservative candidates in next year’s local elections.

PA Wire/PA Images George Osborne says the clock is ticking on May'd departure

Evening Standard editor and former chanceller George Osborne effectively used his paper’s editorial to claim the “clock is ticking” on May’s departure and that her best option was to set her own timetable.

“Behind it all lies the simple fact: Mrs May called an election four months ago to increase her majority and her authority, and instead she lost both,” it read.

“Almost everyone in the cabinet and the parliamentary party agrees she cannot possibly fight the next election. That makes her position much weaker than either John Major’s or Gordon Brown’s.

“Bluntly, there are three possible futures Mrs May now faces. She can decide she’s had enough and quit this autumn...but history suggests that party leaders, let alone prime ministers, rarely jump before they are pushed — David Cameron was the recent exception.

“The second possible future is the one unfolding now: a bloody series of attempted coups, protestations of loyalty and bitter recriminations that ultimately leads to her exit.",Theresa May Refuses To Quit: 'I Am Providing Calm Leadership',http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/06/theresa-may-refuses-to-quit-it-is-business-as-usual_n_18201044.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.","There have been fresh warnings that Brexit could lead to British farming and food standards being lowered if meat from the United States is allowed to flood UK supermarkets.

The claims, which have been backed by passionate animal welfare advocate and former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson, come amid a conference this week of international agriculture and livestock experts in London.

Experts have said that Brexit could see a race to the bottom for Britain’s food quality in the interests of completing free trade deals with countries like the United States, and that food safety standards faced “serious risks” if the UK failed to adopt EU-style rules.

This follows previous warnings that rules around hormone-injected meat, chlorinated chicken, milk containing antibiotics and genetically modified vegetables could be weakened after the country severs ties with the European Union, which currently offers protections against such products.

EMPICS Entertainment Stanley Johnson warns that Brexit could force UK farmers to lower standards to compete with US market.

Johnson, who also revealed he now backs his son Boris on Brexit, told HuffPost UK it would be easy for Britain to go down the mass production route seen in the US.

“Just how animal friendly are some of these intensive rearing techniques... which result in cattle never getting out of the feed lot at all? I would be worried that, once we’re out of the EU, people will say ‘ok we can get American beef’.

“I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life, where you have got thousands and thousands of animals packed in,” he told HuffPost UK.

I’m worried about importing quantities of beef which we know for a fact come from establishments where these animals simply don’t have a decent life Stanley Johnson

Johnson added that cheap meat from the US could also lead to farmers in the UK being forced to compete with food giants across the Atlantic: “I would be very worried that, as a result of letting that happen we then have increasing pressure in this country, because of competition reasons, to say ‘we must do that ourselves now, go down this mass production route’.”

International trade secretary Liam Fox has repeatedly talked up the benefits of free trade deals with countries such as the US and Canada after the UK leaves the EU.

But there was outrage in Britain this summer after it was revealed that chlorine-washed chicken, which is legal in the US, could enter the UK food chain in order to facilitate a trade deal with Washington.

Fox slammed the media for being “obsessed” with the issue after he was challenged to eat chlorine-washed chicken to show he was comfortable with the product entering the UK food market.

PA Wire/PA Images The practice of washing chicken in chlorine, common in the US but banned in the UK under EU regulations, has sparked concern.

Under current EU regulations, poultry meat which is rinsed in chlorine is banned, but after the UK leaves the EU it will be up to the government whether a ban stays in place.

Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University in London, has previously warned that Brexit could see a race to the bottom in terms of food quality.

He told the Compassion in World Farming’s Extinction and Livestock international conference on Friday: “We in Britain are currently away with the fairies, because of Brexit we are throwing everything into the air like children throwing toys out of the pram.

“Beware, intellectually and in principle we might get improvements from it (Brexit), but the likelihood of that is very low, because at the moment the food culture in Britain is based around price. The schemes to go for ever cheaper food will triumph over higher values.”

Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at City, University of London

In a University of Sussex report co-authored by Lang in July, experts warned there were “serious risks that standards for food safety will decline if the UK ceases to adopt EU safety rules and instead accepts free-trade agreements with countries with significantly weaker standards”.

In addition to weaker standards in countries like China, the report also identified the US, warning: “Under the Trump administration US standards are likely to decline sharply.”

It continues: “Brexit campaigners ignored the inbuilt reliance the UK has on pan-European institutions, to which we contribute. A vast array of institutions and scientific infrastructure keeps UK food fit to eat.

“Brexit campaigners did not inform consumers/voters that US agribusiness is salivating at the prospect of selling foods which have weaker standards, nor that foods derived on world markets use standards which are weaker than the EU’s and those of the USA.”

Examples of food practices used in the US, which are currently banned in the EU: Hormones Many beef producers in the US use implants of synthetic hormones under the skin of their beef cattle in order to promote growth, requiring the animals to need less food but still grow at a fast pace. The US says meat from hormone-treated cattle is safe, but the EU disagrees, citing the posed risks to vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and people with weak immune systems. Bovine somatotropin in dairy cows In the US, many dairy cows are injected regularly with a synthetic hormone called bovine growth hormone (BGH). In the UK and the EU the hormone is called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST). The growth hormone is used to to increase milk yield but it can cause mastitis in cattle, which is an inflammation of the udder that derives from a bacterial infection. This can lead to more antibiotics being given to the cows. The EU’s Scientific Committee on Animal Health found that the practice led to “very significantly poorer welfare because of increased foot disorders, mastitis, reproductive disorders and other production related diseases”. GM crops and animals More varieties of GM crops are allowed to be produced and sold in the US than in the EU. GM foods are not currently grown commercially in the UK, but they can be imported. In the EU, if a food contains or consists of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or contains ingredients produced from GMOs, this must be indicated on the label. In the US there is no mandatory labelling requirement. Chlorinated chicken Poultry dipped in chlorinated disinfectant hit the headlines in the UK this summer. In the USA, in an attempt to combat problems of microbiological contamination of poultry meat, manufacturers are required to dip the meat in disinfectant, which most commonly is a chlorine-based product. The practice is not lawful in the EU or the UK and in the US poultry meat is not labelled as having been dipped in disinfectant.

According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, more than 99% of farm animals in the US are raised in factory farms.

Speaking about factory farming, which can see tens of thousands of animals crammed into one warehouse, Johnson said: “I wouldn’t want that to come back on the agenda merely because the Americans are able to sell their stuff over here”.

He also warned about UK policies possibly being swayed by US food giants in the future.

“Never underestimate the political influence of the big agricultural business ... they will ... take whatever advantages they find they can take.”

As part of the EU Withdrawal Bill, all existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law after March 2019.

This means there is unlikely to be an immediate impact on much of Britain’s industries, including farming, straight after leaving the EU.

Karl Falkenberg, a former adviser to president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, served as deputy director general for trade in Brussels for five years before becoming director general for environment between 2009 and 2015.

He told HuffPost that the EU’s extensive food product legislation has been heavily criticised by the US in the past: “In the United States GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) are common practice, hormone addition in producing meat is absolutely normal practice.

“We have decided that these are things that we don’t want to have in the European Union and therefore we have legislation that protects this.

“But when you leave the European Union, again you become free to modify those conditions, if you so want.”

That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union

Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers Union, claimed last month that free trade was a “myth” as so many countries subsidise their agricultural sectors.

“That isn’t a level playing field, that isn’t an equal opportunity, that is the economics of the madhouse that will lead to us simply sucking in foods from other parts of the world produced to different standards.

“We don’t think that’s a very sensible scenario for anyone to just sign up to some ideological idea that free trade actually exists where I don’t think it does.” If the UK’s food safety standards do not meet the EU’s requirements, then exports from the UK to the European bloc would also be affected.

However, if the UK increases its food standards to a point that exceeds European Union guidelines, then it would be up to the EU to meet those requirements if it wants to sell to the British market.

Extinction and Livestock Karl Falkenberg speaking at Compassion in World Farming's Extinction and Livestock Conference.

Yet both Falkenberg and Johnson admit that animal welfare and farming practices aren’t always at the top of politicians’ agendas.

Environment secretary Michael Gove told a party conference fringe meeting he was aware of concerns and was committed to ensuring animal welfare standards in the UK do not slip after Brexit.

The Tory minister said: “Outside the European Union’s single market, we can improve animal welfare, supporting more humane methods of farming and restricting the live export of animals.”

And while Johnson praised Gove’s goal to restrict live animal exports, he said Theresa May’s government isn’t doing enough about sustainable farming.

The Government said that maintaining safety and public confidence in food available in the UK “is of the highest priority”.

A spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost UK: “Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses, and consumers.

“Any new products wishing to enter the UK market must comply with our rigorous legislation and standards – we will not compromise on animal welfare and food safety.”

Unlike his son, who was one of the main driving forces behind the Leave campaign, the Johnson was a staunch Remain supporter.

In the run-up to the European Referendum last year, the 77-year-old founded and co-chaired Environmentalists for Europe.

He said: “My position in the run up to the referendum I said let’s stay in.. because the gain is not only the gain in animal welfare in Britain but is the gain in terms of animal welfare throughout Europe as a whole.

“I think this whole question of chlorinate chicken, for example, was an issue… I mean certainly if you look at the way chickens are raised in the United States you do have to say to yourself, ‘look, come on, are we really talking about humane treatment of animals?’.”

Das Internet kann ein ziemlich mieser Ort sein. Vor einiger Zeit verbreitete sich ein Bild von Molly Lensing und ihrer Tochter im Internet und wurde wild diskutiert.

Ein fremder Mann hatte die junge Mutter am Flughafen in Colorado fotografiert, als Lensing und ihre damals zwei Monate alte Tochter Anastasia auf dem Rückweg von einem Familienbesuch waren.

Lensing sitzt wartend in der Halle und blickt auf ihr Smartphone, vor ihr auf dem Boden liegt ihr Baby auf einer Decke. Der Mann stellte das Bild bei Facebook ein und schrieb dazu: ""Ich fürchte mich vor dem Tag, an dem die Technologie über die Menschlichkeit triumphieren wird. Auf der Welt wird es nur noch eine Generation aus Idioten geben. - Albert Einstein.""

Es dauerte nicht lange, bis die Internet-User schonungslos ihre Meinung zu dem Bild kundtaten. Sie verurteilten die Mutter und kritisierten, Lensing habe wohl mehr Interesse an ihrem Smartphone als an ihrem eigenen Kind.

Lensing war geschockt, wie sehr ihre Privatsphäre verletzte wurde

Weil das Bild sich so schnell verbreitete, dauerte es nicht lange, bis Lensing das Bild selbst entdeckte - und geschockt war, wie sehr ihre Privatsphäre verletzt worden war.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Schwangere wurde aus einem Restaurant geworfen - wegen ihres T-Shirts

Dass alle sie verurteilten, obwohl niemand wusste, in welcher Situation das Bild entstanden war, verletzte sie zutiefst.

Nun hatte sie das Bedürfnis, die Geschichte hinter dem Bild mit der Öffentlichkeit zu teilen. ""Wir hatten das Pech, am Flughafen festzusitzen, weil es an diesem Tag einen Systemabsturz gab"", sagte Lensing gegenüber ""TODAY Parents"", einem Format des Nachrichtensenders NBC.

(Im Video: ""Ich schämte mich für meine lauten Kinder - dann sagte ein Kindertherapeut diese 5 Worte zu mir""; der Text geht darunter weiter)





""Ich habe Anastasia mehrere Stunden im Arm gehalten und in ihrem Babyträger getragen""

Ihre Flüge hätten Verspätung gehabt und sie sei zusätzlich noch mehrfach umgebucht worden, sodass sie über 20 Stunden an verschiedenen Flughäfen habe warten müssen, sagte sie - und das mit einem zwei Monate altem Kind.

""Ich habe Anastasia mehrere Stunden im Arm gehalten und in ihrem Babyträger getragen"", erzählte Lensing. ""Meine Arme waren müde und sie musste sich ausstrecken. Und ich musste meiner Familie mitteilen, wo ich bin - sie hatten sich schon gefragt, wo wir bleiben.""

Ein Fremder Mann respektierte nicht ihre Privatsphäre

All das schien den fremden Mann nicht zu interessieren, der sie ohne ihre Erlaubnis fotografierte - und er machte sich auch nicht die Mühe, sie zu fragen. Er sah sie und verurteilte sie auf der Stelle.

Lensing hatte kurz zuvor bei einem neuen Arbeitgeber als Kinderkrankenschwester angefangen.

""Ich hatte solche Angst, dass meine Mitarbeiter oder mein Chef dieses Bild und die Kommentare sehen und dann vielleicht denken, ich sollte nicht mehr mit Kindern arbeiten"", sagte sie ""TODAY Parents"". ""Aber zum Glück ist das nie passiert.""

Lensing bekam Unterstützung von anderen Müttern

Bei all der Kritik bekam Lensing aber von Anfang an auch viel Unterstützung von anderen Müttern. Mary Katherine Backstrom, Bloggerin bei Mom Babble setzte sofort einen Kommentar unter das Bild, in dem sie Lensing in Schutz nahm.

""Nein, einfach nein"", schrieb Backstrom. ""Man sollte keine Fotos von erschöpften Müttern am Flughafen machen - und sie dann auch noch in der Öffentlichkeit bloßstellen. Das ist widerlich und muss aufhören.""

Backstrom ist selbst Mutter und kennt diese Situation sehr gut: ""Mein Flug hatte auch schon mal Verspätung, ich hatte kein einziges Mal meine Augen zugetan und ich hatte Angst, dass mein Baby vielleicht aus meinen Armen fallen würde, wenn ich weg döse"", schreibt sie.

A traumatic event features exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or a sexual violation.""","Horrific events like the mass shooting in Las Vegas and the devastating hurricanes in Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico don't just cause distress the moment they're happening. The effects linger on ― sometimes for months or years in the aftermath.

It's important to be aware of all the signs and know what to do when they pop up. Trauma can be a complex mental health issue. Some people may have mild symptoms, while others may deal with more severe problems that interfere with their everyday life.

We chatted with a few experts on what everyone should know about trauma following a tragedy. Whether you were directly involved in a recent event or know someone else who was affected, it's critical to be armed with information on what to look for and how to deal with it. The support could help more than you know.

Check out some warning signs and tips below:

Trauma comes with a range of emotions.

A person impacted by a horrific event may not just feel scared or sad. There are other feelings associated with the mental health issue as well, according to David Austern, a clinical instructor of psychiatry and NYU Langone Health.

""People may feel intense unpleasant emotions like fear, anger, or guilt,"" Austern told HuffPost. ""They may find themselves thinking about the event when they don't want to and nightmares about the event may impact their sleep. They may feel more unsafe and may want to avoid situations that make them feel uncomfortable.""

Each person has a different way of coping.

""Some people may want to seek support while others may prefer to cope on their own. Research has shown that forcing people to talk about traumatic events can be more harmful than helpful,"" Austern explained.

However, if symptoms like restlessness or severe moods persist for a few months, Austern says it's best to seek help from a professional. It could be a sign a longer-term mental health condition, like post-traumatic stress disorder, is at play.

Victims aren't the only ones who suffer following tragedies.

First responders are also susceptible to mental health complications in the aftermath of a horrific event. It's critical for firefighters, police officers, EMTs and other emergency workers to look after their psychological wellbeing (and for loved ones to keep tabs, too).

""The occupational hazard of [first responders] is going directly into harm's way both physically and emotionally,"" Jeffrey Lieberman, chair of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, told HuffPost. ""The intensity and gravity of these events is such that it can have a lasting effect if not managed properly. And it's in the same way soldiers in combat experience the emotional effects of war.""

Know that what you're feeling isn't wrong.

Mental health issues are just as valid and real as physical health issues. Feeling residual effects from a tragedy is absolutely understandable and is nothing to be shamed, according to Charles Figley, a professor at Tulane University's Traumatology Institute.

""It is a set of normal reactions to an abnormal event or series of events,"" he said.

There's a distinction between upsetting events and tragic ones.

""A traumatic event differs from other types of stressful or upsetting events,"" Austern said. ""Because we often use the word 'traumatic' colloquially it can blur this distinction. A traumatic event features exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or a sexual violation.""

Horrible events, like losing a loved one to a fatal illness, can certainly take a toll on a person's mental health, but they're not technically classified as a trauma, he added.

Treatment is available if things become too much to handle.

There should be absolutely no fear or shame in seeking help, Austern stressed. If you're dealing with trauma ― or you have a loved one who is dealing with it ― it's vital to utilize mental health resources like the Crisis Text Line or a therapist to get necessary support.

""Perceived stigma can be a barrier to people receiving treatment so as a society we need to remember that these symptoms are not signs of weakness,"" Austern said. ""Rather, it takes strength and courage to seek help.""

You can recover from trauma.

It's possible to get back to a healthy place, whether it's through getting treatment, receiving support from friends and family, allowing time to pass or a combination of all three.

""Often people experience post-traumatic growth and are stronger and more resilient in the long run due to the lessons learned,"" Figley said. ""Don't be afraid.""",This Is What Everyone Should Know About Trauma,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/07/this-is-what-everyone-should-know-about-trauma_a_23236215/

We saw it — Mélanie Joly spewed some pre-baked controversial statements last Sunday on Tout le monde en parle regarding Canadians' concerns about paying taxes on the new Netflix deal while weakening our cultural Canadian sovereignty. They became fodder for the media, who were at times demagogic, even almost trolling, creating a big show of smoke and mirrors hiding what's truly at stake: the reproduction of our creativity, of the future of our Canadian culture.

If you take the time to closely read her cultural policies, you'll understand that Mélanie Joly takes our culture and our Canadian identity to heart.

First of all, Mélanie Joly did not give a tax break to an American giant: the American giants, having no physical place of business here, are not subject to our tax laws concerning digital services. The taxation is not in Mélanie Joly's court and that's a whole other issue. This situation would need to be dealt with in an overall manner by the tax legislation and not piecemeal through an amicable agreement between Canadian Heritage and Netflix. The minister's mistake was that she didn't say ""that's not in my court"" and she didn't show up with Bill Morneau at Tout le monde en parle to explain that part of it... But, well, she's learning politics the hard way, I guess.

This week's collective hysteria hides what's fundamentally at stake: putting the brakes on Internet providers' gluttony for the benefit of our cultural creations, the future of our culture.

Then, apart from the negotiations between Canadian Heritage and Netflix, nothing keeps the Canadian government from revising the Statutes and Regulations of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), something that the minister intends to do, according to her recent speech that you can hear again with this link. Then, our Canadian culture, in a digital environment, could be privileged over the American or other countries' culture.

But, taking into account that Netflix's $500-million investment will surely create work for artisans on Canadian soil, the CRTC reform could likely dictate Netflix's decisions on which scenarios its productions should concentrate on, so that they end up on its Canadian landing page. What's the use in producing content if you can't showcase it?

If you listened to Mélanie Joly's speech, and read closely her proposed framework, the CRTC's Statutes and Regulations reform has yet to happen; the NAFTA needs to be renegotiated, while conserving our vital ""cultural exception"" that lets us exercise cultural protectionism and not become more Americanized. Especially since the Copyright Act and the (very, very very slow) Copyright Board of Canada also need to be reformed, specifically to ensure fair remuneration for the use of commercial and non-commercial cultural digital content.

This week's collective hysteria hides what's fundamentally at stake: putting the brakes on Internet providers' gluttony for the benefit of our cultural creations, the future of our culture. And to those who believe that a mandatory royalty fee paid by the Internet service provider to the cultural community is in fact a hidden tax passed on to consumers, here's what I have to say to them on the matter, shamelessly, and for their education, above all.

Taxing my Internet... one more tax?

Regarding cultural consumption in the pre-Internet era, various players cashed in on the more-or-less fair value: retailer, distributor, producer, label, publisher, etc. What was left went to the artist, the creator.

Today, the artist creates, the producer produces, the distributor represents and aggregates the contents in volume, distributes them and delivers them through the Internet service provider (the ""ISP"") to a digital service platform (the ""DSP"") like Netflix or Spotify. The consumer also goes through his or her ISP to connect to such platforms. The majority of the zeroes and ones the consumer uses is linked to cultural content like music, videos, movies and TV series. And the digital service platforms take their content from the distributors like the ISP. The ISP is everywhere. But, seriously, everywhere! It's THE almighty middleman.

A sign is pictured outside a Rogers Communications retail store in Ottawa, July 20, 2017.

The ISPs, like Rogers, Bell, Estlink, Shaw, Cogego, Videotron, Telus, CIK Telecom, TekSavvy, Xplornet and many others, are now monetizing a part of our cultural content's value in a disproportionate way compared to streaming and sales platforms and even more compared to producers and creators who end up with only minute crumbs.

A concept that already exists...

For history's sake, the Canadian Media Fund came to be in 1995 (known then as the Cable Production Fund). Its purpose was to enable those who delivered cultural content from the creator/producers/distributor to the broadcaster/viewer to contribute to the creation of new content.

This gave way to creating and producing our very own cultural content, regardless of our low demographics. When we were but a few warriors facing a cultural conqueror, the fund was in a way our secret weapon to stand up to the Americans. If not, we would have been reduced to watching film and TV adaptations from our neighbours.

Maybe we'll finally see, sooner than later, the rich and hungry ISPs share a small portion of their huge cake with the starving and out-of-breath creative industry?

The arrival of the Cable Production Fund may have increased what we were charged for our few TV channels by Cogeco or Videotron, but it doesn't change the fact that it guaranteed the survival of our creativity, our cultural regeneration.

In short, if you agree with such a logic (that you've been paying for for quite some time), I ask myself why this wouldn't apply to the Internet wire that's just next to the cable, creeping up the exterior wall of your home. More specifically in the context of the cable distributors offering services through fibre-optic Internet (like Youtube TV coming soon).

Light at the end of the tunnel!

The good news is that there is still (and now more than ever) hope. Minister Joly, in one of her recent communications with the media, was very specific: ""We want companies that benefit from the new business model to contribute [to the funding], she said. In the context of reforming our laws [on radio broadcasting and telecommunications], we will make sure to have a new model that will guarantee funding.""

Maybe we'll finally see, sooner than later, the rich and hungry ISPs share a small portion of their huge cake with the starving and out-of-breath creative industry?

It'll be exciting to watch what happens next!

Russland-Experte Boris Reitschuster schreibt ihm zu seinem Ehrentag einen Brief - mit 10 ungewöhnlichen Geburtstagswünschen

Lieber Wladimir Wladimirowitsch,

ich kenne Sie seit mehr als anderthalb Jahrzehnten persönlich; noch länger verfolge ich Ihr Wirken, habe mehrere Bücher darüber geschrieben.

Zu Ihrem heutigen 65. Geburtstag möchte ich Ihnen diese 10 Wünsche mit auf den Weg geben:

1. Dass Sie den Kontakt zur Realität wiederfinden

Macht macht selbst in demokratischen Ländern einsam. Absolute Macht, wie Sie sie haben, koppelt einen von der Wirklichkeit ab.

In Ihrer Umgebung traut sich niemand mehr, Ihnen unangenehme Wahrheiten zu sagen.

Etwa, dass Ihr Auftritt als Sänger und Pianist vor laufenden Kameras nur peinlich war.

Sie erklären Ihren Vertrauten morgens die Welt, die erklären die Welt dann genau so den Chefredakteuren – und abends sehen Sie im Fernsehen genau die Welt, die Sie am Morgen selbst entworfen haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie die Stärke finden, kritische Stimmen nicht mehr zu unterdrücken.

Das wäre zumindest ein erster Schritt.

Für eine grundlegende Rückkehr zur Realität, die ich Ihnen von Herzen wünsche, wäre allerdings die Erfüllung meines zweiten Wunsches notwendig.

Mit 65 Jahren sind sie bereits fünf Jahre über dem Renteneintrittsalter von russischen Männern, und auch wenn Sie Deutscher wären, dürften Sie jetzt bald mit dem Arbeiten aufhören.

2. Ich wünsche Ihnen: Gehen Sie in den Ruhestand

Fast 18 Jahre lange ein und dieselbe Arbeit zu machen, ist auch für weniger qualifizierte Jobs wie Arzt oder Professor ein langer Zeitraum; 18 Jahre an der Spitze Russlands ist für sie als Regierender sicher ebenso ermüdend wie für die Regierten.

Sie haben einmal gesagt, sie würden so hart arbeiten wie ein Sklave auf einer Galeere. Wählen Sie die Freiheit, schmeißen sie ihr Ruder weg!

Sie legen damit nicht nur die Einsamkeit der Macht ab.

Sie lassen immer verbreiten: Russland ist umzingelt, und meinen damit die NATO. In Wirklichkeit sind Sie umzingelt. Von Schönrednern und Claqueuren.

Befreien Sie sich!

3. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie endlich Ihre KGB-Brille ablegen können

Sie haben beim Geheimdienst gelernt, die Welt klar in Schwarz und Weiß zu teilen, in Freund und Feind.

KGB-Offiziere im mittleren Dienst wie Sie wurden darauf abgerichtet, überall Verschwörungen und Verrat, Provokationen und Angriffe zu wittern.

Viele Ihrer weltgewandteren Kameraden haben das abgelegt.

Ihre Politik zeigt, dass Sie bis heute in diesem Denken verfangen sind.

Die russischen Medien, die Sie steuern, lassen den Menschen ständig eintrichtern, die NATO plane einen Überfall auf Russland.

Ich fürchte, dass Sie selbst inzwischen daran glauben. An Ihre eigene Propaganda.

Wenn man überall Verrat, Provokation und Aggression wittert, muss das Leben eine Hölle sein.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie sich aus dieser Hölle befreien.

Russland ist nicht von Feinden umzingelt.

Die NATO plant keinen Angriff auf Ihr Land.

Wir wollen Partnerschaft mit Russland – nur tun wir uns schwer damit, solange Sie Nachbarländer überfallen und Ihre Kritiker gewaltsam ums Leben kommen.

4. Ich wünsche Ihnen ehrliche und freie Wahlen

Niemand zweifelt daran, dass Sie im Frühjahr zum vierten Mal zum russischen Präsident gewählt werden, mit einem überwältigenden Ergebnis.

Jeder, der Russland auch nur halbwegs kennt, ist sich bewusst, dass diese Wahlen massiv manipuliert werden.

Weil Sie Ihre Gegner gar nicht zur Wahl zulassen, sie in den Medien mit Schmutz bewerfen, statt sie zu Wort kommen zu lassen, weil Sie in und um die Wahllokale massiv und dreist betrügen.

So ein Wahlsieg muss so befriedigend sein wie ein Boxkampf, in dem der Sieger seinen Gegner vorab knebeln und auf den Boden fesseln lässt.

Ich wünsche Ihnen den Mut, eine echte Wahl zuzulassen.

Sie würden dann erfahren, was die Menschen wirklich von Ihnen denken.

Und egal, wie die Wahl ausgeht - sie könnten in jedem Fall stolz sein: Auf einen Sieg, der er ehrlich wäre. Und sogar auf eine Niederlage könnten sie stolz sein, weil Sie die Größe gehabt hätten, diese zu riskieren.

5. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie keine Angst mehr haben vor Ihren politischen Konkurrenten

Gerade hat ein Moskauer Gericht wieder in einem peinlichen Schauprozess Ihren bekanntesten Kritiker, Alexej Nawalnij, für 20 Tage einsperren lassen.

Zum wiederholten Male.

Selbst Ihre Marionette Dmitrij Medwedew hat, als er pro forma für Sie Präsident war, zugegeben, dass in Russland""Telefonjustiz"" herrscht – also Gerichtsurteile per Telefon von ganz oben an die Richter diktiert werden.

Es ist deshalb klar, dass auch Sie für das Urteil gegen Nawalnij Verantwortung tragen. Ebenso dafür, dass sein Bruder, der drei kleine Kinder hat, seit Jahren unschuldig in Haft sitzt – de facto als Geisel.

Sehr viele Menschen sitzen in Russland im Straflager, weil Sie gegen Sie sind.

Wer seine Gegner wegsperren lässt, muss große Angst haben.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie diese Angst besiegen.

Nicht nur Ihre Gegner werden dann frei sein – auch Sie werden sich freier fühlen.

6. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie im 21. Jahrhundert ankommen. Oder zumindest im 17. Jahrhundert

Ihr politisches Denken ist nicht mal in den Zeiten Bismarcks verhaftet – die Grundlagen für die Souveränität von Nationalstaaten wurden bereits 1648 mit dem Westfälischen Frieden gelegt.

Sie hingegen glauben immer noch, dass Russlands Nachbarländer wie kleine Kinder nicht ganz erwachsen sind und Sie über deren Schicksal mitbestimmen müssen.

Sie sind deshalb in diesen Ländern verhasst wie kaum ein anderer Politiker.

Lassen Sie diese Länder in Ruhe.

Akzeptieren Sie, dass nicht Sie, sondern die Menschen in diesen Ländern selbst über ihre Leben und ihr Schicksal entscheiden dürfen.

Ich zweifle, ob die Menschen dort wirklich dankbar sein werden, wenn Sie sie endlich in Ruhe lassen – dafür haben sie zu viel Angst dort ausgelöst, und zu viele Menschen sind gestorben.

Aber zumindest der Hass gegen Sie würde nachlassen.

Und weniger gehasst zu werden, sollte befreiend wirken.

7. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie Ihre Sowjetnostalgie ablegen. Sie ist schlecht für Sie und für Ihr Land

Sie haben den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion als die größte geopolitische Tragödie des 21. Jahrhunderts bezeichnet.

Unter Ihnen ist es in Russland zu einer Stalin-Nostalgie gekommen. Der grausame Massenmörder wird heute wieder gefeiert. Sie lassen Seine Verbrechen relativieren und seine angeblichen Verdienste preisen.

Sie stehen in der sowjetischen Denk-Tradition, wonach der Staat alles und der Mensch nichts ist.

Solange Russland diese Denkweise nicht ablegt, solange Stalin verehrt wird, hat Russland keine Zukunft. So treten Sie und Ihr großartiges Land immer wieder auf die alten Mistgabeln.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie verstehen, dass Russlands Zukunft nicht darin besteht, dass die Nachbarländer es fürchten.

Russland hat eine große Zukunft, wenn die Nachbarn es beneiden.

Wenn die Menschen nicht auf Russlands Bedrohungspotential stolz sind, sondern Stolz sein könnten auf eine funktionierende Gesundheitsversorgung, auf würdige Renten, funktionierende Gesetze und eine erfolgreiche Bekämpfung von Korruption und Willkür.

8. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie in die Geschichtsbücher nicht nur als Krieger eingehen

Sie sind für den Krieg in der Ostukraine verantwortlich, der mehr als 10.000 Menschen das Leben kostete und noch heute fast täglich Opfer fordert.

Die Truppen von Ihnen und Ihrem Verbündeten Assad haben massive Kriegsverbrechen in Syrien begangen.

Sie tragen die politische Verantwortung für den Abschuss des Fluges MH-17 über der Ostukraine mit fast 300 Toten und für die Ermordung des Ex-KGB-Agenten Alexander Litwinenko in London 2006 mit radioaktivem Polonium, wie niederländische Ermittler und ein britischer Richter feststellten.

Die Liste ließe sich lange fortsetzen.

Machen Sie sich ein Geburtstagsgeschenk, indem sie den blutigen Krieg in der Ukraine beenden. Sie müssen dazu nur die Grenzen dichtmachen und aufhören, aus Russland Waffen und Geld an Ihre Befehlsempfänger zu liefern, die Sie als ""pro-russische Rebellen"" ausgeben.

Vielleicht haben Sie Angst, dass Frieden statt Krieg zu beginnen Sie schwächer dastehen lässt.

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall.

Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie das verstehen.

9. Ich wünsche Ihnen, dass Sie nicht nur als Spitze der russischen Korruptions-Pyramide in die Geschichte eingehen – sondern als jemand, der auch einen Teil seines Geldes zurückgibt

Sie müssen ja nicht gleich Robin Hood sein.

Enge Vertraute von Ihnen brachten es auf dubiose Weise zu unvorstellbaren Milliardenvermögen, seit Sie an der Macht sind.

Ihre Kritiker bezeichnen Sie als reichsten Mann der Welt, weil sie sagen, dass Sie auf dieses Geld Zugriff haben.

Geben ist seliger als Nehmen, sagt ein deutsches Sprichwort.

In Russland leben Millionen Menschen in bitterer Armut; viele können sich nicht vollwertig satt essen, vielen fehlt das Geld für dringend benötigte Operationen.

Sagen Sie Ihren Freunden, dass Sie – als Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie, statt Yachten und goldenen Toiletten für Ihre Flugzeuge – zumindest einen Teil Ihrer Milliarden den Menschen in Russland zurückgeben sollen.

Die Dankbarkeit der Menschen wird ein schönes Geburtstagsgeschenk an Sie werden.

10. Ich wünsche Ihnen echte Freunde

Nicht solche wie Ex-Kanzler Gerhard Schröder, deren angebliche Freundschaft mit Ihnen einen schalen Beigeschmack hat, weil er von Ihnen – über den Umweg Ihrer Konzerne – Unsummen an Geld verdient.

Genauso wie so viele Ihrer anderen Kumpels, die zu Milliardären wurden, beruhen solche Beziehungen auf Abhängigkeiten – und nicht auf Freundschaft.

Ich wünsche Ihnen Menschen, die kein Geld von Ihnen wollen, keine Macht, keine Posten – sondern die Sie um Ihrer selbst willen wollen.

Local authorities claim that funding measures from their own budgets would mean less money to invest in new council homes or pay for running repairs on existing stock, the Press Association reports.

Jane Urquhart, who holds the housing portfolio on Nottingham City Council, said the works planned on high-rises in her area were considered “additional rather than essential” by the Department for Communities and Local Government.

Empics Entertainment Sajid Javid's Department for Communities And Local Government is refusing to meet promises to fund fire safety improvements, councils claim

“We found that really difficult to understand given that in the refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament sprinklers are considered essential, so we thought it was quite incredible that they were essential for the Houses of Parliament but not essential for residents of high-rises,” she told The Today programme.

The Labour councillor said: “Safety must come at the top of the list and the works that we have considered will be done; the impact will be that fewer new homes will be built and our other housing will not have the repairs that it needs.”

Adam Hug, leader of the Labour opposition group on Westminster City Council, said his authority faced similar problems getting money from Communities Secretary Sajid Javid’s department to pay for the installation of sprinklers and removal of cladding.

“Ultimately these are things that the London Fire Brigade says have to be done and ultimately the cost is having to be borne by the housing revenue account, which is tenants’ rents and service charge fees,” he told Today.

“Councils across the country are asking the Government for the help that Sajid Javid promised and they are being told ‘no, only in exceptional circumstances when you literally don’t have the money in any form’.”

He said Westminster stood to lose about £20 million to pay for the work: “That means either 100 affordable homes can’t get built or it means that for 20 or 30 years our residents are going to not have their damp dealt with, when things break not being repaired.”

He added: “It’s a national civil emergency across the country, councils have complied with the regulations that have been there and the Government is not stepping up to the plate.”

The Guardian reported that other councils, including Croydon and Wandsworth, had also had requests for funding declined.

A DCLG spokesman said: “Public safety is paramount which is why, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Government established a comprehensive building safety programme to ensure a fire like this can never happen again.

“This included commissioning an independent review of building regulations and fire safety. We will consider this issue in light of the recommendations of this review and the findings of the public inquiry.

“Building owners are responsible for funding measures designed to make a building safe.

He is more optimistic than some campaigners, stressing that more than 20 state legislatures have passed gun control laws, on issues like background checks, since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012.","“There is less hope than ever for fundamental reform of America’s gun laws,” former congressman Steve Israel tells HuffPost.

The Democrat, who represented New York from 2001 to 2017, thinks that, even after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history left 59 people in Las Vegas on Sunday, gun laws will not be tightened.

The killing has led to calls for bi-partisan legislation, which would require stronger background checks for those buying guns, to finally be passed.

Another gun control advocate, Senator Dianne Feinstein, has introduced a bill to ban devices that accelerate the fire rate of the type the Las Vegas gunman is believed to have used.

But Israel does not expect either change to succeed.

“Nothing will happen in Congress. Nothing has happened. In the 16 years I served there were 52 mass shootings, I used to think Congress would act.

“Its action has been confined to lowering US flags, tweeting condolences and holding moments of silence. Too many members of Congress fear the gun lobby more than they fear the kind of things we saw in Las Vegas.”

People often try to explain America’s gun laws with generalisations about culture - such as how America’s frontier history gave it a strong tradition of self-defence and self-sufficiency.

11,720 people have been shot dead in America in 46,829 incidents so far this year. A total of 548 children aged 11 or under have been killed or injured

But Israel focusses on shorter term causes, arguing in an article in the New York Times, that in a partisan age politicians and gun lobbyists are more likely than ever to take extreme positions and refuse to back down.

The failure to stop Americans shooting each other baffles many abroad.

At the time of writing, 11,720 people have been shot dead in America in 46,829 incidents so far this year. A total of 548 children aged 11 or under have been killed or injured.

BBC North America Editor, Jon Sopel, recently told HuffPost that the expectation regular mass shootings would lead to reform - as they did in the UK after the Dunblane massacre - was misplaced.

“You go on the 10 O’Clock News... The presenter says to you: ‘Jon, is this going to lead to a big overhaul of gun laws?’ And you want to say: ‘No, not a chance’,” Sopel said last month.

Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Gabby Giffords, who was serving in Congress when she was shot in 2011, addresses a rally with fellow Democrats after the Las Vegas mass shooting, calling for legislation to strengthen background checks

Britain and Australia both introduced wide-ranging gun bans after mass shootings.

But the right to bear arms - because “a well regulated militia” is “necessary to the security of a free state” - has been enshrined in America’s constitution as long as the right to free speech and freedom of religion.

Mass murder in America is 'the price of freedom' conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly

As conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly said after Las Vegas, mass murder in America is “the price of freedom”.

Mick North, who lost his five-year-old daughter in the Dunblane massacre and campaigned for gun control in Britain and America, was appalled at the opposition there to control measures he thought urgent.

Ken Cedeno via Getty Images Barack Obama wipes away tears as he talks about needless shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary school during a press briefing in January, 2015

He senses American gun control advocates had grown shyer in the two decades since he first started campaigning, emphasising more and more that they don’t oppose the Second Amendment and are focussing on smaller changes.

“The whole thing has been pushed further and further away from what I would see as sensible measures by what the NRA has done. It’s managed very successfully to push the debate so far out in its direction, that those who want to do something now feel they can’t ask for a lot,” North says.

The NRA is the National Rifle Association, an organisation that has five million members and is one of the most famous pressure groups in the world.

It fights against efforts to make gun ownership harder and casts a long shadow over Washington, grading politicians’ friendliness to gun owners and fighting to unseat its enemies.

Boston Globe via Getty Images A worker rearranges the guns inside the booth at Commemorative Firearms as fans stopped by to check out guns bearing Trump's motto: 'Make America Great Again' in Bristol, Tennessee

NRA lobbying has been blamed for sinking gun control measures that stop short of confiscating any weapons and most people supported.

Four months after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which 20 children were killed, legislation expanding background checks on those buying guns failed in the Senate. This was despite a poll finding 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. The bill was itself watered down - a proposal to ban assault weapons failed to make the cut.

The NRA moved fast after Sandy Hook. It held a press conference just a week later where its president Wayne LaPierre claimed the solution to a school massacre was more guns, pledging “armed police officers in every single school in the nation”.

The minority of people who oppose [gun control] laws, especially those who are members of the NRA, tend to be much more willing to base their entire view of their member of Congress or state legislature on that one issue. Prof Jon Vernick, The Center for Gun Policy and Research

As the battle in Congress began, the NRA claimed background checks were only enforceable through a national registry of gun owners.

“Obama wants you to believe that putting the federal government in the middle of every firearm transaction — except those between criminals — will somehow make us safer,” LaPierre said.

At a White House press conference after the Senate bill failed, Barack Obama said the NRA “wilfully lied” to galvanise its members against it.

Prof Jon Vernick, co-director at The Center for Gun Policy and Research at John Hopkins University, says some NRA members’ “single-minded focus” on the issue give the organisation the power to defeat control measures, even if they enjoy broad support.

He tells HuffPost: “The minority of people who oppose such laws, especially those who are members of the NRA, tend to be much more willing to base their entire view of their member of Congress or state legislature on that one issue.

“The minority who are opposed to these kind of common sense laws are willing to vote based on that issue alone, to give money on that issue alone, are willing to write members of Congress on that issue alone. That gives them outsized authority.”

Alissa Scheller/HuffPost

Even something as basic as gathering data on gun crimes has been a casualty of the fight.

Data shows a strong correlation between high gun ownership and gun deaths.

But, in 1996, Congress passed the Dickey Amendment, which forbids US government agencies from doing work that would “advocate or promote gun control”.

The NRA spent $3.2 million on lobbying in 2016. In the same year, leading gun control advocates The Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence spent just $152,009 The Center Of Responsive Politics

The effect was to dissuade researchers from conducting research into gun violence. The number of studies published has fallen by 64 percent by 2012.

According to The Center Of Responsive Politics, the NRA spent $3.2 million on lobbying in 2016. In the same year, leading gun control advocates The Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence spent just $152,009.

But the NRA’s spending on lobbying is dwarfed by what it spends on getting its allies elected. Last year, it spent $6.2 million on one senate race in North Carolina, helping Republican Richard Burr win re-election.

Tom Williams via Getty Images Richard Burr's campaign to be re-elected North Carolina senator received more than $6 million from the NRA

He voted against the background checks after Sandy Hook. During the election campaign, Burr joked about putting a “bullseye” on Hillary Clinton, for which he later apologised when the audio of the remark leaked.

After the Las Vegas massacre, he issued a short statement that said nothing about gun control but said he and his wife would be “praying for those lost and their families”.

Republicans are far more likely to receive big gun rights donations

The NRA grades his voting record on guns as “A+”.

Though both sides give money to both parties, Republicans are far more likely to receive big gun rights donations.

Donald Trump received $969,138 from gun rights campaigners and $1,984 from control campaigners, while Hillary Clinton received $48,013 and $1,100,698 respectively.

Both houses of Congress are under Republican control. Vernick says this means the party “doesn’t just control the votes, [they] control the agenda. They control whether bills get hearings or whether they’re even brought up for a vote.”

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Donald Trump addresses the NRA's Leadership Forum in Atlanta, Georgia in April

HuffPost interviewed Republican senators who were unwilling to advocate gun control measures in the wake of Las Vegas.

Former presidential candidate Ted Cruz said: “The facts are still developing, but it appears this was a crazed madman and sadly violence will always be part of our lives.”

America has not always been so paralysed over the issue. In 1994, Congress legislated a 10-year ban on assault weapons across the country. Attempts to renew this have failed.

“Congress is more polarised than ever,” Israel says. He blames “gerrymandering” - the engineering of districts’ boundaries to overwhelmingly favour one party - for pushing Republicans to more extreme positions to satisfy an increasingly partisan group of constituents.

He also says the NRA itself has become more polarised, arguing it used to support “sensible laws” but, having been driven to extremes in the threat of losing supporters to rival gun groups, now fights without compromise.

The ferocity of the lobby and the partisanship of politicians are not the only factors.

Prof Vernick says the way people die - and who dies - are both reasons Congress has not acted.

The demographics of the legislators and those most at risk of being shot to death matter, he argues.

He points out that black males aged 15 to 24 are more than 20 times more likely than white males to be shot to death.

He says: “Think about the demographics of members of Congress. Overwhelmingly, they are middle-aged white men. If they were dying at the same rate in gun homicides...

“It’s inconceivable to me that we wouldn’t see more change... It’s a question of who actually is dying.”

It’s a question of who actually is dying Prof Jon Vernick, The Center for Gun Policy and Research

Prof Vernick also says it is often overlooked that around two thirds of gun deaths in the US were suicides and this is of less interest to policy makers than murder.

He is more optimistic than some campaigners, stressing that more than 20 state legislatures have passed gun control laws, on issues like background checks, since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012.

As after the Las Vegas shooting, Diane Feinstein introduced a bill to the Senate after Sandy Hook. That bill proposed a ban on assault weapons. It was defeated by a 40 to 60 vote.

Then, Feinstein castigated her colleagues from the Senate floor, saying they should “show some guts” on the issue.

Her Republican colleague Charles Grassley fired back, saying: “This is a slippery slope of compromising the Second Amendment. You go down that road, you’re going to find it easier to compromise other things.”

When asked if he was optimistic Congress would act in the next few years, former congressman Steve Israel says: “My optimism drained when children were murdered at a small school in Connecticut and President Obama had tears in his eyes and Congress couldn’t even bring itself to do the right thing.",A Guide To Why Mass Shootings Don't Change American Gun Laws,http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2017/10/04/america-gun-laws_n_18202962.html?utm_hp_ref=uk

Joel Benenson, Clinton campaign strategist: We had suspected that the DNC hack had been done by Russians.
But at the same time, this was who we all believed Donald Trump was and we’d been saying Donald Trump was for months.","NEW YORK — It began as a relatively quiet day in the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were each holed up with their aides on Friday, Oct. 7, 2016, preparing for the second presidential debate, scheduled for Sunday night. Hurricane Matthew, which was churning off the Florida coast, led the Friday-morning newscasts. The Chicago Cubs were beginning a quest for their first World Series title in more than a century. But by midafternoon three separate bombshells, all coming within the span of roughly 90 minutes, threatened to throw the race into chaos.

First, the top intelligence officials of the Obama administration announced their belief that the Russian government was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee earlier in the year. Then the Washington Post published the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald Trump bragged about forcing himself on women. And WikiLeaks dumped its trove of emails from the Clinton campaign, hacked from the account of campaign head John Podesta.

Yahoo News conducted nearly two dozen on-the-record interviews with top officials inside and outside the Clinton and Trump campaigns and the Obama administration, as well as major media figures in Washington, New York and beyond, to produce an exclusive oral history of the wildest 64 hours in modern political history.

The resulting documentary film and online feature present a firsthand account of three pivotal days in the campaign and paint a vivid picture of the behind-the-scenes drama that unfolded inside the Post newsroom, Trump Tower, Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, Clinton’s Westchester County, N.Y., hotel, and the debate site in St. Louis.

The accounts show how Clinton’s campaign team — staffed by some of the most experienced political operatives in the country — scrambled to stay ahead of the fast-moving events, as news poured in on their phones, computers, tablets and televisions. The wisdom of a key decision — to hold off commenting on the “Access Hollywood” tape for 48 hours — was hotly debated at the time. Meanwhile, the band of relative amateurs assembled by Donald Trump, guided by the candidate’s own implacable, unerring impulse for self-preservation, barreled ahead in the face of denunciations from all sides, including his fellow Republicans. Out of desperation, the campaign came up with the phrase “locker-room banter” to describe Trump’s remarks — and devised the masterstroke of bringing to the debate a gaggle of women who had famously accused Bill Clinton of sexual improprieties in years past.

The dizzying events of that weekend reflect some essential truths about the two candidates and their campaigns: Clinton cool, cautious and cocooned by staff; Trump instinctual, aggressive and unbound by propriety and convention. The same qualities that have so often gotten him in trouble were also the ones that rescued him from this crisis. An embarrassment that might have ended the career of a more conventional candidate somehow morphed into an opportunity for him to show off his resilience — a lesson the nation is still learning about the candidate who emerged triumphant from that one astonishing weekend, one year ago.

5 a.m. ET: Hurricane Matthew is about 40 miles east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Fla., heading north-northwest at 13 miles per hour. The National Hurricane Center in Miami warns that the Category 3 storm — which had already killed more than 300 people in Haiti — is expected to produce life-threatening conditions for those living along Florida’s east coast.

Matthew had already created political controversy. Earlier that week, Hillary Clinton’s campaign was criticized for buying ads on the Weather Channel timed to air during the storm. President Barack Obama was forced to cancel a planned rally for Clinton in Miami. And Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump supporter, denied the Clinton campaign’s request to extend the voter registration deadline in Florida.

7 a.m. ET: “I’m focused on a storm,” Scott says on “CBS This Morning.” “I’m focused on making sure people, every life is — you don’t lose a life. That’s what I’m focused on now. We’re in the middle of a storm.”

David Fahrenthold, reporter, the Washington Post: I had been writing about Trump’s giving to charity for months. I was in the middle of reporting about claims that he was going to give money to charity, and trying to figure out whether he’d actually made good on them. So that was a long process that involved calling a lot of charities to see if Donald Trump had ever given the money. So, as I was planning that Friday, it was just going to be another day of sort of that reporting. I didn’t have any plans to write a big story that day.

Around 9:30 a.m. ET: Trump is at Trump Tower. While he has no campaign rallies, he hosts two “roundtable” photo ops in the morning, including one on border security in which he alleges the Obama administration is turning a blind eye to illegal immigrants in the country so they can vote in the election. “They are letting people pour into this country so they can go and vote,” Trump declares, which lights up Twitter and cable TV.

A few blocks away, Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime political adviser who for weeks had predicted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange would publish damaging material about Hillary Clinton on Oct. 1, answers Twitter followers who have grown tired of waiting. Stone says he was told by a journalist who had interviewed Assange of WikiLeaks’ plan.

“Stay tuned!” Stone tweets. “Assange was delayed by death threats but undaunted.”

stay tuned ! Assange was delayed by death threats but undaunted — Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 7, 2016

“Julian Assange will deliver a devastating expose on Hillary at a time of his choosing,” Stone tweeted the day before. “I stand by my prediction. #handcuffs4hillary”

Brian Fallon, Clinton’s spokesman: That’s what contributed to our very ominous sort of sense that there was something around the corner.

Clinton, who has no public events scheduled, is in Rye Brook, N.Y., at the Doral Arrowwood, a hotel and conference center located a few miles from Westchester airport, where she is preparing for Sunday’s presidential debate.

Ron Klain, senior adviser to the Clinton campaign: We were doing what you do in debate prep. That morning in particular we were going over new answers that had been written after the first debate — new material that took into account a lot of the reporting that had been done about Trump’s tax return, leaked pages from Trump’s tax return. Secretary Clinton hadn’t been on a stage since then.

They are also dealing with another distraction: A day earlier, Clinton’s personal email address had been exposed in a breach of former State Department staffer Capricia Marshall’s email account by the anonymous hacker organization DC Leaks. During Thursday’s debate prep, Clinton began receiving a barrage of hate mail, so aides quietly took possession of her iPhone while they rerouted the messages.

Philippe Reines, a longtime Clinton adviser who played Trump during debate practice: It’s hard to describe how nasty what she was getting was. It was coming in dozens a minute. I don’t think a single one of them went to the Secret Service, meaning, none of them were like, “I’m going to hunt you down and shoot you.” They were almost worse.

Reines is about to hand Clinton her phone back when it begins to ring.

Reines: I didn’t answer the phone. It wasn’t a masked caller. It was like one of these things where it was like, “What’s area code 928?” Rings again. Different number. Rings a third time. At this point, it’s pretty clear to me something is amiss, so I answer it. And you hear somebody on the line going, “Yo.” And I said, her number is clearly compromised. Her number must have been somewhere in Capricia’s email. And the campaign was looking and looking and looking but couldn’t find it and then they found it. And you know, that’s sort of a much more intimate violation. You know, if nothing else, you can’t change your phone number in 10 minutes like you could change your email address. And she was getting text messages. It was just ugly.

Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton campaign communications director: So we were dealing with a little bit of aftermath from that, including Hillary having to get a new cellphone.

In Washington, Obama administration officials are preparing to issue a statement accusing Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee.

Jeh Johnson, former secretary of homeland security: Over the course of the summer, there came a point when the intelligence community had concluded that the Russian government was behind the attempts to interfere in the election process, through the hacks to the DNC. And we were seeing this emerging picture of scanning and probing around voter registration databases. We reached a point, probably late summer, when the proof was beyond a reasonable doubt. The question then became what to do about it. A number of us felt very strongly that we had to tell the American public what we knew. In the midst of the election season, we had to tell the public what we knew.

James Clapper, former director of national intelligence: We had a number of meetings and had debates about it — about whether we should say something and what to say. And the arguments revolved around whether if we say something — particularly if the president were to say something — about what the Russians were doing, would that, first, dignify or amplify what the Russians where doing? And secondly, would that be seen as the administration putting its hand on the scale in favor of one of the candidates?

Johnson: There was a concern that by making attribution, in and of itself, we’d be undermining the integrity of our election process. This was a situation where the national security apparatus of our government was pretty much injecting itself into an ongoing campaign, which doesn’t happen too often. And so, it required a lot of careful thought.

Clapper: So we went around and around about this. Jeh and I, particularly, I think, were of one mind, one voice on this, where we felt very strongly that, knowing what we knew, it was imperative to share that publicly.

Johnson: Don’t forget, we were in the midst of a very heated campaign where one of the candidates was casting doubt on the integrity of our democracy, saying that the election outcome was going to be rigged a month later. And we were very concerned about not playing into exactly that. We were also getting reports that that may be the Russian government’s exact objective, by hacking into the DNC emails. And so we were wrestling with several different crosscurrents of considerations. In the end, we concluded we had to tell the public what we knew, and that it would be unforgivable if we did not.

Clapper: If the election did go south for one reason or another, and then afterwards it was learned that we knew about what the Russians were doing and sat silent, there’d be hell to pay.

Johnson: Then the question became, who? At first we thought seriously about the intelligence community, and I think that was a right call, because this was their assessment and their judgment. And at one point, Jim Clapper and I decided we should both issue a statement.

Clapper: Which was, I thought, logical. We could sort of lay down the threat.

Johnson: And I’m gonna issue a statement on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security saying, “And here’s what we’re doing about it.” And I remember sitting next to Jim in the Situation Room, and he slipped me a note saying, “Why don’t we just issue a joint statement?” And I said, “That’s a great idea. Let’s do that.”

Clapper: The objective was to get it out and make this publicly known to people before the election of what the Russians were doing.

Somewhere in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin is celebrating his 64th birthday.

Yahoo News

11 a.m. ET: Trump aides say the candidate will spend the rest of the day doing debate prep. The group prepping him includes campaign chief Steve Bannon, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, adviser Stephen Miller, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been playing Hillary Clinton in debate prep.

David Bossie, deputy Trump campaign manager: We were in the conference room on the 25th floor in Trump Tower, where we held virtually every one of our debate prep sessions with Mr. Trump. There was six or eight of us in the room.

At about the same time at the Washington Post’s offices, Fahrenthold gets a phone call from a source who claims to have video of Trump making lewd comments about women.

Fahrenthold: We didn’t know it was coming, we didn’t know it existed.

The five-minute video captures a hot mic conversation between Trump and Billy Bush during a 2005 taping of “Access Hollywood” on the set of “Days of Our Lives.” Fahrenthold watched the footage on his computer at his desk in the Post newsroom.

Fahrenthold: You see a bus driving through a backlot in Hollywood — pretty boring. And you hear kinda muffled voices. You can’t see Trump’s mouth moving obviously, you just see the bus. But then after a few seconds you start hearing this dialogue between Trump and Billy Bush. And, you know, the first two minutes you knew that you were seeing something really different.

Trump brags to Bush that he can kiss and grope women because of his celebrity status. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump says. “Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.”

Fahrenthold: We were pretty used to being shocked by Donald Trump, [but] these were things that were beyond what we’d heard before. So I called my neighbor, my desk mate, over to look at it too. And she puts the headphones on and I can see her watching it. She’s covered Russia, she’s covered all kinds of things that are, you know, very serious. She’s seen a lot of things in her life. And she made this noise of, like, outrage and shock and just, like, a guttural “ugh” that I knew, OK, this is — this is really something different.

The race is on to publish it.

Fahrenthold: My editor was in line at Whole Foods. I don’t know what he was doing at Whole Foods on a Friday morning, but he was at Whole Foods. So I called him and told him, “Look, I got something really important. You gotta come in.” And we sort of started the ball rolling. Because we knew we had this thing, we knew it was really important, we didn’t know who else had it. And so we wanted to make sure we got it out as fast as we could.

The tape is given to the Post’s video staff for preproduction.

Fahrenthold: They had to add subtitles ’cause you couldn’t really hear the audio that well. They wanted to cut it down because the last three minutes are boring — it’s just Trump getting a tour of the NBC backlot. And they wanted to run it by their lawyers. So they said, “OK, it’s 11 a.m. now. We’ll have this ready by I think 3:30.” That was the deadline they gave us.

11:29 a.m. ET: Hillary Clinton tweets: “To everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew: Stay safe, and know that America is with you.”

To everyone in the path of Hurricane Matthew: Stay safe, and know that America is with you. pic.twitter.com/0KuidMhEHm — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 7, 2016

Palmieri: I worked for President Obama in 2012 when we had Superstorm Sandy. And that meant sort of a respite in the campaign. And people stopped politicking. And given, this was a pretty unusual year, we didn’t expect that there would be some ceasefire. But things would slow down. And plus they would slow down because you’re preparing for the debate.

Johnson: The Clinton campaign reached out to my office and said, “Candidate would like a briefing on the recovery effort.” I said, “Sure, fine. But I’ll have to offer the same thing to candidate Trump.” So I call Chris Christie, and I said, “Chris, Secretary Clinton wants a briefing on Matthew. I’m offering the same thing to the Trump campaign.” And he said, “Sure, I’ll set it up.”

12:15 p.m. ET: Johnson and Joseph Nimmich, then deputy administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, call Clinton to brief her on Hurricane Matthew.

Johnson: This was a pretty significant hurricane moving up the Florida coast, and so, in any briefing to the president, or the press, or in this case candidates for president, you give them the rundown about the extent and the effects of the hurricane, its likely path, the devastation that occurs, and what FEMA is doing about it, what we’ve mobilized, the president’s disaster declarations and so forth. We gave Secretary Clinton the rundown on what happened that day. Forty-five minutes later, I call Mr. Trump. They put me straight into his office.

Bossie: The president respected the secretary of homeland security very much, dealing with the Secret Service protection — and the protection for his family was very important to him.

Johnson: He was very cordial, and he was very interested in what we had to say. And then got off the phone and presumably returned to debate preparation. Neither one of them brought up that they were preparing for a debate. And I remember thinking, I’ve just briefed them on this hurricane and the relief effort, but I didn’t tell them that we’re working on finalizing this statement about the Russian government’s interference in their campaign. Now, the question I will always have in my mind, is whether at that moment when I spoke to him at 1:00 that afternoon, he was aware of the “Access Hollywood” video that was dropping on his head. Didn’t seem to. No, he seemed to be in pretty good spirits that day.

Around 12:30 p.m. ET: Fahrenthold calls the Trump campaign to explain he has a copy of the tape that the paper plans to publish, and to give Trump a chance to comment. He gives the Trump campaign a deadline of 3:30 p.m.

Bossie: I was sitting right next to Steve Bannon when my BlackBerry went off. There was a message from Hope Hicks [Trump’s longtime publicist] telling me that she had been contacted by the Washington Post reporter who wanted a comment on a transcript that he claimed that he had. So I showed my BlackBerry to Steve, handed it to [him], let him read it. We then decided to leave the room to discuss it further. We said we weren’t gonna be giving out a comment without seeing something.

Yahoo News Video David Bossie, deputy Trump campaign manager.

Conway: We didn’t have any tape. We didn’t have any transcript. We didn’t know what was happening.

Fahrenthold: I sent them a transcript of the two minutes, the sort of most offensive part of the video.

Bossie: We read the transcript together outside. Having known the president now for seven or eight years, it didn’t sound like him.

Fahrenthold: The first reaction we got back from them was, “Well, that doesn’t sound like Mr. Trump. That doesn’t sound like something he would say. Can you send us the video?”

As Bossie and Bannon discuss the transcript, Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and then a senior campaign adviser, emerges from the elevator bank and walks over to join their conversation. Hicks and Jason Miller, the Trump campaign communications director, join too.

Bossie: We’re standing outside in the foyer, outside of the conference room. We were having a conversation about what to do. Obviously, inside the room is Chris Christie and Reince Priebus still continuing with the debate prep session, which we had just gotten started about 2. And so, when we started these sessions, we had a rule of thumb not to interrupt them. And clearly, because it’s a glass wall, they could see us out there. And Reince and Chris were wondering what we were doing. It’s never a good sign when, you know, the senior staff is having a huddle outside of the door. So they knew something was afoot, they just didn’t know what.

The senior staff interrupts Trump’s debate prep to discuss the tape. According to Conway, when Trump saw the transcript, he said it didn’t sound like anything he would say.

Conway: He said, “It doesn’t sound like me.”

Yahoo News

3:00 p.m. ET: White House releases joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence saying for the first time publicly that the Russian government was behind the election hacking — and that “only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized” the operation.

Johnson: As we were writing this statement, it occurred to me that this is unprecedented. I don’t think the United States government had ever before accused a foreign superpower publicly of intervening in our political process. And I thought that was a big deal.

Joel Benenson, Clinton campaign strategist: We had suspected that the DNC hack had been done by Russians. It turns out we were right. We thought this would pick up some steam, at that point, given the people who were saying it.

Karen Finney, Clinton strategic adviser and campaign spokesperson: It was a very big deal. At that point you thought, that’s gonna be the news. It was Friday. So the thought was that that’s probably gonna be what we’ll be talking about into the weekend.

Klain: I remember Jake Sullivan, who was leading the overall debate prep effort and was Secretary Clinton’s chief foreign policy adviser, stepped out to take a phone call about it.

Fallon: We jumped on a conference call within the hour after that joint statement was released. That statement was not something we had been expecting, to my knowledge.

Reines: The campaign really kicked into gear on the DNI statement.

Fallon: We had a bit of a scramble. We set up a conference call. Folks who were in debate prep dialed in, as did folks who were in the headquarters. Those of us who were in the headquarters gathered in person at Robby Mook’s office and had the call on a speaker phone. The likes of Jen and Podesta and Joel Benenson dialed in from the debate prep site. We talked probably for 30 or 40 minutes about how to react to the statement. I remember one of the points of discussion on the call was, how should we try to hold Donald Trump’s feet to the fire in the aftermath of this joint statement?

Klain: Sullivan came back in and we stopped and he briefed Secretary Clinton and the rest of us about what had happened and its significance. And we sent a little group of them to rewrite a few pages in the debate book around that to strengthen our answers around Russian interference in the election — put more pointed challenges to Trump on this. A little team went off to write that. We returned to Q&A and practicing for the debate.

Fallon: Several of us felt that we should insist that he accept the findings of the government, of the Obama administration and denounce and condemn the Russians’ intrusion on our election. Others felt that that was too low a bar and that Trump of course would take the opportunity to say he accepts the findings and condemns this breach of the DNC. Several others of us felt that it seemed like it had been pretty much a given that no matter what evidence might surface about the Russians’ involvement, for whatever reason he was always going to be loath to criticize Vladimir Putin. We felt it would be a sufficient way to jam him to simply urge him to acknowledge that it was the work of the Russians.

Bossie: It was a distraction. It, they, somebody was trying to get us to be distracted. It wasn’t important to us.

Conway: I barely remember that being the day.

Fallon: This was a big moment for us. We finally felt like this is going to be the major topic of the debate. We’re finally going to get some unmitigated scrutiny of this issue we’ve been trying to drive home.

Fahrenthold: We’re getting closer to 3:30, there’s some discussion among the editors, “Should we send them the video?” So we send it to them, and we tell ’em, ‘OK, now the deadline is 4:00. You know, you have to get back to us by 4:00.’

Inside the conference room on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, Trump and his top campaign staffers watch the “Access Hollywood” tape for the first time.

Yahoo News

Bossie: We watched it together. We all watched it together at the same time. We pulled it up on, actually, my iPad, and we watched it on the iPad — the group.

According to the New York Times, Trump agrees to say he is sorry if anyone was offended. Ivanka Trump, who was in the room, makes “an emphatic case for a full-throated apology.” But her father is unmoved. “As she spoke, Mr. Trump remained unyielding. His daughter’s eyes welled with tears, her face reddened, and she hurried out in frustration.”

Bossie: Mr. Trump reacted exactly like I expected him to, which he’s a very unflappable person when it comes to these types of events. And he, you know, he is somebody who took it in, internalized it and worked on the response — “What are we gonna do about it?” — as opposed to dwelling on it.

Christie later tells a New Jersey radio station that he urged Trump to apologize. “I made that very clear to Donald on Friday when this first came out and, you know, urged him to be contrite and apologetic because that’s what he needs to be,” Christie says. “This is just, you know, stuff that you just can’t, can’t be involved in and shouldn’t even be thinking.”

3:30 p.m. ET: In Chicago for a pair of private Democratic fundraisers, President Obama makes an unannounced stop to cast his early vote. Asked by the traveling press pool who he voted for, Obama looks up and smirks.

Susan Walsh/AP

Jesse Ferguson, Clinton campaign deputy national press secretary: The irony is a month in advance I remember us talking about that being a big moment because we were trying to encourage people to take advantage of early voting. And the president doing it would put a spotlight on it that might raise awareness of the opportunity and encourage people to do it. And we thought that would be a big, important moment. When in reality, because of everything else that happened, not only did it not become that, but in [the] history books, it was completely forgotten.

Earlier that afternoon, Fahrenthold called NBC for comment on the “Access Hollywood” tape. In her memoir about covering the Trump campaign, “Unbelievable,” NBC News correspondent Katy Tur describes the drama unfolding inside 30 Rockefeller Center: “I was called into NBC’s executive wing around 3:30 p.m. ‘You’re not in trouble,’ the executive said over the phone. ‘Just get down here.’ The tape was from 2005. ‘Access Hollywood’ had it in their archives and the Washington Post somehow got hold of it. Because ‘Access Hollywood’ is an NBC Universal property, the Post called us for comment, I was told. ‘Go find an office and get me a script,’ the executive said. ‘We go to air as soon as we can get the video into the system and subtitled. Legal and standards has to review what you report before you report it. Reach out to the campaign. We need their response. Do it quickly.’”

Fahrenthold: So coming up on 4, we had written the whole story. We talked to our lawyers who had decided that we believe this was authentic, this was newsworthy, it was the candidate for the president of the United States saying these terrible things. We were gonna publish it whether the Trump people were going to comment or not. We still wanted to give them till 4 o’clock to comment.

Bossie: You know, we had, you know, one of the best rapid-response communications directors in the country, Jason Miller, in the room, doing the initial draft of what that response would be to the Washington Post, with input from Hope Hicks and Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway and others that were in the room: Chris Christie, Reince Priebus, myself. And there were others, as well. But, you know, we wanted to get something out quickly, ’cause the Washington Post was pressing us for a response. And we didn’t want the story to go out without a response. It’s a kind of, you know, Politics 101.

Fahrenthold: I had been reporting on the Trump campaign for a long time about his charity, and generally they just never responded to me. They would never even say, “No comment.” They just wouldn’t call me back at all. And I sort of expected that’s what would happen in this case, but it didn’t. In this case, 4 comes and goes, we’re still terrified that NBC or somebody else has this tape and they’re gonna publish it. So the editor leaves my desk to walk the sort of 30 or 40 feet to her desk to push to publish it. And in that walk, in that, you know, 10 seconds, the Trump people called. Hope Hicks said, “Wait, wait, wait. We’re gonna send you a statement.”

The Trump campaign sends a statement to the Washington Post:

“This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.”

Conway claims the candidate came up with the phrase “locker-room banter” himself.

Conway: That’s Donald Trump. I mean, that’s the way he views this. And most of what you see, with him, it’s always his voice and his choice.

4:02 p.m. ET: Fahrenthold tweets: “stand by for some news about @realDonaldTrump….”

Fahrenthold: The thing that really stood out, the place where I felt like we were seeing Donald Trump’s character come through was in this line where he says to Billy Bush, you know, “You just start kissing them. I don’t even stop. And when you’re a star, they let you do it.” In those words, in “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” there was a weird sense of wonder. Like, he’s not BS’ing for his friend, he is actually reflecting that he can’t believe the world lets him get away with this. That he was just expressing the unlimited things he could get away with because he was rich and famous. I thought that was one of the most telling things of that whole conversation — he’s describing to you about how he views the world and what his place in it is.

Finney: This audiotape certainly felt like it could end him. And not just because it was so outrageous, but because it felt like it was consistent with, you know, someone who was brash and arrogant and disrespectful of women, but also has lived his life in this very disconnected world where you can do whatever.

Back at the Doral Arrowwood, the Clinton campaign learns about the tape during debate prep.

Klain: All of a sudden you notice that some people in the room were a little distracted they had seen something on their Twitter or wherever they saw it. There’s a little buzzing conversation in the room, and eventually someone said that we should stop, there’s some big news. So we stopped where we were practicing. We had kind of taken a wing of the hotel, a conference area of the hotel. And there was a room where we did most of the debate practice and adjacent to it is what they used for groups — a lounge room with a bunch of bar tables. It was filled with televisions. We walked there and grabbed some snacks and flipped on the TVs and watched the reporting on the “Access Hollywood” tape.

Hillary Clinton watches the tape along with her staff.

Klain: I wasn’t really focused on her reaction to it. I was sitting at a table with [senior policy adviser] Jake Sullivan. Other people were scattered at other tables. We watched the coverage like everybody else.

Benenson: It was being played over and over again so you didn’t hear it just once. And people are all spread out in this room. And there is silence for a long time. People trying to absorb that this is actually real — and how the hell did the Washington Post get this? — before conversations started. And I remember at one point, I was looking at the monitor and I remember Hillary Clinton was seated behind me — because she hadn’t had lunch yet. And so we had taken this break in debate prep and she was getting something to eat. And, you know, I saw her face at one point, just in absolute disbelief that we were listening to this coming from a man who was a presidential candidate, a nominee of a major party.

In her campaign memoir, “What Happened,” Clinton describes the seeing the tape for the first time: “My team and I had finished a grueling morning debate prep session. We had taken a break for lunch. The television was on in the room, with no volume. Then a commentator came on to warn viewers that they were about to hear something vulgar. Boy, was that true. For many, hearing the Donald Trump tape was literally sickening. As for me, it made me sad — for women and girls, for men and boys, for all of us. It was … horrible, just horrible. It still is. And it always will be, because the tape is never going away. It’s part of our history now.”

Yahoo News A screengrab from the “Access Hollywood” tape.

Finney, who was traveling with vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine in Denver: I didn’t have enough bandwidth on my phone to play the whole tape. But then when we did, to then be able to play the tape was absolutely shocking. I remember I had to play it a couple of times. Because I just couldn’t believe that anyone would talk like that, that someone who was seeking to be president of the United States of America was so vulgar.

Ferguson: Can you be shocked but not surprised? Is that technically possible? If so, that was the reaction. I think everyone’s jaws hit the floor because of how offensive it was. But at the same time, this was who we all believed Donald Trump was and we’d been saying Donald Trump was for months. So there was also a sort of degree of validation for our continued argument that he was unfit to be president. That he didn’t possess the moral character that he should to be president.

Finney: Campaigns are so unpredictable. And I remember thinking as that sort of gossipy sort of chatter was going on, that with Donald Trump, you know, every new revelation was so shocking and appalling and disgusting, you sorta thought, “Well, what, what more could there be?” So that when this dropped, it certainly felt like this was the thing.

At Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, top staffers are working on a statement in response to the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian government was behind the election hacking. Then televisions set to MSNBC flash news about the tape.

Fallon: The network was cutting in with breaking news about a Washington Post report about some tape that had been acquired where Trump was quoted saying absurdly sexist things. Just hearing that, not hearing the actual audio of the tape yet, most of us thought that would be the secondary thing right now because this is the moment we’ve been waiting for — to finally get attention for the Russia issue. So let’s finish banging out this statement, get it right so we can blast it out.

But after the audio is played on air, they realize the tape is going to be a huge story.

Fallon: The one reaction I remember that’s etched in my mind is that of Laura Rosenberger, who was the deputy national security adviser on the campaign. We all were just staring at the television and hearing it through the open door and at one point after we sort of processed what was being said on the audiotape. Laura Rosenberger gasped audibly, and sort of clutched her chest and that was the first moment that sort of drove home how horrified women collectively were going to be by this audio that had surfaced.

Benenson: I couldn’t imagine that any mother or father of a daughter, brother of a sister would be able to vote for somebody who bragged about and proudly proclaimed that he was basically committing sexual assault on women and bragging about it.

Fallon and Glen Caplin, the Clinton campaign’s national spokesman, break away to finish the statement on Russia.

Fallon: We released it and started circulating it and working the phones and trying to get people to still care and pay attention to this issue in the campaign.

J. Todd Breasseale, then the assistant secretary for public affairs at homeland security, recalls being on the phone with a top network correspondent who was working on a piece for that evening’s news broadcast about the DNI statement on Russia. The correspondent, who Breasseale declined to identify by name, was excited about what he saw as an unprecedented disclosure of a foreign power attacking American democracy. Then, suddenly, he heard the correspondent barking to a colleague: “Oh f***! Unmute the TV!” It was a cable news report about the Access Hollywood tape. “You’re not going to f***ing believe this!” the correspondent shouted over the phone. “Dude, I’m sorry, I got to go,” the correspondent said, hanging up the phone.

Palmieri: You could see your hopes of ever being able to make Russia a big issue just dissipate.

4:32 p.m. ET: WikiLeaks begins publishing thousands of emails obtained in a hack of John Podesta’s personal account, including some that reveal the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is living in exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, refuses to reveal the source of the emails.

Palmieri: Tony Carrk, who was the research director, was in the room with me. And he just said, “It looks like some of John Podesta’s emails have been leaked too. And I think maybe the Wall Street speech transcripts are in it.” And that is when I said, “I need to go take a walk.” I got up, and I was like, I got my phone. I turned on Bruce Springsteen, “Take It as It Comes,” and did a couple laps around the Doral Arrowwood outside. And I was like, “OK. This is — I’ve been through, like, a lot of days, but this is really — this one is just really off the charts.”

Benenson: Any day that Hillary Clinton and the word “emails” are in a story was going to be a bad day for us. We knew voters were making no distinction between the WikiLeaks emails and the political emails and John Podesta’s emails and Hillary Clinton’s emails from secretary of state. That was something we couldn’t overcome unless we were gonna have to try to proactively, like, do a tutorial in Hillary’s emails, which would’ve been politically ludicrous. Particularly in a race where we have an edge that we’re trying to maintain.

Fallon: We had a very generalized suspicion that there was going to be more material that would be weaponized against us and that it would probably be the work of the Russians.

Both campaigns see conspiracy rather than coincidence.

Palmieri: At first I just had to laugh because it was so absurd. And obviously not an accident. And to this day I wonder what the leak of John’s emails was meant to cover up or distract from. The “Access Hollywood” tape or Russia? I’m suspicious about the “Access Hollywood” tape. I’m suspicious that the “Access Hollywood” tape came out either through Trump sources or Russia sources to distract from the administration’s statement about Russia.

Bossie: The first thing that comes to my mind is, this is a Clinton operation, a Clinton oppo research effort to influence the Sunday night debate coming up in 48 hours. Pure and simple. And I think that, I still believe that, to do this day, that they were the ones who put it out.

Palmieri: And then Podesta’s emails was just another distraction to, you know, to further obfuscate what was in the very damning information that was in the administration’s statement on Russia. Now, that could seem farfetched, although I’m not sure what’s farfetched given, you know, what we know to be true. And it also could seem reckless because that tape did hurt Donald Trump. But if you’re the Russians, you don’t care.

Stone doesn’t see it that way.

Stone: It was inadvertent. It was coincidental. I don’t think it was planned. Since I have nothing to do with their release and nothing to do with the Billy Bush tape, of course, I’m speculating too.

Yahoo News

As news about the “Access Hollywood” tape breaks, Mike Pence is in Toledo, Ohio, eating a chili dog with his daughter at Tony Packo’s Café — a frequent stop for Republican presidential contenders and their running mates. The restaurant has a wall of signed cardboard hot dog buns, Toledo’s equivalent of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and reporters are positioned to watch Pence sign a bun when suddenly the event is called off. “Without explanation, the pool was told Pence would be leaving directly after he finished dining, without looking at the signatures or shaking any more hands,” Politico reports. “The pool was instructed to return to the press bus and was not permitted to film Pence leaving the restaurant — thus stripping them of an opportunity to ask Pence for his reaction.”

Jason Chaffetz, Republican congressman from Utah and former chairman of the House Oversight Committee: I saw it on the Drudge Report, as I recall and then I actually clicked through to see the actual video and watch it for myself, so I could make my own determination. And it was grotesque. It was embarrassing, it was wrong.

Fahrenthold: [At the Post] we have this sort of, like, roundabout way about talking about scandalous things like that, sex things in particular. So, lying and sex, two things that we like to describe in very convoluted terms. And so in this case we struggled with both what curse word we were going to use, you know, basically this had every possible curse word.

The same issue plays out in newsrooms around the country. The New York Times chooses not to censor Trump’s comments in its article about the tape.

The Washington Post via Getty Images In this 2005 frame from video, Donald Trump (center)prepares for an appearance on ‘Days of Our Lives’ with actress Arianne Zucker (right). He is accompanied to the set by Access Hollywood host Billy Bush (left).

On CNN, correspondent Brianna Keilar describes the “Access Hollywood” tape to viewers during “The Lead With Jake Tapper,” censoring herself on the fly. “‘I did try and eff her, she was married,’ Trump says. And then a little later goes on to talk about how, you know, ‘I’m automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them, it’s like a magnet, just kiss, I don’t even wait. … And when you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything.’ … And Trump says, ‘Grab them by the —’ and he uses a word that begins with p, which is a slang term for women’s genitalia, he says, ‘You can do anything.’”

Keilar also reads Trump’s statement that defends the comments as “locker-room banter.”

4:53 p.m. ET: Chuck Todd tweets: “They don’t really think this is a sufficient response, do they?”

Yahoo News

Bossie: The response to our response was, you know, in hindsight, what we thought it would be, which is, we need to do more. And that’s when we decided to do the video, you know, that evening.

4:55 p.m. ET: Hillary Clinton tweets: “This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.”

In Westchester, top Clinton operatives decide to take an early dinner break while they debate the tape’s significance — and how to respond.

Reines: I think we had the same reaction as the rest of the world, like this is — how do you come back from that? It wasn’t like everyone was, “Let’s call it a day and go to the bar.” But it was this, I mean, how much more devastating can it get?

Klain: I remember when we first heard the tape, I actually turned to Jake Sullivan and said, “This is not going to change anything.” We had a big, spirited debate about that. I said, “Look, as horrible as this is, none of the people who are voting for him will have their mind changed by this.” I will say that was a strong minority view in the room. Most people thought this was kind of either the end for Trump or a devastating blow and a lot of speculation began to swirl in the room about whether Trump would come to the debate on Sunday.

Palmieri: Did she need to say anything more in person ahead of the debate? It was Friday night. Sunday night seemed like a very long time away. Or could we wait and have her not speak until the night of the debate on it? She thought she should wait. She thought that it’d be more powerful for the first time people hear from her directly. She’d be on the stage facing him and saying this to his face.

Benenson: I had no doubt in my mind that this would be the first question in the debate and we could hammer it then in front of a nationally televised audience.

Yahoo News

Palmieri: At first I had thought that she should say something beforehand — and that it seemed like a very long time to get through without hearing from her. But she thought, it’s probably gonna be better if I wait. And the more I thought about it and understood what she wanted to say to his face, I thought that was gonna be a pretty powerful moment.

Benenson: I was anxious as hell to get into the field [to conduct polling]. We talked about whether we should accelerate our polling schedule and go in right away. And we thought, No, let’s let it settle. Let’s let it sink in for a couple of days.

Fahrenthold: The Post has an internal system we use to track web use, number of people reading the story at one time. On your computer, it’s a little dial, like, a spin-o-meter. And it was, like a Bugs Bunny cartoon that the spin-o-meter started spinning around. Instead of going like this, it was going around like that. We actually broke the system that was designed to track traffic. We had so much traffic that the system to track web traffic broke. I was not expecting that, but by the, you know, like, an hour in, you could tell it just was gonna be something really different.

5:30 p.m. ET: Pence attends a previously scheduled rally in Rossford, Ohio. He ignores the controversy, instead using his speech to talk up Trump’s leadership and his ability to be a strong commander in chief. Afterwards, he tries to ignore questions on the controversy: “Governor, how can you ignore this question?” one reporter asks. “Invariably, they’ll say, this time we got him. This time we found that there’s another tweet come out or something,” Pence replies. “This time we got another thing, another issue that’s come forward. Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting for the American people. And he is going to fight all the way to the White House.”

Privately, though, Pence is “beside himself” about the “Access Hollywood” tape, and his wife is furious, the Associated Press reports. According to the New York Times, he calls Trump after the rally to urge him to show humility.

6:25 p.m. ET: Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager turned CNN analyst, offers his reaction to the tape: “Look, I think what this comes down to, and this is not a surprise, is clearly this is not how women should be spoken about. But we’re not choosing a Sunday school teacher here. And I want to be very clear about this. And what we know about Donald Trump, this is 12 years ago, this audiotape. And it does not reflect or bring to mind the Donald Trump that I’ve spent 18 months with traveling. I’ve never heard anything like this out of him. And so let me say, we’re appointing a leader. We are electing a leader to the free world, we’re not electing a Sunday school teacher.”

But condemnations from fellow Republicans begin to roll in.

7:05 p.m. ET: Jeb Bush: “As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”

Klain: At some point at time, 7 or 8 o’clock, I walked into one of the rooms and Jen and Podesta were in there busily scribbling away on a notepad. And I said, “Hey, what’s going on?” And they told me the first batch of the emails had been dumped.

7:42 p.m. ET: Podesta‏ tweets: “I’m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump. Don’t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.”

1. While I'm in pretty good company with Gen. Powell & Amb. Marshall... — John Podesta (@johnpodesta) October 7, 2016

Klain: We talked about what was in some of those emails. And so I sent another little group of people off to write debate answers about what was in those emails.

Fallon: Immediately there was an effort to try to understand what they had and what they were dumping out. The triage was happening by monitoring Twitter. Reporters were culling it quicker than we could.

Palmieri: Back in Brooklyn, they set up an operation to start searching through all of his emails to understand better what was, you know, what was there. Had a big team of people doing that. It was a lot of emails. John was, you know — you feel really, really exposed. And powerless.

Benenson: The first step was to say, We’re not gonna validate anything. We’re not gonna authenticate anything. This was stolen emails. And we’re not gonna get into that game with anybody in the press or anybody else. So that’s your job. You go figure out if they’re authentic or not. As I said to one editor later on after the campaign, I said, “You know, you suggesting that we should validate or invalidate would be like, you know, Woodward and Bernstein going to Richard Nixon and saying, ‘Hey, is what Deep Throat telling me true?’ You know, that’s your job as journalists. You go do the work. Don’t just take it from an agency that you know has ties to Russia, who you just learned is meddling with our election.”

Clinton, who had gone to her Chappaqua, N.Y., home for dinner, does not return to the hotel.

Klain: We told her not to bother to come practice because the situation was so fluid.

7:54 p.m. ET: Clinton tweets a digital campaign ad that uses a clip from the “Access Hollywood” tape.

“Women have the power to stop Trump.”

9 p.m. ET: On Fox News, Bill O’Reilly plays part of the tape of Trump’s comments, but omits the crudest part: “In 2005, Donald Trump was doing a segment with ‘Access Hollywood.’ He was speaking with the entertainment reporter Billy Bush privately about women. The Washington Post somehow acquired that audiotape. I’m not going to play too much of it because it’s crude guy talk. But here’s a sample: ‘I better use some Tic Tacs in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.’”

Meanwhile, more prominent Republicans call on Trump to issue a full-throated apology.

9 p.m. ET: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy: “There is absolutely no place for that sort of conduct or language in our society. Donald Trump must make a full and unqualified apology.”

9:04 p.m. ET: House Speaker Paul Ryan: “I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.”

Conway: People were saying, “This is it. It’s done. It’s over.”

Yahoo News Video

Haberman: Democrats were calling and chortling. I was getting calls from very excited Democrats. And very, very concerned Republicans. I got a call from a Republican strategist who was working with the campaign who was weeping, because the expectation is that this meant that Trump was done, and that this was such a mess for the party.

Chaffetz: It just looked like a dire situation for us and I’m sure the Clinton camp was jumping up and down with joy.

Finney: There was never a celebration. And that’s largely because, you know, if you’ve done enough campaigns you know that October is really strange. And a lot of strange things happen. It is very unpredictable. And I think at the time, I certainly felt like, and I think others did, that it was too unpredictable.

Klain: I never thought this was going to be a game changer. I never thought Trump was going to drop out and I never thought his key supporters were going to abandon him.

Ferguson: There was not a question that he was ever going to drop out. I’d never assumed he would. But there was a moment when I thought the Republican leadership might block him.

Benenson: I think other people at first thought, you know, how can he survive this? Republicans were starting to turn on him pretty quickly.

Palmieri: We’d seen moments like this before. We’d seen moments where Republicans would get nervous in the moment about something Trump had said or done and react quickly — in a sort of attempt to distance themselves from him. But they would always come back around.

Klain: As the evening played on and a few prominent Republicans came out and raised doubts about it, I think there was some euphoria by some members of the team.

Yahoo News

Ferguson: At some point there was even a deliberate discussion about how we make sure to not let expectations of the impact of this get carried away when we knew full well that the race would still not be over. We knew people would claim it was. But we didn’t believe the hype.

Reines: No one, least of all Clinton, thought that this was in any way a slam dunk.

They also worried about the volatility the tape could bring to the race.

Palmieri: If you’re in the lead, stability is your friend. If you’re not, you know — we didn’t need to mix up this race any more than it was.

9:24 p.m. ET: The Clinton campaign releases a statement on the U.S. confirming Russia was behind the election hacks: “It should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become president.”

Sometime on Friday night, Billy Bush releases a statement via NBC News: “Obviously I’m embarrassed and ashamed. It’s no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry.”

10 p.m. ET: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Trump’s comments are “repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance” and makes clear his brief statement would not suffice. “As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape.”

Stone: There’s no question the sunshine soldiers are heading for the exits. These are people who largely don’t know Donald Trump. Above all, he’s not a quitter. It’s just not in his makeup. But yes, there were a lot of depressed people that day. And normally, in a normal presidential contest, this would be a determinative matter. But there was nothing normal about the entire election.

Chaffetz announces he is withdrawing his endorsement of Trump, becoming one of the first prominent Republicans to do so.

Chaffetz: “I talked through it with my wife and thought about it and I like to think I call balls and strikes as I see ’em and I just said, Look, I’m out. I can’t endorse a person who’s going to be acting like that.”

On “CNN Tonight With Don Lemon,” Chaffetz says: “Julie and I, we’ve got a 15-year-old daughter. Do you think I can look her in the eye and tell her that I endorse Donald Trump for president when he acts like this?”

Ferguson: That was the moment. If there is one moment that is both indelibly seared in my brain but also reflective of what happened in this campaign, it’s Jason Chaffetz. It’s watching him lie on CNN, call in, express his disgust, say he can’t look his daughter in the eye if he stands by Trump, announces he’s out and you know coming from the man who had been leading the witch hunt against [Clinton], it was a, you know, stunning moment that made me think that the Republican Party that this might have been the straw that broke the camel’s back for the Republican Party. And then whatever it was, 72, 96 hours later, Chaffetz is back and announcing he’s voting for Trump.

10:45 p.m. ET: At Wrigley Field in Chicago, the Cubs defeat the San Francisco Giants 1-0 in Game 1 of the National League Division Series.

Back at Trump Tower, Trump continues to consult with top aides in his 25th-floor office about how to respond to a crisis that is quickly spinning out of control. Aides later tell reporters that Trump wanted to have a Friday night news conference, but his aides, backed up by his children Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric, talk him out of it, worried it would make things worse. It is decided late Friday that Trump will issue a statement via video to try and stem GOP defections.



Haberman: I heard from a source that they had put in a request to get an ad crew, like an advertising crew really quickly, like a film crew shooting him. They didn’t end up I think using that crew, they had to do something different from within their own headquarters.

Shortly after midnight, Trump issues a videotaped statement:

“I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize. I’ve traveled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me. I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let’s be honest. We’re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today. We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground. I’ve said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.”

Chaffetz: That was a very lame, insincere apology. I felt like he was apologizing because he got caught, I didn’t feel like he was speaking from his heart. He was reading off a teleprompter and it showed.

Stone: It looked like a hostage video, I mean, you could see that he was unhappy doing it. You know, look. One of Trump’s rules is never apologize. It’s really not in his makeup. In this occasion, I think he understood that what he thought at the time was kinda regular, locker-room banter, now on the big stage of presidential politics looked terrible. I think he was a little angry at himself. It’s also the only time I think that I saw Trump where he actually seemed dejected.

Yahoo News Video Roger Stone, longtime Trump political adviser.

Haberman: It was the only time in my memory that Trump has ever been humiliated, honestly. By that I mean he felt shame in a way that you could identify. It’s the only time I’ve ever seen him experience shame that he couldn’t mask as toughness in some other way.

Stone: I’ve known Donald Trump for 40 years. He doesn’t apologize. During the presidential campaign of 2012, when Mitt Romney issued one of his weekly apologies for something stupid that he did, Trump was tearing his hair out. “What’s wrong with this guy? Why does he keep apologizing?” So it was out of character. I also think at the time, it was politically necessary and it did help quell the, you know, the scandal, as it were.

Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign staff is at the hotel discussing how Clinton should address the “Access Hollywood” tape when Trump’s video is released.

Benenson: We’re all standing at the bar, waiting to see what Trump does — like, there’s a bar in this room. We’re not out in public. But we’re glued to the TV, chilling out after debate prep. We’ve kind of finished our work, waiting, like, what are they gonna do? He hadn’t said anything, which to us was amazing.

Reines: Some of us were in the minority opinion that he was not going to see this as something he wanted to fall on his sword about, since that’s just not his style. And that he would be pretty Trumpish about it.

Benenson: And then you kinda get this midnight hostage video with his phony apology to nobody, in reality.

Reines: We watch it together and for the first minute I was like, “Wow, was I wrong,” because he’s saying all the right things. And then it just went off the rails. It was “Bill Clinton has said worse.” It’s not like we thought he was going to raise the white flag. And his Friday night video statement made clear his mindset.

Yahoo News

Klain: Right after the hostage video, it was obviously clear Trump was staying in the race. It was obviously clear he was coming to the debate on Sunday. And Trump was coming not with his tail between his legs but with his claws bared and we needed to get ready for that. Then the question was should she go out and say something Saturday morning or should we save it for the debate. Our consensus that we reached probably by 1 o’clock in the morning was, let’s just save it for the debate. We didn’t want to give Trump the benefit of the back and forth over the weekend. We wanted the focus to be on him and him coping with it.

Fallon: Why mess with something that was playing out as horribly for him as it possibly could have? She can’t say anything that would carry more weight than members of his own party aren’t saying. We didn’t want to undertake any steps that would cause partisans to retreat back into their corners where Republicans reflexively started defending him just because Hillary attacked him.

Benenson: There’s a rule in politics: When someone is in the middle of a shit storm, you don’t get in the middle of it, right? And you know, this was of such a scale, that we said, well, let’s see if they can wind their way out of it.

Fallon: Let’s have her stay dark, not weigh in. Let’s let this pile-on continue. The added virtue of holding her back and keeping her in reserve, it would ensure that whatever she said at the debate would be the news of the debate.

Haberman: They did recognize that there was there was something fraught about this in terms of her because of her husband. And so Trump and women was always a pretty dangerous area for her. And this was no exception.

It’s the eve of the second presidential debate. Reporters spot several Trump aides and advisers entering Trump Tower early in the morning, including Chris Christie, Kellyanne Conway and Rudy Giuliani. Hillary Clinton returns to the Doral Arrowwood Hotel in Westchester to prepare for Sunday night’s debate. The “Access Hollywood” tape is front-page news around the world. The U.S. government’s declaration that Russia was behind the election hacking is not.

Jeh Johnson: It was below-the-fold news that day, literally, because of the “Access Hollywood” video. I pick up the Post, and I pick up the Times, and it is literally below-the-fold news in both newspapers. I was expecting it to be above the fold, not full-banner, but at least maybe a quarter-banner. And it was below-the-fold news. This was the United States government accusing the Russian government of interfering in our election through cyber-hacking activity. That’s a big deal, and I expected it to be above the fold, and I expected it to be something that would have a lot of currency over the following days. And that it would be a continuing conversation with more questions from the press. How do we know this? What is the extent of it? And so, the press had gone off to the other end of the pasture ’cause of greed and sex and groping.

Chaffetz: I started to realize how much my own comments had been retweeted and spread. I was a little surprised by that.

Fahrenthold: Saturday I’m at the grocery store picking up something for my family, and I saw my phone that Jason Chaffetz, the, you know, then the House Oversight Committee chair, the guy who had given Hillary Clinton so much trouble about Benghazi, someone who was sort of like a moral authority in the Republican Party, said, I think the words were, “I’m out.” You know, “I can’t look my teenage daughter in the eye and say I supported Donald Trump.”

In Westchester, the Clinton campaign is preparing for the debate — and for the inevitable questions about the “Access Hollywood” tape she’ll face at the debate.

Klain: We did a lot of Q&A with her. We obviously spent a lot of time working on revising her Russian answers to try to make them more pointed, drafting and practicing some answers about what we thought were the most likely WikiLeaks-related questions around the Goldman speech and trying to figure out what she should say and how she should say it around the “Access Hollywood” tape. What to say about it. We crafted it that morning. Karen Dunn and Mandy Grunwald took the pen themselves, and I did a lot of the initial drafting. Sometime midmorning, the two of them presented some ideas about the answers, and then Secretary Clinton herself sat in the room and talked through it with us at some length. And then through redrafts we got at her core answers.

Palmieri: She practices what she, you know … we understand that what’s gonna matter is that moment where she confronts him.

10:48 a.m. ET: Trump tweets for the first time since his apology video: “Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!”

Haberman: I volunteered to go stake out Trump Tower. I felt we needed to be there. We obviously were not alone. And It was grim. I mean, we were all sort of in the lobby. All these reporters are hanging out. We couldn’t get word from upstairs. Trump was just cloistered, like, inside the tower. And we would chase people who came in and out. Jared was around despite Shabbat. Ivanka did not come, but Jared did show up. And he went in through a side door so we couldn’t see him. Christie was there at one point; Reince was there at one point. Rudy Giuliani. And Kellyanne Conway. Bannon, I think, was there too. And we all were waiting to see: Would he drop out? What was going to happen?

At some point in the morning, Trump gives an interview to Monica Langley of the Wall Street Journal — the first of two newspaper interviews he does that day. Trump tells Langley there is “zero chance” he will quit the race. “I never, ever give up,” Trump says. “The support I’m getting is unbelievable, because Hillary Clinton is a horribly flawed candidate.” Langley asks how his daughter Ivanka and wife, Melania, reacted to the tape: “I was with Ivanka yesterday; I’m with Melania now. They fully understand, and they’re very loyal.” As for supporters’ reactions, he says, “People get it. They get life.”

Sometime before 11 a.m. ET: Trump calls Robert Costa at the Washington Post, reiterating his refusal to quit the race. “I’ve been here before, I’ll tell ya, in life,” Trump says. “I understand life and how you make it through. You go through things. I’ve been through many. It’s called life. And it’s always interesting.”

11 a.m. ET: Hurricane Matthew makes its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near Myrtle Beach, S.C., as a Category 1 hurricane. Nearly 600 deaths were blamed on the storm, including 548 in Haiti and 47 in the United States, where it caused more than $10 billion in damage — making it then the 10th costliest in U.S. history.

Mid- to late Saturday morning, Trump and his senior staff gather inside his residence on the 64th floor of Trump Tower.

Bossie: There were many of us in the room — Governor Christie, Rudy Giuliani, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, myself, Reince Priebus. Jared and Ivanka would have been there, but it’s during Shabbat and they did not attend. We sat around the room, in a circle and discussed different opportunities that presented themselves. What should we do? What could we have done better? How do we try to get past this to tomorrow night’s debate? With that, Reince came into the meeting late, actually. He was coming up from D.C. He had returned to Washington Friday evening, and he came up on the train Saturday morning.

Conway: Reince was asked by Mr. Trump, “What are you hearing from other people?”

And of course officeholders were all saying what they said. Some unendorsed him. Some never endorsed him. Some said they were going to write in Mike Pence’s name. But he was asked, “What are you hearing from elected officials?”

Bossie: Reince’s position was that things did not look good. That party elders, leadership in the House and Senate and Republican Party, and donors were very nervous, some jumping ship. And he said Trump had two choices: He could lose the biggest electoral landslide in American history or he could drop out of the race and let somebody else be the nominee.

Conway: I think Reince was reflecting, “Here’s what they think. They think that you could lose and that you’ll drag them down with them.”

Bossie: The rest of us were a little bit shocked by the quite candid and honest way he put it. The president’s response was incredible, which was, “You know, Reince, if that’s what the party’s going to do to me, then I’ll lose. They shouldn’t be running away from me. This is something that I will get through and it will not be a problem. But more importantly, Reince, I’m going to win.” That was his response. “I’m going to win.”

Trump went around the room and asked everyone for their opinions.

Bossie: “What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? Gimme a percentage. You know, what am I gonna — am — am — am I in this thing? Am I outta this thing? Everybody give me your percentage.” And, you know, I’m not gonna say what everybody said, but lots of people said, “This is a challenge. This is going to be an uphill fight. A lot of this will depend on tomorrow night’s debate performance.”

Conway: I felt he should stay in the race. Absentee ballots were already being filed in some states, I’m pretty sure. But he should stay in the race unless he felt that he was no longer equipped and willing to be the nominee for the Republican Party. My clinical analysis was, “You’ll take a hit in the polls. But they will always do what the left always does, and what Secretary Clinton always does, which is not come up with a compelling, persuasive, sticky and positive message of her own, and they’re gonna push the envelope too far on this. Everybody will be talking about this. You need to go out and talk about everything else.”

Bossie: I wasn’t quite at 100 percent, but I was close. I said, “If we do these things correctly and the debate performance tomorrow night matters. And if you come out of the debate performance tomorrow night alive and on an upswing, we’re gonna win this thing.” Steve Bannon was the only one in the entire room who said, “100 percent victory, not even a question about it.”

12:56 p.m. ET: Pence changes course from his reaction on Friday night and issues a statement more critical of Trump, saying he can’t defend his running mate: “As a husband and a father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the 11-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people. We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.”

2:58 p.m. ET: Melania Trump releases a statement: “The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.”

3:03 p.m. ET: Tic Tac USA, which Trump name-checked in his discussion with Billy Bush on the “Access Hollywood” bus, releases a statement distancing the company from the Republican nominee: “Tic Tac respects all women. We find the recent statements and behavior completely inappropriate and unacceptable.”

In Wisconsin, Paul Ryan kicks off his rally without Trump or Pence. “There is a bit of an elephant in this room,” Ryan tells the crowd. “It’s a troubling situation, I’m serious, it is.” The house speaker is heckled by Trump supporters throughout his remarks.

Meanwhile, statements from GOP leaders withdrawing their support for Trump trickle in throughout the day.

John McCain, Republican senator from Arizon: “Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.”

John Kasich, Republican governor of Ohio : “Donald Trump is a man I cannot and should not support. The actions of the last day are disgusting, but that’s not why I reached this decision, it has been an accumulation of his words and actions that many have been warning about. I will not vote for a nominee who has behaved in a manner that reflects so poorly on our country. Our country deserves better.”

Fallon: Some of us reacted on Friday night like, “Well, this is just going to be another one of those things where he says something that should be disqualifying but isn’t.” As horrific a statement as it is, we probably shouldn’t get our hopes up too high that this is going to kill his chances because he’s survived other things before: He took on a Gold Star family. He took on a POW, John McCain. But when those statements started rolling in from Republicans it was like, all right, maybe this is real. We’re only a month out from election and you have prominent Republicans unendorsing him.

At the same time, calls grow louder from other members of the party for Trump to step aside in favor of Pence.

Rob Portman, Republican senator from Ohio: “While I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him. I continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency. I will be voting for Mike Pence for President.”

Condoleezza Rice, former secretary of state: “Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw. As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth.”

Cory Gardner, Republican senator from Colorado: “I am committed to defeating Hillary Clinton. The only way this is now possible is with a new nominee that reflects the values of our country and our party. I will not vote for Donald Trump. If Donald Trump wishes to defeat Hillary Clinton, he should do the only thing that will allow us to do so — step aide, and allow Mike Pence to be the Republican Party’s nominee.”

If Donald Trump wishes to defeat Hillary Clinton, he should do the only thing that will allow us to do so - step aside. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/hadKP4gIrr — Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) October 8, 2016

John Thune, Republican senator from South Dakota: “Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.”

Palmieri: There were times where we were concerned about that, just because you have to prepare for that moment in case that happens, and all of a sudden you’re running against Mike Pence, and how are you gonna handle that? But, you know, the people who knew him had told us he might drop out if he thinks he’s going to lose and doesn’t want to be embarrassed, but he’s not gonna drop out when he’s got his back against a wall. He’s not gonna do that. This situation, he’s just gonna fight New York tabloid style and come after you. And, you know, I knew what that looked like.

Back inside Trump Tower, Trump is watching cable TV and growing angrier by the second, upset at the number of Republicans who are turning their back on his campaign.

3:40 p.m. ET: Trump tweets: “The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly – I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA”

The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2016

Conway: He was not going to abandon them just because a bunch of people who didn’t support him in the first place wanted to push him out of the race. He was never going to get out of that race.

Downstairs, the scene outside Trump Tower has become a circus, a mob scene of Trump supporters and protesters who are sparring. The cable networks and other news organizations have reporters and photographers staked out at all public entrances to the building, hoping to keep track of the comings and goings. Because Trump has no formal events, the designated protective poolers have been trying to keep track of rumors that Trump might hold an impromptu rally in New York City that night, but most questions to the campaign are being met with radio silence.

4:30 p.m. ET: With no notice to the media, Trump suddenly appears in the lobby of his building with Conway and Donald Trump Jr. and makes his way through the glass doors to greet supporters outside — the ones who hadn’t abandoned him.

Haberman: He walked out to this little impromptu rally supporting him going on right outside. There were also protesters. I remember being afraid. It was the first time I had actually really felt fear. Not that anything was going to happen. But there was a sort of a sense of danger in the air because he was so wounded. And I felt like he was capable of doing anything at that moment, which was scary.

Surrounded by heavy security, including Secret Service and the NYPD, Trump shakes hands, gives high fives and basks in the glow of his most fervent supporters.

Haberman: He went out into the crowd of people. It was like his Juan Perón moment. They were, like, touching his jacket. And he put his arm up in the air and did the closed-fist power salute. And then he went back inside, and it was like watching somebody get some kind of, like, B-12 injection. There was this sense of excitement.

A reporter asks Trump if he will remain in the race. “One hundred percent,” he replies.

Conway: It doubled his resolve, and it showed his commitment to the people.

Campaigning for Hillary in Wisconsin, Bill Clinton does not mention the Trump tape in his remarks at a rally in Milwaukee. But as hecklers shouting, “You’re a rapist!” are escorted out of the event, Clinton indirectly addresses the controversy. “You gotta feel sorry for them,” he says. “They had a bad day yesterday, give them a hand.”

At some point on Saturday afternoon, Breitbart publishes an interview with Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978. In the interview, which the site claims was filmed at the Watergate Hotel on Friday, Broaddrick is asked about Trump’s remarks on the “Access Hollywood” tape. “Bill Clinton raped me, and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don’t think there’s any comparison,” she said. At one point, she is comforted by another Bill Clinton accuser, Kathleen Willey.

Fallon: It felt like this promotional effort that was going to have something more to it than just this Breitbart interview. The Breitbart interview felt like it was setting the table for something.

At Trump Tower, Bannon tells Bossie of his plan: to have Trump arrive at Sunday’s debate with four women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and rape.

Bossie: It was Steve’s — Steve Bannon’s idea. And it was a brilliant stroke. He called me into his office and told me what his idea was. And I just looked at him like, a combination of fear and brilliance, all wrapped up in one idea. Because it could — you don’t know how it’s gonna play out. You don’t know how it’s gonna go. There’s a lot of moving parts and a lot of downside to it. But we were in a tough spot. We had to be dramatic in our response.

Stone: Bannon and I had talked about this for months — either having them at a debate or having them show up at a Trump rally and be allowed to speak. Steve had read my book “The Clintons’ War on Women.” In fact, Steve had serialized the book at Breitbart. He knew a number of the victims of Bill Clinton were compelling, incredible women. And that if you let them speak, they could be persuasive on their own behalf. So we talked about having them perhaps attend a rally and speak after Trump or before Trump or having them show up at the debates.

Bossie: We’re going to run an operation in St. Louis with these four women who want to come forward and tell their stories for several reasons. One, to get people talking. To get people to talk about Bill Clinton, not Donald Trump, first. Secondly, we want people in her camp to be distracted from allowing her that time in the two or three hours before the debate starts, to have clarity and have a calm time before the biggest debate at that point. We felt that it was a move to get in her head — and her team’s head.

Spencer Platt via Getty Images Donald Trump greets supporters outside Trump Tower on Oct. 8, 2016.

Stone: For several months, Steve had urged us to go out and try to find, you know, outside funding to do an independent effort to put these women up on TV and let them tell their story. That actually never came together. It was an idea, but it never was realized. It was far better, in my opinion, to have them speak under the aegis of the campaign. I don’t think this would have happened but for the Billy Bush tape.

Trump allies also insist it was Clinton who inspired the sideshow weeks earlier by threatening to seat billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner and “Shark Tank” host Mark Cuban, who had been publicly feuding with Trump for months, in the front row at the first presidential debate. Trump countered by saying he might invite Gennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton’s former mistress.

Stone: Remember how this begins. Mark Cuban tweets that he’s gonna be attending the [first] debate and sitting with the Clinton family. Then Donald Trump tweets that maybe he’ll bring Gennifer Flowers.

Conway: They build it as, you know, be there to stick it in the eye of Donald Trump at the debate, you know, so it would distract him, which I think is itself sort of cheap and petty, only because, why is that the point? Why don’t you debate on the issues? If you want to debate on the issues, debate on the issues. But that had started, where then I think somebody mentioned, “Well, then, we’ll just have Gennifer Flowers,” and everybody was freaking out.

On Saturday night, rumors spread about possible defections within the Trump campaign, including speculation about the fate of Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager and most prominent woman in his campaign. She is spotted at Trump Tower but has yet to offer public comments about the “Access Hollywood” tape.

Conway: I felt no need to issue a formal statement. And I think people wanted to hurt Donald Trump by having me, his female campaign manager and a mother, they wanted me to be Joan of Arc and leave his campaign and really show that he was done for. And I’m like him. I’m very loyal. I had no doubt about sticking with him, not one doubt about sticking with him, ever. And I made that very clear to him and his wife and his family, and my colleagues, and Governor and Mrs. Pence, and others. And I always keep the specifics of conversations like that completely private. But I will tell you, I never once flinched.

Back in Westchester, Clinton’s debate prep concludes for the day.

Klain: I think we probably went till 9:30; somewhere between 9 and 10 p.m. that night we broke up. I’ve been doing this for 30 years, and there’s always some answer you practice over and over again and you don’t like, and people say, “Let’s take one more stab at it on debate day.” Particularly around the defense of the Goldman speeches, we were still trying to figure out exactly what to say about the public answer/private answer thing and the open borders thing. I remember after she left that night a group of people trying to tweak those answers again.

Sometime on Saturday night, Haberman receives phone calls from Democratic strategists working with the Clinton campaign.

Haberman: They were cackling. All of them said the exactly same thing: “Aren’t you loving this?” And I said, “No, I’m not loving this. This is horrible. What is there to love about this?” And then they all went on to say, “Well, I’m loving this.” Everything about it was depressing. What he had said was depressing. The tape was depressing. Its existence was depressing. The fact that they were so excited by this was depressing, that they felt this was all just fun. It was all just really terrible.

Late Saturday night, CNN’s KFile publishes a story that in other news cycles might have been a bombshell: “Donald Trump to Howard Stern: It’s okay to call my daughter a ‘piece of ass.’” The network’s investigative arm had unearthed old interviews Trump had given to the shock jock.

“In [one] interview, from September 2004, Stern asks Trump if he can call Ivanka ‘a piece of ass,’ to which Trump responds in the affirmative. … In another, from 2002, Trump boasts about how he’s allowed backstage at the Miss America pageants when contestants are naked.

“‘Before a show, I’ll go backstage and everyone’s getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it,’ Trump tells Stern. ‘You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good. You know, the dresses. “Is everyone OK?” You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. “Is everybody OK?” And you see these incredible-looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.’”

11:35 p.m. ET: “Saturday Night Live” opens its episode with Alec Baldwin mocking Trump’s apology video: “This was way back in 2005,” Baldwin says. “It was 11 years ago back when I was just a young, childish, 59-year-old man.”

Haberman: Somebody I know had talked to one of Trump’s close advisers. And the guy kept saying, “Everybody is trying to kill us, everybody is trying to kill us.” And then the adviser said, “You watch what happens now.”

It’s debate day. The second presidential debate, a town-hall-style event at Washington University in St. Louis, is hours away.

Klain: There was a feeling like this was the pivot point in this thing, and if we could go out there and have a good debate we might really solidify our position. Not have the race be over, but be in a place where this lead could carry us through. That was more the emotional tone. We were busy walking up this mountain, we had finally got a little distance on this mountain, and it was time to go do it. I think it was a pretty task-focused, “let’s go get this done” kind of mentality.

Benenson: We felt Hillary had the upper hand. She was a better debater. The town hall environment gave us, we thought, an advantage, because she was generally better with people in that situation than he was. You know, his rallies, he was not good in town halls. He was not very good with one-on-one. He still isn’t, because he’s a brute and a bully. And he can’t contain that aspect of his personality.

Bossie: He had never debated one-on-one against anyone in his entire life. And then you’re going up against Hillary Clinton, arguably one of the best debaters, one of the most experienced debaters — she had debated Barack Obama one-on-one. I mean, this is somebody who knew the issues inside and out, steeped in policy, and somebody with incredible experience, on one hand, and on the other you had Mr. Trump, who told it like it was. Somebody who spoke from the heart, somebody who could connect directly with the American people through his use of language.

9 a.m. ET: Trump tweets: “Tremendous support (except for some Republican ‘leadership’). Thank you.”

The Sunday shows are consumed by the “Access Hollywood” tape. Echoing the punditry on Friday and Saturday, some guests continue to question if Trump can survive.

Fallon: I remember by Sunday the conversation really was turning in the press — we weren’t trying to stoke it — to the idea of getting him off the ticket. If anything, we were trying to combat the narrative that he even could. We were putting [Clinton campaign lawyer] Marc Elias out there to remind people that there was a federal law that requires states to print out their ballots and send them to overseas voters 45 days out before the election. It was too late to change the ballots to try to get another name out there. So even if they wanted to push him out, [the ballots] had already been sent out. And so we were like engaging in a little information campaign to try to prevent this idea that he could just be replaced from gaining steam lest it actually happen. We didn’t want that to happen. At that point he was being abandoned left and right, he just seemed like a sitting duck, and so the idea of some Hail Mary effort to replace him seemed like the only thing that could screw it up. And so we were trying to prevent that from gaining steam.

Reince Priebus and Kellyanne Conway had been scheduled to appear on several of the Sunday shows, but on Saturday they abruptly cancel. The only Trump representative willing to appear: former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Giuliani says he does not anticipate that Trump will bring up sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton during the debate.

Meanwhile, no one from the Obama administration is asked to appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the Russia announcement.

Clapper: We didn’t get asked. I didn’t get asked to go on talk shows about it.

Chaffetz, though, is.

Chaffetz: I think I got invited to go on almost every Sunday-morning talk show, but I declined them all. I respectfully said I was not available.

Fallon: I think we sort of forgot ourselves in the 36 to 48 hours after that Friday. I think that Friday we were pretty skeptical that any one thing could really wreck him because we had seen him absorb so much before. But then I think we let ourselves convince ourselves that this might be fatal, given how his own party was reacting to it.

11 a.m. ET: Fahrenthold appears on Fox News to discuss the “Access Hollywood” tape.

Fahrenthold: One of the anchors on Fox, her husband is a pitcher for the Orioles, the Baltimore Orioles. You remember Trump had said, “Oh, this is all locker-room talk.” And she said to me after the cameras were off, like, “He’s been in the locker room his whole life. He’s never heard anybody talk like this.”

Finney: The story turned to this conversation about locker-room talk. That “Oh, this is just locker-room talk. That’s just how guys talk.”

Benenson: Let’s correct the record. What Trump did wasn’t talk. This is a guy who also bragged about walking in on the Miss Teenage America pageant because he was the owner and he could inspect the girls. Like, this is a pattern of behavior.

11:22 a.m. ET: Clinton boards her plane for St. Louis. She does not respond to a shouted question about whether Trump should “stand down.”

Andrew Harnik/AP Hillary Clinton boards her campaign plane in White Plains, N.Y., on Oct. 9, 2016, to travel to St. Louis for the second presidential debate.

Sometime around noon: Trump, who had been scheduled to leave for St. Louis around 2 p.m., boards his aircraft hours early — leaving his traveling press pool behind.

Back at the Washington Post, Fahrenthold gets another phone call from someone who saw his appearance on Fox News.

Fahrenthold: I got a call from a guy in Milwaukee who wants to talk about the story, you know, wanted to harangue me. And after a while I hung up on him. I then go home. Later on that day he called the Post again. We later learned he was drunk, and he slurred my name into the automated voicemail system so badly that it didn’t send him to my phone again, it sent him to another guy in sports whose name starts with D. So he leaves a death threat for me on that guy’s voicemail. I don’t think it was ever that serious. The FBI actually interviewed him and he turned out to be drunk when he made the phone call. He didn’t mean anything by it.

Palmieri: There was what I would describe as primal anger on the campaign trail in that I felt — and, you know, we discussed it with the press sometimes, too, because I know that the press felt, whether you were covering Trump or you were covering Hillary — felt like a target. And, you know, it’s like something terrible is gonna happen. You know, we were really concerned, not necessarily for the candidates, but really concerned that someone’s gonna get hurt. Something violent is gonna happen. Things had just really reached a boiling point.

Mit drastischen Worten hat der berühmte Ökonom Joseph Stiglitz die Präsidentschaft von Donald Trump beurteilt

Im Interview mit der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" erklärte er: ""Keine Firma kann mehr kontrollieren, was in den USA geschieht""

Doch Stiglitz warnte auch vor einer gefährlichen Entwicklung in Deutschland

Nobelpreis-Ökonomen sind nicht gut auf Donald Trump zu sprechen. Das gilt vor allem für Paul Krugman, der den US-Präsidenten täglich auf Twitter attackiert und zurechtweist. Und das gilt auch für Joseph Stiglitz.

Der Nobelpreisträger wirft Trump in einem Interview mit der ""Süddeutschen Zeitung"" vor, die regelbasierte Weltordnung irreparabel zu schädigen. ""Trump sagt: Es gibt wieder Grenzen. Ein Land kann jeden Moment einen verrückten Typen wie mich wählen. Waren können dann nicht mehr frei über die Grenzen verkauft werden“, erklärte Stiglitz der Zeitung.

Stiglitz: ""Dass der Erfinder dieses Systems eine Granate hineinwirft, ist erstaunlich“

Jedes Unternehmen gehe bei weltweiten Lieferketten auf einmal ein hohes Risiko ein, so der frühere Chefökonom der Weltbank. ""Keine Firma kann mehr kontrollieren, was in den USA geschieht.“

Dabei seien die Vereinigten Staaten traditionell Vorkämpfer freier Märkte gewesen, so Stiglitz. ""Die USA spielte eine große Rolle beim Aufbau der regelbasierten Weltordnung. Dass der Erfinder dieses Systems eine Granate hineinwirft, ist erstaunlich.“



Stiglitz sieht im Wahlsieg Trumps und dem Erfolg der AfD in Deutschland einen Aufstand der Globalisierungsopfer. ""Die Menschen erkennen, dass die Globalisierung für Unternehmen und Reiche super funktioniert hat, aber nicht für die übrigen Bürger.“

Speziell auf die AfD bezogen erklärte er: ""Es gibt eine ökonomisch begründete Angst in Deutschland. Es gibt jede Menge Leute, die sehr wenig verdienen, deren Einkommen seit Jahren stagnieren und die sehr unglücklich sind. Die Regierungen haben unterschätzt, wie wichtig ein anständiges Einkommen für die Würde der Menschen ist.“

Stiglitz: ""Deutschlands Wachstum ist nicht so großartig wie viele glauben""

Stiglitz rät zu einem politischen Kurswechsel, um den wirtschaftlich Abgehängten zu helfen.

""Deutschland muss die Einkommen der Menschen steigern, die schlecht oder mittelmäßig verdienen“, sagte Stiglitz. Eine Möglichkeit dazu sei ein Konjunkturprogramm mit Investitionen in die Infrastruktur.

Stiglitz forderte zudem einen höheren Mindestlohn. ""Und das Geld dafür ist da, Deutschland erzielt einen Haushaltsüberschuss"", sagte Stiglitz. ""Das Wirtschaftswachstum ist nicht so großartig wie viele glauben.“

Michel Boudrias rose in the House of Commons to contrast what he sees as the ""loose"" cash flow available for the Governor General's office in comparison to ""not one penny"" available for rural Quebec.

""It cost us $53 million last year, in little trips and little canapés. God save the Queen!"" Boudrias said in French of the viceregal post.

""And afterwards, the government has the balls to tell Quebecers that there's no more money for our dairy farmers and that getting cell and internet service to the regions costs too much. Is that what we call being royally ripped off?""

The $53 million figure Boudrias referenced is a combination of the $22.6 million disclosed in the Governor General's financial summary last year and the $31.03 million spent among six federal departments to support former governor general David Johnston's activities.

The sarcasm and royal pun prompted Assistant Deputy Speaker Anthony Rota to confer with a colleague over the Terrebonne MP's language.

""I would remind the members of the House that when one refers to the Queen or to the Governor General, that a certain amount of respect is required and one must be careful in how one addresses those figures,"" Rota said.

The assistant deputy speaker's warning received applause and a standing ovation from some MPs.

Members of the House of Commons stand and applause after Assistant Deputy Speaker Anthony Rota warned member to respect the Queen and Governor General.

As a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces and an elected member of Parliament, Boudrias has recited the Oath of Allegiance to the Queen at least twice, despite being a lifelong sovereigntist.

Military members are required to recite the oath on enrollment. Under the Westminster System, parliamentarians must take it before assuming their seat in the Commons.

Liberal MP David Lametti later dismissed Boudrias' accusations, saying the government has made efforts to improve internet connectivity as well as provided funding and subsidies to Quebec regions.

""'I am just going outside and may be some time...' We knew that Oates was walking to his death... it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman,"" Scott wrote in his diary.
But on the return journey from the Pole, Scott's expedition found rations carefully planted on the journey out had disappeared.
""For too long Scott has been held responsible for the death of himself and the men of his party who made the fateful expedition to the South Pole,"" Turney said.","Was it bad leadership or sabotage that caused the tragic deaths of Scott of the Antarctic and four companions on the ill fated return of his scientific expedition to the South Pole?

And was it covered up?

Long blamed on poor planning on the part of expedition head Robert Scott, the discovery of new documents by a University of NSW researcher may point the finger at another expedition member, and explain why it's has been covered up for over a century.

Professor Chris Turney found documents he said reveal how second in command, Lieutenant Edward (Teddy) Evans, undermined Scott by stealing rations from food depots and failing to pass on orders to a dog sled team that would have brought Scott home safely.

""The new documents suggest at the very least appalling leadership on the part of Evans or, at worst, deliberate sabotage, resulting in the death of Scott and his four companions,"" Turney said.

""The documents also show how public records were altered in later recounts of the expedition and why a Committee of Inquiry into the expedition was rapidly shut down almost before it began.""

It's not the first theory to take the blame off Scott.

In 2012 University of Cambridge and the Scott Polar Research Institute researchers concluded Scott may have returned alive had officers under his command not disobeyed orders he had left for them.

The frozen remains of Scott and his travelling companions were found on November 12, 1912, 10 months after they arrived at the South Pole only to find they weren't the first ones there. A Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had beaten them by just 33 days.

""The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected. Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority,"" Scott wrote in one gloomy entry in his diary.

Robert Falcon Scott Looking Through A Telescope During The Terra Nova Expedition To The South Pole In 1912.

Petty Officer Edgar Evans was the first man to die after he slipped into a coma.

Then a month later, on March 17, crippled with frostbite, Captain Lawrence Oates left the party's tent on his 32nd birthday.

""'I am just going outside and may be some time...' We knew that Oates was walking to his death... it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman,"" Scott wrote in his diary.

""We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far. It seems a pity but I do not think I can write more,"" he wrote a few days later.

Early on, multiple members of Scott's expedition developed doubts about Lieutenant Teddy Evans' role as second in command.

Evans -- pictured here observing with the Theodolite used by Captain Scott to fix the position of The South Pole -- may have sabotaged the expedition, a UNSW research says.

Scott himself described Evans in letters as ""not at all fitted to be second-in-command"", and promised to ""take some steps concerning this"".

Researcher, Professor Turney said it was likely one of the reasons that Scott sent Evans back to base before he pushed on to the South Pole with four companions.

But on the return journey from the Pole, Scott's expedition found rations carefully planted on the journey out had disappeared.

In addition, the updated orders Scott gave to Evans to send a dog team out to meet the returning expedition were seemingly never delivered.

""For Scott and his team, reduced supplies and a failure to follow orders fatally exposed the Polar Party to the extreme conditions they met on the return journey,"" Turney wrote in Polar Record.

""During their final push across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott was anticipating his orders had been acted on and the surviving men would soon meet the dog teams.""

Instead, Scott and his team were left to die alone and starving in a blizzard.

Robert Falcon Scott (1868-1912) naval officer explorer of Antarctic (south pole)

Turney began his hunt while researching his book 1912: The Year the World Discovered Antarctica, drawing on original diaries of the explorers kept by their families and museums.

Evans -- who became the 1st Baron Mountevans -- had a history of taking more than his share of supplies, and public statements were changed to deflect blame from Evans' role in the missing rations after Scott's death.

At the time, the President of the Royal Geographical Society, Lord Curzon, decided not to hold a public committee ofuniver inquiry.

""For too long Scott has been held responsible for the death of himself and the men of his party who made the fateful expedition to the South Pole,"" Turney said.

""These new documents tell a very different story about how Scott's planning for the expedition was undermined, reveal that his orders were fatally ignored and why the man who arguably contributed the most to his death was never held accountable for his actions.""","A Century On, The Death Of This Antarctic Explorer Remains A Mystery",http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/04/a-century-on-the-death-of-this-antarctic-explorer-remains-a-mystery_a_23233222/

It's a town most known for its quaint community markets, and a little doughnut van that somehow everyone in the state knows about, but Berry is fast becoming known for this December festival which has hosted the likes of heavyweight indie acts Jagwar Ma, Japandroids, The Drones, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard and Father John Misty since its inception in 2015. This year will see synthpop kings Client Liaison, groovy indie band Future Islands, rising blues act The Teskey Brothers and beloved outfit The Shins take over the showgrounds on December 8 and 9. Fairgrounds is just two hours' drive from both Sydney and Canberra, the perfect distance for a short road trip, and close to the beach and hinterlands.

The festival also offers amazing food and drink -- including an oyster bar -- family games, a picturesque camping site set on a riverbank, and even a pool.

Inland Sea of Sound, Bathurst, NSW - 3 + 4 November

From the sea to the mountains, Bathurst's Inland Sea of Sound is another boutique event for the older, more discerning music fan. Headlined by Bernard Fanning, Meg Mac and Dan Sultan, the festival is set at the famous Mount Panorama race circuit. It's three hours driving from both Sydney and Canberra, with roadtrippers able to stop at the Blue Mountains National Park, Goulburn or Jenolan Caves along the way, depending on the route taken. A big selection of beers, burgers and cheese await those looking to indulge their stomachs as well as their ears at the music festival, while campers get to pitch their tent right at the top of the mountain.

NYE on the Hill, South Gippsland, Victoria – 30 Dec to 1 Jan

Already a firm favourite on the Victorian music calendar, NYE On The Hill takes place on a hill, on New Year's Eve, surprisingly. A 90-minute drive from Melbourne, the festival will feature Ball Park Music, Regurgitator, Gold Class, Gretta Ray and a swag of other rising talents to usher in 2018. NYE On The Hill takes place on a family farm, with rolling green hills. The area is also known for its beautiful sunsets, so much so that an entire page on the festival's website is devoted to pictures.

Lost Paradise, Glenworth Valley, NSW - NYE

For a different type of New Year's Eve, check out Lost Paradise, nestled secretly in the gorgeous Glenworth Valley on the NSW Central Coast. Less than two hours outside Sydney, the festival rests deep inside a lush valley between mountains, with picturesque scenery and a very convenient river to swim, lounge and cool down in. HuffPost Australia went in 2016, and found a giant party in the bush -- we called it like ""a big backyard party spiralled out of control; in the best way possible"". To usher in 2018, the biggest lineup yet includes Rufus, Matt Corby, DMA's, Little Dragon, Cut Copy and heaps more. Take a slow drive up, stop off at beautiful forests along the way or even detour out to the coast to check out beaches in northern Sydney or the Central Coast, and prepare for a very cool weekend.

Falls Festival - NYE

One of the senior statesmen of the Australian circuit, the Falls festivals are still going strong after more than 20 years. The New Year's Eve events take place in four locations nationwide, in Byron Bay, Lorne, Marion Bay and Fremantle. The 2017 edition will be headlined by Fleet Foxes, Angus and Julia Stone, Flume and The Kooks, with an impressive roster of other acts including Run The Jewels, Foster The People, Liam Gallagher and even Daryl 'Horses' Braithwaite.

The picturesque locations for each Falls instalment have long been a major drawcard for those who want to stretch their three-day festival experience into a week-long (or more) holiday up or down the coast, stopping off at beaches or little towns along the way. A few of the Falls dates have already sold out, but be quick and you might be able to get cracking on a festival road trip of your own.

Queenscliff Music Festival, Queenscliff, Victoria - November 24-26

For something a little different, check out QMF, focused on more eclectic and thoughtful acts. Situated in Queenscliff, Victoria, just outside Geelong, it's just a short drive from Melbourne and right on the coast. Take a drive down, see the sights on the way, then settle in for some good listening -- Bernard Fanning, The Bamboos, The Temper Trap, The Beautiful Girls and a special performance from members of Yothu Yindi are the standout headline acts, ably supported by a cast of up-and-comers like GL, Didirri and A.B. Original collaborator Caiti Baker.

Festival Of The Sun, Port Macquarie, NSW - December 7-9

Keen on the NSW north coast? Check out Festival of the Sun at Port Macquarie. Set in a caravan park within stone's throw of the beach, it's a chill, laidback vibe. Laze around in the pool or in the surf, catch a few bands (or waves), and crack into a few drinks -- it's even BYO booze. Acts on the bill include The Preatures, Horrorshow, Bad Dreems and Meg Mac, and besides that, you've got the beautiful and sunny north coast to check out on your way there or your way home.",Seven Music Festivals To Take A Road Trip To This Summer,http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/05/seven-music-festivals-to-take-a-road-trip-to-this-summer_a_23233260/

OTTAWA — The prime minister accused opponents on Saturday of ""stoking national divisions"" through their reactions to TransCanada's decision to cancel its Energy East Pipeline plans.

Justin Trudeau said in a Facebook post that critics who attribute the proposed project's cancellation to government regulation ""ignores the obvious.""

""Aside from its being intellectually dishonest, the reflexive stoking of regional tensions is a political dead end. The Conservative party, formerly the Reform Party, trod that road in its infancy. It was a road better left abandoned,"" Trudeau stated in the post.

See the full post below:

Trudeau also pointed out that when Energy East was first proposed, the global supply of crude was relatively tight.

He ended the post with a warning that festering regional tensions bound the country in ""paralyzing unity debates"" from the 1970s through the 1990s.

""Let's not go backwards, simply because speaking from anger is an easy response to disappointing news,"" Trudeau said.

Conservative reaction

Conservative M-P Michelle Rempel, who represents a Calgary riding, responded that if there are regional divisions that arise from government policy, Trudeau must take the blame.

""I've watched them go the wall for Bombardier, yet my province has been suffering for two years now and there's been very little focus in doing anything for it,"" Rempel said in an interview Saturday.

The pipeline would have carried western crude from the Alberta oilsands to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John, NB, as well as an export terminal, but TransCanada cancelled it Thursday, citing changed circumstances.

TransCanada said in a letter to the National Energy Board that it was abandoning the project because of the board's decision to allow hearings to consider greenhouse gas emissions from producing and processing the oil it transports in the pipeline.

Canadians 'deserve better than a discussion in which leaders leap to capitalize on perceived regional slights, regardless of context or facts.' Justin Trudeau

The premiers of Alberta and New Brunswick have expressed disappointment, while Quebec politicians, along with Indigenous and environmental groups, welcome the project's demise.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer responded with his own Facebook post late Saturday, where he called Energy East a ""nation-building project"" and disputed Trudeau's claim the pipeline was cancelled for business reasons.

""TransCanada, the proponent for the Energy East Pipeline, has said explicitly that it was the regulatory changes introduced by Trudeau that caused the firm to cancel the project,"" Scheer said in his Facebook post.

""(Trudeau) should take responsibility, and explain why he wanted this project cancelled, instead of shifting the blame.""

Trudeau noted Saturday that his government has approved two major oil export pipelines that are now under construction, and that a third is expected to move forward soon. He said Canadians ""deserve better than a discussion in which leaders leap to capitalize on perceived regional slights, regardless of context or facts.""

""We don't get far — we never have gotten far — by pitting one region against another, or one group against another. We succeed when we work together, as Canadians. And that absolutely requires a give and take,"" Trudeau said in the post.

The Conservatives have said TransCanada's decision to cancel the project is the result of what they call ''disastrous'' Liberal energy policy.

Rempel said that when she in the previous Conservative government, former prime minister Stephen Harper urged ministers to make sure their policy decisions were always in the best interest of the entire country.

""A strong Alberta has always been a strong Canada, just as a strong Quebec has always been a strong Canada,"" Rempel said.

Some industry analysts have questioned the need for the Energy East project after other pipelines were green-lighted, such as TransCanada's Keystone XL project, which received U.S. approval to transport oil from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

But the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said all the pipelines are needed, predicting in June that national oil production will climb by 33 per cent by 2030.",Trudeau Warns Against 'National Divisions' After Energy East Pipeline Decision,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/10/07/trudeau-pipeline-decision_a_23236202/

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Was ich lernte, als ich in Deutschland Flüchtlinge unterrichteteAuch mir ist das im Unterricht schon passiert.","Seit vier Monaten unterrichte ich in Mannheim Deutsch, alle meiner Schüler sind Flüchtlinge. Obwohl mir das Unterrichten großen Spaß macht, habe ich viele traurige Beobachtungen gemacht.

Asylsuchende werden in zwei Gruppen aufgeteilt: Flüchtlinge mit und Flüchtlinge ohne

Bleibeperspektive. Im Laufe meines Lehrerdaseins fiel mir auf, dass Flüchtlinge aus Syrien, Iran, Irak, Eritrea und Somalia, Flüchtlinge mit Bleibeperspektive, meistens enthusiastischer sind als Flüchtlinge aus Afghanistan oder dem Balkan.

Grund hierfür ist, dass Asylsuchende mit Bleibeperspektive Deutschland mittlerweile als ihre Heimat ansehen. Für sie ist es daher selbstverständlich, unsere Sprache zu lernen. Das trifft jedoch nicht auf die übrigen Flüchtlinge zu.

Sie sind verunsichert, wie es mit Ihnen weitergeht. Angela Merkel sagte schließlich bereits 2015: ""Deutschland kann nicht alle Flüchtlinge aufnehmen"".

Das ist der Grund, warum einige Schüler nach wenigen Wochen keine Lust mehr auf den Unterricht haben, zu spät oder auch gar nicht mehr auftauchen.

Er weiß nicht, wie es mit ihm weitergeht

Alle meine Schüler sind Männer. Viele von ihnen kommen aus Gambia und Nigeria. Einer von ihnen, Taru, ist Nigerianer und Christ. Taru kam nach Deutschland, weil er in seiner Heimat nicht mehr sicher ist.

Seit er an Demonstrationen gegen die aktuelle muslimische Regierung teilnahm, schwebt er in Lebensgefahr. Grund der Proteste war die Forderung der Unabhängigkeit für den christlichen Teil Nigerias.

Würde man Taru zurückschicken, erklärte er mir neulich, sei er ein toter Mann. Taru wohnt seit 10 Monaten in einem Camp in Deutschland. Sein Asylverfahren läuft noch, aber er lebt in Ungewissheit. Er weiß nicht, wie es mit ihm weitergeht. Er befürchtet, dass die ganzen Monate der Integrationsbemühungen und des Deutschlernens völlig umsonst waren.

Die Unsicherheit frustriert ihn enorm. Taru war zu Beginn sehr begeistert im Unterricht und wir sind gut miteinander ausgekommen. Doch im letzten Monat des Sprachkurses wurde er immer demotivierter und missmutiger. Ich nahm ihn irgendwann zur Seite und fragte, was mit ihm los sei.

Er antwortete: ""Ich bin hierher gekommen, weil mir zugesichert worden ist, dass man in Deutschland und Europa die Menschenrechte achtet. Doch dann komme ich hierher und das Erste, was mir mein Sozialarbeiter sagt, ist: 'Such dir ne Frau, sonst kannst du nicht hierbleiben!'

Von vielen meiner Schüler höre ich nie wieder was

Menschen wie Taru fragen sich dann zurecht, was es überhaupt für einen Sinn hat, den

Deutschunterricht und die Integrationskurse zu besuchen. Unsere Sprache ist nicht gerade einfach. Noch dazu kommt, dass die afrikanische und die deutsche Kultur unterschiedlicher nicht sein könnten.

Die afrikanischen Flüchtlinge empfinden die Deutschen als sehr verschlossen. Wenn sie

versuchen, mit den Einheimischen in Kontakt zu treten, erleben sie meist nur Ablehnung. Selbst die Betreuer überlassen die Flüchtlinge meistens sich selbst und sprechen mit ihnen nur über das Nötigste.

Wie sollen sich diese Menschen für das Deutsch lernen begeistern, wenn niemand mit ihnen Deutsch sprechen möchte?

Wenn sie in ihrem Alltag kein Deutsch benötigen und sie keine Aussicht auf eine Zukunft in Deutschland haben, sehen sie verständlicherweise keinen Sinn darin, die Kurse zu besuchen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Ich unterrichte eine Flüchtlingsklasse - alle, die die Integration schaffen, haben eine Sache gemeinsam

Von vielen meiner Schüler höre ich nie wieder etwas. Sie sind einige Wochen lang im Unterricht und werden dann in eine andere Stadt gebracht. Dort versuchen sie dann sich an die neue Umgebung zu gewöhnen und ihr Leben nochmal neu zu gestalten.

Doch mit einigen halte ich auch über die Kurse hinaus Kontakt. Für fünf meiner ehemaligen Schüler versuche ich gerade, einen Ausbildungsplatz zu organisieren.

Einige sind einfach von den Bedingungen in Deutschland enttäuscht

Wenn sie einen Ausbildungsplatz in einem Unternehmen ergattern können, bekommen sie mit höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung und dürfen in Deutschland bleiben.

Doch für die meisten Flüchtlinge ist es nicht leicht, an einen normalen Ausbildungsplatz zu kommen. Um an Geld zu kommen, arbeiten sie für einen niedrigen Lohn im Camp oder suchen sich andere Verdienstquellen. Einige wenige dealen mit Drogen - das sehe ich ihnen im Unterricht an.

Ohne richtige Arbeit versuchen sie dann, mit anderen Maßnahmen an eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung zu kommen. So erschreckend es klingt, aber in ihrer Verzweiflung versuchen manche, sich an Frauen heranzumachen.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Was ich lernte, als ich in Deutschland Flüchtlinge unterrichtete

Auch mir ist das im Unterricht schon passiert. Ich habe diese Schüler dann auch zurecht

gewiesen, was mir auch glücklicherweise gelang. Im Laufe der Monate habe ich es geschafft, mich als Respektsperson zu etablieren.

Auch eine Kollegin von mir und unsere Sekretärin haben schon Heiratsangebote bekommen. Dass unser Asylsystem sie zu solchen Schritten zwingt, ist auch für sie total unverständlich.

Einige sind daher einfach von den Bedingungen in Deutschland enttäuscht.

Australia's national gun amnesty has taken 51,000 unregistered guns off the streets, slashing the country's number of illegal firearms by one-fifth.

The federal government ran its gun amnesty -- where citizens could hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms, without fear of punishment, to be destroyed -- between July and September. During the three month period, tens of thousands of guns were surrendered to authorities including pistols, rifles, shotguns and some rather exotic firearms.

""The firearms surrendered under the amnesty ranged from historic pre-1900 weapons and guns from both World Wars, to modern semi‑automatic firearms, a homemade machine‑gun and even a rocket launcher,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement on Friday, in announcing the results of the amnesty.

""A number of more unusual items were also handed in. These included a sawn-off shotgun found at a local tip in 1995, a handgun used in the early 1900s for personal protection, a pistol small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, and a heavily modified Russian shotgun.""

The amnesty was the the first national scheme of its type since the Port Arthur shooting in 1996, where the government held a buyback of guns to get firearms off the streets. After the Port Arthur shooting 21 years ago, where 35 people died when a lone gunman opened fire with an assault rifle, Australia brought in strict and controversial gun laws including banning semi-automatic rifles and shotguns.

Prior to the amnesty, authorities estimated there were around 260,000 unregistered guns in Australia. The 51,000 unregistered guns surrendered in the amnesty, which Turnbull called an ""overwhelming response"", would represent almost one-fifth of this number.

""Australia has some of the strongest gun laws in the world but illicit firearms remain a threat to community safety. As a result of this successful amnesty, there are now 50,000 fewer firearms on the streets,"" Turnbull said.

""The Turnbull Government is continuing the Howard legacy of strong gun control laws. We are also seeking to increase penalties for gun traffickers, including with mandatory minimum sentences... This amnesty has succeeded in keeping Australians safe, and confirms the resolute commitment of the Turnbull Government to national security.""

While the amnesty finished at the end of September, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin still urged people to surrender any illegal firearms they might still possess.

""If there are members of the public who still have firearms that they're concerned about, I would strongly encourage them to make contact with their local police across different jurisdictions,"" he told a press conference.

""There are continuing amnesties across jurisdictions.

News recently broke that the final season’s episodes could come in at around $15 million each, and that the show will bring back directors Miguel Sapochnik and David Nutter.

“We assembled a team of directors this year who have been in charge of some of our big episodes in the past,” John Bradley, who plays Sam Tarly on the show, told HuffPost. “Miguel and David have done some of the standout episodes of previous seasons. Clearly every single episode of the six you’ve got left in Season 8 is gonna be monumental and needs somebody at the helm who’s done that kind of high-stakes, high-octane direction before for us.”

“I think what we used to call Episode 9 in ‘Game of Thrones’ folklore — the episode when everything comes to a head and you get a lot of spectacular sequences — I think you’re gonna get six ‘Episode 9s’ this year,” Bradley added. “You can tell that because we’ve got directors who have been in charge of some of the most huge setpieces in the past doing episodes all throughout the season.”

Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss are set to direct the finale, which Bradley calls “poetic.”

“It’s in the right hands there,” the actor said. “They know everything about the show. They’ve been in charge of everything ― every key decision in all seven seasons so far has been made by David and Dan. I think they’ve done an incredible job with this series. They deserve everything they get, and they deserve the right to finish this show off in the way they see fit. I don’t think there’s anybody better qualified, so I can’t wait.”

The actor continued talking to HuffPost about “Game of Thrones,” explaining the reason Sam seemed to take credit for Gilly’s (Hannah Murray) big discovery on the show, and opened up about his upcoming project, “American Satan,” a supernatural thriller about a rock band that may find itself in an actual deal with the devil.

How do you fit in other projects while doing “Game of Thrones”?

It’s a little different this year because the way the schedule works out, but usually you have the last six months of the year taken by “Game of Thrones,” and the first six months of the year you’re pretty much free to do whatever you want. So that’s been nice over the last few years ― the fact that we have all this time to play around with things and do different projects and venture into slightly uncharted territory as far as our careers are concerned, but knowing that we have this security, that we have this brilliant thing to go back to in the last six months of the year. That’s kind of a really nice comfort blanket.

We filmed [“American Satan”] a long time ago now. We filmed it spring 2016 — March, April 2016. Yeah, it was a long time ago. This is the way they go with movies, the fact that you filmed them so long ago. You’ve kind of forgotten about them and you kind of have to refresh your memory before you can talk about them again. “American Satan,” we’re talking a good 18 months ago now.

So how did you refresh your memory?

By just reading the original script again, watching the movie for the first time, and kind of being reminded of that shooting experience, which was a strange shooting experience. On “Game of Thrones,” we’re so used to having lots of time to shoot and a lot at our disposal, and “American Satan” was a little bit different, much more kind of a self-sufficient, resourceful thing going on. We had to shoot when we could on this project in this slightly less formulaic way. It’s a much less orthodox way of filming than I’m used to.

That’s one of the things that first attracted me to it. I’ve done indie movies before, and I often like the kind of danger of them, that little bit of uncertainty, and that little bit of energy that comes from a group of people who have to make choices artistically and solve problems artistically when you don’t necessarily have a lot of money to throw at a problem.

What can you tell us about your character, Ricky Rollins?

All the characters that I play tend to be in quite dark places, psychologically, and [don’t have] that much faith in themselves. They’re crippled by self-doubt or low self-esteem or envy of other people or a dissatisfaction with life. They’re such great characters to play because you can deal with internal conflict, and you can deal with all those dark psychological areas a character like Samwell, especially, basically inhabits.

The thing that I found refreshing about this film is that I play a character for the first time really [who’s] beaming with self-confidence. He’s absolutely overflowing with self-confidence. He has absolute belief in himself and it may be deluded. It may be completely misguided belief in his own ability, but he has them. He can go into any room in any situation and take it by the scruff of the neck because he believes he is Superman. He believes he is bulletproof. This guy has not got any of that crippling Samwell Tarly self-doubt. He’s got absolute — perhaps wrongfully, but — absolute belief in himself.

Malcolm McDowell is in this movie. Did you talk about “A Clockwork Orange,” or is that taboo to bring up?

Twelve months before “American Satan” started shooting, I really became a kind of [Stanley] Kubrick obsessive ... then when I found out Malcolm McDowell was in this movie I was so desperate to get him to talk about it, and so I thought, “I’m gonna ask him everything. This is going to be direct about what it’s like to work with Stanley Kubrick.” And then I thought, “Well, maybe he wants to get away from all that. Maybe he talked enough about ‘A Clockwork Orange.’ Maybe he just sees that as one movie in his career, and he’s done lots of other great things he might want to talk about. Maybe he’s sick of talking about Kubrick.”

I kind of danced around the issue for a long time, and I wanted to bring it up so often — just kind of pin him down and get him on my own where I could finally ask him the question, “What was it like?” and hopefully he has some stories about him. I knew I had to walk on eggshells around [McDowell] a little bit because he may not be quite fond of me. I found out he’s very, very happy to talk about Stanley Kubrick.

I think he’s still incredibly proud to have worked with him and have that association with him. He told a famous story about Kubrick trying to con Malcolm out of money [...] I heard that story before when I was getting beamed into my Kubrick fascination, but to hear it from Malcolm and to hear him talk about those days in vivid detail, I really got an impression of what it was like to work with Kubrick.

In “Game of Thrones” Season 7, there’s a scene where Gilly seems to uncover that Prince Rhaegar had an annulment, but Sam cuts her off. Then he brings up that info later to Bran. A lot of people on Twitter were upset, but what do you think about what happened?

Sam hasn’t consciously plagiarized Gilly’s idea there. He’s not giving her the elbow. He’s not really necessary taking credit for someone else’s work because … Sam heard that because he’s so good at processing information now. He can take information in, almost subconsciously, and almost without thinking about it. His eyes and his ears are constantly attuned to absorbing information, so he’s able to absorb that without even necessarily thinking about it. Sam is like a radio, and if there’s information in the air, he will pick it up, and he will store it whenever he needs it.

It’s not about him ... taking credit for her idea. He probably wasn’t even aware of where he heard that information. He just knows he heard it somewhere in the air, and he was able to pick it up and process it.

What I will say that in fairness, Gilly did tell Sam that, and Sam didn’t necessarily say that Gilly was the one who started that, but Jorah Mormont didn’t go back to Daenerys saying Samwell Tarly cured him of greyscale. He’s not gone back there name-checking Sam for saving his life. He’s not mentioned the name Samwell Tarly to Jon Snow or Daenerys, so Sam’s not getting his credit there for something he actually did.

Although Sam is taking a little bit of credit for something that he didn’t do, he’s also not getting credit for something that he actually did, so I think in terms of the equilibrium, he’s getting just the right amount of credit from a slightly different source than he probably deserved.

A Year On And Theresa May Has Delivered Nothing But A Weak And Wobbly Government One year of Theresa May is as good a proof as any that Britain is held back by the Tories.

Sie blickt aufs Smartphone, während ihre zwei Monate Tochter vor ihr auf einer Decke liegt

Im Internet schlug ihr dafür viel Kritik entgegen - ohne dass jemand die Geschichte hinter dem Bild kannte

Das Internet kann ein ziemlich mieser Ort sein. Vor einiger Zeit verbreitete sich ein Bild von Molly Lensing und ihrer Tochter im Internet und wurde wild diskutiert.

zut

Ein fremder Mann hatte die junge Mutter am Flughafen in Colorado fotografiert, als Lensing und ihre damals zwei Monate alte Tochter Anastasia auf dem Rückweg von einem Familienbesuch waren.

Lensing sitzt wartend in der Halle und blickt auf ihr Smartphone, vor ihr auf dem Boden liegt ihr Baby auf einer Decke. Der Mann stellte das Bild bei Facebook ein und schrieb dazu: ""Ich fürchte mich vor dem Tag, an dem die Technologie über die Menschlichkeit triumphieren wird. Auf der Welt wird es nur noch eine Generation aus Idioten geben. - Albert Einstein.""

Foto: Facebook

Es dauerte nicht lange, bis die Internet-User schonungslos ihre Meinung zu dem Bild kundtaten. Sie verurteilten die Mutter und kritisierten, Lensing habe wohl mehr Interesse an ihrem Smartphone als an ihrem eigenen Kind.

Lensing war geschockt, wie sehr ihre Privatsphäre verletzte wurde

Weil das Bild sich so schnell verbreitete, dauerte es nicht lange, bis Lensing das Bild selbst entdeckte - und geschockt war, wie sehr ihre Privatsphäre verletzt worden war.

➨ Mehr zum Thema: Eine Schwangere wurde aus einem Restaurant geworfen - wegen ihres T-Shirts

Dass alle sie verurteilten, obwohl niemand wusste, in welcher Situation das Bild entstanden war, verletzte sie zutiefst.

Nun hatte sie das Bedürfnis, die Geschichte hinter dem Bild mit der Öffentlichkeit zu teilen. ""Wir hatten das Pech, am Flughafen festzusitzen, weil es an diesem Tag einen Systemabsturz gab"", sagte Lensing gegenüber ""TODAY Parents"", einem Format des Nachrichtensenders NBC.

(Im Video: ""Ich schämte mich für meine lauten Kinder - dann sagte ein Kindertherapeut diese 5 Worte zu mir""; der Text geht darunter weiter)





""Ich habe Anastasia mehrere Stunden im Arm gehalten und in ihrem Babyträger getragen""

Ihre Flüge hätten Verspätung gehabt und sie sei zusätzlich noch mehrfach umgebucht worden, sodass sie über 20 Stunden an verschiedenen Flughäfen habe warten müssen, sagte sie - und das mit einem zwei Monate altem Kind.

""Ich habe Anastasia mehrere Stunden im Arm gehalten und in ihrem Babyträger getragen"", erzählte Lensing. ""Meine Arme waren müde und sie musste sich ausstrecken. Und ich musste meiner Familie mitteilen, wo ich bin - sie hatten sich schon gefragt, wo wir bleiben.""

Ein Fremder Mann respektierte nicht ihre Privatsphäre

All das schien den fremden Mann nicht zu interessieren, der sie ohne ihre Erlaubnis fotografierte - und er machte sich auch nicht die Mühe, sie zu fragen. Er sah sie und verurteilte sie auf der Stelle.

Irgendein Mann, der nicht wusste, dass sie schon seit 20 Stunden mit ihrer Tochter festsaß. Ein Fremder, der es nicht lassen konnte, sich einzumischen.

Er schoss das Foto und stellte es ins Internet - vermutlich ohne darüber nachzudenken, wie sich die Mutter dabei fühlen könnte.

Lensing hatte kurz zuvor bei einem neuen Arbeitgeber als Kinderkrankenschwester angefangen.

""Ich hatte solche Angst, dass meine Mitarbeiter oder mein Chef dieses Bild und die Kommentare sehen und dann vielleicht denken, ich sollte nicht mehr mit Kindern arbeiten"", sagte sie ""TODAY Parents"". ""Aber zum Glück ist das nie passiert.""

Lensing bekam Unterstützung von anderen Müttern

Bei all der Kritik bekam Lensing aber von Anfang an auch viel Unterstützung von anderen Müttern. Mary Katherine Backstrom, Bloggerin bei Mom Babble setzte sofort einen Kommentar unter das Bild, in dem sie Lensing in Schutz nahm.

""Nein, einfach nein"", schrieb Backstrom. ""Man sollte keine Fotos von erschöpften Müttern am Flughafen machen - und sie dann auch noch in der Öffentlichkeit bloßstellen. Das ist widerlich und muss aufhören.""

Backstrom ist selbst Mutter und kennt diese Situation sehr gut: ""Mein Flug hatte auch schon mal Verspätung, ich hatte kein einziges Mal meine Augen zugetan und ich hatte Angst, dass mein Baby vielleicht aus meinen Armen fallen würde, wenn ich weg döse"", schreibt sie.

Das Original-Bild wurde inzwischen von Facebook gelöscht - trotzdem wird es immer noch kopiert und geteilt. Lensing müsse sich noch immer mit negativen Kommentaren auseinandersetzen, sagte sie ""TODAY Parents"".

""Ich ignoriere die Bilder und die Kommentare und suche Halt bei denen, die wissen, wie ich wirklich bin"", sagte Lensing.

Last month, the Daily Mail claimed that Kim had pulled out of playing Samantha Jones in a third big-screen adaptation of ‘Sex And The City’, due to producers failing to meet her apparent “diva demands”.

In response, Kim said she’d made no “demands” but had simply decided not to do the film.

‘Sex And The City’ fans have been divided over the news, with some arguing that Kim should give them one last outing as Samantha (particularly after ‘Sex And The City 2’ proved to be such a dud), and others claiming it’s her right to not take part if she doesn’t want to.

But it seems Kim is done with the conversation completely now, publicly urging one fan to “move on” from the topic.

One fan tweeted her saying he was “confused” after reading she said she was “too old” to play Samantha, despite her having spoken out about Hollywood ageism in the past, to which she responded: “I’ve played ‘SAM’ for 20 years. Am moving on & so should you.”

Perhaps sensing the tweet would get media attention (or maybe we shouldn’t be so cynical), she then urged him to watch her more recent series, ‘Sensitive Skin’, on Netflix.

‘Sex And The City’ cast members Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis have both expressed their disappointment that the film was ultimately canned, with SJP saying: “We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.

“It’s not just disappointing that we don’t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.”

By way of response, Kim admitted she thinks her former co-star “could have been nicer” about her decision not to return.

In the rush to remember the Mahatma on his birth anniversary, it is easy to forget one of MK Gandhi's most ardent followers, also born this day and a leading light of independent India.

Lal Bahadur Shastri, India's second prime minister, who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru in 1964, enters his 114th year on 2 October 2017, with muted remembrance from the nation, though his legacy as an astute statesman is more pertinent than ever in the prevailing political climate.

Born Lal Bahadur Varma, in 1904, to Sharada Prasad and Ramdulari Devi, he discarded his caste name and opted for the simple epithet of the scholar — ""shastri"" — after he becoming acquainted with Gandhi's anti-caste philosophy. Shastri's name had come up in the public discourse earlier this year during a controversy that erupted over the re-naming of Mughal Sarai railway station in Uttar Pradesh.

In a bitter battle of ideologies, Shastri was pitted by the Congress against Deen Dayal Upadhay, a right-wing thinker who has been resurrected for his centenary year by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre and in the states it rules. But the differences between the two men could not have been starker.

As an earlier piece on HuffPost India pointed out, born a Kayastha, Shastri grew up in a milieu that valued perhaps that most robust expression of Bharatiya sanskar (a virtue the BJP and its allies have appropriated according to its whims): the joint family.

Shastri's mother, widowed at a young age when he was only a year old, moved to his grandfather's place, who also died within a couple of years. Since then, the family was looked after by a cousin of his mother's, well enough for Shastri to have eventually become the prime minister of the country.

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, we haven't heard the last of his humble origins and, in contrast, the ills of the dynastic behemoth that is the Congress. While both statements are true to an extent, if you are looking for a politician of humble origins who soared to unexpected heights by dint of sheer hard work, you have to start with Shastri.

As a child, Shastri had a syncretic upbringing, studied Urdu under a maulavi, and later went on to work in the independence movement actively. A participant of the Salt Satyagraha in 1930, he had dropped out of a government school, inspired by Gandhi's call to students to join the Congress. He would end up spending over two years in prison for his involvement in revolutionary activities, before eventually rising through the ranks of his party.

After Nehru died in office, Shastri was chosen as his successor over the right-leaning Morarji Desai for his firm belief in Nehruvian socialism as an instrument of social change. He had already been the minister for transport, during which time women were allegedly appointed as conductors for the first time.

Noted for his quiet demeanour, Shastri had a firm sense of self. ""Perhaps due to my being small in size and soft of tongue, people are apt to believe that I am not able to be very firm,"" he had once said. ""Though not physically strong, I think I am internally not so weak.""

It was this inner fortitude that allowed him to take momentous decisions, such as steering a nation through the war with Pakistan in 1965, helping it recover its morale from the humiliating defeat in 1962 against the Chinese, and inspiring the public to collective action to tackle a crippling food shortage in the 1960s. When revolts erupted in Madras during his term over fears of imposition of Hindi as national language, mirroring a familiar discontent of our time, Shastri stepped in decisively to restore harmony.

Like a true leader of the people, Shastri stepped down from the role of railways minister in 1956, after a devastating accident led to the death of over 150 people in Tamil Nadu. Such a decision, which may have appeared obvious to a man of his integrity and conscientiousness, must seem odd to the leaders of today. India's last railway minister was removed from his portfolio after many more had died this year alone in a series of mishaps and tragedies that continue to wreak havoc across the country.

""Perhaps due to my being small in size and soft of tongue, people are apt to believe that I am not able to be very firm""

Among the several highlights of Shastri's career were his initiatives to create a dairy and farming revolution in India in a bid to make it self-sufficient in milk production and agriculture. ""In the long run, the economic condition of the country will improve only if we plan the economy in a rational and scientific manner,"" he'd said, without losing focus from the industrial growth of the nation.

Shastri died, allegedly under mysterious circumstances, in Tashkent, of a cardiac arrest, a day after signing a major international treaty. Leaders like him, always hard to find, are now a vanishing generation.

À l'époque, le cliché de son corps reposant à Vallegrande a fait le tour du monde. Le ""martyr"" de Cuba est alors devenu un an après, l'idole de toute une génération contestataire. Antoine, 20 ans, étudiant en histoire à Tolbiac et casque bluetooth vissé sur les oreilles, secoue la tête pour appuyer son premier propos et ajoute: ""Aujourd'hui, ça ne prend plus. La logique belliciste systématique du Che a terni le symbole"".

Si Antoine n'a pas souhaité être filmé, certains de ses camarades et des étudiants d'autres universités ont accepté de parler à notre caméra. Et de constater avec nous, que plus grand-monde parmi la jeunesse, ne se souciait encore d'El guerillero heroico, comme vous pouvez le voir dans notre vidéo ci-dessus.

Pour Daniel Pinos, membre des libertaires et syndicalistes indépendants de Cuba, habitué des allers-retours dans l'État insulaire et ami du petit-fils du Che décédé en 2015, ce désintérêt s'explique par le déclin du mouvement révolutionnaire, amorcé dans les années 70. Interrogé par le Huffpost, il raconte: ""L'image du Che est alors beaucoup moins utilisée sur les banderoles ou si elle est brandie, c'est dans des manifestations sans rapport avec l'idéologie du Che. On la voit moins sur la couverture des journaux aussi. [...] Et les révélations qui sont faites sur lui post-mortem, notamment sur les exactions qui ont été commises sous ses ordres, altèrent l'image du héros martyr qu'on avait de lui.""

À tel point que même son petit-fils, Canek Sanchez Guevara rejettera en bloc l'héritage du grand-père, épousant à son compte la culture rock puis punk. Comme pour se défaire d'un passé trop lourd qui n'améliore pas l'avenir.

Pas étonnant du coup que 50 ans plus tard, les étudiants de ces mêmes universités qui l'adulaient auparavant, ne brandissent plus réellement le Che comme un héros inspirant. Et n'en sachent pas plus sur lui que ce que la culture générale impose. ""Si je ne l'avais pas vu en cours d'espagnol, je ne le connaîtrais peut-être même pas"", nous avoue une étudiante sur les marche du Panthéon.

Une photo connue dans le chapitre ""Amérique Latine"" d'un livre de cours d'espagnol, et un briquet bariolé à la pause café. Voilà peut-être ce qu'il reste du ""Che""pour la jeunesse de 2017.

Doch Doug Sosnik, einer der renommiertesten Politikstrategen des Landes, glaubt: Trump wird wiedergewählt werden

Im Video oben seht ihr, warum zudem ein vorzeitiges Ende von Trumps Amtszeit unwahrscheinlich

Was soll man noch schreiben, über einen Mann, der auf jedem Meter derart aneckt, dass die ganze Welt erzittert? Über Donald Trump, der sich mit seinem Rassismus, seiner Kriegstreiberei und seiner Unfähigkeit zu Regieren zum unbeliebtesten US-Präsidenten der Neuzeit gemacht hat?

Doug Sosnik hat diese Frage in einem Artikel für die ""Washington Post"" für sich beantwortet: Er schreibt, dass Donald Trump seine Wiederwahl im Jahr 2020 gelingen wird. Obwohl 56 Prozent der US-Bürger ihn für ungeeignet halten, sein Amt auszuführen. Und obwohl Trumps Beliebtheitswerte am Freitag wieder einmal auf ein Rekordtief fielen.

Sosnik war jahrelang Top-Berater des ehemaligen US-Präsidenten Bill Clinton. Er ist als Politstratege für die Demokratische Partei in den USA tätig.

Laut ihm gibt es gleich vier Gründe, warum Trump sich Hoffnungen auf eine zweite Amtszeit im Weißen Haus machen kann:

Grund 1: Trump braucht keine Mehrheit für den Wahlsieg

Die Mehrheit der US-Amerikaner hat Donald Trump nicht gewählt. Seine Konkurrentin Hillary Clinton hat bei der Wahl drei Millionen Stimmen mehr bekommen als der jetzige US-Präsident.

Trump gewann, weil es bei Wahlen in den USA darum geht, mehr Wahlmänner und -frauen für sich zu gewinnen als der Gegner.

Und das tat Trump. Mit Wahlsiegen in wichtigen Staaten wie Florida, die besonders viele Wahlmandate stellen. Doug Sosnik argumentiert nun: Bei der Wahl im Jahr 2020 könnte Trump auf die gleiche Weise gewinnen. ""Trump weiß, dass die absolute Mehrheit zu gewinnen keine Voraussetzung ist, sondern höchstens ein Anspruch"", schreibt Sosnik.

Tatsächlich seien aber zwei der letzten drei Präsidenten ohne absolute Mehrheit gewählt worden: George W. Bush - und eben Trump.

Grund 2: Die Politikverdrossenheit in den USA hilft Trump

Das Vertrauen in die Politik ist in den USA schwer beschädigt. Nicht nur die Demokraten haben damit zu kämpfen, sondern auch die Republikaner. Donald Trumps Wahlsieg war Ausdruck dieses Frusts, dieser Wut auf das politische Establishment in Washington.

Sosnik schreibt, dass diese Stimmung im Land die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöhe, dass 2020 ein dritter, unabhängiger Kandidat sich um den Posten im Weißen Haus bemühen werde. Außerdem könnten noch weitere Kandidaten vom politischen Rand das Duell von Republikanern und Demokraten stören.

""So ein breites Kandidatenfeld könnte dafür sorgen, dass die Anti-Trump-Front aufgespalten wird"", schreib Sosnik. ""Das würde ihm die Wiederwahl sichern, wenn seine Anhänger gleichzeitig weiter zu ihm halten.""

Grund 3: Trumps Beliebtheit wird unterschätzt

Und danach sieht es aus.

Zwar sehen nur 32 Prozent der US-Bürger Donald laut einer Umfrage der Nachrichtenagentur AP Donald Trumps Präsidentschaft derzeit positiv - doch Sosnik glaubt, dass Erhebungen wie diese Trumps Beliebtheit unterschätzen. So würden die Umfragen alle Wahlberechtigten berücksichtigen. Und nicht nur diejenigen, die tatsächlich als Wähler registriert und gewillt sind, zur Wahl zu gehen.

Hinzu kommt laut Sosnik: ""Viele Wähler wollen einfach nicht offen zugeben, dass sie Trump gewählt haben und unterstützen.""

Grund 4: Der fanatische Kern von Trumps Anhängerschaft

Dem harten Kern von Donald Trumps Anhängerschaft geht das anders. Sie halten eisern und lautstark zu ihrem Präsidenten. Egal, was dieser macht. Sosnik erinnert in diesem Zusammenhang daran, dass Trump einmal im Wahlkampf sagte, er könne mitten auf der Fifth Avenue in Manhattan jemanden erschießen, und seine Fans würden weiter zu ihm halten.

Und noch einer weiteren Gruppe an Anhängern könne der US-Präsident sich gewiss sein: ""Denen, die ihm weiter die Treue halten, weil sie fest davon überzeugt sind, dass er das System in die Luft jagen und echte Veränderungen bewirken wird.""

Sosniks Fazit: In einem gespaltenem Land wird Trump gewinnen

Ob Trump dies gelingen wird, bleibt höchst fraglich. Auf jeden Fall hat der US-Präsident mit einer Rekordfülle an politischen Traditionen in den Vereinigten Staaten gebrochen. Warum sollte er also nicht wiedergewählt werden, obwohl er so unbeliebt ist, wie noch nie ein Präsident zuvor?

Für Sosnik ist klar, dass Trump dies in einem politisch gespaltenem Land gelingen kann. ""Wenn die Demokraten Trump schlagen wollen, müssen sie sich hinter einem Kandidaten vereinen"", schreibt der Wahlkampf-Stratege.

Soll heißen: Einen innerparteilichen Grabenkampf, wie er 2016 zwischen Hillary Clinton und dem Senator Bernie Sanders stattfand, können sich die Demokraten bei der nächsten Wahl nicht erlauben.

Die Demokraten dürfen Trump auf keinen Fall unterschätzen, warnt Sosnik. Er schreibt: ""Es wäre ein Fehler zu glauben, Trump könnte 2020 nicht gewinnen. Genau so, wie es ein Fehler war zu glauben, er würde erst gar nicht Präsident werden.""

""Ignoble et outrancier texte de Mélenchon qui en claquant la porte de la mission Nouvelle-Calédonie, affiche son mépris pour les Calédoniens"", a écrit Manuel Valls, dans une série de tweets.

1) Ignoble et outrancier texte de Mélenchon qui en claquant la porte de la mission Nouvelle-Calédonie, affiche son mépris pr les Calédoniens — Manuel Valls (@manuelvalls) 6 octobre 2017

Dans sa lettre au président de l'Assemblée, Jean-Luc Mélenchon rappelait notamment les propos sur les ""white"" et ""blancos"", saisis par une caméra en 2009, et dénonçait la ""proximité"" de l'ex-maire d'Evry ""avec les dirigeants de l'extrême droite israélienne"".

""Que vient faire Israël dans ce débat ? Quel lien avec l'islamisme radical ? Là encore, des raccourcis et allusions évidentes et délétères"", rétorque Manuel Valls, qui insiste: ""tous les républicains ont un devoir de vigilance face à ses thèses et prises de position. Personne ne peut laisser passer cela"".

Ici, qui vient-il trahir ? — Jean-Luc Mélenchon (@JLMelenchon) 3 octobre 2017 Dans un communiqué adressé à l'AFP, le président de l'Assemblée François de Rugy a dénoncé la ""nature des propos"" de Jean-Luc Mélenchon et assuré que ""la création et la constitution de la mission"" s'étaient déroulées ""dans des conditions parfaitement conformes au règlement"" de l'Assemblée, n'excluant ""aucune force politique"".

LIVRE - C'est un livre pour ceux qui veulent voyager, se mettre au vert et écouter les histoires (millénaires) que les arbres nous racontent. Il vient d'être publié par David G. Haskell aux éditions Flammarion ce 4 octobre.

Le nom de ce biologiste et écrivain vous dit peut-être quelque chose. Il est l'auteur de ""Un an dans la vie d'une forêt"", finaliste du prix Pulitzer. Pendant un an, jour après jour, saison après saison, il a observé un mètre carré de verdure, au beau milieu d'une forêt des Appalaches.

Cette fois-ci, avec ""Écoute l'arbre et la feuille"", Haskell s'intéresse à plus de 10 arbres mythiques autour du monde. Là aussi, il scrute les moindres détails sur les troncs, les feuilles et les branches. Mais surtout, il écoute.

Des sons si bien restitués à l'écrit qu'Haskell nous emmène avec lui dans la canopée, comme dans la 86e rue de Broadway.

It’s playing for 12 hours, on a continuous loop.

In other words, in the shadow of a memorial shaped like a giant phallus, people get to hear the president of the United States talk about grabbing women “by the pussy.”

Amanda Terkel/HuffPost UltraViolet set up a large video screen playing the Donald Trump ""Access Hollywood"" video Friday.

The women’s rights group UltraViolet set up the display Friday, approximately one year after the 2005 tape became public. Trump and Billy Bush, then of “Access Hollywood,” were caught on a hot mic bragging about their sexual conquests.

“And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump said. “You can do anything. ... Grab them by the pussy.”

“That’s why I don’t like Donald Trump,” one teenage girl said as she walked by the screen, right after the part where Trump said, “I moved on her like a bitch.”

The video display attracted plenty of attention, with many people stopping for a moment to take a picture. Most were surprised UltraViolet was given permission to put up the video on public land, and one Canadian visitor said it was “refreshing that it was allowed.”

Everyone who spoke with HuffPost said they remembered Trump’s comments. One man, originally from Australia, said he felt Trump and the tape represented the “demise” of the U.S. political system and its position in the world.

The display was, in many ways, a fitting coda to the week, where there were plenty of other stories about toxic masculinity.

For starters, Las Vegas is still recovering from one of the largest mass shootings in history, carried out by Stephen Paddock. Employees at a Starbucks he frequented remember him verbally abusing his girlfriend on various occasions. As HuffPost’s Melissa Jeltsen has noted, “Over the past few years, a number of mass killers and violent terrorists have had one striking thing in common: They practiced their abuse on family members before targeting the public.”

Then New York Times had a blockbuster story filled with allegations Hollywood producer and Democratic mega-donor Harvey Weinstein has been sexually harassing women for years.

On Thursday, BuzzFeed published documents showing how Breitbart News has smuggled white nationalist ideas into the mainstream. Buried in the story was a disturbing section about how male journalists at reputable publications gave suggestions about ways the conservative site could attack women online. Mitchell Sunderland, a senior staff writer for Vice’s women’s section, encouraged Breitbart News to go after writer Lindy West, saying it should “mock this fat feminist.”

The Atlantic came out with an in-depth look at the heartbreaking death of Tim Piazza, a young man who died during hazing at a Penn State fraternity. He and the other pledges were forced to drink massive amounts of alcohol and then run an obstacle course. He later opened a door that happened to lead to the basement, and fell down the stairs. No one in the fraternity called 911 until 12 hours later.

And Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) resigned after it was revealed that he had pressured a woman to have an abortion while publicly touting his anti-abortion stance. Murphy was having an extramarital affair with the woman. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also reported that Murphy mistreated his staff.

Trump supporters quickly jumped on the Weinstein news to use as a cudgel against Democrats.

Those attacks rang rather hollow, considering the president they are supporting is a man who has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.

And on Friday, the administration of this man rolled back requirements for employers to provide birth control coverage in health care plans for their workers.

However, Chizzy has now had her say on the matter, claiming she doesn’t believe it to be the case.

Speaking to Metro, she explained: “There are real racial injustices going on in the world and I think is dangerous to throw the race card in for something that has no bearing.

Chizzy had a particularly emotional reaction when she first discovered that she’d be leaving the competition, leaving us all crying along at home with her, later thanking professional partner Pasha Kovalev for helping her throughout her time on the show.

She said: “This dude, I have loved every minute dancing with him and it will continue because I will just be going round his house to dance now. But I don’t have his address so if anyone could email me I would appreciate it.”

The remaining celebrity contestants will hit the dance floor with their professional partners for the third time tonight (7 October) for Strictly’s annual Movies Week.

Sechs Millionen Besucher haben das diesjährige, längste Oktoberfest der Geschichte besucht, getrunken haben sie sieben Millionen Maß Bier. 127 Ochsen und 59 Kälber verspeisten die Besucher aus dem In- und Ausland, auch unzählige Hendl und Brezel fanden reißenden Absatz. Auch über den Wies´n Hit gibt es in diesem Jahr nichts zu meckern.

Ein friedliches Oktoberfest

Entspannt und gelassen - so beschreibt die Polizei die Wies´n 2017. Bei den Körperverletzungen gab es einen deutlichen Rückgang, nur in 49 Fällen mussten die Beamten der Wiesenwache zu einer Schlägerei mit Maßkrügen ausrücken. Vielleicht lag es an der besseren Videoüberwachung und an den verstärkten Kontrollen, dass es so friedlich geblieben ist. Allerdings mussten 251 betrunkene Besucher ihren Führerschein abgeben und bei 353 Autofahrern lag die Promillegrenze über dem erlaubten Wert.

Besucher aus aller Welt

Waren es in den vergangenen Jahren überwiegend Besucher aus Australien und Italien, die zum Oktoberfest nach München gekommen sind, so waren es in diesem Jahr mehr Amerikaner. Die Atmosphäre auf der Wies´n fanden aber nicht nur die Gäste aus Großbritannien, Österreich, Frankreich und der Schweiz gut, auch die Besucher aus Saudi-Arabien, Uruguay und Simbabwe waren begeistert.

Was waren die Wies´n Highlights 2017?

„Hulapalu"" - so heißt der Wies´n Hit in diesem Jahr. Immer, wo der Hit von Andreas Gabalier zu hören war, standen die Gäste in den Bierzelten auf den Bänken und Tischen. Gerne gehört wurde auch „Despacito"" von Luis Fonsi, leider gab es beim Mitsingen Schwierigkeiten, da Fonsi den Hit in Spanisch singt. Immer wieder gefragt war „Atemlos"" von Helene Fischer, ein echter Dauerbrenner, der schon seit einigen Jahren zu den Klassikern gehört. Die stimmungsvolle und auch ausgelassene Atmosphäre in den Zelten gehört definitiv zu den Highlights 2017.

Kurioses aus dem Fundbüro

Das Fundbüro auf der Wies´n ist immer wieder die Sammelstelle für Kuriositäten aller Art, das diesjährige Oktoberfest machte da keine Ausnahme. Neben Schlüsseln, Handtaschen, Dirndlschürzen, Hüten und Geldbörsen wurden auch mehrere Gebisse und sogar Krücken abgegeben, die offenbar niemand mehr vermisst.

“WHERE’S THE FUCKING HEAD?”HBO Susie Essman didn't truly make her presence felt on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" until a Season 2 episode entitled “The Doll.""","Susie Essman was a few minutes late, thanks to the %*#@$ leader of the free world.

“Asshole’s in town,” she muttered as she sat down. President Donald Trump had returned to New York City to address the United Nations, causing a presidential buildup of traffic between Essman’s prior engagement and ours on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just down the block from her apartment.

Essman’s mouth is famous, perhaps even more so than she is. It is certainly one of the most iconically foul weapons on television. Eighteen years since Essman first agreed to join Larry David’s HBO show “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” it is hard to read certain phrases without hearing her distinctive New York cadence. Four-eyed fuck! Fat piece of shit! Sick fucko asshole! Freak of fucking nature! Car-wash cunt!

HBO “What is hilarious to me is that I have now become beloved and iconic for telling people to go fuck themselves,” Susie Essman said.

Essman and those around her say she shares little in common with the character she plays on television. “She’s not like Susie Greene in real life,” said Joy Behar, her best friend of more than three decades. Greene is the justifiably embittered housewife of Hollywood manager Jeff Greene, played by “Curb” executive producer Jeff Garlin ― the kind of woman who tells her perpetually cheating husband that if he so much as utters the word “divorce,” she will take him for everything he’s worth and then thumbtack his testicles to the wall. Essman, 62, is kind, quiet and thoughtful ― a seasoned stand-up comedian, shaped by the New York City clubs of the 1980s and happily married to a man who works far outside the industry.

But as “Curb Your Enthusiasm” returned last Sunday for its first season in six years, and its ninth in total, there’s no question that the character and her creator have one thing in common: Neither is going to let any stupid fuck tell her how to live her life anymore.

Even as a young girl watching “I Love Lucy,” Essman always gravitated to the Ethel Mertzes of the world, not the Lucy Ricardos.

“Lucy always pissed me off because it was always like, ‘Wah, wah, wah ― Ricky’s going to be mad at me that I bought a hat,’ you know?” she said as she ate her bacon and scrambled eggs (well-done) last month. “Grow some balls.”

“I didn’t feel that way about Ethel,” she added. “Ethel wasn’t beholden to Fred in the same way.”

Essman had wanted to be an actress ever since she was a child growing up just north of New York City in Westchester County. But in elementary school, Essman realized she wouldn’t be able to live life as a Lucy even if she wanted to. In first grade, the part of Mrs. Claus in a school play went to her best friend. At her sleepaway camp’s production of “The Wizard Of Oz,” Essman didn’t get the role of Dorothy either. The part went to a supposedly talentless blonde instead, leaving a young Essman with the role of the Wicked Witch of the West. Enraged, she performed the part with an incomparable passion, repeatedly screaming “I’m melting” during her character’s death scene. The performance earned her a standing ovation. Watching as the crowd cheered, she realized something.

“I was never going to be the ingenue,” she says now. “Because I was too New York, too Jewish, too whatever. I was always going to be the best friend.” But she didn’t care. That night, Essman decided she liked being the Wicked Witch of the West plenty.

Those closest to her were often less than supportive of Essman’s acting ambitions growing up. Her mother, who taught Russian at Sarah Lawrence College, and her father, an internist, wanted Essman to apply to law school. Her college boyfriend told her that her dream was ridiculous.

“I had very little encouragement from anybody,” she said.

After graduating SUNY Purchase with a degree in urban studies, Essman spent most of her 20s waitressing in the city, too scared to dive headfirst into acting but not quite able to give up the idea. She took a few classes here and there, but found herself simultaneously bored by them and ridden with performance anxiety. When there were assignments, she’d skip class altogether. “I was so scared to get up and do anything,” she said. She met a man, and the two of them entered into an unhealthy relationship. At one point, she even applied to law school like her parents wanted ― and got in ― but she couldn’t bring herself to go. Confused as to where her life was headed, she entered a depression. “I was just so lost,” she said.

In July 1983, a broken Essman entered intensive psychoanalysis at the advice of her therapist. That same month, she got onstage at an open mic at the Mostly Magic comedy club on Carmine Street. She pulled together a couple characters that would get a laugh in her acting classes ― among them a Jewish mother and a “jappy” girl from Long Island ― and did five minutes. It was a decision that would change her life, even if it didn’t seem like it at the time.

About two months later, she received a call from a man she had met that night named Burt Leavitt. He had opened a club called Comedy U. with a friend in the city, and he wanted Essman to perform, but she was still struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. “I was in a very bad place,” she said. “I was in the worst place I ever could have been in.” Nevertheless, she agreed ― it might have even helped her to overcome her usual anxiety. “[I]f I hadn’t been in such dire straits — suicidal and depressed and feeling like I had no options in life at all — I don’t know if I ever would have gotten up on stage,” she later wrote in her memoir, What Would Susie Say? Bullsh*t Wisdom About Love, Life and Comedy.

The first time went fine. The second time went great. But the night after, she spiraled and decided to take “every pill in my medicine cabinet from aspirin to Valium to Tums,” she later recalled. Quickly, she realized she didn’t want to die. She called her friend and then her father, who told her to make herself vomit.

“I did, and the rest is a blur,” she wrote.

Essman came out of the experience changed. “There was something about actually having acted on my suicidal thoughts that banished them,” she wrote. A few days later, Leavitt called her again and offered her a paying gig on the weekends at the Comedy U. She took it and started working there regularly. After a while, she tried speaking in her own voice, rather than hiding behind characters. She began performing at other clubs.

“After about three months, I remember feeling like this is what I was meant to do with my life,” she said, smiling. “And I became a comic.”

YouTube By 1988, Susie Essman was performing as part of HBO stand-up comedy specials.

Over the next half-decade, Essman worked relentlessly to perfect her newly discovered talent. “Seven nights a week, many clubs a night,” she said. In 1987, she performed over 400 shows. By 1988, she had appeared on an HBO special. By 1989, she had appeared on Johnny Carson. “She was very much well-respected,” said Behar.

She stopped caring so much about what other people thought, too. To stand out, she had to. There had been “nearly a hundredfold increase” in full-time comedy clubs since the early 1970s, Rolling Stone wrote in 1988. But there was something a bit different about Essman. With her thick New York accent, she was so distinctly a product of the tri-state, which she played up in her act, joking about her hunky Italian ex-boyfriend from the Bronx and how the gentile bridal showers of Connecticut compared with her own Jewish family’s more brash get-togethers. She also adopted something of her father’s dirty mouth ― “‘Fuck’ every other word,” as she described it.

But most notable was the way Essman talked about sex. “She was ahead of her time,” said Ilana Glazer, co-creator of Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” a blissed-out riff on life at loose ends for two sexually liberated twentysomething women in New York City.

When joking about men, Essman could be simultaneously honest and brutal. Often single and unashamed of it, a Fredless Ethel, she talked about the men who turned her on and the men who turned her off ― sex every which way. When Oscar-winning actress Sally Field needed a stand-up coach for a 1988 film she starred in called “Punchline,” she looked through hundreds of tapes before eventually deciding on Essman, saying, “[Essman] commands the audience to be with her and a lot of it comes from her sexuality.”

Over time, Essman began to create what Glazer described as “a space where women can be loud [and] opinionated ... not the standard-narrative white woman.”

“She was single and fucking people and living that real New York life before ‘Sex In The City,’” Glazer added. “‘Broad City’ is trying to capture some essence of what Susie really lived.”

It wasn’t always easy being a woman in the New York City comedy scene. “They would never put two women on a show together,” Essman said. “They kind of assumed that if you have two women on a show, they’re both going to be talking about their periods.” But she was unwilling to blame any lack of success on her gender. “I hate victimhood ― hate it,” she said. “I was always just like: ‘I’m going to be so good that they can’t deny me. I’m going to be such a great comedian that they cannot use this against me.’ And that was my goal.”

Standing there with a microphone in her face and the comedy world in front of her, Essman was ready to show them all. Comedy Central had initially resisted the New York Friars Club’s suggestion that Essman participate in the televised 1999 roast of comedian Jerry Stiller. “I’m not sure why,” she later wrote. “Too old, too female, too Jewish, too who knows?”

Essman had joined the exclusive club, famous for its extravagantly vulgar celebrity roasts, a few years before, in 1995. The club was the stuff of legend ― Frank Sinatra signed Essman’s admission certificate ― but it hadn’t allowed women in until 1988, and it hadn’t let women onto the dais during a roast until 1990. Even after those walls were broken down, biases against female comedians remained. “They didn’t think women were funny. Especially if you were relatively attractive. That confused the shit out of them,” Essman said.

But she earned the Friars Club’s respect, enough that it pushed for her to perform against Comedy Central’s wishes. Eventually, the network relented.

She wanted to prove women could keep up ― for more reasons than one. By the mid-’90s, Essman had started to get a bit fed up. She had been in the comedy scene for over a decade. Many of her friends had headed West for jobs in Los Angeles, but she had been unwilling. “I never thought about moving,” she said. “[Los Angeles] just doesn’t feel like home to me.” The decision cost her. She was in her 40s and still struggling to make a decent living. Sure, she had bit parts here and there, but nothing was sticking.

“I was very frustrated because ― I mean, especially in those days, I was good,” she said. “It was like, ‘OK, how much better do I have to be before I start making some money?’”

Up onstage during the roast, the frustration was transmuted into one of the dirtiest, filthiest, most heinous sets of the night. To start: “I’m very hoarse tonight. I have a sore throat. Jerry knows why. I know why. Enough said,” she said. She turned to Maury Povich: “You know, Maury, I always wondered why you married Connie Chung. And then I realized: We all know Jews love to eat Chinese. Once a week, right?” And on and on.

She was the kind of woman whom she had admired as a child ― wicked, beholden to no one ― and she killed. One man took notice. Just before he sat down to watch the Stiller roast, “Seinfeld” co-creator Larry David had wrapped a one-hour mockumentary for HBO called “Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.” He was planning to transform the special into a full-on television show, and he needed someone to play his best friend’s wife. For the part, he needed a woman who could be ferocious and crass, with a mouth that had to be heard to be believed. Watching the roast, he realized what he needed was Susie Essman.

The two had known each other back in the 1980s, when they were both in the stand-up scene. When David called up his old acquaintance and told her about the part, she asked for a script. No script, he said, just rough outlines of scenes. He added that the show would be more or less improvised. Oh, and Essman would only receive union day scale, too. With no contract and no real commitment, she decided to accept the role and see where it went anyway.

Essman and David never really discussed the character of Susie Greene. But Essman knew exactly whom she wanted her to be. In high school, she had marveled at girls who, unlike her, were totally secure in themselves. That was what she wanted to create in Greene ― an East Coast housewife who never second-guessed her choices, fashion or otherwise.

Essman appeared in a few episodes of Season 1. But Susie Greene didn’t become a fully formed man-killing machine, Essman said, until seven episodes into Season 2. Larry and Jeff have stolen the head of one of her daughter’s dolls, and here is Susie Greene, confronting them on the driveway, snarling, Spaghetti Western music playing in the background. “Where’s the head?” she asks, arms folded across her chest. Jeff and Larry are silent, terrified. Susie asks again: “I know you took the doll’s head. Where is it?”

Then once more, with power.

“WHERE’S THE FUCKING HEAD?”

HBO Susie Essman didn't truly make her presence felt on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" until a Season 2 episode entitled “The Doll.""

It was a little slice of the Jersey Turnpike, set down in Pacific Palisades. The scene, in an episode entitled “The Doll,” would serve as Essman’s breakout moment, which is probably why she still considers the episode her favorite. “It’s the first time you see how deeply feared I am with Jeff and Larry,” said Essman.

Over the seasons, she would skewer her “fat piece of shit” husband plenty. But her real wrath was saved for Larry. Whether it was because he didn’t want an house tour, got her daughter drunk, ruined a school tour, doubted her respect for wood or didn’t love her shimmering Packers sweater, Essman let that four-eyed fuck have it. The show, in general, revolved around everyone ridiculing Larry into moral oblivion, and no one ridiculed better than Essman.

By Season 3, “Curb” fans were regularly stopping Essman in the streets of Manhattan and begging her to rip into them. Women in particular have come to love Susie Greene, Essman has said, going so far as to tell her that Greene is “their hero.”

“The thing that people really love about Susie … is her comfort with her anger, especially women,” she said. “Her complete comfort with being angry unapologetically, I think, is liberating for women to see.”

She enjoys the physical process of playing her, too. “After we do a screaming-shouting scene, I go back to my hotel [and] I feel so relaxed, I fall asleep. I feel like I got a massage, you know?” she said.

Marc Janks/HuffPost

In the almost two decades that she’s been playing Susie Greene, Essman has come to be defined by the role, and in some ways limited, too. “I’m definitely pigeonholed and typecast,” she said. While many of TV’s most famous male comedians are well known for their stand-up routines, few people know of Essman as a stand-up comedian who woodshedded for two decades before “Curb.”

“People really have trouble giving credit to women. I mean, they just fucking do,” Glazer said. “And I get it ― it’s uncomfortable. It’s not what we’re used to seeing. But Larry David didn’t create Susie Greene. He knew Susie Essman, who perfected herself.”

Years ago, when Glazer and “Broad City” co-creator Abbi Jacobson were working on the web series that would become their hit Comedy Central show, they dreamed of having Essman play Glazer’s mother. “She [was] just so Jew-y and ethnic and New York and unapologetic,” said Glazer.

But Glazer wasn’t a “Curb” diehard. She was a fan of Essman, the stand-up comedian, who had helped inspire Glazer to speak proudly and frankly about sex and a woman’s place in the world. A few years after Season 8 of “Curb” wrapped up, the pair finally got their wish when Essman joined the show as Ilana’s handbag-addicted mother, a casting decision that looked instantly perfect as Glazer and Essman ran around New York City together.

In real life, Essman became something like family to the two comedians. “I have the deepest respect for them. I feel like they’re my little sisters [and] that they’re my legacy in a certain way,” Essman said. “They are the outgrowth of some of the stuff I was doing.”

Glazer agrees. “‘Broad City’ would not be covering the content that it is had Susie Essman not been doing the stand-up that she did starting in the ’80s,” Glazer said. “She really feels like our mother ― who created a world for us.”

Last spring, Essman got a call from Larry David. After five years, he was seriously thinking about Season 9. She’s hopeful it won’t be the last one. “It’s not as though these are the characters that we’re going to grow out of. It’s not ‘Baywatch,’” she said. Since the show first started, Essman’s life has both changed dramatically and not at all. She still does some stand-up comedy and still lives in and loves New York City. But the once-perpetually single Essman is married, a little older and a bit more removed from the scene. She hasn’t become a star. She still has to work to pay the bills. But she’s fine with all that, and she doesn’t care what you think about her life or her world anyway.

In a way, she’s become a bit more like her character ― secure in herself and her ability to tell everyone else to fuck off.

“What is hilarious to me is that I have now become beloved and iconic for telling people to go fuck themselves,” she said. “For the rest of my life, that will be my legacy.”

How does she feel about that?

Requiring insurance plans to cover birth control imposes a ""substantial burden"" to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and could promote ""risky sexual behavior"" among adolescents, the administration told reporters Thursday night.

The Affordable Care Act deemed contraception an essential part of women's preventive health care for the first time in history, requiring that it be covered under most insurance plans, along with prenatal care, breast exams and well-woman visits. The birth control mandate compelled for-profit employers to cover the full range of contraceptives, including the pill, the intrauterine device and the Plan B morning-after pill, at no out-of-pocket cost to women, while carving out exemptions for churches and nonprofit religious organizations.

The Trump administration, which is stacked with officials who oppose contraception, will now allow any employer or for-profit company, regardless of whether they are religious, to refuse to include the coverage in their health insurance plans for moral reasons. This could mean that tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of women in the United States will once again have to pay out of pocket for birth control.

La Nouvelle-Orléans, dévastée par l'ouragan Katrina en 2005 qui a causé au moins 1800 morts, se mobilisait tout particulièrement.

Située en-dessous du niveau de la mer, elle est très exposée aux inondations et subissait déjà les premiers assauts de la tempête samedi après-midi avec de forts vents et une pluie drue.

""La pire menace n'est pas nécessairement la pluie mais des vents forts et des vagues"", a précisé le maire de la ville, Mitch Landrieu.

Des habitants se hâtaient de remplir des sacs de sable tandis que d'autres obéissaient aux ordres d'évacuation, les véhicules chargés au maximum.

""J'ai vécu Katrina et je sais à quoi ça ressemble"", a confié Jackie Daigre, 69 ans, habitante de La Nouvelle-Orléans depuis 41 ans où elle a subi déjà trois ouragans.

Elle faisait quelques provisions avant que le supermarché, bondé et quasiment dévalisé de ses bouteilles d'eau, ne ferme à 15 heures.

Juanita Stovall, 57 ans, a acheté quelques conserves mais assure avoir déjà l'essentiel: ""J'ai des torches. J'ai une radio fonctionnant avec des piles. J'ai des bougies. Et nous avons des jeux"", dit celle qui n'en est pas à son premier ouragan non plus et qui prévoit de quitter la ville avec ses trois fils.

Le sud-est des États-Unis a déjà été durement frappé en août par deux ouragans: Harvey au Texas et en Louisiane, qui a fait 42 morts et causé des dégâts matériels considérables, et Irma, qui a fait 12 morts en Floride. Et l'ouragan Maria a lui laminé le territoire américain de Porto Rico, et fait au moins 34 morts.

Par précaution, des plateformes pétrolières et gazières, très nombreuses dans le Golfe du Mexique, ont été évacuées avant l'arrivée de Nate.

Dévastation en Amérique centrale

Ponts détruits, routes inondées, arbres au sol et glissements de terrain: Nate a causé d'importants dégâts lors de son passage en Amérique centrale.

Le Costa Rica, le Nicaragua et le Honduras -- pays les plus durement touchés -- commençaient à évaluer les destructions mais des villages entiers restaient coupés du monde.

Selon les derniers bilans officiels des services de secours, la tempête a fait seize morts au Nicaragua, dix au Costa Rica, trois au Honduras et deux au Salvador.

Au Costa Rica, où plus de 5000 personnes se sont réfugiées dans des abris temporaires, les secouristes recherchaient plus de 30 personnes.

Le président du pays Luis Guillermo Solis a décrété trois jours de deuil national en hommage aux victimes et a prévenu que le risque d'inondations et de glissements de terrain allait persister ces prochains jours.

Le Nicaragua semble être le pays le plus touché avec, d'après la vice-présidente et porte-parole du gouvernement, Rosario Murillo, plus de 10 000 personnes affectées par des inondations et coulées de boue tandis que des milliers de familles étaient privées d'électricité.

La région Caraïbes est encore traumatisée par des puissants ouragans -- Harvey, Irma, José et Maria -- qui ont frappé depuis mi-août, laissant des paysages de désolation et de nombreuses victimes derrière eux.

And they'll do it for one reason: to express their opposition to Adani's proposed Carmichael mine.

The national day of action has been organised by the Stop Adani Movement, in conjunction with grassroots climate action movement 350.org. Stop Adani organised some polling around the mine, the ethics of which were called into serious question by Four Corners earlier this week, as they have been many times before.

And it seems that Australians -- who generally have bullshit detectors second to none -- are onto the fact that this mine does not make economic or environmental sense.

The results of the ReachTEL poll are super revealing. Look below and you'll see that virtually all Australians, no matter what their political stripes, oppose the Carmichael mine, construction of which could start within weeks.

Even among One Nation voters, more people are opposed or strongly opposed than support the mine. Opposition is also high among National Party voters, who mostly live in rural electorates and would tend to favour agriculture over mining.

There is also extremely strong and widespread opposition to the $1 billion Federal government loan which has been offered to Adani to build the rail line to the Abbot Point coal terminal, about two hours from the mine.

Two thirds of Australians want the Queensland government to use its power to veto the loan.

Prominent businessman and Australian Conservation Foundation President, Mr Geoff Cousins AO, will speak at the Bondi protest event.

""Adani's new dirty coal mine will damage everything it touches,"" he said ahead of the day of protest.

""It will pollute where they dig up. It will pollute when they burn the coal. And it'll make the world a more dangerous place by fuelling global warming.

""It is astounding that our elected representatives are bending over backwards to give Adani preferential treatment to help it build a massive dirty coal mine that will threaten our Great Barrier Reef. And it is crazy the Turnbull Government is now considering a billion dollar handout to help Adani build it. The Turnbull Government must stop the loan and not let this mine go ahead.""

The owner of a large-scale dog breeding operation near the city of Greenville agreed Tuesday to relinquish 117 animals — 93 adult dogs, 22 puppies and two cats — to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Texas, a local animal welfare agency that operates shelters and spay-and-neuter clinics.

Local law enforcement, working in cooperation with the SPCA of Texas, had seized the animals the previous week. Most of the dogs and puppies were living inside a metal structure next to the home, according to a news release from the nonprofit.

Photos show dogs crammed inside small, dirty cages and crates in a room where a fan was thick with dust and debris. Investigators said they could smell dog feces and urine from the road near the building, and inside the scent was so strong it made them gag.

Some of the dogs came to the organization soaked in urine, while others had medical conditions like eye ulcers or ear infections due to heavily matted fur, said Victoria Albrecht, a spokeswoman for the SPCA of Texas.

Most of the dogs are now doing well.

“For the most part these dogs seem very friendly and enjoy receiving attention and affection,” Albrecht told HuffPost in an email.

A Facebook video posted this week showed workers removing matted fur from a male poodle mix, who appeared in good spirits.

“Even after everything he’s been through this little guy wouldn’t stop giving our team kisses and all he really wanted was to be held, which we were happy to do for him!” the group wrote on Facebook.

Dog breeds represented including Maltipoos, Pomeranians, Shih Tzus and Yorkies, according to Today.

The owner of the operation, whose name has not been released, is accused of violating state regulations surrounding large-scale breeders, which set standards on space, shelter, ventilation, food and medical care.

Albrecht said the organization’s animal cruelty investigator told her the puppies were being sold for approximately $700 to $1,200. It was unclear where the puppies were being sold, though it was not out of the home directly, she said.

Animal welfare organizations typically recommend that people adopt pets from animal shelters and rescue groups, instead of buying them from breeders. However, if someone is set on purchasing a pet from a breeder, there are steps that can help ensure you’re not supporting a puppy mill operation.","More Than 100 Dogs Rescued From Cramped, Filthy Cages In Puppy Mill Bust",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puppy-mill-bust-greenville-texas-spca_us_59d9131ae4b072637c4470a7?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009
